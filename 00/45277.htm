    <title>Help on moving xbox live subscription &#38;amp&#59; gamertag to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gadgetman2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help on moving xbox live subscription &#38;amp&#59; gamertag to another email address</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have scanned the forums and am not sure of the correct way to move my xbox live subscription and gamer tag.&nbsp; What I did several years ago when I purchased an Xbox 360 is to create a separate email address (a @live.com address) from my primary email address
 (a @msn.com address).&nbsp; The @live.com address is linked to my xbox live subscription.&nbsp; Fast forward a couple of years.&nbsp; Last year I purchased a windows phone and linked it to my primary account (@msn.com) address.&nbsp; The phone auto generated a gamer tag.&nbsp; What
 I would like to do is to move my gamer tag associated with the @live.com address to my @msn.com address.&nbsp; Is this possible?&nbsp; Or is it possible to for the xbox app to sign into my @live.com address with my phone?&nbsp; The smartglass application on my phone seems
 to want to try and find&nbsp;my xbox under the @msn.com address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Finntan</p>

            <p>No worries. &nbsp;You'll need to create a dummy email address to move the tag off of your msn.com address. &nbsp;Then just follow the instructions at the link below to move the other gamertag to the msn address.</p>

<p>Thank you for your assistance. &nbsp; There are several reasons and it would be nice to know which reason. &nbsp;</p>
<p>From the link:</p>
<p>Current Microsoft account:</p>
<p>•Funds remaining on the current Microsoft account will not move with your gamertag. You must spend the funds before you can transfer your gamertag. &nbsp;-
<span>Check - No funds</span></p>
<p>•The gamertag was not created or changed within the last 30 days. If you try to move a gamertag before 30 days have passed since you created or changed it, you’ll get the error “Sorry, we can't change your Microsoft account right now.” -
<span>Check - Gamertag was created at least 6 months ago</span>.</p>
<p>•The gamertag has not been moved within the last 30 days. If you try to move a gamertag before 30 days have passed since the last time you moved it, you’ll get the error “Sorry, we can't change your Microsoft account right now.” -
<span>Check.&nbsp; Never moved.</span></p>
<p>•The current Microsoft account can have an Xbox Live or Xbox Music subscription associated with it, but no other subscription (such as Office 365). Sign in at account.microsoft.com to see if this is the case. -
<span>Maybe.&nbsp; Does Skydrive count?&nbsp; I also have a canceled subscription to MSN dialup from 02/26/2004 (over 10 yrs ago!)</span></p>
<p>•The current Microsoft account has only one billing account associated with it. If you have ever made purchases in more than one country, have subscriptions such as Office 365, or have bought an app through the Windows Store, you may have more than one billing
 account. Go to account.microsoft.com to find out.&nbsp; <span>
What is a billing account?&nbsp; Is it a payment method?&nbsp;I have 2 - Microsoft account and credit card. &nbsp;Or is it purchases - I have 2 free purchases - Smart Glass and Minecraft.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Again, thanks for your help.&nbsp; Any further insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>SkyDrive is now OneDrive and that may be what is preventing it from being moved. &nbsp;What you should do is contact phone support to be sure if that is the reason or not. &nbsp;If you live in North America dial 1-800-469-9269</p>

    <title>Why does Windows Firewall allow inbound connections by default for all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tzon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows Firewall allow inbound connections by default for all modern apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>To continue my initial question that was posted <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/applications-still-access-the-internet-even-if-i/8372685c-5786-4282-bb5c-315c9cacdf7d">
here</a>, I would like to understand why the Windows Firewall allows by default incoming connections for any modern app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few observations:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Firewall with Advanced Security there are two sets of rules: inbound and outbound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outbound rules allow programs and apps to communicate to the internet. Inbound rules allow unsolicited connections (as I have understood so far, random not user or app provoked connections) to the computer from the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows Firewall's outbound scanning is disabled by default, outbound rules are useless due to this "allow everything" policy (unless there is an explicit outbound block rule).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regular apps (non servers), such as browsers, can work just fine by having outbound allow rules (or by the default "allow everything" Firewall setting). They can still receive incoming data if they are allowed to communicate to the internet (outbound) even
 if there is no allowing inbound rule or even if there is a blocking inbound rule!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, launching Google Chrome and typing an address, will make the browser send a request (outbound) to the website's server and receive info (to display the webpage) -- all this with no inbound rule enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that unsolicited inbound connections are required when, for example, sharing files or printers on a PC network. A remote PC on the same network can send a request to get access on some resources (media file, printer etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on all the above, I do not see the purpose of having inbound allowing rules for all apps installed on the PC. Apps can work just with the outbound allowing rules or policy. Very few apps actually need to receive unsolicited inbound connections to work
 properly (server apps). Why then allow all apps to do so? Isn't that kind of a risk, if say, a malicious inbound connection exploits a vulnerability?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,&nbsp;</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>I am not a very technical person but I think it may have something to do with the Port numbers you allow and deny. Say, you blocked chrome from having inbound connection, but you haven't completely blocked the Standard Port number 80, which is for HTTP,
 then chrome would still have access in searching the net. Again, I am not really technical person, its just an opinion.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I don't think it has to do with port 80 or anything similar. Apparently, there is some sort of functionality that needs the (unsolicited) inbound access as well. I am wondering what functionality is that,
 do I need it, and if it could increase the security risk. Why does my web browser need to listen for incoming connection? I understand why would Media Player do that, when sharing music on a home network, but not with the browser case.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hello Tracey, my name is Alexander. I'm an Independent Advisor and I'm happy to assist you! 
<br />
<br />If you turn on BitLocker Drive Encryption, you create a BitLocker password which you need to enter when you want to get access. The system also generated a BitLocker recovery key, which you can use to gain access to the volume if you forget your BitLocker password.
<br />
<br />The error with BitLocker can be caused by the BIOS and TPM that are not updated. You can check using another Windows 10 PC to see if you are getting the same error. If you see the same error, update TPM and BIOS version. To update BIOS you need to contact the PC manufacturer.
<br />
<br />I also recommend that you perform the steps provided by Johann Eva in the following thread: 
<br />

<p>Hey dragon! I have 5 solutions for you to try. Give them a shot and see if one of them will work for you.</p>
<p>Solution 1- Hard reset- hold down power button on front of console until it turns off then unplug from out for a minute then plug back in and power back on.</p>
<p>Solution 2- If your console is set to instant on or energy saver switch to the option it is not and restart you xbox and try the game again.</p>
<p>Solution 3- In-install/re-install the game </p>
<p>Solution 4- remove profile then re-download profile</p>
<p>Solution 5- Reset console- Go to settings, system, console and updates, reset console. Be sure to keep everything and your console will restart. After it boots up to the home screen you will go through a quick set-up and sign in. After your signed back in
 try the game again. </p>
<p>Hope one of these solutions help you out. Good Luck!</p>

            <p>As Smwutches said, Your only real option is to contact your isp the moment the attack occurs, They are able to block the incoming attack and get you back online, Also most isp's will then track and&nbsp;report the incident as most countries class a ddos attack as a cyber crime.</p><p><br /></p><p>Theres not really much microsoft can do as the attack is not happening over xbox live its being directed straight at your networking equipment via your ip address and unfortunately it is very simple to obtain the ip addresses of every player you meet online whether its on xbox live, PS or PC.</p>

            <p>Let xbox know ASAP from when I look into how people do this back in the day (When I played 360) one of the primary steps is to actually infect your personal Console with a code in order to see the IP of anyone in the party with you. With the info you can tell service provider, mail location, weather. enough to freak them out and DDOS but not usually enough to show up to their home and harm them.</p><p><br /></p><p>I haven't carefully read over xbox terms and service or code of conduct yet since I'm new but pretty sure infecting and jailbreaking your xbox violates something in one of those. so like everyone is saying get them reported ASAP so enforcement can take a look at what the player is doing. Maybe even mention when messaging them that you have it clipped and have it ready incase they want to look at it.</p>

            <p>You can contact your ISP to get the ip for your modem changed. usually IP's are assigned for a set amount of time by your ISP so just turning the modem off for a few hours typically wont register it with a new one. If you want to make it to where you dont have to rely on your ISP to change your IP (hold times are terrible sometimes) you can do the following:</p><p><br /></p><p>1. buy a router. most modems have routers built in but get your own. you will still use the one your ISP provided you with you just need your own wireless router.</p><p>2. update the router and go through the basic setup config and have it connected to your modem.</p><p>3. turn off your modem<br /></p><p>4. whenever you get hit by a ddos attack you can go into the routers config and set a mac address to whatever it says the mac of the router is just change the last letter/number to something else. so if your mac is 3E:43:87:H7:J2:87 change it to 3E:43:87:H7:J2:88 and save the config. once the change is made and the router

<h2>            New computer-forgot password</h2>
                    <p>Hello - I have purchased a new computer with Windows 10 and have gone through install and setup, creating a password. &nbsp;I had waited several days to use again and now I cannot remember my password. &nbsp;When I go to reset password, it tells me I need a removable
 disc or USB for the :F drive. &nbsp;How do I go about getting into my computer? &nbsp;If I have to reset, I am fine with this. &nbsp;I just need to know how. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

</p><p>VPG_provides management, tagging, and searching capabilities for digital photos. It provides an image viewer that can replace the default OS image viewer, and a photo import tool that can be used to acquire photos from a camera or other removable media.
 Windows Photo Gallery also allows sharing of photos by uploading them to OneDrive, Flickr and Facebook.</p>
<p>If thats all you need otherwise&nbsp;-&nbsp;WLPG</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your reply - to a point..</p>
<p>My impression was that WPG and WLPG were kind of the same thing that had been renamed back-and-forth by Microsoft some number of times.&nbsp; I gather from your reply that they are both viable products for W10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So what does WLPG offer (that I might want) that WPG doesn't?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>And I assume that I did not get WPG or WLPG or Essentials as part of my W10 upgrade from W8.1.&nbsp; I don't see any of the 3 products in my apps panels or in Control Panel | Programs... or the "Start" menu of all apps.</p>
<p>In fact, under Control Panel | Programs... there are no programs that are entitled "Windows" anything although there are some entitled "Microsoft" something.
</p>
<p>I do run Windows Defender which carried forward from my W8.1, and I do not know whether I got Defender as part of Essentials when I was under W8.1.</p>
<p>So do I need to download/install one of the PG apps from some MS web site?</p>
<p>Should I download/install Essentials from some MS web site?&nbsp; If yes, can I just use the pieces of Essentials that I want (WPG or WLPG) and remove/uninstall the rest?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I want to login to my hotmail.com and outlook.com emails, I'm first forced to login to a Microsoft Live account (MSN?).&nbsp; I also have to enter my Windows Live userid/password when I boot my PC.&nbsp; So does that mean I should use WLPG instead of WPG?&nbsp; I'm
 really confused by all this MS Live stuff.</p>

</p><p>So I went to the link you provided and it shows nothing about being for W10 - and it's been 4 years since Essentials 2012. &nbsp;What is the right free photos sw for W10 in 2016?</p>
<p>So what should people do for (primarily) desktop management (free sw) of photos and videos?</p>
<p>Essentials doesn't appear to be MS solution for W10 systems - what is?</p>
<p>I still do not know whether I should try to find and download/install WPG or WLPG.
</p>
<p>I still don't know what WPG lacks that WLPG offers (or where they live in the world of W10). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other words, I have not heard anything from MS or others that makes it clear what free sw should be used on my W10 64bit desktop PC.</p>

<p>The reply above from geekdom was totally unhelpful as to my question about which free MS photo/video software I should use on W10, and where I should download it from.&nbsp; The link geekdom provided pointed me to a posting where users were asking why their MS
 photos sw did not work right, how they could uninstall it, the shortcomings of the MS Photos App and other items that in no way answered my questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one has replied as to the difference between WPG and WLPG and which I might need - and where to get
 it from.&nbsp; For W10 in 2016, I don't know if there is a replacement for MS Essentials, or what that replacement might be called.&nbsp; So many millions of us use PC's with W10 and want photo management software that I can hardly believe that my questions have not
 been fully answered some months ago.&nbsp; I assumed that answers.microsoft would have good and quick answers, but I was wrong. &nbsp; &nbsp;

            Assuming that the connector on your computer looks like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
pretty much any standard monitor with a "VGA" input will work.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Your problem may be that it was the video card in your Presario rather than your old monitor that stopped working.&nbsp; Did you get the Dell monitor from a system that was working?&nbsp; If so, connect your old monitor to that system and see if it works.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that the cable is the problem.&nbsp; If you are connecting the Dell monitor to your Presario with the old cable, try using the cable that was on the system to which the Dell monitor was originally connected.<br />

    <title>Win 7 not asking for WEP Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> additude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 not asking for WEP Key</h2>
                    
<p>I am connecting a new Win 7 laptop to one of my wireless routers. I have a problem with Win 7 not asking for the WEP Security Key when attempting to connect to my Linksys VPN. I cannot connect. I could not find the connection listed in Network Managers,
 simply because it has never been able to establish a connection. I was able to disable security in the router and Win 7 connected fine. I then re-enabled WEP security. Again Win7 would not prompt for a WEP Key. I went into Manage Networks and found and deleted
 that unsecured wireless connection. Rebooted, tried again and still no prompt for WEP key. I searched the registry for my WEP key, it was not there. I searched the registry for my wireless&nbsp;SSID and deleted all instances of it. Rebooted, tried connecting and
 still it failed to connect and had no prompt for a WEP Key. I went back into Manage Networks and manually entered the connection information, WEP key, etc. and Win 7 connected fine. I established a connection by entering the information manually. I rebooted
 and reconnected again just fine. I then disconnected and went back into Manage Networks and removed that manually entered SSID. I rebooted and tried to connect. Again failed to connect and no prompt for WEP Key. I have no WPA connect problems with my other
 routers, but this network needs to run WEP because of some wireless eqpt on it only has WEP. Win 7 properly identifies the WEP network in the mouse over info box, but will not provide me a WEP Key enter prompt.</p>
<p>I think either Win 7 has stored info resource somewhere and is not updating it, Win 7 is broken because come on...this kind of issue is reported in XP and Vista or that during first setup, it asked for the info and I entered it, but because my router is
 setup for MAC screening it didn't let it connect then and Win 7 is somehow not seeing it needs a WEP Key.</p>
<p>I know I can get Win 7 to connect by manually entering the SSID info, but it is not supposed to work that way. If it works manually, why won't it work automatically connecting?</p>
<p>I guess I am looking for a root problem and not a work-around bandaid just get it to work fix.</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Thanks.&nbsp; --Wes</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Additude,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to remove all the security settings for the router and try setting up the security on the computer and check if
 you can connect properly</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To manually create a network profile using WEP shared key authentication use the below steps on the computer and then check -<br />
a. Open Network and Sharing Center by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type network, and then click Network and Sharing Center.<br />
b. Click set up a new connection or network.<br />
c. Click on to manually connect to a wireless network, and then click next.<br />
d. On the Enter information for the wireless network you want to add page, under Security type, select WEP.<br />
e. Complete the rest of the page, and then click next.<br />
f. Click Change connection settings.<br />
g. Click the Security tab, and then, under Security type, click Shared.<br />
</span><span>c. You may also want to tick ‘Start this connection automatically’ and ‘connect even if the network is not broadcasting’. Subsequent connections should be automatic.</span></span><span><br />
<span>h. Click OK, and then click Close.</span></span></p>

    <title>connecting a MIDI Keyboard M-Audio 49e to work with Encore 5 music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruprecht niepold  say:</h3>
<h2>            connecting a MIDI Keyboard M-Audio 49e to work with Encore 5 music editor</h2>
                    <p>I am struggling with having a M-Audio 49e MIDI keyboard (USB connected) recognized by a music editor programme Encore 5, even after studying various threads discussing similar issues which do not seem to be uncommon after W8.1 qwas introduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am basically porting an environment which worked perfectly under my XP environment but fails to work in my new&nbsp; W8.1 environment.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The XP environment was:</p>
<p>XP SP3, MIDI keyboard M-Audio 49e connected to USB 2.0, soundcard Audigy 4 pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new environment is:</p>
<p>W8.1, same MIDI keyboard M-Audio 49e connected to USB 2.0, sound card Relatek ASLC887 (high definition) --&gt; I had to replace the soundcard, because Audigy 4 pro is no longer supported under W8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem: When doing the MIDI set-up under Encore 5, I see the " MIDI Mapper" as output device (and it works as I can listen to Encore playing scores via the Realtek soundcard of my PC, but the MIDI keyboard 49e is not seen as MDI input / sync device
 by Encore, so I can't use my MIDI keyboard to write scores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the installation of the keyboard connected to USB 2.0 (I am aware of the problems with USB 3.0 connections so don't use them): The keyboard shows up under the
<span>
<span>
audio/video/gamecontroller" category&nbsp;</span> (generic class driver from Microsoft installs automatically) as
<span>
<span>
„Keystation 49e" </span>and <span>
under the category "software devices" as "Keystation49 [0] (Out)" and "Keystation49 [1] (In)".</span> I conclude that I do not have a keyboard driver issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard is manifestly working: I tested it with an alternative music editor (MuseScore) and in this programme can see and set the keyboard as input device,&nbsp; and hence e.g. enter indivudal notes played on the keyboards in scores and played by my sound
 card . Also, I tested the GVox VST Player and can select the keybaorad as input on teh various channels and see an LED blinking when set and actioning the keyboard. But I cannot get this recognised by Encore itself. (Unfortunately, for various reasons, I cannot
 change my music editroe programme).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck with this situation. My manual for Encore 5 does not give much clue on how to configure the MIDI set up and from the programme menu I can only choose between inputs detected when launching Ecore (they are called "record port" and "sync port")&nbsp;
 and it sees none.&nbsp; It seems that the MIDI interface between the keyboard and the Encore programme does not work or does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions how to get out of this ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks !</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ruprecht,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that it must be frustrating to not be able to use your keyboard with something as new as windows 8.1. But, as you have stated that you are able to use your keyboard as an input device with other software, it is certain that the issue is not
 with windows 8.1 but the software (Encore). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the old softwares were designed to run on older operating system (XP, Vista, Windows 7). There is a possibility of a compatibility issue, when this software is run on windows 8.1. I suspect the same to be the issue in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’d suggest you to check with the Manufacturer passport if they have any updates and patches for Encore 5 which makes it compatible with windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please wait for a response from Passport and
</span><span>feel free to reply, in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</span></p>

            <p>Yea anything in the EA vault will lock when your sub runs out. It's a wicked good deal though. If you can swing buying a year it's really worth it. </p>

<p>may I ask why you just do not buy a year sub at $30 and gain access to like 6 other games (plus more in the coming year, plus week early access to all EA games plus discounts) instead of buying a single game at $25.00?</p>

<h2>            Unpinning full-screen connection bar in RDP W8.1 &#62; W7 not remembered.</h2>
                    For a few weeks now if I unpin the connection bar when using Remote Desktop to a W7 from a W8.1 this is not remembered in the next session. So I have to unpin it each time. This used to be remembered. It could be caused by having to remove a few updates
 on the W7, causing very problematic behaviour. Anyway, if this cannot be changed, please change the default to unpinned (auto-hide).&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Are you using a desktop or a laptop?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>To boot into Safe Mode, restart the computer and tap the F8 key for about four to five times. You will see safe Mode listed in the Windows Advanced options. Select safe Mode and
 then press enter. To start the computer in normal mode, restart the computer and do no tap the F8 key.</span></p>
<p><span>You could also try disconnecting the mouse and connecting it back again. Also check if the same issue occurs if you connect the mouse to a different computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Check for latest drivers for the mouse in the computer manufacturer’s website.
</span></p>
<p><span>Check if Windows update has any pending updates.</span></p>
