            <p>I should not have or did not realize I had a third party game on this machine.&nbsp; I need to understand why all the services listed are Teredo, given Teredo is an IPv6 translator and I am on a local network that should only be IPv4.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>More research indicates that&nbsp;my current router does not show any evidence of IPv6.&nbsp; Several questions&nbsp;now&nbsp;occur to me:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is it that my XP is set up to tunnel IPv6 addresses through my IPv4 network connection?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My research&nbsp;appears to indicate that&nbsp;SP3&nbsp;may have implemented&nbsp;Teredo on my&nbsp;XP.&nbsp; Is this were it came from, or what application should I look for that would have&nbsp;turn Teredo on?&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What does it mean to have all the&nbsp;services being Teredo?&nbsp; Is there a security risk?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Whether or not it is a risk, how would I deinstall/deactivate/make dormant/control?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue occur only with Windows live messenger?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>In Windows live messenger c<strong><span>heck the configurations in the messenger options/settings.</span></strong><b><br />
</b><br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start <strong><span>Windows Live Messenger</span></strong> and login.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before connecting to anyone open the <strong><span>Tools</span></strong> menu and click
<strong><span>Audio and video setup.</span></strong><br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perform the tests and click <strong><span>next</span></strong> and confirm webcam is displaying video then click
<strong><span>Finish.</span></strong><br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before connecting to anyone open the <strong><span>Tools</span></strong> menu and click
<strong><span>Options</span></strong><br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select <strong><span>Personal</span></strong> and put a check-mark beside
<strong><span>Webcam - Allow others to see that I have a webcam</span></strong><br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong><span>Apply</span></strong> then click
<strong><span>OK.</span></strong><br />
g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign out and completely EXIT Windows Live Messenger to save new settings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>The issue concerning could be as a result of missing webcam drivers. You may have to download and install the latest Windows 7 compatible drivers from the manufacturer’s website.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft articles for more details on updating drivers:</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your advices and good intention to help. However, neither Method helped me.</p>
<p>When I went through Method 1 and selected&nbsp;the step:</p>
<p>e. Select <strong><span>Personal</span></strong> and put a check-mark beside<strong><span>Webcam - Allow others to see that I have a webcam</span></strong></p>
<p><span>there <strong><u>is no</u></strong> check window and also <strong>Webcam - Allow others to see.....&nbsp;</strong>at all&nbsp;available on the Tools/Options menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>My web cam works on my laptop with other applications like Skype, Google Talk. Only Live Messenger is an exception.... Don't know why... Believe me, I tried various approaches, however, without any positive results...</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>

<h2>            Printing from software that doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s own print settings</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>I'm attempting to print from a program that doesn't have print settings. According to the IT department for the program, it only uses the default print settings from the computer. When printing from a Window 10 laptop it prints fine, BUT when printing from
 a Surface Pro (3 or 4) it prints small (about 1/4 the size in the upper left quadrant of the page). How can I change the settings on the Surface Pro Windows 10 device to print using the entire page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I can export to a PDF and it prints normally on laptop and Surface Pro. ONLY from the program in questions that doesn't have its' own print settings does it print small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Charles,<br />
<br />
Changing some settings before printing is one of the possible ways to resolve the issue. We'd like to verify if you are being prompted to change some print settings like changing the scale before printing?<br />
<br />
See screenshot below for reference.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5eb225aa-b995-4a7e-8715-1388fafaaf1d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5eb225aa-b995-4a7e-8715-1388fafaaf1d?upload=true" height="283" width="391" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.<br />

<p>Unfortunately it doesn’t prompt with any settings before printing. The program is Rehab Optima, if that helps, and it only has a print icon which sends the document directly to the printer. The Rehab Optima team said they are considering adding a print setup
 or print settings before it actually prints, but it’s not a priority for them and it couod be a year or two even until they roll it out. The only thing they were able to tell me is that it uses the Surface Pro’s default print settings. Mind you, the same program
 prints normally from a laptop or desktop. Only the Surface Pro prints small. So my assumption is that I need to change the default settings somehow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>

            Try managing your default printer by going into Settings. Open <strong>Settings
</strong>&gt; <strong>Devices </strong>&gt; <strong>Printer &amp; scanners</strong>. Click your default printer, then click
<strong>Manage</strong>. Select <strong>Printing preferences</strong>, then see if you can change some printer settings like the scale.<br />

Keep us in the loop with the result.<br />

</p><p>Not all users need to provide a copy of their IDs. This only applies to Skype users who put in a birthdate that is not meeting the minimum requirement (legal age) to use Skype in their country and they don't have or they don't want to use a credit card to
 verify their accounts. </p>

<p>Strange because my birthdate in skype is 04-07-1989. Im 28. Surely old enough. Yet i get a message randomly after 10 years of use that a parrent needs to verify my account. And the email is send to a no longer existing address with skype doesn’t allow me
 to change. Since we cannot unlink our microsoft accounts. That are linked to a skype username.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This causes me to be signed out every 3-4 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cant change my password either. Gives me a message “oops. Something went wrong” all the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a lot of people where this happened in the last few days. All at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there not something like an error somewhere in the system?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway it was driving me crazy so i made a fresh account all together &nbsp;sinds the linked microsoft account didnt exist anymore anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The "<em>parental permission</em>" prompt only appears on the accounts of&nbsp;users who input an incorrect birthdate when our system asked to add more information to their respective&nbsp;accounts.

<p>
</p><p>If you're having trouble <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa95/how-do-i-change-or-reset-my-password-for-skype?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
resetting your password</a> and hits a snag when going to the page, I suggest you to try using another device, browser and Internet connection and let me know if the same problem will happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to clarify what you mean by your statement: "<em>And the email is send to a no longer existing address with skype doesn’t allow me to change</em>.", is this when you are resetting your account's password?</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i mean by the email topic:</p>
<p>when i log in to skype. I get prompted to verify my age. It tells me a parrent needs to do this. Eventhough my birthdate is set on year 1989.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skype then gives me the option to send a verification email to an email address of a parrent. This address is set in skype. In this case it is my linked microsoft account. Which is no longer in use. So i am unable to receive said email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But i am unable to unlink or change this linked microsoft account because microsoft does not allow this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option in account settings to unlink or change it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is an old account that got linked to it on accident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for me it doesnt really matter anymore right now. Since i already created a new skype account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did this because of the linked account that is no longer existant and was unable to change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because i constantly get forced signed off because of the age thing. Which drove me nuts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is true that we no longer have an option to unlink Skype from Microsoft accounts and vice versa. This is made to focus our efforts in the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and for users to enjoy one credentials across Microsoft's services.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I was wondering how long it takes for the loan shark in Novigrad to replenish his money? After meditating like 10 days straight, he restocks like 100 coin. Will he ever replenish some real money so I can sell him things again? Thank you :)</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Price&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>For Christmas my brother and I are planning on upgrading to the Xbox One, however, it will be quite pricey... We will have to get 2 Xbox ones, 2 Fifa 15s and 2 Advanced Warfares and I think the Controllers come separately too.... Is there a way to somehow
 lower the cost of all this by buying in a bundle or something because it equates to about over a grand :(</p>

<p>well bundles are cheap right now. 350 (w/o kinect but I'd recommend kinect if you can afford it) each console will come with a controller. Also if you buy digital you both can play off one copy of the game. Just set his console as your home and your console
 as his home and any game either fo you buy digitally can be used by both of you guys at the same time. So for AW, Fifa, 2 consoles, and 2 controllers your total should come out to around 820 bucks (plus tax). and that will also include the bundles game which
 right now the options are halo :MCC, SO, or AC4+ACU. if you buy 2 different bundles (say you buy halo MCC and he buys SO, for that 820 bucks you'll both have your own console, own controller, and 4 games (halo, SO, AW, and Fifa) thats a hell of a price TBH
 for all that. I mean i paid around 750 on launch day for 1 xbox and 4 games</p>

<p>The $350 bundles ($450 for Kinect bundles) will be that price 'til the end of the year, btw, so no need to scramble to get one this week. By the time Black Friday and Christmas come knocking, I'd be looking for bundles with even an extra game tossed in by
 the retailer. It's a great couple of months to be buying an Xbox One. :D</p>

<p>Buy 1 xbox one with free FIFA 2015 includes as a digital game, but one xbox one with COD included as a digital game and then setup digital sharing, you also only need 1 person with gold membership. (The games have to be digital for this to work)</p>

<p>@ the OP ...</p>
<p>Not sure if you want Kinect or not but having a very quick look on Simplygames.com you can get an Xbox One ( without Kinect ) and a copy of the new Call of Duty for £329.99, times that by 2 and it comes to £659.98</p>
<p><a href="http://www.simplygames.com/p/xbox-one-console-with-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-bundle-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.simplygames.com/.../xbox-one-console-with-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-bundle-xbox-one</a></p>
<p>On Simplygames also, FIFA 15 is £34.85, so lets round it up and say £70 for 2 copies of FIFA, so you could get right now, 2 Xbox One consoles, 2 copies of COD and 2 copies of FIFA for roughly £730, £230 off that grand ;)<br />
<br />
And this is having a quick look, shop about a little and you might even get it all cheaper!</p>

<h2>            Touchpad is randomly clicking &#40;links&#41;</h2>
                    My touchpad - not touchscreen - seems to randomly click on links, programs, etc. when I am moving my cursor around the screen. I have already adjusted by touchpad settings to "low sensitivity" but the problem continues. There seems to be no pattern behind
 the problem but it happens regularly...several times an hour. Any suggestions? I've had this computer for one week and starting to regret the purchase.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the problem began on the very first day I received the (new) computer (last week). I am typically running multiple programs but they are not high-computing programs - generally I have Outlook, Word, and a web browser open at a given moment (usually

            I will add that I changed the default settings of the touchpad. I changed it from medium sensitivity to low sensitivity and I disabled "touch lower right for right click". I also set the four finger swipe to adjust audio.

<h2>            Event Viewer</h2>
                    Can someone please explain to me what is the purpose of event viewer in Win 10? I mean, i know what its purpose is. But what i can't understand is why is it that whenever i click on that link "event log online help" for ANY event, instead of getting TechNet
 page with event description, all i get is MS front page where they try to sell me some products? Makes event viewer completely useless.

            Event Viewer is a gigantic diary for Windows and third-party applications that use it. And like most diaries, it's mundane and boring 99% of the time. For the 1% of the time that it contains useful information to help you diagnose a problem, just plug
 the information into a search engine. That's what I do, and it enables me to get information from sources other than Microsoft, which is what I really want.

    <title>File access very slow in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerbsinator  say:</h3>
<h2>            File access very slow in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Accessing files takes around 5 seconds to open, when it used to be instant in Windows 7. I can move through Windows Explorer freely and instantly but if I open a file (picture, text document, video, etc) there is a delay of about 6 seconds before it opens.
 It's not one single program that has this delay it's ALL of them. Once the program opens it runs fine but the delay is very irritating. I have Windows installed on an SSD and then a regular harddrive, which both have lots of free space. I did a disk check
 on both and they came out good so it's definitely something in windows that is causing this.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:<br />
Perform a clean boot.<br />
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps to eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8,
 Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />
Note:<br />
• You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot.<br />
• Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still
 exists.<br />
• If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to change the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft
 support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
I suggest you to try the steps provided, in the link below in order to perform a clean boot on your computer.<br />

    <title>microsoft.... how have they done with Winx. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmw318iman  say:</h3>
<h2>            microsoft.... how have they done with Winx.</h2>
                    <p>I had a windows 7 pc running like a dream, I used it at home to assist with work as a printer installation support engineer. I was sent Word documents, Exel spreadsheets, maps, post codes. I constructed and sent timesheets, expense claims.</p>
<p>Then along came Windows 10.</p>
<p>I decided to go with the flow and upgrade while it was free (always liked a "bargain").</p>
<p>Here I am 4 months later, reinstalling Windows 7.</p>
<p>Trouble is I no longer have a job, any personal files on my pc, original drivers for the components on the pc, or respect for Microsoft.</p>
<p>Their "pc compatibility software" told me I had only to replace 1 program (InCd), and the graphics card because Nvidia did not make a new driver for Winx.</p>
<p>Not too bad, I thought.</p>
<p>Upgraded the Graphics card, all ok?</p>
<p>NO.</p>
<p>The graphics card drained the power supply, so new PSU installed on Win 7 pc (£65) sound ok (winning!).</p>
<p>Installed Winx, no sound, downloaded and installed new drivers, ok?</p>
<p>No, still no sound.</p>
<p>Told "sound card is not compatible".</p>
<p>Bought new sound card, downloaded drivers for Winx, sound keeps screaming through speakers constantly.</p>
<p>Grapics card drivers installed, blue screens, after 3 visits to Microsoft "Support", and 4 months past.&nbsp; Told to take pc to local pc workshop. they fitted yet another PSU as Winx was draining power. back to Microsoft. Told windows 10 will import personal
 files so no need to back them up. Try a repair, try a clean install of Winx (did not complete). told try a reset, told try another clean install of Winx. Told "pc will not allow Winx to be installed", "you will have to go back to Windows 7".</p>
<p>so no job, no money, no personal files,&nbsp;windows 7 with no drivers, no faith in Microsoft.</p>

            <p>So you are saying that Windows 10 caused you to lose your job, it sounds like you have an older system, seems to me if your job depends on having a well running PC/Laptop is that you would have obtained atleast a 2nd backup system, now if you supply some
 info about your system we might be able to help with your issue, as I haven't seen many people posting about draining of the PSU as you have posted. &nbsp; Also noticed on your other posting about MS tech you never answered the question that was asked about&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            System Recovery and other programs Won&#39;t Open after virus was cleaned off of the system</h2>
                    <p>Original title: System recovery Won't Open </p>
<p>Recently, my computer has encountered some nasty virus or something that I can't quite place. It caused me the problem of most of my programs not opening. More specifically, about three quarters of my programs, when I click on them, give me the "Open With"
 window where you select what program to run it with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've ran Ad-Aware Full Scan multiple times and it can no longer find anything and I've defragmented my hard drive multiple times.</p>
<p>I would just run a System Restore since it has worked before in the past to get rid of problems, but there's just one problem with that - System Restore is one of the three quarters that gives me the "Open With" option. I've tried a couple different methods
 to fix this - including the troubleshooting page - but nothing works. Can someone help me just get it opening again since I can fix things from there?</p>

<h2>            Removing or Disabling Firmware&#47;Bloatware Adobe Flash Player&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've found the&nbsp;Adobe Flash Player on my Windows 8.1 and I am planning to remove it by removing TrustedInstaller as the owner and make me the owner and remove the files but when I attempted to do so&nbsp;Windows 8.1 warned me about future problems and security
 issues and that latter part got my attention. And I'd just want some conformation that removing the</p>
<p>Flash Player - C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_adobe-flash-for-windows_31bf3856ad364e35_7.3.9600.18116_none_0e1c3f02c832eb17 -, One of many locations, will only make my computer more safer right? Since Adobe Flash Player is a easy way to gain limited access to Another
 computer but perhaps it is something like that leaving the core program files of the Flash Player and just disabling extensions is a safer route?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is your opinion? Remove or Disable?</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />Read-only is a file attribute, or a characteristic that the operating system assigns to a file. In this case, read-only means that the file can be only opened or read; you cannot delete, change, or rename any file that’s been flagged read-only.
<br />
<br />To change the read-only attribute, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Right-click the file or folder icon.
<br />
<br />Remove the check mark by the Read Only item in the file’s Properties dialog box.
<br />
<br />The attributes are found at the bottom of the General tab.
<br />
<br />Click OK.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />
<br />Engr. Jamshed Muhammad

    <title>My Xbox Live experience has been destroyed by the &#34;avoid me&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> novaprospekt_518  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Xbox Live experience has been destroyed by the &#34;avoid me&#34; reputation status</h2>
                    <p>I have reached a level of frustration and disappointment that is difficult to put into words regarding the Xbox One reputation system. I have been an Xbox Live Gold member from the very beginning, and my account is well over a decade old. In that time, I
 have never cheated or in any way violated the XBL Terms of Service or User Agreements. I have a perfectly clean record. I admit I have done my fair share of trash talk over the years, but never anything malignant or personal -- or something you wouldn't encounter
 if you were playing a game of football or hockey and were being competitive. Lately, I don't even use my microphone unless it is in a party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had a problem with the Xbox Live/One reputation system up until now -- in fact I didn't even know it existed until I tried to play a game of Red Dead Redemption 2 online and was strangely unable to find any multiplayer games and had repeated
 matchmaker failures whereby I am confined to a large empty world all by myself. The reason: my reputation is set to "avoid me." Prior to Red Dead's release just over a month ago, I had not played any online Xbox games for well over 6 months (work/life constraints)
 and even as early as this past Spring was not active much - few games of SWBF2 here and there -- but never had any reputation issues before going on hiatus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discover now that my reputation has been set to "avoid me" without warning, without premise, without due process, and without recourse outside of nebulous "play more games, but not the games you like" suggestions. In fact, after reviewing my reputation
 dashboard on the XBL enforcement page, I learned that my reputation has bounced back and forth from "Good player" to "Avoid me" month to month dating back to July during a period of time I wasn't even playing online (my account is secure, before you ask).
 The dashboard revealed I received 1 report of "cheating" in the last 6 months, but otherwise have no other feedback that I am supposed to act on as recommended by the published guidelines for this issue. As I stated before, I never cheated (or exploited) in
 a game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has now been almost 10 days where I have endlessly "grinded" multiplayer games like Fortnite, BF1, World of Tanks, Neverwinter - in the process squandering
<strong>hours of my life</strong> and the majority of some paid time off I had from work - trying to do what I was instructed to do by 3 Microsoft support representatives and from players who found themselves in similar situations across the web in order to
 repair my reputation. Despite my best efforts, I still have nothing to show for it but the big fat banner saying "avoid me" on my profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My paranoia that someone could still report me (read: a disgruntled player who I bested in combat in any of the above games) has now grown to a point where I have intentionally let people kill me especially if I have killed them in the same match (in a pathetic
 attempt at "being a good sport") which is ridiculous. If a teammate came across a chest in fortnite that I just looted before he could get there, I throw my orange and purple guns on the ground for them to take out of fear they might frivolously report me
 because I got the better loot (and with the hope that the good karma will come back my way). In other words, I am actively trying to hurt my own competitiveness in order avoid inadvertently pissing someone off and getting a report while grinding these games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do at this point. I am sick of spending hours upon hours playing games I do not want to play with no sense or means of knowing my efforts are not being wasted. My dashboard has yet to update with any sense of feedback (positive
 or negative). No support technician has the means to help me. I believe I have been unfairly punished by this system and effectively banned from most multiplayer games, unable to chat in games if I wished, and have a huge blemish on my profile that is visible
 within games (akin to a "kick me" sign taped to my back for other players to report me if the wanted to be a troll).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never received a warning of my status change or any due process to contest the supposed "community" allegation(s) against me -- i.e. the one report of cheating (according to the Xbox Enforcement page) -- and no one at Microsoft seems to have any answer
 other than the Enforcement department deals with this but we don't know how to contact them and don't believe they can be contacted unless your account receives a suspension, so just keep playing games. I find it asinine that other players can determine my
 ability to play online without any checks/balances or accountability outside of a mysterious "algorithm" that is supposedly very sophisticated and worthy of not needing human supervision or contravention in the event a player/customer disputes its actions.
 The solutions to this problem are a nebulous and unhelpful "keep playing games and it will improve over time" for the reasons I've stated above. In fact, the FAQ page still references Xbox 360 on there making me question whether it is even accurate or whether
 anyone that handles customer service truly understands how this system works or how it affects players.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I am stuck wearing my scarlet letter and effectively banned from the game I paid to play and from the service I paid to play without any way of appealing to a human to look into how I somehow entered this purgatory while not using my Xbox and, to
 my knowledge, playing within the confines of the Xbox Live TOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or feedback to my situation, or the reputation system as a whole, is welcomed. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Indeed, I have reviewed that website in its entirety and is what I am referencing when I question the accuracy given it continues to cite "Xbox 360" in the information as opposed to Xbox One. Who knows what might be different about Xbox One's reputation
 system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A major purpose of this post was to renew feedback and discussion on how this system is incredibly inappropriate for having the power to punish players beyond a mere cosmetic "scarlet letter" as I put it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to use my Xbox Live subscription to its fullest, and unable to participate in a games' multiplayer mode that I paid for -- all because of allegations made against me anonymously and without human review for accuracy much less my own ability to
 contest them. This is the biggest issue I have with the whole reputation system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way for me to reach out to a "GM" or supervisor like there would be in any video game where adverse action has been taken against you for them to investigate whether that was appropriate or not. I didn't play my Xbox for 6 months, and somehow
 between then and now I was reported for cheating and my reputation was tarnished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that my "punishment" amounts to having to grind in games I have zero desire to play (while wearing the Scarlet letter on my profile), and with zero sense of progress or how many of these games I must play, is also reprehensible for a triple-A service
 such as Xbox Live. Hence my point above, if I don't play games I do not have interest playing, then I have no recourse in repairing my reputation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feels like the twilight zone...</p>

<p>Since your account was what was reported, and you insist you were not playing in online lobbies, the only other logical explanation is that someone else is using your credentials. Have you given your account information to ANY user for ANY reason?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click on the Reputation tile at the Enforcement site, it shows you the types of reports that have been filed over the last six months. In your case, that would be the period in which you say you have not played.</p>

<p>No I am sure I have not -- I have two factor authentication set up and I also change my major passwords every 6-9 months or so to coincide with when my employer makes me do it for job-related stuff. The only other Xbox I log in on (very infrequently) is
 my brother's when I visit him and even then, it requires a passcode -- I trust him with my life anyway so it's definitely not that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, when I first noticed the issue I had looked back at "recent players" -- to eliminate surreptitious use as a possibility -- and the last time my account had played with anyone was in SWBF2 and it said something like 38-40 weeks ago. This is congruent
 with the timeline when I had last initially played online around the Spring of this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Xbox enforcement dashboard describes a single (1) user report for cheating in the last 6 months. And the graph of my reputation like I said shows an "up-down-up-down-up-down" pattern month to month from Good Player to Avoid Me from July until now in December.
 Though I never played online in that interval, I did turn my Xbox on periodically for updates and to stream movies or videos whereby I connected to the Xbox Live service so that's the only explanation I can have for why my reputation could have changed (but
 still begs the question how, if I wasn't playing a game)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, a single user report of cheating (as the enforcement dashboard displays) shouldn't nuke my reputation and especially without warning or some sort of opportunity to address it hence my frustration here. Further, after over a week of playing various
 other games for hours on end, one would think that would outweigh whatever frivolous reports I received in such a sparse interval of gaming. Part of me also wonders whether the reputation even updates in real time or whether it is a monthly update requiring
 that I wait until January?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these questions and the nebulous descriptions of what to do about it, I feel, prove that this system needs a lot of work and improvement if it wishes to accomplish the goals it sets out to do per Microsoft's website.</p>

<p>Im just going to speculate. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Maybe the report of you cheating gave you a long suspension without you knowing about it. Hence the drop of your reputation.&nbsp;</p>

            As I mentioned above, this really isn't a possibility in my mind - I change my password frequently and have two factor authentication. No suspicious email or other connection activities noted either. My recent games played also did not suggest anyone was
 on my account since I used it.

<p>I can't see how this is even a possibility -- three separate XBL CSR's confirmed my account's disciplinary record was perfectly clean which is also reflected on the enforcement dashboard linked in the first reply to my original post. Besides, if I was given
 a suspension, I assume I would have been contacted by email linked to my XBL account stating as such. One player reporting me for "cheating" should not result in an automated ban nor a reputation hit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an update -- despite two additional days playing several hours of various multiplayer games -- my reputation remains the same. That brings me to nearly two weeks now of constant playing of games I do not wish to play. In fact, I even downloaded another
 silly game called Happy Wars out of paranoia that perhaps Fortnite, World of Tanks, and BF1 aren't counting in my favor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some regards, I almost wish I had been wrongly suspended instead of having to deal with this reputation repairing nonsense. At least with a suspension, I could file an appeal with a GM from the Enforcement Team and have them investigate and clear my name.
 The reputation system has no accountability and is essentially judge, jury, and executioner.&nbsp;</p>
