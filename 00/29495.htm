<h2>            Windows Update stalling on install and restart</h2>
                    <p>When Windows updates, the computer hangs usually at 30% (could be for a whole day) and has to be manually shut down.&nbsp; Turning on the computer and checking whether the install was completed it indicates that the updates are not installed and to install them
 the computer must be restarted.&nbsp; When restarting the computer, the computer hangs up again on restart, and it has to be manually shut down and install is not complete.&nbsp; This happens with every time when updates are being downloaded and on restart to finish
 the updating.&nbsp; The current update (KB4056892 (2).&nbsp; Checked on Microsoft support pages and fixes do not work.&nbsp; I am at a total loss as to how to fix this issue.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; It would be greatly appreciated and thanks.</p>

            Hi Rita, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.   
<br /> 
<br />That is a known issue with that update. It actually is installed yet is continually asks for a restart to install.
<br />
<br />I too have had the issue on several computers here and after trying all the usually indicated fixes this is what worked: And it also resolves many other possible Windows corruption issues.
<br />
<br />A repair install and specify that it should update during the process. This is actually fairly easy to perform.
<br />
<br />A Repair Installation allows you to keep the programs and data though redundant backups are always a good idea.

<h2>            Samsung IR blaster works on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have connected a small Samsung IR blaster from my TV in to my Xbox One. Does this work with Xbox? I can't seem to get it to work, but then again I can't find the correct cable tv tuner in the list either so I don't know what is wrong.</p>
<p>My cable company is Get in Norway and my box is Get Box ii, and I can't find find a remote code which works. Google it for picture.</p>
<p>Sorry I can't seem to search on this forum if it has been posted before. Thank you.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Oskar</p>

<p>Sorry, this is now solved. The problem is that the range is very short. The blaster has to be less than 1 meter away from the tuner.</p>

<br />
<br />
Performance Tips<br />
----------------<br />
-In general, the system is at full capacity when running the simulation at full speed, all graphics enabled, and sounds and music playing. To improve performance, turn graphics options down or off, turn sounds and/or music off, and use lower screen resolution
 settings. These settings are found by clicking the "Options" button in the Control Panel. You can change the graphics options by clicking the "Graphics Options" button that looks like a monitor. NOTE: The option to turn Anti-Alias off is no longer available
 or needed. You can change the sound options by clicking the "Sound Options" button that looks like a speaker. You can use the shortcut in the start menu to run at 800x600 rather than 1024x768.<br />
-Running the game with the "Roof" option on can affect system performance. We recommend players use the "Walls Cutaway" option, located in the Control Panel above the time indicator.<br />
-Disabling the "Export HTML" function in the "Play Options" menu can speed up saving of the game. We recommend this for players who will not be using the web page features of The Sims.&nbsp;<br />
-We recommend that you don't frequently Alt+Tab in and out of the game, especially when the game is saving or loading.<br />
<br />
<br />
System Requirements<br />
-------------------<br />
- Windows(r) 95, 98, or XP (Windows(r) NT and Windows(r) 2000 are not supported)<br />
- 233 Mhz or faster Intel(r) Pentium II(r) processor&nbsp;<br />
- 64 MB RAM (128 MB required if using Windows XP or other expansion packs for The Sims)<br />
- 2MB PCI or AGP video card capable of High Color (16-bit Color), 800x600 resolution display. It must have a DirectX 7 or later compatible driver.<br />
- 4x CD-ROM drive using 32-bit Windows(r) 95/98 driver&nbsp;<br />
- 1.4 GB free hard disk space (additional space required for DirectX 8.0 installation and Windows(r) swap file)<br />
- DirectX 7.0 (or higher) compatible sound card<br />
- A keyboard, mouse, monitor and a power source.<br />
<br />
<br />
Playing with Windows(r) XP<br />
--------------------------<br />
When playing The Sims Deluxe Edition on Windows(r) XP, be sure to use an account that is a member of the Administrators or Power Users groups.<br />
<br />
We only support one copy of the game running on Windows(r) XP, even with multiple users logged in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Video Problems<br />
--------------<br />
-The Diamond Fire GL 1000 Pro, 3DLabs Permedia 2, and Symetric Glyder-Max 2 video cards did not pass our compatibility tests for Windows(r) 95/98.&nbsp;<br />
-The ATI Rage Fury Maxx, Cirrus Logic 5464 Reference Board, Diamond Stealth II G460, Intel i740, REAL 3D Starfighter, Hercules Terminator Beast, Matrox Mystique 220 MGA-1064SG, and S3 Savage 3D video cards did not pass our compatibility tests for Windows(r)
 XP.&nbsp;<br />
-Although 3D acceleration won't improve game performance, newer 2D/3D video cards tend to have better 2D support than older 2D cards.<br />
-If The Sims screen appears fuzzy after switching between applications by pressing Alt+Tab, this is likely a result of outdated video drivers.&nbsp;<br />
-If you are still experiencing problems, try updating your video card drivers.<br />
<br />
Diagnostic tools:<br />
If you are still having problems with video, try running the game from a shortcut with some of these command line options:<br />
-w (forces game into windowed mode)<br />
-r1024x768 (forces 1024x768 screen size)<br />
-skip_intro (skips the intro movie)<br />
-skip_verify (This skips verification for OS, DirectX version, a compatible graphics card, the game already running, not enough memory/hard disk space, and a Pentium processor or better; it will
 try to set 16-bit color in windowed mode if it is not set to 16-bit color. Use this if the game will not start at all. It provides a possible solution for some laptop and audio/video workstation problems. Make sure you run 800x600 mode and use 16 bit or higher
 color with this setting.)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To create a shortcut, right click on Sims.exe and choose "Create Shortcut". To edit the shortcut, right click on the shortcut and select "Properties." At the end of the line called "Target", add a space after the existing text and enter your command line option
 (such as -skip_intro).<br />
<br />
When running the game with video cards using 2MB of RAM, the buy/build mode menu in the lower left hand corner flickers as you pan around the screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound Problems<br />
--------------<br />
Diagnostic tools:&nbsp;<br />
If you are having problems with sound, try running the game from a shortcut with the "-nosound" command line option. This will run the game with no sound or music. Try this only if you need to determine if your sound card is causing problems with the game.<br />
<br />
Turning the sound effects, voice, and music all the way down in the game will effectively turn all the sound off. These options are located in the Control Panel under "Options" and then "Sound Options".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Music only works from mapped drives (e.g., g:\), not "universal naming convention" (UNC) devices (e.g.,\\myserver).<br />
<br />
No Sound with USB Speakers: &nbsp;<br />
-DirectSound does not work properly on some systems with USB speakers.&nbsp;<br />
-If you have USB speakers and are not getting any sound then you need to turn off sound acceleration on the Multimedia control panel.<br />
<br />
Windows(r) 2000:<br />
-From the start button, go to "Settings", then "Control Panel".<br />
-Click on the "Sounds and Multimedia" control panel. &nbsp;<br />
-Click on the Audio tab. &nbsp;Under "Sound Playback", click "Advanced". &nbsp;This opens the "Advanced Audio Properties" dialog. &nbsp;<br />
-Click the "Performance" tab. &nbsp;<br />
-Drag the "Hardware Acceleration" slider all the way to the left ("None").<br />
-Click "OK" in both dialogs. &nbsp;You should now be able to play with sound.<br />
<br />
Windows(r) 98:<br />
-From the start button, go to "Settings" and then click on "Control Panel".<br />
-Open the "Multimedia" control panel. &nbsp;<br />
-Click on the Audio tab. &nbsp;<br />
-Click the "Advanced Properties" button to open the "Advanced Audio Properties" dialog. &nbsp;<br />
-Click the "Performance" tab. &nbsp;<br />
-Drag the "Hardware Acceleration" slider all the way to the left ("None").<br />
-Click okay in both dialogs. &nbsp;You should now be able to play with sound.<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows(r) 2000<br />
---------------<br />
The Sims Deluxe Edition does not support Windows(r) 2000. However, it does run on many Windows(r) 2000 systems. One way to avoid some of the compatibility issues is to install and play the game (and any expansion packs) as an Administrator.<br />
<br />
Both the installer and the game set registry entries under the LOCAL_MACHINE tree. This registry tree is protected in Windows(r) 2000 so that only Administrators can modify it. Some game features expect to see certain registry entries there in order to detect
 what game version you have, what expansion packs are installed, and other important details.<br />
<br />
If you do not install The Sims Deluxe Edition or any of The Sims expansion packs as an Administrator under Windows(r) 2000, you may get unsatisfactory results.<br />
<br />
Regardless of your results, The Sims Deluxe Edition does not support Windows(r) 2000. EA tech support cannot solve Windows(r) 2000 problems with The Sims Deluxe Edition.<br />
<br />
<br />
Browsers<br />
--------<br />
Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher is required for players who wish to take advantage of the web features of The Sims.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Web Pages Help<br />
--------------<br />
For instructions on how to create your own web page templates, please refer to the Web Page Template README.html file located in the Readme directory of The Sims Deluxe Edition CD-ROM.<br />
<br />
<br />
Serial Numbers<br />
--------------<br />
A valid serial number is required for installation of The Sims Deluxe Edition and for registration at www.thesims.com. The serial number is located on the CD jewel case. &nbsp;If you encounter problems with your serial number, please contact Electronic Arts Technical
 Support. &nbsp;Refer to your printed documentation for Technical Support contact information.<br />
<br />
<br />
Importing Families<br />
------------------<br />
Family Importing in The Sims Deluxe Edition<br />
You will notice a button on the neighborhood screen that looks like a house with a plus sign. This is the family importing button. Instead of automatically prompting you to import a house as soon as it is in the import folder, The Sims Deluxe Edition gives
 you the option to import families you want into the neighborhood you specify. Simply change to your desired neighborhood with the neighborhood arrow buttons, and then click the import family button to import your downloaded families. A dialog box will appear,
 prompting you to import the families that you have downloaded.<br />
<br />
The Import Family button will only function if you have a family to import in your userdata import folder. There is only one import folder, but houses in it can be imported to any neighborhood you wish. When houses are downloaded from The Sims Exchange, they
 are first downloaded to the Import folder until the player imports them into a neighborhood. In a typical install, the Import folder can be found in C:\Program Files\Maxis\The Sims\UserData\Import. Likewise, when a house is saved, it will appear in the Export
 folder C:\Program Files\Maxis\The Sims\UserData\Export. (These are automatic functions that the player does not need to manage.)<br />
<br />
Foreign language versions of The Sims Deluxe Edition will NOT have the ability to upload or download families.<br />
<br />
<br />
Installing The Sims Deluxe Edition with Vacation, Hot Date, and House Party<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
If you do not have The Sims installed on your computer, you must install The Sims Deluxe Edition before installing any expansion packs. NOTE: The Sims Deluxe Edition includes Livin' Large, so there is no need to install Livin' Large after you have installed
 The Sims Deluxe Edition.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you already have The Sims (and any expansion packs) installed on your computer, you can install The Sims Deluxe Edition over these as an expansion pack.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A few things of which you should be aware:<br />
- Once you install Deluxe Edition, you will always need the Deluxe Edition CD in your drive to play the game. Even if you install Livin' Large, House Party, Hot Date, &amp;/or Vacation, or see game screens that say "Livin' Large", "House Party", "Hot Date", or
 "Vacation", the game requires the Deluxe Edition CD to play.<br />
- If you have installed Livin' Large, House Party, Hot Date &amp;/or Vacation after Deluxe Edition, you will get a dialog that says "It has come to our attention that you have installed another Sims expansion pack after The Sims Deluxe Edition. &nbsp;For this to work
 properly, The Sims Deluxe Edition installer will now update your installation. &nbsp;Select OK to proceed." Please click OK. &nbsp;The game will run The Sims Deluxe Edition's installer to update the game files as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last Resort: Reinstalling<br />
-------------------------<br />
If everything above fails, and you're still having problems with the game, here's what you do:<br />
<br />
1) Move ALL your UserData directories (your neighborhoods) somewhere safe, like your desktop.<br />
2) In the Start menu, under The Sims, choose Uninstall The Sims. Make sure that you have tried to launch the game at least once prior to uninstalling, so that any maintenance installer files get copied to your hard drive.&nbsp;<br />
3) When the uninstall process is complete, delete all remaining files and folders in the location where you had previously installed The Sims (by default, this is C:\Program Files\Maxis\The Sims\).<br />
4) Install The Sims Deluxe Edition.<br />
5) Install House Party if applicable.&nbsp;<br />
6) Install Hot Date if applicable. NOTE: you may occasionally receive a request to insert "The Sims Livin' Large CD" when installing Hot Date. If this happens, insert CD #1 for The Sims Deluxe Edition and click "Next". &nbsp;<br />
7) Install Vacation if applicable.<br />
8) Move your backed-up neighborhood directories from Step 1 back into your "The Sims" folder. Click yes to overwrite if Windows(r) asks to overwrite a file.<br />
9) Put CD #1 for The Sims Deluxe Edition back into your CD-ROM drive.<br />
10) Play! You've earned it.&nbsp;<br />
When you launch the game, you will get a dialog that says "It has come to our attention that you have installed another Sims expansion pack after The Sims Deluxe Edition. &nbsp;For this to work properly, The Sims Deluxe Edition installer will now update your installation.
 &nbsp;Select OK to proceed." Please click OK. &nbsp;The game will run The Sims Deluxe Edition's installer to update the game files as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Registry Cleaner<br />
----------------<br />
On occasion, when uninstalling, users have experienced errors. When this happens, some of the registry files will be left behind, and will not enable the user to re-install. We have created a tool that will help clean the registry to allow The Sims Deluxe Edition,
 and any of The Sims expansion packs, to be re-installed. You can find this tool on The Sims Deluxe Edition CD ROM under the Eraser folder. It is called SimsEraser.exe. NOTE: Only use this tool if you have tried to uninstall and you cannot re-install successfully.<br />
<br />
We recommend that you reboot your computer after using the SimsEraser.exe, to ensure that registry changes take effect.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
New to Deluxe Edition<br />
---------------------<br />
-New "The Sims Creator" Character Skin creation tool<br />
This application, which is installed to your "Maxis" folder, is a great new way to create your own Sims, and then play them in your game! See the game manual, and the readme file in your Sims Creator directory for more information.<br />
-New Objects, Walls, Floors, and Character Skins<br />
Over 25 new objects, over 50 new character skins, and over 40 walls and floors allow you to customize your Sims' houses in grand historic Roman style, or futuristic SciFi Space Camp themes!<br />
-New "Deluxe" MySimPage capabilities<br />
This feature is available exclusively to registered owners of The Sims Deluxe Edition. It will give you fully customizable top 10 lists for all your Maxis exchangeable items (for The Sims, SimCity, etc.). Log on and register to get more information on this
 web feature.<br />
<br />
<br />
Neighborhoods<br />
-------------<br />
The Sims Deluxe Edition supports multiple neighborhoods. You can select new neighborhoods by using the arrow buttons in the upper left portion of the neighborhood view screen. The first five (5) neighborhoods are created by The Sims Deluxe Edition. If you are
 installing The Sims Deluxe Edition over a current installation of The Sims, whether alone or with other expansion packs, your current neighborhoods should not get overwritten with a normal install process. The first neighborhood, Neighborhood 1, is reserved
 for the existing neighborhood players have created since The Sims. Neighborhoods 2,3,4 and 5 are created by Livin' Large and Deluxe Edition. Neighborhoods 6, 7, and 8 are created by House Party, Hot Date, and Vacation. It is possible for users to have even
 more neighborhoods in The Sims, with any of the expansion packs installed. &nbsp;Here's how:<br />
- Make a copy of the TemplateUserData folder. &nbsp;Place it in the same directory as the other UserData folders.<br />
- Rename this copy to UserDataXX, where XX is an unused number (check the existing UserData folder numbers) up to 99. We do not recommend you use neighborhoods 2-5 after you have installed Livin' Large or Deluxe Edition, or neighborhoods 6-8 after you have
 installed House Party, Hot Date, or Vacation. See the "Last Resort: Reinstalling" section for more details.&nbsp;<br />
- You can do this before you run the game, or while you are alt-tabbed away from the game. &nbsp;Either way, the game should pick up the fact that you added a new neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Here's an example:<br />
- You're running the game, and you decide you want to add a new neighborhood to hold some imported houses you just found on The Sims Exchange at www.thesims.com.<br />
- You alt-tab to the Windows(r) desktop, find the installation folder for The Sims, and make a copy of TemplateUserData. &nbsp;Rename this folder to UserData23.<br />
- Alt-tab back to the game. &nbsp;As you scroll through the different neighborhoods, "23" will show up. &nbsp;This refers to your new UserData23 directory.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
***WARNING***<br />
Do NOT rename the original UserData folder either while the game is running or when the game is not in use. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Have fun playing The Sims!! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p>I am having similar problems. I tried adding my Paypal account on the 360 itself, but I got some strange Status Code. One that doesn't appear valid according to Google. I tried 5 more times, kept giving it to me. Then I tried doing it on Paypal itself, and
 that worked, however, it told me to add a credit/debit card in order to complete the process. I have neither, so this is a predicament for me.</p>

            Hi Dipdas.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Again, yes it does.  The present contents of RAM is written to the hiberfile replacing the previous hiberfile.   
<br />
<br />The hiberfile is the exact size of the RAM, so it only fits the latest hibernation.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>When I go into the detailed network connection it says that i have 120ms latency. So when i launch a game and try to play I&nbsp;have a good connection to the game but I still experience lagging in game. It's like when the game freezes for 1/2 second and i appear in another location in front of me. Sometimes it gets worse than this.</p><p>I've been running with the original Xbox One since 2014 and haven't had a problem with it,&nbsp;every game and app ran normally. It wasn't until i bought the Xbox One X that now both consoles have constant 120ms latency. I've tried moving my console to a different location and disconnecting my original Xbox from the same wifi (using wifi by the way). I even went as far to try and change the HDMI cord but it&nbsp;still remains the same.</p><p>I haven't changed anything apart from the consoles. At the moment my setup is using the Xbox One X connected to wifi. I'm still using the same TV, controller and settings as the original Xbox One. The only thing i've chang

            <p>This could possibly be a network issue. Many people have had no problems with their Xbox consoles until they try to have 2 consoles on the same network. I know that many ISPs can't... or don't... support multiple Xboxes on their equipment. Often, the settings that need to be checked/changed are either inaccessible by the user, or simply aren't there. Those people usually report the issues you're experiencing, but they also will typically have intermittent issues with one console randomly disconnecting, only being able to get one console online at a time and/or only being able to get one console with open NAT, which can cause other issues. Also, certain games seem to have problems when more than one console on the same network try to play online at the same time (Call of Duty series if memory serves).</p><p><br /></p><p>This is why Unleashed was asking those questions.

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu, Cortana, and Networking Issues After Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a fairly new IT Guy(Competent, but new to the professional environment and there is a lot I still don't know) and I have been having a reoccurring issue with multiple devices. All are Dell Latittude E5540 running Windows 10 Pro x64. I believe the issues
 are all connected, as each time these happen, the others happen as well. Know that networking is probably my weakest area. I am smart enough to learn and research, but also smart enough to know my strengths and weaknesses. That being said, I appreciate your
 help in advance. Long story over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues I am having:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start menu non-responsive. I can right click and run most options there, but usually not search. I have attempted to reload apps using powershell, but still no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana/Search non-responsive. I can't even click to get the chance to type. I can shut it down in task manager, and it will work for about 60 seconds, but then the issue reoccurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No networking. At all. Ethernet, wifi, nothing. One thing I have noticed is that "The Diagnostic Policy Service is not running." But it will not start. Checking ipconfig brings back the Microsoft APIPA address. Although while on the logon screen, it can
 see the available networks, as soon as I log on no networks are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have booted into Safe Mode w/networking, attempted to restart the Diagnostic Policy Service. Tried netsh winsock rest, netsh int ip reset, I even contacted Dell and they had me turn some things on and off(I can't remember the cmd commands off hand, and
 the chat log wasn't emailed to me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling drivers, I have even reinstalled Windows, which worked for a while and then it got returned to me again. I am thinking it is after a specific Windows Update, but am unsure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incomplete installation of the update or corrupted system files is few possible reason this issue is happening. To help resolve the issue, check out the links below and follow the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System File Checker tool (SFC)</a><br />
System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p><br />
Note: If SFC didn't resolve the issue, proceed to method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DISM or System Update Readiness tool</a><br />
DISM checks Windows updates and service packs may fail to install if there are corruption errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hello Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. Sadly neither of the solutions worked. I tried on two of the four defective devices. The sfc /Scannow stated no errors, and I ran DISM first with the /restorehealth option and then the /scanhealth option. /Scanhealth returned
 "No component store corruption detected."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uploaded the DISM log to dropbox for viewing if needed.&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2pUeG5p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here is the link</a></p>

            Since the troubleshooting steps weren't able to resolve the issue. We recommend performing the following step in the article below:<br />
<br />

    <title>Yellow Lines on Windows Media Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mommy2elijah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yellow Lines on Windows Media Center</h2>
                    Sometimes when playing back a recorded show, there are yellow lines running from the top of the screen to the bottom, covering all of the screen except the very center.&nbsp; The first time, I thought it was just from a bad signal on the channel that had been
 recorded.&nbsp; However, it is happening more frequently, and shows on any recorded program that I try to watch at that given time.<br />
<br />
What is causing this, and what can I do to fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
I think I know what the problem was, atleast for me.&nbsp; I don't turn of my computer at all, so when I went to re-boot it to try and see if that would help solve the problem some windows updates had to be customized.&nbsp; When it was finished customizing that updates
 and re-booted the problem was solved, the yellow lines disapeared,&nbsp; I think the problem was that I had updated on my computer, but I&nbsp;didn't restart my computer after the updates were fully installed.

<p>Thanks for the info there, rabjhop.<br />
As I suspected, the weak link there is your integrated graphics - the Intel GMA910GL just doesn't have the juice (nor does it have the WHQL-certified WDDM drivers needed) to properly support DirectX (nor a few others things) fully in hardware (not on Vista,
 nor Win7.)&nbsp; Even the GMA950 chip had issues in Media Center (going all the way back to Media Center 2005); the minimum that actually&nbsp;<em>really</em> worked - ever - was the GMA x3000.&nbsp;
<br />
In other words, you're gonna need a graphics card.&nbsp; But, you need not spend a lot of money - a decent PCIe card (assuming that you have a PCIe x16 slot) can be had for &lt;$50.</p>
<p>I don't suppose you could pop the side cover off of the PC, and see what (if anything) you have available for a graphics slot, could you?<br />
Here's what you're looking for:<br />
PCI Express:&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PCIExpress.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PCIExpress.jpg</a>&nbsp; See the long slots?&nbsp; Those are x16.&nbsp; Not the difference (you can tell by the location of the keyway in the slot) to the following.<br />
AGP slot:&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AGP_slot.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AGP_slot.jpg</a><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps listed below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Method 1: I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter and check if it helps:</p>
<p>Open the Search and Indexing troubleshooter by clicking the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type
<strong><span>troubleshooter</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>. Click
<strong><span>View all</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>Search and Indexing</span></strong>.
</p>
<p>Depending on the severity of the problem, the Search and Indexing troubleshooter might need to restart the Windows Search service.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer to my reply to Cheryl to deal with the first part of your query. See if that article helps and let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your second query, unfortunately, importing contacts to the Mail or People app in Windows 8.1 is not supported. Windows 8.1 automatically syncs Contacts in People app from the email that you have used to log in to Windows. You will not be able to import
 contacts into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another point I think worth mentioning is that the Mail app in Windows 8/Windows 8.1 is not a high end email client like Windows Live Mail or Microsoft Outlook. So, if you want to have the features of a full featured email client, I would suggest you to
 go for email clients like Windows Live Mail (<em>Free program available for download at
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials-other#essentials=overviewother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a></em>) or Microsoft Outlook (<em>that you can buy online by visiting the
<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></em>). In email clients like these, you will have the features like importing contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance, we will be glad to be of help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards-</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t type in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshuamar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t type in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I installed windows 10 on both my computer and laptop and they both have this problem. So far I noticed that it occurs whenever I open some sort of messaging app like skype and teamspeak3. Whenever these programs are open I lose the ability to type into
 anything. Can't type in either of the programs, search bar, or anything that has a text box. Oddly enough, I was still able to type in Google Chrome but it seems I've lost that ability now too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know for a fact that there isn't anything wrong with my keyboard because windows still responds when I use keys like tab, alt, ctrl, and windows. Is there a way to fix this without having to constantly restart my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently typing this message using the touch keyboard...and I don't own a touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            The issue does persist when using all other programs like Notepad and Wordpad. The OSK does work fine with everything though I do not prefer using it because I do not own a touch screen. I ran the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter &nbsp;and it did not detect
 any problems or fix the bug.&nbsp;

            I was able to find a workaround fix. I copied the entire backup off of the network drive&nbsp;to an external hard drive. In the Windows Backup and Restore, I selected "Select another backup to restore files from" and pointed to the external hard drive with
 the copied backup. I was able to restore my folder successfully.

            <p>Thank you for your helpful workaround. Works for me, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand it is really ridiculous that this problem still exists up to and including the newest Windows10. The reason is clear: When creating a backup with the "Windows 7 backup &amp; restore" (which is still the favourite utility in W10), the system
 asks for username &amp; password for login to the NAS. (See screenshot).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a9e956c-1004-4e3f-ae69-d59864b6f680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a9e956c-1004-4e3f-ae69-d59864b6f680" /></a></p>
<p>The problem is simply that this password is not being saved and there is *no* such option when restoring a file. Therefore, *any* backup from an NAS cannot be used for restore as the NAS needs a valid login but Windows does not offer me the capability to
 supply one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly a bug and it would be nice if Microsoft could start fixing it...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>Let’s try running the <strong>hardware troubleshooter </strong>and check if that helps. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
<br />
a)&nbsp;<strong>Click on the start screen and </strong>Type ‘<strong>Troubleshooting’ </strong>
and select ‘<strong>troubleshooting’</strong>.<br />
b) Click on ‘<strong>Hardware and Sound’ </strong>and select ‘<strong>Hardware and Devices’
</strong>and click on <strong>next </strong>to run the <strong>troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>If the issue persists let’s visit the manufacturer’s website &amp; download the sound card drivers. Try installing the drivers in compatibility mode to check if that works.</p>
<div><strong><br />
&nbsp;To install the driver in compatibility mode follow the steps below.</strong><br />
<br />
a) <strong>Right-click </strong>on the driver <strong>executable/installer </strong>
file.</div>
<div>b) Click on <strong>Properties </strong>and select the <strong>Compatibility tab.</strong></div>
<div>
<p>c) <strong>Click </strong>the <strong>checkbox </strong>before <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode
</strong>for option and select the Windows 7.</p>
<div>
<p>d) In the <strong>list-down box</strong>; then try installing the <strong>device driver
</strong>via <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp; The new Realtek audio drivers are causing an issue with the sound to be very faint even with volume turned all the way up. &nbsp;My PC is about 5 years old and the only workaround I could find was to disable the updated driver
 install from Windows update and install the driver that came with my PC. &nbsp; I now have the audio back and it is working fine. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            HELP Xbox won&#39;t allow me to upload a custom gamerpic.</h2>
                    <p>Xbox won't let me upload a custom gamer pic. I'm above 18 years old, I'm an adult account and I even put my credit on the account to verify my age. But it still won't let me upload one. Whenever I click to upload one from the app it says " Only adult accounts can upload an image" when I do it on my Xbox it says "you must be 18 or older to upload a custom gamerpic" But I am above 18 and I'm an adult account and I even provided proof.&nbsp;I called Microsoft for hours, restarted my Xbox, redownloaded profile, security proofs updated, and all. But it's not working and I deserve the right to enjoy a custom gamer pic like every other paying customer.</p>

<p>I also have that same problem. I’m older than 18 and I have the adult account but I still can’t change it. It always says “only an adult account can have custom images” and when i look at my settings, it says it is adult.</p>
