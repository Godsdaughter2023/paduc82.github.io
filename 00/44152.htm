            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I would like to inform that the PCI Express Root port is a part of your motherboard drivers which allows you to connect and access devices to your PC in an efficient, faster and reliable manner. Having stated so, you can install the drivers
 for the same by downloading the chipset drivers from your computer's manufacturer website and installing the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
 any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are done at your own risk.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now coming to the graphic card, the above is not related to your graphic/display. It is related to the ports that are available in your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

<p>Hey there Frothy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to play Minecraft. </p>
<p>Do you mind if I ask what kind of error you get? It would help to know what it exactly says.
</p>
<p>As far as troubleshooting goes, I would say to try and start off with <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-gameplay-issues-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot gameplay issues on Windows 10 </a>since this is the only game this happens with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, let us know how that helped and what error you get if you do.

<h3> jack okay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enhancements to MICROSOFT Jigsaw Puzzle</h2>
                    <p>I wold like to make several suggestion to the MICROSOFT Team. The suggestion are for MICROSOFT Jigsaw Puzzles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When the puzzle drawer is open and you double click a puzzle piece it would move to the drawer.</p>
<p>2. Currently, when you empty an open drawer it places all the pieces in the middle of the playing area. Change this so when you empty the drawer it places them where the drawer currently located in the playing area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two changes would significantly reduce the repetitive wrist/hand movement, and make the puzzle easier to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I contact the MICROSOFT Team to make these suggestions?</p>

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to post to clear something up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like Just has said, using the feedback function in the App will always be your best option. However, if the developers want to contact you, they will reach out. This is not often, but it can happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, folk from Microsoft do look in these forums. Office, Skype, Xbox, Windows and Windows Insider are where they sometimes post. You can define a Microsoft Employee by the "Microsoft Employee" badge on their post and profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Computer attempting to delete files on startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashwmk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer attempting to delete files on startup</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Windows 10, I've encountered messages upon startup saying I don't have administrator privileges to delete certain files. Note, this occurs as soon as I log in, without having interacted in any way with my files/programs. Until now, I've
 just clicked cancel without worrying too much about it, but just recently I encountered the same message only with the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">operating </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">system&nbsp;</span>being the item that was nearly deleted. I've run a virus scan with Malwarebytes, but that turned up only a few minor threats, and removing them did
 not seem to help. A quick google search for these symptoms didn't shed much light on the matter either. Since, as I say, this didn't occur before my update to Windows 10 (from Windows 7), I'm vaguely suspicious that the two are linked. For reference, here
 is a screenshot of the dialog I see:</p>

<p>In truth, Windows 8 does not support a direct upgrade from Windows Vista. This means you will have do a custom install, which means, any applications or drivers you currently have installed will have to be reinstalled. You might likely need updated drivers
 for some hardware. Windows 8’s built in upgrade compatibility wizard should help you determine what is compatible and needs to be removed before proceeding with the upgrade. Migrating from Vista to Windows 8 will preserve your personal files and settings though.
</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model.</li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Backup your Data:</strong></p>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Windows Vista depending on the edition you are running includes some form of backup. If you
 are running editions such as Windows Vista Business, Enterprise or Ultimate editions, you can use the built in Complete PC Backup of your Vista installation. This can be very handy in case your Windows 8 installation fails. For instructions about how to use
 Complete PC Backup, see the following article <strong><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2007/09/29/speaking-of-recovery-tools-windows-vista-backup-center/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Of course, you will need an external hard disk for this task.
</p>
<p>If you are running editions such as Windows Vista Starter, Home Basic or Home Premium, the only backup option available the standard backup and restore which archives your Account folders with some settings. If you need an option similar to Complete PC Backup,
 you will need a third party too. </p>

<p>Other steps you can use to ensure your data is safe before upgrading is creating a Windows Easy Transfer backup. Learn more
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> This option is quite limited and should only be used if do not plan on returning to Windows Vista since Easy Transfer backups can only be restored in Windows 8 or Windows 7.</p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows Vista to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest
 available drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows
 8. </p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade.</li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed such as BitLocker Drive Encryption, Folder Encryption.</li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications).</li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing.</li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Type: MSCONFIG.</li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</li><li>Click OK.</li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart.</li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p>What I suggest you do is create a bootable copy of the installation file on a blank DVD or USB thumb drive.

<p>I was able to upgrade Windows Vista to Windows 8. By going in and simply creating a new administrator account, then what I did is make myself systems administrator in Windows Vista, then I installed the Windows 8 DVD and had no difficulty with the installation.
 So if you're trying to upgrade from Windows Vista and you get an error such as change administrative settings, just do as I described above.</p>
<p>If anyone has any questions feel free to contact me on this forum. Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Family Settings in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> feenixt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Settings in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My Web Reporting activity reports have stopped on my daughters activities on my windows 10 computers since upgrading to Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the background. I have a desktop and laptop both running Windows 10 now. The desktop is a FRESH install of Windows 10 on a brand new hard drive, the laptop is an upgrade. &nbsp;I also have another computer at my mom's house which I just upgraded to Windows
 10. Before the upgrade, my Microsoft account already had Family settings turned on and we were using it to monitor my daughter's web activities and I was receiving regular web activity reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the option to report web activity to me by email and until the Windows 10 upgrade, that WAS happening. I recently tweaked the Windows 10 privacy settings and I'm wondering if by doing that and making my settings both on my login and my child's
 Microsoft login on the computers more private, that may have disrupted the web activity reporting. I did make quite a few privacy choices on the Settings menu on all 3 computers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since making our Windows 10 settings more private, I have yet to receive any web reports on web activity for my daughter. When I log in to my Microsoft account at Microsoft.com, I click on my daughter and Web Activity and there is nothing there. It should
 have a listing of websites visited but there is nothing, nada. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me if there is a setting I have changed in Settings on Windows 10 that may have caused a problem with Family reporting web activity for her? She's definitely on the computers and visiting websites so there should be a report.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Her Web Browsing settings say Adult Content, blocked; InPrivate Browsing, blocked; Bing SafeSearch on. I can't see any reason why Web activity reporting would just stop???</p>

<h2>            my windows 7 computer will not let me log in.</h2>
                    i have a lenovo all in one computer with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, celeron 2 processor, 4 gig of DDR3 ram, 1 Tb hard disk. it will not let me log on. i start it, it shows the user icons, i click mine (it won't work for anyone else either) and put
 in my password (some users don't have passwords, same problem) and it goes to the screen that says "Welcome" and has the spinning circle cursor next to it. it looks like this:<br />

<br />
it can sit there for more than a day. that is just when i force it to turn off. <br />
when i restart into safe mode, it gets to the login screen and five seconds later, shuts off and restarts into normal windows, not even giving me time&nbsp; to hit F8 and get to the startup menu. i can not find the windows 7 fix it disk that it has you create when
 you start it for the first time, but i found one for another computer, but it won't let me use it. gives me some weird error code. the built-in startup repair option won't do anything except try to restore to a system restore point that was made while i had
 the problem.<br />

<h3> cw_302  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Flickering in Windows 10</h2>
                    So I've seen posts about screen flickering in Windows 10 dating back a few years before now.&nbsp; I have an HP computer (3 years old), Kaspersky AV, Office 2013 installed and upgraded a few years ago from Windows 8.1&nbsp; to Windows 10.&nbsp; I took all Apple Products
 off my computer, uninstalled IDT Audio and uninstalled other apps, but I can't get rid of them all.&nbsp; I updated the driver too.&nbsp; The flickering seems to go away at random just to start up again when the computer is turned on in the morning.&nbsp; Driving me crazy.&nbsp;
 Is there any way to tell exactly what app may be causing this?&nbsp; I have the latest driver.&nbsp; Could it be the older version of Office?&nbsp;

            <p>This issue started for me a few weeks prior to my post.&nbsp; Not sure of the exact date.&nbsp; No changes to PC settings prior to problem, although automatic updates are constant.&nbsp; Not sure if that matters.&nbsp; Issue was ultimately resolved via an IT person in my office.&nbsp;
 My computer is a few years old, HP brand.&nbsp; When purchased it had Windows 8 with the immediate Windows 8.1 upgrade upon set up.&nbsp; Sometime later I updated to Windows 10.&nbsp; According to the IT person, something on the computer relating to Windows 8 was in conflict
 with Windows 10.&nbsp; He disabled whatever was causing the problem days ago and I haven't had flickering since.&nbsp; Can't tell you how many hours I spent myself trying to fix this according to suggestions online.&nbsp; Not blaming Windows.&nbsp; I know that's technology, but
 dang!&nbsp; Whatever it was caused irritation and valuable time.&nbsp; Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 all came together relatively quickly.&nbsp; The upgrades should have worked together or it should have been given more time to work out the bugs first.&nbsp; My opinion.&nbsp;

    <title>Folder View Settings in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Folder View Settings in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have a folder that contains several dozen PDFs with a lot of visual information in each thumbnail. To be able to find the file I need when I need it, I set the view to Extra Large Icons in File Explorer. File Explorer, or perhaps Windows Update, keeps
 changing it back to Details view again. I love Details view for most of my folders, but how do I get the Extra Large Icons view to "stick" for this one? Every time I change it back it takes several minutes to display the thumbnails again. I'd like them just
 to stay there. How can I do that?<br />

<p>You could also try Autoruns, as suggested. Still, it seems you have larger problem.</p>
<p>Since you're experiencing spontaneous shutdowns &nbsp;- can you indicate if the computer powers down, or restarts? &nbsp;If it powers down, it could well be a hardware problem or it could be overheating. &nbsp;Make sure there is adequate airflow/ventilation, that fans
 are working and heat sinks aren't clogged with dust, etc. &nbsp; If it restarts, you could be encountering a bugcheck / BSOD. Check c:\windows\minidump for files and&nbsp;<span>upload
 them to your&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;and
 provide a link.</span></p>
<div><span>
<p>For dealing with Blue Screens,&nbsp;general guidance follows (you may already have seen some of it):</p>
<p>Consider running chkdsk on all partitions. &nbsp;Let chkdsk complete on each partition and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Also consider running SFC /SCANNOW.</p>
<p>Other common suggestions include ensuring drivers are up to date (including video drivers), as well as ensuring that you're &nbsp;using the latest BIOS.</p>
<p>Consider testing memory with Windows Memory Diagnostic or memtest86.&nbsp;<em>Note
 that memory that passes tests is not necessarily &nbsp;good memory - it just hasn't failed a test.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider systematically eliminating RAM from the system - run with a couple of &nbsp;modules for a while, and see how things go. Then try the other modules.</p>
<p>If you boot into safe mode, do you still experience bugchecks? What about if you do a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean
 boot</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/6115cb34-2890-46b5-8c1e-c934c56ecfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device
 clean boot</a>?</p>
<p>It can be helpful to use Driver Verifier. &nbsp;To enable Driver Verifier... start-&gt;verifier.exe-&gt;OK-&gt;Create standard settings- &gt;Next-&gt;select driver names from a list-&gt;Next-&gt;sort by Provider-&gt;select all non-Microsoft drivers-&gt;Finish, and OK your way
 out &nbsp;of the dialog.</p>
<p>Then, reboot and use the system as you normally would, and wait for a problem. &nbsp;In the event that the system does not boot &nbsp;completely after enabling driver verifier, boot into Safe Mode and run driver verifier, and tell it to delete the changes.</p>
<p>Wait for a bugcheck to occur after enabling verifier as described, and then upload it to your&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>,

<p>hkcmd.exe seems to be a hot key interpreter, from Intel.. If you don't use this feature, you should be able to go to Control Panel-&gt;Intel Extreme Graphics-&gt;Hot Keys and turn it off.</p>
<p>Else, consider using e.g. Sysinternals <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoruns</a> to locate and disable the autostart for hkcmd.exe.</p>

</p><p>I&nbsp;assume you want to purchase/create Skype for Business account, for this need, you should have an Office 365 account, then you can purchase the Skype for Business online or enterprise plan license for this Office 365 account.

    <title>&#42;&#42; SOLVED &#42;&#42; Control alt shift bubble next to pen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m i evulchibi  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#42;&#42; SOLVED &#42;&#42; Control alt shift bubble next to pen cursor</h2>
                    I'm using windows &nbsp;10 with the latest wacom drivers.<br />
Whenever I'm using the pen and I press ctrl/alt/shift it appears in a box next to my cursor , creating a very slight lag that interferes with work , also its very annoying to pop up since I press these buttons very often<br />
<br />
I tried the solution where you enable the " turn off pen feedback" but the problem remains.&nbsp;<br />
The other way to remove it is to disable windows ink in the wacom driver properties but then I lose the pen sensitivity&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there another way to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
<br />

&nbsp;<br />

    <title>How to stop Live Mail from sending old email messages&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinmccoy2768  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop Live Mail from sending old email messages&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have read several "so called answers" to this, but, so far, no one has been able to give an answer. I guess I am the latest to try to get MS to fix this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to get Outlook Express and it worked great! I used it for years and, whenever I switched computers, it was on there and I just set it up and it worked fine. Whenever I read an email, I would delete, most of them, and it would get more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 4 years ago, I had to go and download Windows Live Mail and it has sucked! After I set it up, it starts to download my headers, and it kept downloading and downloading and downloading. A lot of them I had deleted months before. I finally stopped it
 at 2000 messages and decided I would delete them. I got off the internet and started clicking delete and, two hours later, I had all of them gone. I hooked back up and it started downloading ALL OF THE ONES THAT I HAD DELETED and many more. Talk about frustrating!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally thought I'd have to live with it doing that. After two weeks later, I looked an it had over 30,000 email headers on their from a year and a half ago. I decided to buy a laptop and went through the process. This time, using the exact same settings
 as the other one, it would download the newest emails ONLY. I don't have a clue why. I bought a new computer today and, started the WLM up and it is downloading as I write this. It's been about an hour and over 12,000 message headers dating back to September
 of last year. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is FRUSTRATING, Microsoft! Why don't you fix this problem? Why not answer the questions instead of putting wrong information our there?
</p>

            <p>It doesn't sound as if there's a problem that needs fixing. It sounds as if you need to adjust your account settings so that the account works as you want it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default for POP3 accounts in Outlook Express is for messages to be&nbsp;deleted from the server once downloaded. That was fine in the days when users only had one computer where they read email. When Windows Live Mail was released in 2006, it had become common
 for users to have more than one computer - a desktop and a laptop, say. So the default was changed for messages not to be removed from the server once downloaded, so that they were also available to other computers that might access the same mailbox. There
 are a variety of options&nbsp;for deleting messages from the server that should suit any user. Nowadays, it's quite usual for users to have three or four devices - a desktop PC, a laptop, a tablet and a smart phone - all accessing the same mailbox</p>
<p>
</p><p>You haven't told us what type of account you're complaining about. If you're not sure, right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. The type of account - HTTP, POP3 or IMAP - is given at the top of the
<em>Server(s)</em> tab. HTTP and IMAP accounts will download all messages from all folders on the server so that what you see in Windows Live Mail mirrors what you see in webmail. POP3 accounts will only download new (i.e. which haven't before been downloaded
 to this client) messages from the account inbox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your&nbsp;question reads&nbsp;<em>How to stop Live Mail from <strong>sending</strong> old email messages.
</em>The text of your post seems only to refer to <strong>receiving </strong>messages. It would help to have some clarification of what your problem is.</p>

<h2>            Configuring an IEEE-1284 compliant USB to Parallel Interface Cable</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am trying to get my DELL Inspiron 15R laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit to communicate with my Texas Instruments DSP board (TMS320C6711 DSK) via a&nbsp;IEEE-1284 compliant USB-to-Parallel Interface converter cable and I do not know how to&nbsp;change
 the parallel interface to operate in EPP or EPC mode in order for the DSP board to communicate bi-directionally with my laptop. Can anyone suggest a solution please?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

We do need the DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking STOP<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
Please follow these instructions to collect data from the crashes and upload them here, to your Skydrive or a file sharing service like Rapidshare.<br />

<h2>            Unable to print, even though the default printer is installed clearly in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/54d8808d-cff6-4888-82e5-52a1d99283d1">Sara Ciborski</a> asked on nov.5 2012</div>
My printer won't print (brand new HP computer with Windows 8)

I have a brand new HP computer with Windows 8. Staples set me up supposedly so I can use my old printer. The printer, which is an HP LaserJet 6L will not print. It shows on the list of devices: HP LaserJet 6L, USB 001, Ready. And I marked it default. But when
 I try to print I get an error message. Also, now that I've tried to print a document (which won't print), the printer keeps going on and on printing out blank pages.<br />
One of the Help functions (I can't recall which, there are so many ways to get help it is extremely confusing) and it seems like the problem might be that I need to upgrade the driver (whatever that is) and in order to do this it told me to go to Search (one
 of the charms) and then type W... and then when the options showed to choose Windows Update. Well....there IS NO SUCH CHOICE as Windows Update!&nbsp; So what do I do? I don't even know if the driver is the problem. Can anyone help me to know what to do? Or to which
 help site/function to get help?<br />
Thank you.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I have the same issue with the reguler Laserjet 6L under the win 8.1 tried on every updates and also delete and reinstall and update all the drivers........it's still getting the error message as Sara said. I wonder if it's the window 8.1's fault that won't
 work with this reguler Laserjet 6L model.<br />
Hp site did not say it's supported in win 8 or not. <br />
Problem is I have bought and stocked so many HP toners for it and hoping not to change my printer.<br />
It's been one year since Sara raised the problem........Is anyone from microsoft can help me solve this problem so that I won't return this brand new computer back to the store and keep using my old win 7 computer?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HP LaserJet 6L is listed as not compatible with Windows 8 Operating System in the Windows Compatibility Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link with more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=HP%20LaserJet%206L%20Laser%20Printer&amp;vendor=HP&amp;Locale=1033&amp;ModelOrVersion=C3990A&amp;BreadCrumbPath=Laserjet%206L&amp;Type=Hardware&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HP
 LaserJet 6L Laser Printer with Windows 8</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device drivers are developed by the manufacturer and for the HP LaserJet 6L the last updated drivers are developed for the Windows 7 Operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest that you download the Windows 7 (64 bit) drivers for the HP LaserJet 6L and then try to install them in Windows 7 Compatibility Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the link provided below to download the driver.</p>

<br />
Run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter, it did not display any program pertaining the HP printer. I'd think this is a device issue not any program issue. My laserjet is still taking the papers in and out and over and over
 again without printing anything. Showing error printing test page in the window.
<p>By the way I have tried all without the 6L CLASS driver kind too.<br />

Looks like the usb port is not taking or communicating by win 8.1 while the laserjet is clearly installed by win 8.1 ?!<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f340b936-da15-4589-baaa-6dc7db434706" /><br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">I have worked for several mounts with this system perfectly and there was no problem. Newly, a bad problem has been appeared: when I put the system to sleep for a long time, the system won't wake up (the power LED flashing, Bluetooth
 LED and CPU fan being on). After force shutdown, in the boot process BSD error occurs and after several restart, finally Windows will boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">The BSD occurs when I turn on the laptop after a prolonged shutdown or hibernate also. I emphasize that the problem occurs when sleep conditions (or being turned off or hibernated) is for a long time (more than an hour) and in
 short time periods, there is no error!!!! The computer restart command works properly (shutting down via the Windows and booting again).</span></p>

 Sometimes it is "memory management" with no logged information in dump files (logging is enable in the windows setting).</span></p>
<p>

            <p>I have turned my sleep off, so I will not be getting a problem waking (which I had)&nbsp; I still get freezes on shutdown and then boot problems occasionally, I had turned off fast startup but I think now it maybe better to leave it on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am considering leaving microsoft, linux or a chrome box maybe, apart from the freeze sleep problems you have the massive invasion of privacy too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't run system file checker of DISM at the moment but I PC has been OK the last 2 days even with it's corrrupt system files, it seems the more damge windows 10 is the better it run!!!</p>

            <p>I tested your instruction, but unfortunately, didn't work!</p>
<p>The problem still persists!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The big question in my mind which I mentioned above is:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">what is the difference between prolonged sleep (or shutdown) and short time ones?!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">I think if I know the answer of this question, a real solution may be found.</span><br />
