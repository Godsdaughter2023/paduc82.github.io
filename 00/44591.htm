</p><p>You can check out the suggested third party call recorder application on this list:

</p><p>Please take note:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype doesn't natively support call recording; however, some of our third-party developers have created applications that plug into your Linux, Mac, and Windows Classic Skype clients to achieve this.</p>

<h2>            My Skype Number is Not Listed on Account</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same Skype Number for many, many years. I noticed, today, that it is not listed on my account. AFAIK I've had the same account / email address throughout the billing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype Number is still active: I continue to receive calls to it regularly. At this point, however, I'm confused as to why my account information does not display. I'm not even sure how I'm being billed for the service because I set up recurring payments
 on it so long ago.</p>

<p>Hello Enrique,</p>
<p>I see there are 2 accounts:</p>
<p>one has some skype credit and office 365 subscription, there doesn't seem to be any skypeout calls made though.</p>
<p>the other one has the skype number and subscription, calls are forwarded to your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it indeed seems like you have 2 accounts and you log into the one that doesn't have this number.</p>

<h2>            Windows Accessories &#40;Sticky Notes, Calculator, Notepad, WordPad, Paint, etc.&#41; not working -- HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I just restarted my computer after the latest Windows update and when I tried to open Sticky Notes I got an error message saying: "Sticky Notes has stopped working." I always have Sticky Notes up on my screen in the background and I have some pretty important
 info stored there, so this is a serious problem for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my Windows accessories calculator (not to be confused with the Windows Calculator app) stopped working about a week ago -- when I try to open it I see a spinning blue circle for a split second then nothing, no calculator. The same thing happens when
 I try to open other useful Windows Accessories like WordPad, Notepad, and Paint. I don't know if these Accessories stopped working after the latest Windows update, like my Sticky Notes, or if they broke a week ago, like my calculator, since I just thought
 to check the rest of them. The only Accessories that still appear to be working are the ones I've never used before like Snipping Tool, Windows Journal, Character Map, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting my computer several times now, but nothing has started working again. Why is this happening? Can someone please tell me some way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I also tried switching to a local account, which didn't help either. Then I tried a System Restore from Safe Mode, and I got a different error message (0xc0000022) saying that it did not complete successfully -- but this time it specifically mentioned my
 Bitdefender antivirus program:</p>

 it kept giving me error messages saying it was "unresponsive" and to restart my computer. I restarted once and I got the same messages, so I decided to uninstall and reinstall it. Upon reinstalling and rebooting my computer, everything I mentioned in my above
 posts was broken again! So I uninstalled Bitdefender again and everything resumed working fine. I've enabled Windows Defender instead and will just use that going forward, since I'd like everything on my computer to actually function properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the short version is this: Bitdefender seems to have been responsible for my Windows Accessories, Administrative Tools and System Restore not working. I hope this helps someone else out there who might have the same problem, because I never would've guessed
 that Bitdefender was the cause!</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">BINGO! May have&nbsp;gotten lucky with this one. While doing the&nbsp;Monday morning "Boot-Up" my virus program (AD-AWARE) automatically started a quick scan, found one defect and deleted it:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">( "users\administrator\application data\local\swvupdater\updater.exe " [BTW there were two other listings in the "swvupdater" folder). Performed a system restore. than quickly navigated to the&nbsp;location above and moved the " update.exe
 " file&nbsp;to a private folder on a flash drive. I had several appointments to&nbsp;go to so I left the computer on and connected to the net via the wireless module. When we returned 6 hours later no sign of the virus and the computer operated perfectly.&nbsp;It is now
 Tuesday and everything seems to be still A/OK. Hopefully this will help others especially because this thing is&nbsp;engineered to look like a Microsoft Update however there is no record of this "MS&nbsp;Update" in the normal place. The only way I initially found it
 was that&nbsp;it shows up on the system restore, "restore&nbsp;point list". That helped me to know What but not Where.&nbsp;My virus program&nbsp;showed the location. Looking on the net there were several suggestions to help get rid of this very powerful virus but I chose to
 move the " swvupdater " folder&nbsp;to&nbsp;the private folder above and than deleted&nbsp;it from the flash drive folder. I don't know what the other two listings in the "swvupdater folder"&nbsp;were but I did not want to leave them on my computer. Any thoughts about how that
 thing even got on my computer?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Look on C: for Windows.old or something like Windows.001&nbsp; or anything that is NOT just Windows.<br />
<br />
If you actually created it during the upgrade it should be there. <br />
<br />
Note here there is an automatic Fixit and if that does not work there are also Manual Instructions.<br />
(You need to know the name of your OLD folder as indicated above.)</p>

<p>Windows.old on your C: drive</p>
<p>Usually, but not always, after installing Windows 7 you will have a Windows.old folder on your C: drive that contains your files and data from the previous Windows installation, and can be used to revert back to a previous version of Windows. Open Windows
 Explorer and under "Computer" click on the C: drive - if the Windows.old folder is on your hard drive it will contain all your files from the previous Windows system.<br />
<br />
If it's not there, make sure you can see the Windows.old folder: <br />
&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type:&nbsp; hidden <br />
&nbsp; 2. Click "Show hidden files and folders" <br />
&nbsp; 3. Click to select "Show hidden files and folders" <br />
&nbsp; 4. Click OK and look for the folder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note: after you are done go back and recheck "Hide protected operating system files." If you want to change the other settings back do so.)</p>

    <title>A letter to Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragonsnesting  say:</h3>
<h2>            A letter to Microsoft</h2>
                    <div>Mr. Ballmer, I am writing to make you aware of my recent experience with Microsoft customer support. While normally I do not concern myself with petty issues, this goes far beyond the ordinary day in and day out annoyance of contact with a companies customer
 service departments failing to resolve an issue. </div>
<div>Recently I decided to make use of my XBox 360’s capability to act as an extender to Windows Media Center for viewing live television services via an network attached cable card device. I thought “ What a great idea and feature of Windows / Xbox.”</div>
<div>Well it was a breeze to set it up and it worked like a charm on the PC with no issues. Until......... I added the XBox.</div>
<div>What follows is the nightmare that developed with customer support that I have experienced so far......</div>
<div>My first contact with customer service was via the XBox 360 support chat. </div>

<div>I described my issue with not being able to view live TV services and the message I was receiving “ The provider does not allow viewing of this content other than on the computer on which it was recorded”.</div>
<div>The agent responds : “Is the XBox connected to the TV?” ( Um...ok at this point I am a bit worried)</div>
<div>I respond : “ Yes obviously it is.”</div>
<div>Agent : “ What is it that you are trying to record ?” (sigh)</div>
<div>Me: “ I am not trying to record, this is being displayed while tuning to a live TV broadcast”
</div>
<div>Well it goes on for a bit like this but to cut it short we continue until the agent informs me that I need to speak with Windows Media Center Support specialist. OK, no problem, thank you very much and I get an incident number, a phone number to call and
 go on my merry way.</div>

<div>I call the number and speak with a support specialist by the name of “Carlos”. He is very pleasant but of little help in resolving the issue. I discover through describing the issue and the steps taken to resolve it that his knowledge of Windows Media
 Center and PC troubleshooting is somewhat lacking as he is unable to answer some fairly basic questions I have about how Media Center and the XBox communicate during the DRM license setup and confirmation process. During our discussion he points out that he
 is a contract worker that has no contact with the “real” Microsoft support staff or the program writers / engineers. Pointing out further that his experience and troubleshooting skills are from what he has learned by trial and error on his own. Hmmmmmm. Honest
 but not the best idea to tell a customer that basically “ I have no technical training or contact with the support staff of the manufacturer of this product”.
</div>

<div>Second attempt with XBox support via chat on the website. You can pretty much carbon copy the first encounter with this one except the attitude was less than friendly on the agents part and I got the impression that they were not reading the description
 of the problem at all. The agent suggested troubleshooting steps that I clearly stated had already been tried on multiple occasions and then once again we had an incident number and phone number to Windows Media Center Support. This, after I stated it had
 already been done once before. “I can’t help you as it is not an XBox problem” was the agents only response. When asked how they were arriving at this conclusion they responded with this again. Clearly they had no idea what the problem was other than it was
 one they wanted to go away.</div>

<div>Off to Windows Media Center Support once again. This time I spoke to “Mike”. I explained in detail the issue and the steps I had taken to troubleshoot the issue. While describing this I used several terms common to the PC and home entertainment industry
 such as WHQL, DRM, HDCP, and HDMI. Much to my surprise he had no knowledge of what these meant. Now, I work in the cable industry and am aware that I could throw terminology at folks that would be a foreign language to them. As a support “specialist” for Windows
 Media Center, however I find it very hard to comprehend the lack of understanding of these very basic and common terms. While pleasant, again he was of little help in resolution of the problem. I was told once more that as a “Media Center Support Specialist”
 he was a contract worker with no contact or ability to contact the “true” designers / engineers or writers of Media Center. He further pointed out that since “everyone” was working on Windows 8 it would be impossible to get any help with this problem. He did
 however recommend a call to Microsoft Windows support as a possible solution. OK, I’m game...here we go.</div>

<div>The first call to Microsoft Support.</div>

<div>I called and was eventually connected to a live person who verified my copy of Windows 7 Ultimate 64 as valid but out of warranty. No problem however we will still get you to a technician. Great ! Transferred.....someone picks up and proceeds to speak
 in a manner I have never heard in my life. I have no idea what the heck they said or what language it was in except for the last part ..I’ll transfer you..... after I asked them to please repeat themselves.</div>
<div>The person who answers next asks me for my first name and E-mail and a description of the problem. I give them the requested information. Transfer again as he is not a technician. Next person. At last a technician ! Description given, steps taken to resolve
 the issue and equipment on the premises. He asks for permission to remote desktop into my machine, well ok , not really my first choice but I’ll let him. The technician then verifies and performs the same troubleshooting steps I have taken ( many times by
 now ) and after putting me on hold many times to consult with...someone.....informs me that it is a problem with the XBox itself. Definitely not a problem with the PC or the network but with the XBox. He informs me that I am going to be transferred to XBox
 support....whoa there partner....</div>
<div>OK, since we are so sure it is the XBox that is the problem here I ask, what are you basing this on ? “It is the XBox that is causing the issue I know it is” was the reply. All right...but how are you coming to that conclusion ? What is it on the XBox
 that is causing it to fail to display live TV and to display the error message exactly and why do you think that XBox support can correct it ? Particularly since they have failed to do so twice before ?
<strong><u>“Well I’ll tell them” was the response. </u></strong>Well at this point I’m a bit confused..if you can tell them what is wrong and how to fix it....um...why is it that we can’t just go ahead and do it now ? No answer. I ask the technician what exactly
 is it that is being checked for when the XBox 360 verifies copy protection for live TV services to be displayed on it when in extender mode ? No answer. I ask this question because it is apparently the root of the problem. So, we go to this being escalated
 to a manager as having this sent back to XBox support is obviously not going to fix it.</div>
<div><strong><u>2 hours on hold go by</u></strong> The “floor manager” comes on and proceeds to apologize that it took so long for him to respond. After profusely going over his apologies he informed me that XBox support would be closing shortly and that his
 thought was that “research engineering” would need to be involved as well as XBox support and Media Center Support. He also promised that this would be the case and that I would be receiving a conference phone call the next day with all three involved and
 that this would get resolved. He asked if I would be available the next day and I responded that I would be all day and they could call at any time.</div>

<div>The next day</div>

<div>No call. ( Was I surprised....ever heard the one about being born last night ?)</div>
<div>Now I really do not like being mislead and when it comes to this kind of thing I can become a lot like my Jack Russell terrier. I get a good bite and hang on. So, I call in again. Upon entering my case number I get transferred...someone picks up and immediately
 hangs up. Call number two. Enter case number, transfer, this time someone answers and asks me for my name and E-mail once again and a description of the problem......Transfer again TO XBOX SUPPORT. They of course are no help and blame...... Media Center.</div>
<div>Call number three. Enter case number, transfer, name and E-mail, hold please. Answer questions about the issue for a technician and explain how I have spoken to XBox Support, Media Center Support, Windows Support and the discussion with the previous technician
 and his findings as well as the manager. Please hold. Transferred to XBOX SUPPORT. At his point even my Jack Russell would just give up.</div>
<div>Call number four. Enter case number, transfer, technician, explanation, ( at this point I have very little hope that any notes have been taken to either document the problem or what has been done about it otherwise someone would have some explaining to
 do) technician gets testy when I ask for a level two tech or a supervisor. The technician asks to place me on hold and does. After a wait he returns and asks if I would like to wait for the original supervisor from the day before to call me or if I would like
 to speak to another supervisor. I respond by informing him that since the supervisor has not called me I would like to speak to another one if available and he informs me that there is one and to please hold. Transfer....BACK TO THE VOICE RESPONSE SYSTEM.
 I have now spent hours on the phone with Microsoft again today, am back in the voice response system, and you are CLOSED. Now I’m not saying the technician did this on purpose....Who am I kidding, of course he did.</div>
<div>I have remained very patient and pleasant with the people on the phone to this point ladies and gentleman but boy is the blood pressure going up.</div>

<div>I would be asking myself the questions.....Are we truly big enough to treat a customer with such blatant disregard and allow our customer service people to pass them around this way in hopes that they will become so frustrated that they just go away ?
 Is any company ever big enough to do this kind of thing or big enough that they can afford to ? This is shameful. I’m not saying that Microsoft does not care about their customers. More that there is obviously something terribly wrong in the customer service
 area and in the training of the customer service employees. </div>
<div>I would think that Microsoft would be very interested in finding out the cause of why an XBox crashes a PC running Windows 7 Ultimate and refuses to function in the advertised and intended manner. There is nothing on the PC or the network. There is nothing
 connected to the XBox or between the XBox and the TV that can or should be causing a DRM failure. There is nothing at all that is being done here to cause this issue on the part of myself the user. I want a resolution. I wish to use this equipment for the
 purpose for which it was both purchased and intended and for which it was manufactured. I really do not feel like that is asking to much folks. Especially since I have five PC’s running your desktop software, one running your server software, and three of
 the XBoxes.</div>

<div>I will not be adding my full name or contact information here ( except in the original E-mail ) as this will be going out to a lot of people, particularly if I do not get some sort of answer from Microsoft about this.

            All true , it is however a concern to all of Microsofts customers. Thanks for your reply :) Getting the word out is of importance to us as a communtity and this does address a technical issue. Also, you never know who might point this out to him no matter
 where it is. The issue appears to be a DRM conflict somewhere in the protected mode that XBox runs in while in extender mode. My understanding is that there is an extra layer of security in place while the XBox is being used as an extender and while being&nbsp;
 used with digital cable services / cable card. Since there is no help available in the XBox forums, or from Microsoft apparently I am reaching out to all available sources for a resolution to this issue. Any help would be appreciated. Again thanks in advance
 for any and all help.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As someone who call center hops, I can provide a brief explaination for what's happening here. If you phone in, you're dealing with a 3rd party. In most cases, if the agent makes the effort to contact the company they risk review and written termination
 warnings. Furthermore, they are given extreamly strict guidelines, and if they break them, they get verbal warnings and their pay bonus is cut. When you get little better than minimum wage that really hurts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Training for most companies is about a month. That includes how to work the phones, call flow, (for some reason, there always seems to be a section on how to use a computer), and how to navigate through the tools, boundary training, and then finally a bit
 of content training for what they actually need to know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Transfer....BACK TO THE VOICE RESPONSE SYSTEM. I have now spent hours on the phone with Microsoft again today, am back in the voice response system, and you are CLOSED. Now I’m not saying the technician did this on purpose....Who am I kidding, of course
 he did." Not necissarily: if you're in the states, the agent has 3 min to take you off of hold or the phones do it themselves to remain FFC compliant. In short, if the agent is actually calling out to get you help and pushing you through loopholes, they're
 probably going to loose you. On our end, it looks like the customer hung up. It's extreamly frustrating, especially once you put your neck on the chopping block&nbsp;by breaking guidelines to help&nbsp;someone who was mistreated. (We face termination when we do this,
 but if we feel empathy, we'll take the risk and call in favors. Yes, this is a broken system.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that the agent has a timer running. It's right in front of them, so that they can't miss it. The concequences for going over change with whom you're working for. For one of my jobs, you get reduced to minimum wage with docks for the next
 2 months as your pay goes back up. So the two easiest places to cut time are reading notes, and writing notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're wondering why it's hard to get someone competant, think of this fun, and then ask yourself why they'd stay long term with the company. I can't say how microsoft runs their call centers, but I have worked for a few centers now. Most are lucky if
 they can keep&nbsp;5 employees, who work the phones, for over a year. So everyone is new... always.</p>

            <p>Hi MarkerDusk and thanks for the reply. With all of this in mind, the system is what I like to call a setup for failure. The customer is not served. The company is not served ( as it has spent the money to put in place a system that serves no purpose apparently)
 and the end result is a customer who is dealing with an unresolved issue. This is why my comment on something being terribly wrong is correct. Why any company would spend the kind of money it has to cost to run the operation , even with it being overseas,
 that Microsoft spends to do this is baffleing to me. Seems that it would be much more in their interest to fix things than to leave a customer swinging in the breeze with a bad taste in their mouth.</p>

            I agree completely, it's why I call center hop when I can't take the restrictions in one of them anymore. I've learned only to go into tech support if it's white glove: meaning that you can help the customer out, regardless of your training, as long as
 you let the customer know that you are then personally helping them.

The annoying thing is, I want to help them fix what may turn into a problem for them on a larger scale. I can't possibly be the only one with this problem. I'm not that special lol. Windows 8 Media Center is basicaly the same program ( albeit available as an
 addon) and I am sure will present the same issue to folks using the equipment as I am. Eventualy the snake will bite em.

            It will. They should at least have the call centers train up to the point where they are microsoft certified. Even if they just had one center like this for the others to transfer to when they get stuck... things would be better.

            <p>Now there's an idea. How hard could it be to have a level two area for truely "technical" issues outside of the "normal" support issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I really do understand the issues faced by people in a call center. It's a tedious and demanding job to say the least. I work right next to one ( or did before becoming disabled ) so have direct knowledge of what goes on. This incident bothers me ...mostly...because
 of the offhanded way a "manager" apparently lied to me. I say apparently because I can't say with certainty that something did not prevent him from contacting me as he stated he would. I hope that through some medium Microsoft reponds and resolves this issue
 or that someone in the community can offer a fix for this issue. :) Here's hopeing !</p>

    <title>Program Compatibility Acrobat X Pro is incompatible with Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Program Compatibility Acrobat X Pro is incompatible with Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>My Adobe&nbsp;Acrobat X Pro is suddenly&nbsp;incompatible with Windows 8 which it has been running on since I bought the new computer in&nbsp;May 2013. Using compatibility mode in Windows XP (with Service pack 3) as my windows trouble shooter app suggested&nbsp;does not help.
 Acrobat 10 Pro will not activate and no longer runs on my machine. What is the solution? I'm guessing it has something to do with ongoing Windows 8 updates.</p>

                    <p>
</p><p>Microsoft Windows'10 -- Backup -- Backup Options -- What does does "Keep my backups" mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it could mean:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) If I backup file_x and file_y, and back them up, but then I delete file_y, then after a month (if I chose that option) only file_x remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b)&nbsp;If I backup file_x and file_y, and back them up, but then I delete file_y, then after a month (if I chose that option) neither files remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if "a" is true, then what that means is the back up is refreshed (after a month) and only the existing files are continued to be backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If "b" is true then it is a literal reading of "Keep my backups" and none of the backups are saved, even for existing files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is correct?</p>

<h2>            Forcing Windows 7 to only access internet through Wireless, not LAN</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7. I have my computer connected to a router with no internet access via Wired LAN, and to the internet via Wireless LAN. My computer seems to keep trying to access internet through the wired LAN and this triggers either extremely slow speeds
 and poor connections or reports of no internet connection by applications (i.e. internet browsers). I need to disable Windows 7 and all of its applications from looking for internet at all through the Wired LAN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, if I disable the Wired LAN adaptor while the computer is on, then re-enable, it'll stop hunting for internet through the Wired LAN. That did not work today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network Connections &gt; Advanced Settings and set the Wireless as a higher priority over the LAN. It hasn't fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally you can disable IPv6 to see if that does or does not affect the wireless adapter.
<br />
To disable IPv6:<br />
1) Go to Start<strong> and right click on Network and then click Properties.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>2) Network and Sharing Center window will appear, after that click Manage network connections.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3) Network Connections window will appears. Here you can right click on the network card that you wish to disable IPv6 and click Properties.
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>4) In the Local Area Connection Properties window, untick Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and click OK.
</span></strong></p>

            <p>The setting at issue is the Default Gateway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting the metric, as you did, should resolve that but apparently hasn't.&nbsp; I suspect that may be because Windows is initializing the wired connection faster in the boot process and setting the default gateway
 accordingly.&nbsp; (I've run into something like that before.) You can use ipconfig /all to help diagnose this by noting the default gateway setting when working right vs when having a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a ready solution for you, unless you can set both connections to static and configure the default gateway for the wireless connection.</p>

<h3> merchtx  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB2837618 causes Outlook 2013 to hang</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 computer is set for auto updates. On the 13th it installed a lot of Office 2013 updates, including KB2837618. After those updates Outlook 2013 will hang apparently when attempting to sync with IMAP accounts, whether in safe mode
 or not. So I uninstalled this update and Outlook was working. I see this morning that another round of Office updates were applied, including KB2837618 again. Outlook 2013 behaved the same today so I once again removed the update and this time marked it a
 hidden. Are you aware of this issue and is there a fix?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I experienced the same problem, as has a colleague.&nbsp; After updating, Outlook 2013 will open for about 30 seconds before posting an "encountered error" message and shutting down.&nbsp; We have both uninstalled KB2837618 twice now.&nbsp; Each time it fixes the problem.&nbsp;
 It likely has something to do with the prior hotfix (see <span>
<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msoutlook.info/question/734</a>)</span>, which restored from prior outlook versions the useful to-do pane calendar's ability to show future days' appointments.&nbsp; You can see this capability in the upgraded
 version... just before it crashes.<br />

            I burnt a service call on my M$ contract for this one and the tech support has been absolutely horrendous.<br />
No call back after initial email exchange and the solution was me Googling and using various newsgroups.<br />
I'm not going to pay for that type of service from Bunglelore!<br />

    <title>Xbox is unable to read game discs only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diogones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox is unable to read game discs only</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I have a newer Xbox 360 HDMI cable model, and recently it has been giving me some trouble. Everything on it works fine, except that it won't read or load game discs. It doesn't matter if they are classic Xbox or 360 games. The console will scan the disc,
 and if I select the option to "Play DVD" the Xbox goes to the 360 logo loading screen, and stays there.</p>

<p>I have removed the hard drive, as well as all other USB connectors, leaving nothing but the controller and the TV hooked up to it. I've tried using multiple game discs, both classic Xbox and 360, without avail. The disc drive was originally stuck, but I
 was able to clean out the rubber band and disc gears, and now it opens and shuts just fine. The Xbox also reads audio CDs and DVD movies perfectly, and plays both without any issues. I have also run all updates for my system. I even tried to use the manual
 update install method, using a USB thumb drive, but the Xbox ignored it, so I guess all updates are installed.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if I could use an optical disc cleaner CD, like the kind used for CD and DVD players? The kind with the little brushes on the bottom of them. I have a few of them around, and they haven't been used much. I wanted to ask if they were compatible
 with the system before I used one, since I didn't want to make the situation worse. I wanted to see if cleaning the disc drive lens might fix the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, I'm not sure how to fix this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, if other discs play just fine, it could also mean that the disc drive is OK, and that there is something else wrong with the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I suggest open the disk tray, and slightly moving the disc try left to right, up to down. This will free some stuff up that may be stuck.</p>

<p>Thanks all for the prompt and helpful replies!</p>
<p>Well Outsider, I tried the steps that you linked, but most of those methods I had already tried. The only thing I hadn't done was clear the cache, and that didn't do anything either.
</p>
<p>I also did try moving the disc tray around in the slot, but that didn't work either.</p>
<p>Thanks Daft Badger for the advice. OK, I won't use any disc cleaning CDs. Do you have any other advice for cleaning the lens, besides opening the Xbox itself?</p>
<p>I hope it isn't the motherboard R4ging Badger, but it's beginning to look like that. I could try to get my hands on another Xbox optical drive to see if swapping it fixes the problem. Otherwise, I may be in trouble.</p>

<p>I am beginning to wonder if the optical drive is broken. I've heard that there is two lasers: one for CDS and DVDs, and one for Xbox games. Whenever I put in any compatible classic Xbox games, I will get the Xbox splash animation, but then I reach the "This
 is an Xbox game disc. Please insert into an Xbox." screen in multiple languages. I've tried multiple classic Xbox games with the same result.</p>

<p>Hey there Circanum,<br />
<br />
Really sorry to hear you're having issues with your console not reading game discs.<br />
<br />
It definitely sounds like your console needs a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
repair</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you haven't already I would highly recommend NOT doing anything to your console like trying to swap out disc drives. If you've tampered with your console we won't be able to provide further support for your issue and you won't be able to get an official
 repair.</p>

<h2>            DFSR Question about the DFSRPrivate folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello all and thanks in advance for any info you may provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am using DFSR for first time and I face an issue with the replicated data and the source data. I want to clarify that I am using DFSR only to migrate data to a new file server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my problem is that when I go to check the source and the destination data, they are it the same, whichever expected, as I thought that some files, if they are opened or in use, they cannot be replicated. Well, it seems that this is not true, because I checked
 it in a test environment. So, after I tested it I was wondering why the source and the destination data are not the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A colleague explained me that this is because I have left the DFSRPrivate folder which contains the staging folder in its original location in the replicated folder. He advices me to change this, which is a huge workload for me now. My question is, does
 my colleague have right? Shall I change it?</p>

<ul>
<li>The Skype version installed on your device.</li><li>Make a test call using the "Echo/ Sound Test Service" from your contacts list and check if you can hear the operator voice and yourself on the feedback.</li><li>Are you using a camera and speakers integrated on your device or a camera and speakers that needs to be plugged in to your computer?</li><li>Is the issue happening to all of your contacts or for&nbsp;a specific contact only?</li><li>Test your Internet connection and compare if it meets the minimum download and upload speeds for video calling and let me know the result:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1417/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How much bandwidth does Skype need?</a></li></ul>

<h2>            How do I stop Windows 10&#39;s search from bringing me irrelevant results that are morphologically similar to my query&#63;</h2>
                    I have noticed that when my input language is Turkish, and I search for a word within my files, Windows search (the one in File Explorer) brings as results not only my query but also words that are morphologically similar to my query (like "kara" &amp; "kar"
 when I'm searching for "karma"); as if it's trying to guess what I'm actually searching for. There is no obvious way to turn off this behaviour. Does anyone know of a trick to shut it off? Right now, the only way I can make search return only my desired results
 is to switch to a different input language.

            Only way is to search using quotes.
<br />So if you only want to find things that is karma then type it like this "karma"
<br />Which i think is what you are already doing.
<br />Search uses best bets or words that is similar like all search engines.
<br />Sorry can't be more help.

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. While quote-searching filters out some of the irrelevant results, it doesn't filter out all of them. Also, quote-searching prevents me from including files with words that start with part of my query (like "karmaşık" etc.).

</p><p>I already told Microsoft about this issue through the Feedback Hub, I guess all I can do is wait for them to notice it.</p>

<h2>            Can&#8217;t use any browser after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I’m reaching out to the microsoft community on my phone because after my laptop updated windows I am unable to use any browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my settings I can see that the latest (?) update is KB4058043 for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I was able to use my browsers but it eventually stopped working completely. I cannot use Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, or Google Chrome.
</p>
<p>I’ve searched for many solutions on my phone such as inputting various codes in the command prompt (running DISM.exe or resetting winsock and ip), clearing out my browser’s cache and cookies etc., restoring my laptop using a restore point, and resetting
 windows as shown in the Acer laptop guide.</p>
<p>I’ve run out of options other than disabling my antivirus or firewall, which I was told Not to do by someone who is much better at me with computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see there is also a new update that refuses to install, KB4056892, a 2018-01 Cumulative Update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to download it directly while I was still able to use Microsoft Edge, using a direct link given by a member on this site, but it didn’t install for some reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I am unable to use any browsers I am at a complete loss for what do. I can still connect to the internet but if I can’t use any browser I don’t see how that will be of any use. If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem could be caused by corrupted system files after an update or could be due to a third-party program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to ask some additional information to better isolate the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you say stopped working, are the browsers not launching or automatically closing?</li><li>Did you get any specific error messages or error codes?</li></ul>
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well if you are still having this problem here are a couple other things to try.<br />
<br />
<br />
Use the <span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows Installer Cleanup Utility</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;to uninstall FSX.&nbsp; Then reinstall the game then update it with
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Products/Games/FSInsider/downloads/Pages/FlightSimulatorXServicePack1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
service pack 1</a> only.&nbsp; Then test&nbsp;the game.&nbsp; Also if you are installing any add-ons (different props, etc...) then leave those&nbsp;off&nbsp;to start with.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />

            <p>Found this, and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok. Fixed it. I don't know if renaming SPIOSYS.SYS had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>The details were this: Error message popped up during xp pro reinstall. 9 minutes remaining while registering components.</p>
<p>Setup.Exe - Application Error <br />
The exception unknown exception (0xc0000409) occurred in the application at location (0x6976db5f)<br />
Ok Cancel</p>
<p>This might sound simple fix, but getting to the answer was a lot of work, and the lack of any so called MS 'MVP' help/interest in the problem confirms this. Very disappointing. The MVP badge has no worth these days. Especially a non - MVP person can often
 do a better job!</p>
<p>Anyway, enough ranting, the Fix was to boot from another working partition. <br />
Luckily I had a Winternals 2005 ERD disk in my toolkit from ages ago. You 'may' get by using bartpe or locating a copy of Hirens boot cd.<br />
Or getting this <a href="http://icompute.info/repair_windowssystem32config.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://icompute.info/repair_windowssystem32config.htm</a></p>
<p>Once booted I used System Restore from the preinstalled environment to go back a few weeks.
<br />
This will prevent the stupid setup from launching. <br />
Now you should be able to boot. Get in fix the problem by running sfc /scannow. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps somebody. <br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Please do ALL of these top down even though you have done some before&nbsp;as it is often the total process which
<br />
solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see if the
<br />
version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending
<br />
on how many rollbacks it does.<br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area - check<br />
Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click Properties<br />
check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do same for Configure on Lower Left of<br />
that box.<br />
<br />
In Control Panel you can also look for an Audio Manager along with the Sound Settings.<br />
