    <title>Office 2003 very slow opening file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kcbkong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2003 very slow opening file</h2>
                    I am using Office 2003 Small Business Edition running on Windows XP SP3. Somehow whenever I click to open Excel, Powerpoint file it will take me more than 1 min. But if I open the Excel, Powerpoint program first, then go to File, Open select the file there
 is no problem. Files open up very fast. Why direct double click open the file will be so slow?

            <p>1. Yes, the issue is only in the WindowsApp Folder, I can see the security properties of WindowsApp folder but not of the files inside the WindowsApp folder.</p>
<p>2. Just changing the where the apps will be installed to the drive D, now i have returned it to C, but the issue was not fixed.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6114993c-d149-4e7d-b168-ae663abdf524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6114993c-d149-4e7d-b168-ae663abdf524" /></a></p>

<p>You first have to change the owner of the folder the way&nbsp;HeloelHdez did on his screenshots. Then you just rename the WindowsApps folder to anything you want and you can get your data out of it. Once you move the files out, change the name back to WindowsApps

            I believe this one is from Cables to Go and the part # is 26886.&nbsp; I am going to search for an updated driver since the one installed listed only up to Vista compatibility.&nbsp; I also noticed that it was blue screening when I was using the combination USB/eSata
 port on the laptop.&nbsp; I used a different port later in the day and it did not seem to BSOD.&nbsp; I am going to test more today.&nbsp; Thanks for the reply.

            <div>I am using a prolific USB-to-Serial converter. The converter is using the PL-2303 XA/HXA chip. I have the latest drivers for this chip. They are: ver. 3.4.42.258, date: 12/11/2012</div>
<div>I am running this on Windows 7 64-bit. (with Radeon HD 5500 graphics card)</div>
<div>I have been using this particular converter for quite some time (just fine), but recently,it crashes whenever i use PuTTY.</div>
<div>The only difference is that now, the USB-to-Serial converter uses a higher (than before) COM port number. It now uses COM10. I cannot select to use a lower COM number, because all COM numbers before 10 are used. I don't know how to release the other COM
 numbers.</div>
<div>Whenever the driver crashes, it gives me the following message:</div>
<div>DRIVER_ORQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</div>
<div>driver: wdf01000.sys</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've read somewhere that someone using another terminal emulator (such as terraterm) resolved this issue that way (by using terraterm).</div>
<div>Any thoughts on how to release used COM port numbers?</div>
<div>Or how to proceed to resolve this issue?</div>

<p>Using TeraTerm works fine for me.</p>
<p>PuTTY was the cause because I first tried to use different COM port numbers but the crashes were still happening.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 to Windows 7 downgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off... I am not, in any shape or form, IT savvy, however I need help urgently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got given a Lenovo ideapad 110 (64-bit) as a Christmas gift. It comes with Windows 10 with&nbsp; no option of downgrading to Windows 7. I need to downgrade as my work depends on me being able to use Corel X3 - which I cannot install on this laptop with Windows
 10. I don't understand this as I upgraded to the free windows 10 on my previous laptop and Corel X3 worked perfectly.</p>
<p>I cannot afford to buy a newer version of Corel and besides, tried a trial version of Corel X7 and it just offers nothing majorly new to be worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need urgent help please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help you install Windows 7, you just need a Windows 7 USB or installation disc and a valid product key to activate it. You can check with any retail store since Microsoft doesn't have Windows 7 license anymore.</p>

            <p>The ability to downgrade will depend support for Windows 7 drivers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First I have to say that I never would have thought that people would fall for these things and I'm amazed just how well they actually work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I have noticed is that every time I use one, someone throws a flash/stun grenade at it .............. or do they?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm starting to wonder if the decoy itself simulates a flash/stun.&nbsp;Anyone know if thats the case?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It starting to seem a bit odd to me that every single time I use one, without fail, someone throws something at it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They flash when they pop. &nbsp;They are essentially firecrackers on a fuse. &nbsp;IMO they don't work unless you are on a map like Nuketown or sometimes Firing Range. &nbsp;You need a lot of traffic for my ears for me to not realize the difference between a gun and a
 decoy in this game.</p>

<p>They work great against people who stare at the mini map all game. Even if you distract someone for an instant, sometimes that's all you need to get the jump on them.

<p>I want to get a kill with one of them. I've heard they can kill when the pop at the end of their life.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a vid on my youtube called snipe5 where I get a kill with one. I'm not sure exactly how it works whether it be the contact or the pop, but it seems to have to be touching the person.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you watch the clip, its at the very end. It appears to be the pop that deals damage and is apparently 15, as this was a hc match and it took 2 hits to kill the guy (although he may have been damaged already from a grenade).</p>

<p>I use them in relation with my jammer. I jam someones claymore that is hiding, then throw one where it would seem I would be coming from, then approach from a different direction. Works nearly every time. Smoke works as a substitute in that situation.</p>

<h2>            Halo Reach 2 Player Local Aspect Ratio problem.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just got my second controller today, and was playing Halo Reach Custom Game Mode with another person locally. It went into split screen, but the view doesn't stretch all the way. Both views are squished on top of each other in a pillar box format. Instead
 of this, I want both the spit screens to span across my TV in HD. The TV is a Panasonic Plasma-50." I tried pressing the "Aspect Ratio" button, but the game won't let me change the in game resolution. While playing alone for campaign, firefight, and matchmaking,
 it is perfectly fine. It covers the whole screen in HD. However, in teo player, I just get a small box. Please tell me how to fix this. There are no real video options in the Halo Reach game itself, so let me know if I have to fix this from somewhere else...</p>
<p>Thank You!!!</p>
<p>Carpetfizz</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Rewards Program issue with Hot Deals.</h2>
                    So, one of the problem I came across is the Hot Deal of $5 Xbox Gift Card for 4,000 Points. It's no longer available and everytime I redeem it on Xbox One's Microsoft Rewards app, I get automatically refunded. I think the reward is discontinued.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was having problems with my laptop and had to do a full reformat where all files were removed and the original OS was installed back onto my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before this I had Windows 10 from the free upgrade that was provided. Do i need to pay to upgrade my laptop now? Is there a step by step tutorial on how to get Windows 10 back if I do not need to pay??
</p>
<p>

<p>You can upgrade windows 10 for free, if you have upgraded once. Same steps, just use the media creation tool and select upgrade this PC:</p>

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.

<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span></span></span></span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,
 you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>you already own</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to

            Device not Migrated, generally means there was an issue installing the driver for the device . . .
<br />
<br />Check to see if you can see the drive in Disk Management and if a Drive letter has been assigned to the Drive:
<br />
<br />1.  Right click on Start and select Disk Management
<br />2. Right-click the external partition and then click Change Drive Letter and Paths
<br />3. Assign a drive letter, click Add, click the drive letter you want to use, 
<br />     and then click OK.
<br />4. Check if you are able to access the external drive now.

    <title>Blue Screen and boot-up failure after windows 10 download. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coxyphoto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen and boot-up failure after windows 10 download.</h2>
                    <p>After being forced to download windows 10 on my notebook after constant badgering (I wish I hadn't) I thought that I would be able to download it and install it later- only to find that I had to install it pretty much immediately!</p>
<p>It is now locked into a reboot loop where it seems to boot fine to the log-in screen, only for it to then crash and go to the option to start in safe modes. The only one that will work is the most basic safe mode without networking so troubleshooting will
 not work and I can't find the downloaded files to remove them or restore the system as it no longer has a restore point recorded.</p>
<p>Apparently my girlfriend's collegue had the same problem and it has cost her a lot to get it fixed.</p>
<p>As I bought the notebook second hand I don't have the install disks for windows 7 or I would format the hard-drive and rebuild the system from scratch without the offending files.</p>
<p>If anyone can tell me where/ what files to look for maybe I can remove the faulty files and use my machine again.</p>
<p>At the moment it is just a paperweight and my girlfriend who bought it is threatening to throw it away!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. It is very unfortunate that you are unable to access your PC in any mode other than safe mode. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I would like to ask you the following questions in order to understand the issue better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your PC on Windows 7 or Windows 10 when it boots in the safe mode or to the login screen?</li><li>What is the make and model of your PC?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since your PC is only starting in safe mode and you do not have the Windows disc or installation media with you, it is very difficult for us to troubleshoot the issue without knowing Windows version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are on Windows 7, you may try:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore
 corrupted files. It will scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In addition to that,&nbsp;refer to the steps below:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open the start menu and type "<strong><span>cmd</span></strong>"</span></li><li>
<span>Right click on the command prompt and click on "<strong><span>Run as administrator</span></strong>".</span></li><li>
<span>Type the following commands and hit enter after each.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you run these commands, restart the system and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also refer to,</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are on Windows 10,&nbsp;I would recommend you to do a system repair and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Download and create Windows 10 ISO from the below link.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Once you complete creating media. Insert the Windows installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After you boot the computer using Windows DVD, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD".</strong> Press any key<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>

            <p>Sahil,</p>
<p>Thank you for the repair ideas.</p>
<p>Firstly the notebook is an Asus Eee PC 1005HA and, as far as I can see, is still running Windows 7 and, after the log-in screen&nbsp; displays "page fault in nonpaged area", dumps the memory and then boots to the safe mode selection screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried SFC and it did not find any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to run DISM I can display the options, but when I try the Scanhealth or Restorehealth commands both display an error message:</p>
<p>Error 87 and that an error occurred while processing the command.</p>
<p>Would looking in the log file be of help?</p>

<p><span>Does anyone have any information on Phantasy Star Online 2?</span></p>
<p><span>I recently saw a video on youtube showing gameplay on this title. I was a huge fan of it when it launched on the sega dreamcast, but all I see is that the game is already out on PC, and that its going to debut
 on the PS4.</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone know if the tile is coming also for the Xbox One, please let me know if you have any info on this.</span></p>
<p><span>thanks!!</span></p>

<p>Dont know who told you that its on ps4...... its been out for ages in Japan and was supposed to be on pc worldwide early spring this year. No chance of it being on xboxone as its both not a popular game outside of japan and xbox isnt really going to sell
 in well in japan either. </p>
<p>More chance of a vita version over here and that doesn't look likely either</p>

<p>It may not seem likely but then again who would've thought PSU would've came over to the xbox as well. It's the same story there, a huge franchise game in Japan but it did come over to the U.S for console. While it may not look promising for the xbox one
 I can say that I believe eventually it will come to xbox again. However like times before, Japan will be playing it long before we get a chance at it.</p>

<p>Not sure why anyone would think PSO is only popular in Japan, parts 1 and 2 were both on Dreamcast, Gamecube and the original Xbox and were very popular at the time. Pretty sure PSO 2 would do really well in the States, if they made the game s little more
 story driven and allow more people to play together in one game.</p>

<p>This game is actually only on PC in Japan. Even the US version is not out (expect early 2014, may be Q2 2014). It is also available on PSVita if I'm not wrong. Sega clearly said that this game will only be on PC. But it is on PS vita though, so we can always
 expect an Xbox One or PS4 version but don't count on it, I think it won't come. </p>

<p>Just lol'd at the last comment, Xbox 360 isn't powerful enough to run a game like this, and i have the Xbox One and it's a great console i adore it, so why they wouldn't make a game because one person like you who hate on something that you don't have? It's
 kinda selfish i don't wanna start a fight but it's because of people like you that ruin the point of view of gaming, so go on your perfect playstation 4 with your troublesome system core, thank you! And for Phantasy Star Online 2 on Xbox One it would be awesome
 i hope they do it, i mean they making it for PS vita and IOS so come on why not on Consoles !</p>

<p>Stop being mad, you know notbing in gaming if you don't know that a console have a limit of performance, your just bad,</p>
<p>In one year i probably played more games then you did in your whole life, so stop saying anything, if your not happy go cry someone else, the 360 is not enough powerful to run a online game like Phantasy star Online 2, get over it not even PS3, the game
 is too big for those consoles! Go learn about gaming before saying anything ! Look at how Battlefield 4 and Assassin's creed 4 running on 360 and now on xbox one, you're probably just a kid who get mad at everything on internet !</p>

<p>====================================<br />
You may have compatibility issues with your source files.</p>
<p>Many formats are reportedly compatible with <br />
Movie Maker but the most reliable choices are:<br />
<br />
Photos -&nbsp; bmp<br />
Video -&nbsp; wmv or dv-avi<br />
Music -&nbsp; wma, wav, wmv</p>
<p>Also...removing Effects and Transitions may help and<br />
it may be worth a try to go to...Tools / Options / <br />
Compatibility tab and uncheck all the filters.</p>
<p>Large complex projects are prone to causing problems.<br />
If you create several smaller projects and Publish (save) <br />
each one in the .wmv movie format in a folder on your <br />
hard drive you can then import the collected movie clips <br />
into Movie Maker and combine them into a final movie.<br />
Or import the collected .wmv clips into DVD Maker and <br />
each one will become a Scene (Chapter).</p>

<br />If there is actually data on that disk, choose Like a USB flash drive', that way you can access any previously burned files, though you only get that popup usually if there are no files already on the disk . ..

            The solutions in this answer did not solve my problem. &nbsp;However, this led me to do a regedit search for "shellhwdetection", &nbsp;I noticed in "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/ControlSet001/Services/ShellHWDection/Start", that the value was 0x0000004. &nbsp;I changed
 it to 0x00000002, closed out regedit, rebooted and the problem was solved.

            <p>Have you set Cortana to answer to your voice? If not, this is the first step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First open the Cortana menu by click the symbol on the taskbar. Then, select 'Notebook' from the left bar (image of a book below the home icon) and finally select "Settings". From here, if the option 'Let Cortana Respond to "Hey Cortana" ' in not active,
 activate and try now. (Note, Cortana requires your location, she'll send you to the relevant settings if this is not on.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Cortana is listening for Hey Cortana, then try the option below that 'Respond Best:' and help Cortana learn your voice. This will make it easier for her to understand you, and it's probably a good idea to do this anyway if you're the only person who uses
 that computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are the simplest two reasons as to why Cortana might not allow voice commands. Try changing them and Let me know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            How to permanently delete  MRESP50 NDIS PROTOCOL DRIVER</h2>
                    <p>The above title pretty much covers my question. I cannot find it anywhere on my PC and the only reason I found out about it is that Bullguard picked it up on a security scan and indicated it is a risk. It was also noted by Bullguard that is is "Unsigned",
 whatever that means.</p>

    <title>What to do about the Contacts&#47;Senders Lists bugs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dogtamer  say:</h3>
<h2>            What to do about the Contacts&#47;Senders Lists bugs</h2>
                    <p>I have been using a Windows Live Mail 2011 client to handle multiple POP3 &amp; IMAP accounts on a W7 Home Premium (HP/Compaq OEM v.) puter for some time now; I have consistently had problems with the Senders and Contacts Lists misbehaving.&nbsp; Despite multiple
 attempts to add addresses to the lists, each of the three (Contacts, Safe Senders, &amp; Blocked Senders) refuse to consistently cooperate, with little or no rhyme or reason as to how the failure(s) will manifest.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In some cases, right-clicking &amp; choosing the option "add sender to safe senders list" or the option "add sender to blocked senders list" is simply ignored by the client.
</p>
<p>In some cases the contact will be added to the list specified, but it's presence in said list will simply be ignored, invoking thereby the "the sender is not in your contacts or allowed senders list" warning in the e-mail upon opening it for situations where
 the contact was added to the Safe Senders List, or, in situations where the contact was added to the Block Senders List, allowing fresh mail from the Blocked sender to be received.</p>
<p>In some cases the added contact will appear in the specified list when said list is inspected via Options/Safety Options, but will immediately disappear upon closing the Options dialog (as verified by re-opening the Options dialog &amp; re--inspecting the list
 for the concerned contact).</p>
<p>In some cases the presence of a contact in the Contacts List does not invoke such presence's default behavior, i.e.,&nbsp; for the client to pass said contact as a member of the Safe Senders list.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>All of these problems have been noted in both the machine-specific local client and also in the machine-independent web client; this would lead one to believe that the problem is with Windows Live Mail 2011 itself, and not with the specific installation
 on this particular computer.&nbsp; A search of the web via Bing and of these forums would seem to imply that such is indeed the case, and that this behavior is a known fault with this particular client that has not yet been solved by µSoft; nevertheless I thought
 it worth while to ask if a fix is available for these problems with the Contacts and Senders Lists.&nbsp; I have previously attempted to address this issue by running the repair option avaialable via Control panel, and by compacting the databases, but to no avail.&nbsp;
 The WLM log file gathered today is replete with (i.e., HUNDREDS of instances of) "...Zone_Chk platformservice.cpp:364 ERROR:"" failed with 0x80004004. ..."&nbsp; and "...Zone_MailChk ERROR: (booktree.cpp:8411), failed with 0x80040064..." errors.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The Windows Live Mail client in use&nbsp;is Version 2011, Build 15.4.3555.0308, last updated 14Apr2012, running in Microsoft® Windows® 7 Home Premium Version 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601 on a Compaq-Presario System Model BQ472AA-ABA CQ5500Y (OEM-preloaded
 w/ WinPE or WAIK, unless I am mistaken, &amp; w/ software license {i.e., serial number} 4CE02602K7); the primary web browser is IE9, Version: 9.0.8112.16421 w/ Update Versions 9.06 (KB2675157), a Cipher Strength of 256-bit, &amp; w/ Product ID:03553-991-8992687-00010.&nbsp;
 Any help in resolving this annoyance that one of the talented moderators who monitor these forums may be able to provide will, as always, be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I'm afraid you have not understood the problem I outlined in the original post.&nbsp; The problem is with the Senders Lists not working correctly.&nbsp; No Contacts have been lost; I am able to see all Contacts details, and I can add contacts @ anytime.&nbsp; The only
 relationship my problem has to the Contacts List is the behavior I am experiencing with the Safe Senders List as outlined in my original post: "...In some cases the presence of a contact in the Contacts List does not invoke such presence's default behavior,
 i.e., for the client to pass said contact as a member of the Safe Senders list."&nbsp; In other words, I have some Contacts that show (correctly) in the Contacts List, but e-mails received from these PARTICULAR contacts ARE NOT passed as members of the Safe Senders
 List DESPITE being present as a recognized member of the Contacts List.&nbsp; Please note that not ALL of these problems are with members of the Contacts List; some are simply senders who I have added to the Safe Senders List WITHOUT adding them to the Contacts
 List.&nbsp; And some of these problems are with senders who I have added, conversely, to the Blocked Senders List.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also please note that there are only a few members of the Contacts List for which this behavior is exhibited; incoming e-mail from all the rest of the members of the Contacts List are allowed to pass as members of the Safe Senders List; of those members
 of the Contacts List where this default behavior---being allowed to&nbsp; pass as members of the Safe Senders List---DOES NOT work, some show in the Safe Senders List; some can be added to the Safe Senders List but will subsequently disappear, etc.---all of these
 behaviors I have outlined more succinctly in the original posting.&nbsp; These salient facts would appear to narrow the focus AWAY from a concentration on problems with the Contacts List and TOWARDS a concentration on problems with the two Senders Lists, Safe and
 Blocked; I believe that solving the problems with those will concurrently solve the problem manifested by SOME, but not ALL, of the members of the Contact List.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;As I stated in the original posting, all logical troubleshooting steps I've followed in an effort to isolate these strange behaviors to a particular contact, grouping, or procedure have failed to reveal any rhyme, reason, or discernible pattern or mechanism
 of failure.&nbsp; I feel pretty sure the answer is contained in the Windows Live Mail log I've recovered from AppData/Local, but I do not have sufficient information to be able to decipher what the logs reveal...</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am presently looking for help only in resolving problems with the Safe Senders, Blocked Senders, and Contacts Lists not operating correctly in regard to what is allowed and what is blocked, as outlined in detail in my original post; I am not looking for
 help with the Contacts List malfunctioning in any of the three fashions outlined in the reply to my original post by Moderator Neil_S, as they are not the issue with this e-mail client.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The only questions posed by this reply I can answer are that this issue has been present in my otherwise-excellent client from the original installation of Windows Live Essentials 2011, which was accomplished via the web installer "wlsetup-web, v. v15.4.3538.0513",
 and that these issues were not resolved by the update (effected via Microsoft Update) to Build v. 15.4.3555.0308 on 14April2012, and that these malfunctions occur with both the local client on the computer specified in my original posting as well as with the
 web-based client residing on Hotmail's servers.&nbsp; One additional thing I might add is that the malfunctions occur irrespective of the origin of the contact (in other words, SOME contacts originating from non-Hotmail accounts that are amongst the multiple accounts
 handled by the WLM2011 client are subject to these problems, as are SOME contacts that were part of my Hotmail accounts long before Windows 7 &amp; WLM2011). Thanks for your time in helping me to resolve this annoyance!<br />

            <p>A couple of general points. </p>
<ul>
<li>Blocked and safe senders lists are synchronized with the ones in use at mail.live.com for the Live ID you use to sign in with. Signing in or not thus may have&nbsp;a bearing on the lists in use.</li><li>These lists are also stored in the registry under the sub-key called <br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\PerPassportSettings<br />
Which of those lists is in use at any given time is a complete mystery, but one thing is sure: any third-party software that claims to optimize or defrag or clean up your registry is likely to interfere with the proper updating of the data under this sub-key.</li><li>Blocking senders works differently for HTTP and POP3 accounts. </li><li>The aim of blocking a sender is to keep messages from him out of the inbox. I can't see how this can ever work properly with any given&nbsp;IMAP account, because of the many different ways IMAP servers have of dealing with deleted messages.</li><li>There is also a mystical file in the store folder that contains rules for spam and safety. It's an XML file called SAS.Rule, and it's far from perfect. It supposedly governs the display of red and yellow nanny bars in messages.</li></ul>
<p>For all these reasons, I can't place any reliance on blocking senders. However, using the
<em>Safe List Only</em> option together with trusting mail from contacts seems to ensure that unwanted mail never arrives in my inbox. Regularly dealing with the
<em>Junk e-mail </em>folder finds any false negatives.</p>
<p>I don't remember seeing a message like <em>the sender is not in your contacts or allowed senders list.
</em>When does it appear?</p>
<p>I can't understand why you would ever end up <em>in situations where the contact was added to the Block Senders List.
</em>Contacts should by definition be trusted...&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my advice would be: forget about blocked senders and rely on <em>Safe List Only
</em>+ Contacts, and scrap any third-party 'security' software that does more than monitor viruses and other malware.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Thanks for the very informative reply, Noel.&nbsp; I was not aware of several of the things you have pointed out and am grateful to have gained more knowlege.&nbsp; I do indeed have an IMAP account integrated into this client (GMail), but I neglected to mention that
 none of the issues I've experienced with the Senders Lists have ever occurred with messages received by that address; only the 2 POP3 (RoadRunner) accounts &amp; the HTTP (Hotmail) account have exhibited this problem. First, let me answer the questions you posed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am always signed into the client when using it; I use the Windows Live Messenger feature of WLE2011 and have it set to start when I log into this (Standard) user account, which causes the Windows Live Mail program to initalize as well. (That, too, has
 problematical behavior, in that Windows Live Essentials 2011 will periodically forget what it has been directed to do and the sign-in dialog, with the appropriate credentials and it's "Remember me and sign in automatically" choice, will have to be invoked
 again.&nbsp; I attribute this issue as being likely due to a problem with Windows 7 Credential Manager, but I have not yet gained a wide enough understanding of that features' implementation to troubleshoot it; since I notice the same occasional "forgetfulness"
 with the web-based sign-in, this may be the root cause of all the problems I experience). Since I am signed in during usage of the client, I believe Windows Live Mesh should be syncing-up the local-host &amp; web-based v.'s of the Lists, but that does not appear
 to be the case for all situations...<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;"The sender is not in your contacts or allowed senders list" dialog is part of the "Unknown Sender" warning dialog invoked inside any e-mail not recognized as being from a sender that's a member of the Contacts and/or Safe Senders List; it is hidden by default
 but can be viewed by clicking the "down arrow" @ the right of the warning dialog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You're right about "I can't understand why you would ever end up in situations where the contact was added to the Block Senders List. Contacts should by definition be trusted..."; my postings were long, and I know that it can be hard to follow&nbsp; what I'm
 saying (another reason why I'm so grateful you've taken the time to read them---Thanks again!).&nbsp; What I was trying to say is that, indeed, "Contacts should by definition be trusted...", and that what I am experiencing, with some contacts in my list, is the
 exact opposite behavior.&nbsp; E-mail from some of the members of my contact list does not produce such trusted behavior; in these particular cases the client consistently invokes the "Unknown Sender" warning dialog for any message from the affected members of
 the list. The existence of this problem, along with the habit prevalent amongst many of the senders I deal with regularly of utilizing multiple and constantly-changing accounts (habits I find extremely common with some e-mail newsletter and social-media providers,
 for example), would seem to preclude the use of the "Safe List Only" junk-filtering option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As far as 3rd-Party possiblities being the culprit, I'd have to say that I don't use any "security" software beyond my AV/password manager program, Norton Internet Security 2012, occasional scans with Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware or Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy
 (which is integrated), and the passive blocking features of SpywareBlaster. I know a bit about Windows OS's, having used them since the 3.x days, and I learned long ago (the hard way, i.e. via the good ol' "School of Hard Knocks") NOT to allow 3rd-Party applications,
 other than those I just outlined, anywhere near the registry, as it was my experience that doing so usually caused more problems than it solved.&nbsp; I do use the latest v. of CCleaner on occasion to tidy up select items (usually, only Temporary Internet Files)
 , and every now &amp; then I'll actually run the "Reg-Clean" feature to VIEW what it thinks are problems, but my approach with anything so found is to decipher why these items were flagged and then implement solutions to what caused them to appear where such a
 solution is indicated and/or available; I never allow CCleaner or any other program to "clean" the registry.&nbsp; I have used the latest paid v. of AShampoo's Uninstaller utility, for the last ten years or so, to make before and after system snapshots for any
 &amp; all software I allow to be installed---even for Active X and other browser additions---and so am intimately familiar with the leftovers of poorly-written installation packages; my approach is to follow any and all of µSoft's recommendations concerning them---which
 I have found, more often than not, involves leaving well enough alone and ignoring so-called "registry problems". As I say, I long ago learned the folly of allowing a program to go about snipping things in the Registry willy-nilly.&nbsp; That said, since the problems
 with the Senders &amp; Contacts Lists I experience occur with both the local-machine &amp; the web-based v.'s of Windows Live Mail, I feel pretty sure 3rd Party software is unlikely to be the source of these issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've received a private reply requesting the Hotmail account info so it can be investigated, and will now await the results of that process.&nbsp; In the event that there is subsequently still no adequate resolution, I'm thinking that my approach will be to
 install an eval copy of W7 Enterprise in a VM running on Virtual PC, install the latest v. of WLM2011 in that, and make some comparisons.&nbsp; That of course was always an option for me, but I wanted to see what feed back I might get from the more knowledgeable
 folks to be found moderating these forums (such as yourself, Oberwald/Pegasus, and ITKNowledge24/Fisnik, to name those among the best that I've noticed),&nbsp; Thanks again for all your help &amp; especially for the knowledge you've imparted!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you receive an e-mail from a sender known to you but not yet&nbsp;listed in your contact list, please click the
<strong>Add contact </strong>link beside the name of the sender. All added senders are safe senders. The next time this contact sends an email to you, you should not see the Unknown sender/ Allow sender links anymore in the email.
</p>
<p>Now, if you have added the sender manually in the <strong>Options</strong>&gt;<strong>Safety Options</strong>&gt;<strong>Safe Senders</strong> tab, make sure that you also click
<strong>Apply</strong> and check the 2 boxes to <strong>Also trust email from my Contacts</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Automatically add people I email to the Safe Senders List.</strong></p>
<p>Observe this behavior after doing this and post back if you still have issues about adding contacts&nbsp;to your safe senders.</p>
<p>I've also made an adjustment to your account. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello Melanie_L</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate your time in attempting to help with this issue, but I'm sorry to report that it still exists.&nbsp;Unfortunately, none of the items you have so graciously highlighted are applicable to my particular issues; as I am a rather experienced user and
 well-versed in the intricacies of the initial set up of e-mail clients, I have had the "Also trust email from my Contacts" and "Automatically add people I email to the Safe Senders List" ticked (checked) ever since I performed the initial setup.&nbsp; As I am also
 observant&nbsp;of detail (having found it to be one of the best remedies for many operational errors in using computer programs), I ALWAYS look for an "execution directive" (i.e., an "Apply" button that's "active", or NOT "greyed out"; I have long-since learned
 that an "OK" button does not ALWAYS invoke the same operation as the "Apply" button) in any dialog box with which I happen to be interacting, and have thus been diligently using the "Apply" button in each and every instance of adding a sender to one of the
 two lists, Safe Senders and Blocked Senders.&nbsp; Following this correct procedure hasn't prevented the client from exhibiting the incorrect behaviors I listed in my original posting.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Also, as I pointed out in my original post, the faulty behavior I'm experiencing occurs with SOME senders who I HAVE ADDED to the Contacts List (but NOT, thankfully, with most of them, which are behaving as expected); for the senders with which I am experiencing
 this problem, I DO continue to see the Unknown sender/ Allow sender links in each new mail, every time I receive mail from that sender.&nbsp; In other words,
<u>DESPITE</u> that sender being present as a member of the Contacts List, and in some cases
<u>DESPITE</u> that sender also appearing as a member of the Safe Senders List as well, the client continually
<u>fails to recognize</u> the sender in question, and I get the Unknown sender/ Allow sender links in each and every&nbsp;e-mail from those senders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have noticed that the problem occurs, for some senders, both when I add the sender by using the "Add sender to contacts" link inside the pop-up dialog invoked by right-clicking the e-mail itself, or when I add the sender to the list by manually adding
 the information as a new contact. The default behavior for senders added to the Contacts List is, as you mention, "All added senders are safe senders"; the fact that this expected behavior is not applied by my WLM2011 client to some of the senders I have added
 to the Contacts and Safe Senders Lists is part of the problem behavior I am experiencing (as I originally stated, there are also problems with SOME senders that I have added to the Blocked Senders List, or in SOME cases, remembered: see the list of issues
 in the original post).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; Again, I appreciate your time in this regard, and I look forward to a resolution of the incorrect behavior I am experiencing with the recalcitrant Senders &amp; Contacts Lists of my WLM2011 e-mail client.&nbsp; Have a grand day!</p>

            <p>Hello Caroline_Ta</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention in the matter of my "annoyance" (I've started&nbsp;calling it the "Lists glitch", as it has to do with the Contacts, Safe, &amp; Block Senders lists...).&nbsp; To answer your particular question, I find that the problems are
<em><u>not</u></em>&nbsp;"domain-specific"; the issues occur with all manner of senders from multiple domains.&nbsp; I'm still focusing on Windows Live Mesh as the culprit here, and plan to do more research on whether the plethora of "...Zone_Chk platformservice.cpp:364
 ERROR:"" failed with 0x80004004. ..." and "...Zone_MailChk ERROR: (booktree.cpp:8411), failed with 0x80040064..." errors that fill the Windows Live Mail log are associated with problems concerning Windows Live Mesh.&nbsp; I might add that something I've&nbsp;remembered
 since my last posting is that I long ago set the startup for the Windows Live Mesh remote connections service (wlcrasvc.exe) to "Disabled", as I do not use the service with any account on this computer, and it has neither any system component dependencies
 nor or are there any services that depend on it (according to the properties sheet as invoked within the services.msc main viewer); I thought that despite what the afore-mentioned service's property sheet indicates, the disabling of&nbsp;Windows Live Mesh remote
 connections service&nbsp;might be affecting Windows Live Mesh (wlsync.exe) operation, but I have not mangaed to confirm that as of yet.&nbsp; I plan to check the status of the Windows Live Mesh service (I'm thinking I'll go to
<a href="https://devices.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://devices.live.com/</a>&nbsp;and see what that has to say) as I truly believe my issues may be associated with Windows Live Mesh problems...</p>

            <p>Hi Torey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly&nbsp;reply to the following questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Is&nbsp;the issue confined to a single&nbsp;video or&nbsp;all the videos?</p>
<p>2. Which media player you use to watch videos? </p>
<p>3. If you have more than one media player, did you verify if the video plays correctly on other media&nbsp;players?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to update&nbsp;Graphics card driver and check if the issue is resolved.
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong><strong>Update the&nbsp;graphics card&nbsp;driver.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and click on
<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2.&nbsp;Expand the <strong>Display Adapter</strong><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the&nbsp;graphics card&nbsp;driver and&nbsp;click
<strong>Update driver software</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><strong> Uninstall and then reinstall the&nbsp;graphics card&nbsp;driver.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and click on
<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2.&nbsp;Expand the <strong>Display Adapter.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the&nbsp;graphics card&nbsp;driver and&nbsp;click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;Restart the computer, let Windows detect the driver and install by itself.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would&nbsp;recommend you to refer to the article by Andre Da Costa and&nbsp;try the mentioned steps.</p>
