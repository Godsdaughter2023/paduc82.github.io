            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Why do you edit registry?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; What was the exact error messages you get at start-up?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Do you receive the same error message now also?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Which Windows Update was installed recently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Iastor.sys is the Intel RAID controller driver. I would suggest you to run System File Check (SFC) scans and checks if it helps.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows
 7</strong></a></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:
</strong>System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder
 (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators
 group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the
<b>sfc /scannow</b>, the <b>sfc /scanonce</b>, or the <b>sfc /scanboot</b> commands to repair its contents.</span></p>

            <p>When performing the upgrade process the upgrade assistant determines your existing architecture, downloads the same architecture and installs.</p>
<p>To change from 32bit Windows to 64bit Windows a clean install will be performed (will have to reinstall applications etc…) and it will be necessary to purchase Windows 8 as a DVD.</p>
<p>Below is a web page that has additional information regarding Windows 8 </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>Upgrade to Windows 8</u></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>32-bit versus 64-bit</b></p>
<p><i>I have a PC running 32-bit Windows XP Pro. It has a 64-bit processor, but after upgrading, I found the 32-bit version installed.</i></p>
<p>As you discovered, the Windows download from Microsoft matches the system from which you initiate the download. So if you purchase the download on a system running 32-bit Windows, your downloaded setup file will also be 32-bit.</p>
<p>But there’s an easy (and legal) way to get a 64-bit downloader, as long as you have access to a PC running any 64-bit version of Windows (including Windows 8).</p>
<p>After you complete the purchase, you will receive an email confirmation that includes a product key and a download link.
<em><b>From a 64-bit PC,</b> </em>click that download link and enter the product key you received. The download will commence, and when it finishes, you will have a 64-bit Windows installer that you can save as an ISO or burn to bootable media.</p>
<p><i>How do I get to 64 bit from 32 bit Windows?</i></p>
<p>There is no way to upgrade from a 32-bit copy of Windows to 64-bit, or vice versa. You must backup your data, create bootable media, and do a clean install. After you’re done, you’ll need to reinstall your programs and restore your data.</p>

            <p>You've got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a load of B.S. Thanks for wasting my time and making me regret doing business with you [MS]. Once again, I regret it greatly. And when I do manage to finally get the 64bit iso downloaded, MS will probably want to know why I've activated two win8's so
 close together. God I regret giving MS my money.</p>

<h3> peggie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer on wireless network goes offline</h2>
                    We have a&nbsp;wireless home network with&nbsp;some XP and some Vista computers.&nbsp; The printers are on a Hawking Technologies print server.&nbsp; We can define and access the printers on all computers.&nbsp; However, after a certain amount of time passes, the Vista computers
 show the server printers as 'offline'.&nbsp; This does not happen on the XP computers.&nbsp; The only remedies are to re-boot the Vista computers or drop and re-define the printers.&nbsp; Is there some setting that I have missed that will maintain the connection to the print
 server?&nbsp; If not, is there some command that will re-connect to the print server without having to reboot?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Hi Peggie,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;We would like to get a little more information to better help troubleshoot your issue.&nbsp; Please answer the following questions as best you can.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>What is the model number of the print server?&nbsp; You might want to try installing a firmware upgrade to it.
</li><li>Does this happen on the Windows Vista PCs during inactivity or while in use? </li><li>Are the Windows Vista PCs going into standby or hibernation mode before the issue occurs?
</li><li>Are the Windows Vista PCs updated with Service Pack 1?</li></ul>
<p>Please try running the following commands on one of the Windows Vista when the issue occurs and see if the printer comes back online afterwards<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Click the <strong>Start</strong> orb, and type <strong>cmd</strong> in the <strong>
Start Search</strong> box </li><li>&nbsp;Right-click <strong>cmd</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list and select
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> </li><li><strong>&nbsp; i</strong><span>f you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<b>Continue</b></span> </li><li>&nbsp;At the command prompt, type the following commands&nbsp;and press<strong> Enter</strong> after each one</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>net stop spooler<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>net start spooler<br />
</strong><br />
This will stop and restart the print spooler service.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this resolves the issue of your printer being offline, please let us know.</p>

 that this is a valid Windows Installer package.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The connection to a Router is a Network connection.</p>
<p>In your case the Network consists on two devices the Router, and your computer</p>
<p>Your computer has to be configured with a Valid Network card, and be connected to the Router with Ethernet Cable, or Wireless (if so equipped).</p>
<p>Maybe this can Help, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Setting-up-a-home-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I appreciate your info. however you might not have understood my question. When (in Windows7) I select to setup an internet connection i get two chopices in the CONNECT TO THE INTERNET screen !- Broadband (PPPOE) 2- DIALUP i select Broadband since i am
 on Verizon FIOS service the procedure progresses until i get to the CONNECT TO THE INTERNET screen which is where the problem occurs, I.E. it always attempts to create a connection via the WAN MINIPORT which always fails as i am not using a dialup connection
 via the miniport. My question is still. How do i create an internet connection using my verizon router without the wan miniport becoming involved. Thanks for all help and info.

<p>took your suggestion, contacted Verizon, &nbsp;the tech i chatted with could not grasp my problem and accused me of trying to reconfigure the router and suggested i contact the provider</p>
<p>whom i thought was Verizon since its their equipment. anyway i gave up on getting an answer from him. I am still waiting for someone to explain to me how in Windows 7 when</p>
<p>an internet connection is setup how it gives you two choices 1-Broadband (PPPOE) 2- Dialup. and when i select number 1 it then limits my connection to the WAN MINIPORT</p>
<p>which has nothing to do with Cable or Broadband. Other people must be using a router to connect to Verizon Fios beside me. As further info I am trying to create another</p>
<p>internet connection as i have a problem I trying to troubleshoot, I.E. when computer powered on, it takes 1-2 minutes for internet connection to be established, so was wanting</p>
<p>to see if problem was in way i was connecting to internet, Router or Windows 7 (since its newly installed on computer) Thanks to all for your suggestions and if anyone has an answer i appreciate to hear ir.</p>

<p>Generally, at least with my AT&amp;T DSL service all I have to do is to connect my laptop Ethernet port to the Ethernet port on my DSL modem and I connect. All DSL PPPoE login is configured on the modem. The same with my cable ISP, ie. Cox HSI,&nbsp;and modem at
 home although in that case there is no login information required.</p>

<p>it is FIOS and as i stated above Verizon tech support people whom i had a loong chat with do not understand what I am asking them, The tech i talked with said Verizon does not support what i am trying to accomplish and suggested i was trying to reconfigure
 their routere to do something it was not designed to do and also suggested i contact the "supplier"whom i thought was Verizon since its&nbsp;their equipment, and&nbsp;no instructions were given whan it was setup, simply connecting the router to cable and then connecting
 the computer to the router lets Windows 7 setup an internet connection. the problem occurs when i attempt to setup an internet connection. I have an internet connection i would like to create another different connection that i know is setup to use BROADBAND.
 thanks for your info.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am afraid that you do not grasp correctly the concept of FIOS (and broadband connection).</p>
<p>When you have FIOS, you are all the time connected to active Internet.</p>
<p>The output of the FIOS Modem/Router is a local Network Ethernet output that has to be connected to the computer through the Network card.</p>
<p>Once the card (Network adapter) is connected and configured, you are on the Internet, just start the Browser (IE).</p>
<p>This site has pages with entry-level info about the subject. It was written during Win XP era but the priciples are still the same.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net</a></p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>To check a computer wire connection.</strong></p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>Try to install the latest drivers of the card from the support page of the&nbsp; manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Download the drivers and unpack them to a folder of your choice.<br />
<br />
In the Device manger, right click on the adapter.<br />
<br />
Click on Update Drivers, and choose the Browse my computer for drivers, <br />
<br />
Choose let me pick from a list, Click on&nbsp; Have a Disk and point to the folder with the Drivers.<br />
-------------------------------------</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Local Area Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are connected (few more will be even better).<br />
<br />
Switch Off the computer and the Router, Reboot the Router, and the computer.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><strong>On IP status.</strong> <br />
<br />
TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.<br />
<br />
Typical TCP/IP status looks like this.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Description</strong> is the card manufacturing data.<br />
<strong><br />
Physical address</strong> is the card's MAC number.<br />
<br />
The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).<br />
<br />
yy should be from 0 to 255<br />
<br />
zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.<br />
<br />
<strong>The lease date</strong> should be valid to the current time.<br />
<strong><strong><br />
*Note 1.</strong> IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>*Note 2.</strong> There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>Also Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called
 the Trusted Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled)</strong> . If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic.
 If the 3rd party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>

            ok thanks for the info. now lets boil it down to my basic question which is: Why does Windows 7 limit the broadband connection to the WAN MINIPORT? I am connected to the internet so there's no problem with getting on-line. Why can't i setup a broadband
 connection in Windows 7&nbsp; correctly? I had so such problems in Vista or&nbsp; windows XP, only in Windows 7.

<p><span><b>Create A System Image In Windows 7</b> </span></p>
<p><span>After you install and activate Windows 7 create a system image as a backup for your current computer in case you ever need to reinstall it. This will restore your computer to it's exact state when the image was made - that will save you the trouble
 of having to reinstall Windows 7 and everything currently installed again, and it takes much less time to do.

<p>i bought forza 4 before i bought a new xbox. so naturally, i downloaded the car pack and track pack codes that came with the game onto my "old" console. then i bought my "new" console. i had issues with my email and xbox live account from my "old" xbox,
 so i created a new email, and xbox live account for my new xbox. now, everything was going great! till i realised, i dont have the benchmark test track pack. now, the only way i have found to get this pack, is to have a code from the box. i DO have this code,
 but, its been used. on my "old" xbox. i talked to microsoft, they said i basically need to recover my old account in order to play those tracks on my "new" xbox. so i went threw the steps, and managed to recover my "old" account to my "new" xbox and downloaded
 the track pack onto my "new" xbox.&nbsp;haha, problem solved! NOT!!! see, i have started a new career on my "new" xbox. so, i need to access that track ON MY NEW ACCOUNT! it says on the forza 4 .... menu. that " CONTENT NOT AVAILABLE. this is exclusive content
 and can not be purchesed at this time" ..... grrr. so, my question is. how in the (bad word here) do i get benchmark test track on my new profile on my new xbox when i have already used my code on my old profile on my old xbox......?</p>

<h2>            Microphone super quiet</h2>
                    <p>So Ive tried everything from reinstalling the driver to searching google people seem to not have this issue atleast not the same as me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My microphone is on a headset but i plugged the headset into the headset slot the computer never understood that it was a Headset/Microphone so i plugged the headset into the Microphone slot and got another headset and plugged it into the headset slot after
 that didnt fix the issue i gave up and ended up moving the Mic/Headset into the pink jack in the back of my computer and left the other headset in the headset slot but my issue is no matter what i do my microphone is super quiet and when i boost it. It becomes
 a car horn up to your ear that sounds like its in a tunnel how do i fix this or am i in a Pickle??? and what i mean is it boosts my voice but it becomes super loud and at the same time i sound like im in a tunnel&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Limewire Pro 5.4.6 not connecting</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Vista Home Premium SP2 to Windows 7 Ultimate. I have Limewire Pro 5.4.6, but when the program opens, it says it had a medium connection, but cannot connect to any peers. My computer is wired directly to my router and i have high
 speed internet. My windows firewall and third-party virus protection all allow Limewire Pro to connect. I have tried running Limewire Pro in Vista SP2 compatibility and reinstalled the program after the upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate.

            Hello Willee,<br />
<br />
Limewire should work fine on Windows 7, check out if the machine running windows 7 has a compatible version of Java Runtime engine installed. Looking at the link below will give you more idea about it ( this is important because Limewire is&nbsp;basically developed
 using Java&nbsp;Applet technology)&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.limewire.com/support/check_versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.limewire.com/support/check_versions</a><br />
<br />
You may as well&nbsp;try doing steps below to see if it helps.<br />
1. open the folder <strong>%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\LimeWire<br />
</strong>2. <strong>Delete the file gnutella.net</strong>.<br />
3. Restart LimeWire and it should download a new peers list.<br />
4. The file gnutella.net is automatically recreated when you exit LimeWire.<br />
<br />
More support about this could be provided by your manufacturer - <a href="http://www.limewire.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span><span>Good Day!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We would like to confirm does it happen to one contact only or to your multiple contacts? Does your contact can receive your send messages
 or not? </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Because based on our analysis it seems that the issue is with the other person and not on your end. With that you may advise your contact
 to do some troubleshooting like uninstall and reinstall the Skype app from his/her device.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, kindly reply to this thread.

            Hi Sandeep.
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Calls from Skype to landline or mobiles require skype credit or subscription, so yes they are chargeable. Do you have either Skype credit or Subscription?
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA331/what-are-the-different-types-of-skype-subscriptions-and-pay-as-you-go-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA331/what-are...</a>
<br />
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

            Hi
<br />
<br />Unfortunately there is no such option available today.
<br />
<br />The thing that was always free was Skype to Skype calls, to call a mobile or landline from Skype, you need a little Skype Credit or a subscription. 
<br />
<br />You can find official Skype / Microsoft information on this here:

            Free calling would be a promotion, not a policy. Since that long-term promotion was removed from the site in the past day or so, it would seem that promotion has ended.

<p>Yes! There is a new update now. Calls to US and Canada were free though till the last few months but they have started implementing charges for calling any mobile phone or a landline numbers for these locations as well. No free service now😛&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worried?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I have an option for you . Use Google hangouts for calling and regain your free access of calling to these countries once again 😇😇</p>

<p>Ok a very important question since it causes 99.9% of issues With 360 games</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your account regoon match your actual region? If it doesnt thats why</p>
<p>Most cod games are region locked</p>
<p>For the best experience with xbox live your account region MUST match your actual region</p>
<p>Howwver iF you dont live in a xbox live region it wont work</p>
<p>You can change this at xbox.com and manage your account and change region to your actual region this can only be changed every 3months and changing to random regions wonk</p>
<p>If you dont live in a xbox live region it will never work</p>
<p>
</p><p>US foreign bases dont count as the us YOU must use the local host or use a dod connection or satilite internet from the US</p>
<p>If you using a vpn or google dns you must use your ISP dns and dhcp server</p>

<h2>            GG&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Articles</h2>
                    
<p>I was recently inspired by a post I made about trash talking so I ended up writing not one, but two articles that I would like to share with you guys in the hopes that it will help make your gaming experience a better experience. Be warned, however, what
 follows is essentially a wall of text - but if you can stomach it, it will be well worth the effort. I would like for you to share your opinions and ideas on both articles and discuss them here with everyone else. Enjoy and discuss! :)</p>
<p>[quote user="Article #1"]<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Trash Talking and Good Sportsmanship in Competitive Video Games<br />
</strong></span><em>written by Galactic Geek</em></p>
<p>Video games are largely played by people of all ages for two reasons: (1) for fun and (2) to compete; sometimes both. Unfortunately, for many people, they lose the ability to have fun because others can take competing too far. When gamers get competitive,
 they often forget about having fun and will often try to do anything and everything they can to win, including trash talking. While there is nothing wrong with wanting to win (after all, there is not a person in the world who would actively enjoy losing for
 the sake of losing), it pays dividends to be careful in how it is done, because if done right, the competition can ramp up to unparalleled heights that can never be achieved from talking trash.</p>
<p>Talking trash, in essence, is a negative interaction. Even if a player meant it in good jest, it can still have unintentional negative ramifications towards others. Despite its negative connotation, millions of gamers world-wide make use of it. But why would
 they do this? The answer is simple: it is an effective strategy. Long before video games were invented, talking trash was used the world over in sports and other similar activities (and still is even now) to get inside of the opponent’s head and cause doubt
 in their abilities. This in turn, would give the taunting player an inherent advantage. It was used as a way to shake their confidence.</p>
<p>An unfortunate side-effect of this strategy, however, is the long-lasting effects and implications it can have on its victim. Even though the trash talking occurred in the limited virtual world of the video game, many gamers may be adversely affected beyond
 the game session long after it’s over and can lead to serious stress and depression as a result. It is for this reason that talking trash is considered negative and inherently dangerous.</p>
<p>Instead of talking trash directly to another player, a good idea might be to make a joke about the game itself. Take note of what is in the game and make a pun, for example. If you can get your opponent to laugh, you can still have the same affect that trash
 talking has by way of distraction, but without the negative ramifications of ruining their fun. In fact, because they will be having fun, they may want to continue playing, even if they lose. This in turn helps solve another problem: rage-quitting – and that
 is a whole other can of worms.</p>
<p>Showing good sportsmanship is the key to ensuring everyone has fun and is at their best. If you take the time to be polite and show respect towards your fellow players, you may find that the positive benefits far outweigh the negative benefits you may get
 from trash talking.</p>
<p>The idea behind competition is to see who is best at something – a test of skill. When trash talking is introduced however, it does not involve skill at all – it involves under-handed manipulation. Rather than resorting to that kind of behavior, however,
 rely on your own merit instead. If you are truly better than the other player, than let your actions speak for you, not the other way around. If you let your words speak for you and then lose, you will only come off as pompous, arrogant, and/or a jerk. However,
 if you show good sportsmanship and win through skill alone, not only will you have gained the respect of your opponent, but you just might make a friendly rival out of them. After all, many gamers will agree that a close game is the best way to play. If you
 win by a landslide, it can be fun, but only for so long before boredom sets in. However, if you lose by a large margin, then it will not feel fair to the losing player(s).</p>
<p>A good way of showing good sportsmanship after a game is to discuss the matchup with your opponent - share tips and advice with your opponent after you beat them. For example, you can tell them how you were able to beat them in the 1<sup>st</sup> place by
 (politely) pointing out what they did wrong and how to fix it. This gives you 2 benefits: (1) it helps the other player improve and get better and (2) it forces you to change your strategy and make you a better player in turn. In doing this, your opponent
 will appreciate the advice and have even greater respect for you as a player and a person. It is a win-win for everyone involved.</p>
<p>So the next time you play a competitive video game with someone, make a change for the better – do this and you will be surprised at how much better you will become, how many more friends you will make, how much more you will be appreciated, how much more
 you will win, and most important of all – how much fun you will have. After all, that is why video games were invented! To have fun![/quote]</p>
<p>[quote user="Article #2"]<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><span>Rage Quitting and How to Lose Advantageously<br />
</span></strong></span><em><span>written by Galactic Geek</span></em></p>
<p>When it comes to competitive video games, you will lose – it is a simple fact. As they say, there is always somebody better than you. Despite this fact, it is important to remember that even if you lose, you can lose with an advantage.</p>
<p>Many gamers today are by and large emotional beings and will lash out in some way or even try and avoid losing altogether. This unfortunately has the side effect of players often quitting early and/or rage quitting. Quitting early, as the name implies, is
 simply quitting the game before it is over. Rage quitting, on the other hand, is a bit more serious and complicated because it is the act of not only quitting early, but doing so in a fit of anger.</p>
<p>Both quitting early and rage-quitting are frowned upon by most gamers. Doing either interrupts the flow of the game for all players involved. It might be a quick, simple, and easy solution for the person who decides to leave the game, but the ramifications
 are significant. If the video game in question is a team game, it leaves 1 team short-handed and at a disadvantage, which in turn affects the fun the other players on that team may be having.</p>
<p>Another form of quitting early is literally walking away from the game (but not leaving the virtual game itself). This has the unfortunate circumstance of not only leaving the team short-handed as above, but depending on the type of game, may even prevent
 other players from joining the game and otherwise taking the vacant players spot. While the opponents may appreciate the gesture, most players will not.</p>
<p>Rage quitting is very serious. Although it is a quick solution, it is only a temporary one, and will never permanently fix the problem. When it happens, it can create a domino effect. If you rage quit, it becomes a habit, and not a good one. If you lose
 constantly, you will start to rage quit more often and start to become angry every time you start to lose, even before the game is over. This will affect your concentration and become a self-fulfilling prophecy and turn losing into a constant reality. If you
 let this happen, you may find yourself never having fun with playing video games and eventually giving up the hobby altogether.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, everyone loses. There is no avoiding it – it will happen. So how can you go about making the experience better for yourself? Thankfully, there are two solutions: (1) stay calm and (2) use the loss as a learning experience.</p>
<p>Video games are designed to be fun. If it starts to affect your emotions negatively, then it will cease to be fun. For this reason it is important to remember to keep your emotions in check. It is incredibly important to remember that, in the end, it is
 just a game – not the end of the world as we know it. If you lose and are not happy with the outcome, do not lash out at other players or quit early – doing so will only ruin the other players’ fun. If you have to, become a Vulcan and shut down your emotions
 entirely. Of course, taking a deep breath will also probably help.</p>
<p>Once you have kept your emotions in check, you can think rationally (like a Vulcan). This is where you can take the negativity of a loss and turn it into a benefit. Rather than ruminating on how bad the game was, think about why you lost. Think back on the
 events that took place and start asking yourself questions: What did I do wrong? What could I have done differently or better? Even if you honestly think you did your best, you can still ask yourself questions: What did my opponent do that worked for them?
 How can I use that to my advantage? In taking the time to ask and eventually answer these questions, you will start a domino effect, like with rage quitting, but this domino effect is all positive. If you take the time to rationalize and work your way around
 the problems that are presented from losing, you will become a better player. If you become a better player, you lose less. If you lose less, you have more fun.</p>
<p>So the next time you lose, take a deep breath and instead of saying, “ah man! I can’t believe I lost!” say, “well, I suppose that could’ve gone better - but how?” If you can remember to do that, you are likely to find that your whole (virtual gaming) world
 will change for the better.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe I should start a blog or something. What do you guys think?</p>

<p>COD and fifa seem to be the worst for both, gloating if winning, and quitting and cursing if losing.</p>

<p>I know many of my friends kind of trash talk a little. Even tho several of them are sensible in real life. 99.99% of the time I don't swear. And if so it's not done in a mean way and in an invite only party. It's highly more common in young peps to do so.
</p>
<p>Quitting. Yes many do so especially in Halo and COD Black Ops 2 (and sometimes Forza 5). I do it sometimes too either because it's late or have to do something else or American's come into our Australian/NZ lobbies at way past their bedtimes, usually during
 our evenings, (Australia is only 2 hours behind NZ time) and demonstrate poor teamwork they're the host and the rest of us get a bad connection, or vis versa. I know some Australians and NZ's who will not ready up unless there are no American's in the lobby.
 This is because if an American is playing, either we get a bad connection, or they do, and it's simply not what we want after a long day of school or work. You'll be surprised how fast time goes when you're having fun. Another is unsporting. In fact I get
 marked down in my 360 rep for unsporting and quitting early. Not everyone sticks strictly to the objective of the game. It is a game after all and sometimes want to have some reasonable fun even if it means going off on a tangent. But still have good rep overall.
</p>
<p>In general I'm a nice polite good person. It doesn't mean that I'm a perfectionist tho. Ask any of my friends if I grief or steal in Minecraft. They'll all nod their heads no. Just because I 1% of the time dish out a little trash talk in a private party
 or quit sometimes in games doesn't mean I'm breaching any Xbox rules laid by M. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; First thing I have to say...boy do you have a lot of free time on your hands :). &nbsp;The fundamental point to remember is video games are a false reality. People play them for many reasons and for their own agendas. Some for stress relief, some for empowerment,
 and other to escape the fact they can be something in a virtual world that they cannot be in real life.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In article one I think it is a bit strong to call someone a "victim". Trash talking is a part of life. Does that make it right? In some instances yes and others no. Trash talking can drive competition. If it turns into a personal attack, then it has
 gone too far. People need to grow thicker skins. As I have been around for quite some time and have seen many different cultures and generations, I believe now our younger generation takes things too much to heart. We are raising a generation of sissies. We
 do not encourage them to deal with their own problems, but try to solve it for them. That is where the inherent problem lies with any long lasting effects . Just about every aspect of society plays a role in this.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Article 2.... Rage quitters are funny to me. It is a game. Why get so flustered at it you want to throw down your controller and walk away? To address your point at the quitters that just seem to walk away. In my world, real life takes precedence; period.
 If that means leaving in the middle of a game, so be it. I can always restart later. It happens. The sad fact is those on the other end do not see what is happening and speculate why the person left, and more often than not think they quit for no reason.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of the day it's just a game. We can always start over. Don't worry about the stats; they are just numbers. We want to be able to play in a fun and non threatening place, but that is a utopia that will not likely ever exist.</p>

<p>Not going to lie, I didn't read either article, but I get the jist of what they are about.</p>
<p>I play a fair whack of video games and really haven't experienced much trash talk or rages quitters. I don't take any of it personally, I don't live for a high KD, some games I top the and boards others I will be at the bottom.
</p>
<p>Winning is kewl, but If I am in the mood to lay in a bush and snipe for an entire round of BF4 knowing full well I will only get a handful of kills I will do it.</p>
<p>If dudes wanna Tea Bag me after killing me, I don't mind, who don't like tea anyways? &nbsp; ;)</p>
<p>In summary, I play for my own enjoyment, rage quit, get angry, abuse me, I dont mind... as long as there are folks for me to bust caps into their domes I am happy!</p>

<p>What's more worse than lightly trash talking and sometimes quitting, is modding/hacking and peps who exploit game bugs.
</p>
<p>Light trash talking and sometimes quitting isn't going to end. I'd be lying if I said I never did it. Every one of us is unique, we aren't robots. I understand it can get annoying sometimes. To me there is a difference between rage quitting, and quitting.
 Rage quitting is when someone rages, then quits, and quitting is when someone doesn't want to be in the game. It is wrong to force someone to have to stay in the game. This is why Microsoft doesn't penalize you for carrying out such an action.
</p>
<p>Not everyone strictly plays to the objective of a game. Sometimes they may want to have some reasonable fun. It is a game after all, not an exam.
</p>
<p>Xbox is meant to be a fun thing to do in our free time. Some peps are good at behaving themselves, others not as much, but you can't always expect perfection out of anyone.
</p>
<p>I'm glad you haven't been a party with some of my other friends. 1 of them she was like an angel, until something went wrong in Minecraft then she started raging and swearing and killing that I really wanted to kick her out of my game and party and was being
 nasty to other friends both mine and hers and almost felt like a need to file a complaint. 3 of my friends defriended her and I understand why, yet she always tends to be nice to me.
</p>
<p>We should all try to be considerate of each other. But you shouldn't expect perfection.</p>

<p>Interpersonal relationships require a certain amount of "thick skin." &nbsp;IMHO as long as mothers aren't brought into play (take that imagination) I am fine with a little trash talk. &nbsp;However I am not opposed to not trash talking when the recipient is not feeling
 up to it. &nbsp;I must admit I maybe read one sentence of the above.</p>

<p>Thank you for the replies, guys! For those of you who didn't take the time to read the articles, you're missing out on a good read. ;)</p>
<p>Some of you make good points, some of which I anticipated. For example, saying that players need to grow a thicker skin. I can partially agree with that sentiment. I think that a lot of players have to realize that yes, it is just a game and when someone
 takes it seriously enough to start hurting other players' feelings, then the so-called victim needs to detach themselves from that situation and say to themselves "I play games to relax and have fun and will not allow an emotionally out of control person to
 take control of that." However, it's more important for the attacking player to realize this. In life, many things need to be taken seriously - video games, however, are not one of them (unless, of course, you happen to be a professional gamer).</p>
<p>Some of you brought up the idea of real life taking precedent over gaming and that that is why many gamers quit early. It should be obvious that real life is more important than playing a game - that is an undeniable fact. When it comes to quitting early,
 I personally don't mind if someone has to leave if something comes up such as needing to go to work or school, do homework or chores, or to spend time with friends and/or family. That stuff is important and should be seen as such. However, I think that the
 person leaving the game needs to be courteous enough to take the few seconds of time to let the other players know that they are leaving and why. This way the other players aren't left in the dark wondering. For example, I eat dinner with my family every evening
 to discuss the day's events. I tell my friends when I leave to do this every night and they've grown accustomed to it as a result.</p>
<p>As far as rage quitting goes, it is never okay for the reasons stated above - if you let your emotions get out of control over something that is supposed to be considered fun and/or a hobby, where else might you lose control of your emotions that might be
 a more serious life-impacting moment? If you're not careful, losing yourself can cause you or someone else to end up hurt, in jail, or even dead.</p>
<p>For those of you who took the time to read my articles, I just wanted to say thank you for doing so and I sincerely hope that you take something from them and share the common sense knowledge I have expounded upon you with others as you keep it in mind.
 For those of you who shared your opinions, I also would like to thank you for expanding upon the subject matter and broadening the other side of the issues that may not have been as present in the articles. For those of you who didn't read the articles, I
 urge yet again to please do so. It only looks like a long read, but really isn't. Besides, if you're going to let something as simple as a few words on a page stop you, what else in life are you going to let stop you? If you have to, break it down into smaller
 parts (I even separated the paragraphs for you).</p>
<p>I hope to hear more responses from others, so if you haven't yet participated in this discussion, please do so as everyone is welcome to do so. :)</p>

<p>IMO</p>
<p>Firstly you have to define competetive.....to me competitive games are leagues, ladders, inter clans, clan v clans, anything where both sides know they are playing for a goal agreed by each other before hand.</p>
<p>Public lobbies in objective team games are not competitive, and as such cannot have the same rules and regulations.</p>
<p>I also thing GG has glossed over the reasons why people play, there are a lot more reasons than that, and one persons fun, is another persons loath.</p>
<p>There are millions of levels of trash talk, from very personal to friendly banter, personally i think its down the education, theres a thing called a mute button, and the amount of people that seem to refuse to use it is truly astonishing, people seem to
 think they have the right to talk to people online however they want and not have any consequences, the sad thing is, there are very little consequences, and very few companies willing to take a stand.</p>
<p>Rage quiting.......rage quiting is a term for ego's to feel good about themselves, &nbsp;anyone can quit when they like, it might surprise people but its a game, if I am in the park playing with my mates, I can leave when i want, if I am a board game with my
 family, I can stop when I want.</p>
<p>A lot can be built into the game developement, eg if you don't quit games often be put with other people who don't quit often, if your verbally abusive in lobbies put them with other verbally abusive people in the lobby, build in effective ways to quit and
 resign games, offer areas for more competitive type game play and design them properly.</p>
<p>TBH the topic is to complex to reply without some real thought and a lot of writing, but thats enough for now.</p>

<h2>            0x80040900</h2>
                    <p>Lots of people talking about this code... Mine just started doing this yesterday (6 Feb 2018). Soft reboot&nbsp;gives code repeatedly. Hard reboot loads a game (either Halo 5 or Minecraft) but if I go to change a game, it gives a gray screen that says it cannot complete the request. I am hard wired to router. Hard reset and unplug works to start a game but changing game is when I get this code (0x80040900). If it matters, we play the new Minecraft rather than the Xbox one edition. Though if it's the cross compatibility that is causing this then I can go back to xbox one edition. I just like being able to put in a seed that works.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please advise if there is a more permanent solution as hard rebooting every time is a pain in the ****!</p>

<p>
</p><p>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go to control panel and check your user account status. Right click on the start button and select control panel in the menu. In the control panel, click on the 'view by' option in the top right and select 'large icons'. Now, click
 on 'User accounts' and check if your account is listed as Administrator. If it is not displayed as Admin account, click on the option 'Change user account type' and select 'Administrator' and apply changes. Try these steps and let us know the results. If you
 have already tried, please let us know what all troubleshooting steps you have tried so far, so that we can provided you suggestion accordingly.</p>

            I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; After upgrading I sign in with my Microsoft Account ID/password and couldn't open, edit files or even open some applications.&nbsp; I looked all around at every option under User Accounts.&nbsp; My Account said it was the Administrator.&nbsp;
 My husband then told me about changing it to logging in as a Local Account.&nbsp; I did that.&nbsp; I'm still having problems editing quite a few files.&nbsp; I can't open some Word or Excel files.&nbsp; Pretty frustrating.

            <p>Same problem for me as EB 's original post, as we don't have administrative rights, and therefore cannot open the User Account Control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FR/RG/LU appear to have a slightly different problem to EB and I as they can access the user Account Control and have administrator rights, but problems with certain programmes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent two days trying to find solution to this without success, and I still cannot access the user account panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone says log into User Account Control to correct it. They don't seem to understand that if you have no admin rights you cannot access UAC as the button is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like the only solution is to go back to Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UPDATE TO ORIGINAL POST</span></p>
<p>Having decided to give up on Windows 10 I decided to&nbsp;roll back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what....As I do not have administrator rights I don't appear to have the option to go back to Windows 7</p>

            The bug prevents me from adding a user, changing settings, etc. I get unhelpful error messages such as "Something has gone wrong" and one that says something about waiting for snap-ins to respond (or something like that). It was working fine for about
 a week, and then yesterday (15 August) it blew up. The first indication was when it said it couldn't access my Outlook email (Although my Mozilla Thunderbird still can). I tried a couple fixes noted in these forums. One from the command prompt said I could
 only run it as an administrator, which, of course, I am but it doesn't seem to know that.<br />

            Update. Somehow, this seems to have now fixed itself. At least I think so.<br />

            <p>Has anyone found the solution? I am having the same problem today - and now the biggest joke is that I just paid £5.99 to install Office and my subscription started two hours ago, while I struggle to enter my admin password and say 'Yes' to changes being
 made. I even resetted everything and reloaded Windows 10.</p>
<p>I need help! Please.</p>
