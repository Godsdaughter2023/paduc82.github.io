<h2>            Some of my contact images have changed to other contact users and it was not me or the user that did this.</h2>
                    <p>Some of the images for my Skype contacts have changed to OTHER contact users. To be clear - in the recent chats menu and in the actual chat of those contacts, the image of that contact has changed to another contact image. But only 17 of them. Some of them
 are contacts I have spoken with today but others I've not spoken to in a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's even weirder is that if you go into that contact profile, I'll see their actual/original image. But&nbsp;when I press on that profile image, the strange new image will pop up for a moment but then their original image will appear. And it'll happen again
 and again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the images of every one of the contacts that I chat with, as I chat with them often during the week. So, ContactA&nbsp;has the profile image of ContactB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I said, this has only happened with about 17 of my many contacts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am NOT signed into the wrong account - the users have NOT changed their images to other users - nor have I changed the images. The images have changed ON THEIR OWN. I think the description of the strange occurrence would indicate as such.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched profusely on search engines and can find nothing close to this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and changed my password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea about this?</p>

                    I have Windows XP.&nbsp; Recently, this message appeared when I tried to save my Word documents : "Word cannot complete the save due to a file permission error."&nbsp; I can still eventally save it via a temporary file, but this is very messy.&nbsp; "A file permission
 error" - what on earth is that?&nbsp; And what do I have to do to get things back to normal ??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron Davis, Newcastle N.S.W..

            <p>When you tap the F8 key and get to the Safe Mode Startup screen, use the arrow keys on the keyboard to select "Safe Mode with Networking" and press the "Enter" key.&nbsp; A list of startup items will scroll across the screen, but after all that, you will get
 a normal login screen (except the screen may appear larger than normal and "Safe Mode" may appear in the corners of the screen.&nbsp; At that point, login as any user with Administrator privilege.&nbsp; After you successfully login, you should be able to right-click
 on any folder or file and select "Properties".&nbsp; When the Properties screen comes up, you should have a "Security" tab at the top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another approach is to use the Command Line command "cacls" from a normal bootup which will show and allow you to set permissions on files and folders.&nbsp; (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd") and then you can use the cacls command.&nbsp; The syntax for the calcs command is
 found here:</p>

<p>or you can type in:&nbsp;&nbsp; cacls /?</p>
<p>"Cacls" allows you to screw things up fairly badly and easily so if you can get the "Security" tab, that is the way to go.</p>

<h2>            PDK Black Ops Clan Recruiting&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>We are having tryouts and are recruiting more members for gamebattles for black ops. We are a great clan with perfect potential to be the greatest clan in black ops and we specialize in S&amp;D,CTF,DEM, and Domination. Also we've had plenty of tryouts this month
 already and were making a clan website soon after gamebattles is over. Explain to us what you can bring to the team, how can you help us dominate some more, and if you like us and tryout and get in the clan, then you'll have to understand that there's some
 loyalty involved as well. You can not be in another clan and be in ours too thats why we want mature gamers who play to win (you'll definitely&nbsp;get lots with us) and for fun at the same time. And finally, if your interested just send me JPLAY23 a message and
 i'll get back to you as soon as i can.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-11.gif" /> Their is already 4 new members and a potential new member today if everything goes right.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-21.gif" /></p>

<br />
<br />Looks like a driver fault somewhere on your device, and memory corruption. First run through driver verifier (most likely will give you a BSOD) then memtest 
<br />
<br />driver verifier: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<br />
<br />One fault said FL64.exe may be an issue. Which is from FL Studio Producer Edition. You may want to download a new version of this and reinstall it.

<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. Run Memtest for at least 8 passes (Do it overnight before going to bed)

<br />
<br />4.

<p>Okay so I ran Verifier like&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5f6f566d-2cdd-4694-b047-3afc84a652e8" title="Zackary Vanosdol">Zackary Vanosdol</a>&nbsp;suggested
 and DRIVER_VERIFIED_DETECTION_VIOLATION came up but did not list the xxxx.sys driver.</p>
<p>Will I need to upload a .dmp file again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will run a Memtest later tonight and get back to you on my results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had issues with CPU overheating in the past but I've since upgraded my fan/heatsink. I use Core Temp to monitor it so will running Prime95 still be necessary?</p>

    <title>reinstalling Windows XP Media Center Edition with an OEM license on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            reinstalling Windows XP Media Center Edition with an OEM license on the same computer with different harddrive</h2>
                    Hi, the version of Windows XP Media Center Edition installed on my computer has an OEM license, and I was wondering if it was possible to reinstall it on the same computer on a different external usb harddrive. (I currently have an internal hardrive installed
 in my computer) Also, would reinstalling the version of Windows XP Media Center Edition with an OEM license work if I reinstalled it on the exact brand and model of internal harddrive? Additionally, I don't have any working internal optical drives, and I'm
 currently using an external USB optical drive, would it work to reinstall Windows XP Media Center Edition with that optical drive? or would I need to reinstall Windows XP Media Center Edition using an internal optical drive that was the same brand and model
 of either of the optical drives originally installed in the pc? Also, I'm not sure if this would even work, but would transferring files from my current internal harddrive to another harddrive that would be used with the same pc work for reinstalling Windows
 XP Media Center Edition? <br />

            &nbsp; 1. The customer may use any media kit provided the software meets the downgrade rights criteria (edition,version).<br />
2. They don’t have to go back to their System Builder and ask for the software to be installed and pre-activated.<br />
3. The pre-activation set forth in the System Builder Agreement applies to the system builder when he builds and sells the PC.<br />
<strong>4. When downgrading to Windows XP, VL media may be used as long as the customer has an appropriate key.</strong><br />
5. A customer who downgrades can later return to the version that he bought, e.g. Windows 7 &gt; XP &gt; Windows 7.

            Hi, thanks for taking time to post. Please note that I may be incorrectly referring to my version of Windows XP Media Center Edition as it being one with an OEM license, from my understanding, if the version of Windows XP was pre-installed on a factory
 built pc such as an HP pc, then that version of Windows XP has an OEM license. I noticed that you mentioned downgrading in your post, and I'm not wondering about downgrading, just wanted to get that out of the way. Also, to be more specific, the version of
 Windows XP Media Center Edition I'm talking about was pre-installed on an HP desktop PC, and I'm wondering if it's possible to install Windows XP Media Center Edition on another harddrive that would be used on the same pc, and if so, does the harddrive also
 have to be the exact make/brand and model as the internal harddrive I currently have installed? Or, would it also be possible to install Windows XP Media Center Edition on another make/brand and or model of internal harddrive or external usb harddrive? And
 once again, the new harddrive would be used on the same pc, but it would be used instead of the current one. Additionally, Windows XP Media Center Edition would be installed from 2 backup DVDs that I was allowed to create with my HP PC. The original internal
 optical drives installed in my pc (CD &amp; DVD rom drives/burners) are not functioning, and I'm currently using an external usb multi-drive (an optical drive that can read many disc formats) , and that would be the optical drive I would use to install Windows
 XP Media Center Edition on the new harddrive that would be used on the same pc, would that work? Also, would it be possible to transfer the files from my current internal harddrive to another harddrive that would be used on the same pc and install Windows
 XP Media Center Edition that way? I understand that this post is mostly a repeat of my previous post, but I wanted to explain things with a bit more detail. &nbsp;

            You have an OEM license, you can install a second copy on the same computer but the terms of the EULA does not permit you to install more than one copy of Windows on the same machine or on other machines while installed on another computer.&nbsp; There are
 no technical problems installing a second copy on a different disk or on another partition on the same disk, Windows will install and run without problems.<br />
<br />
However, note that Windows installation is not supported on removable drives and the Windows setup program does not support installation on removable drives (such as USB).&nbsp; Installing and running Windows on USB requires changes to the setup system registry
 to change the load order of the USB stack, on Windows XP the USB stack is loaded after the kernel is loaded and
<i>afte</i>r the Session Manager is started, ergo Windows cannot start off a USB drive unless the load order of the USB stack is changed.&nbsp; Also note that USB drives are slower than internal drives and Windows performance on USB is lackluster at best.<br />
<br />
Why are you wanting to do this?&nbsp; Do you need a bigger drive?&nbsp; Or is your present drive failing?<br />

            Does the fact that the optical drive that would be used to re-install Windows XP Media Center Edition is a USB optical drive matter? I'm wondering because my PC is an HP PC, and I'm not sure if using a component that wasn't originally a part of the PC
 would work. As I mentioned in my post, both of the external optical drives that were pre-installed in my PC are no longer functioning. I would contact HP with my question, but due to the fact that my PC is out of warranty, they want to charge for support,
 and I don't see paying for support for just that one question to be cost effective. I was wanting to use a USB harddrive because my current harddrive is failing (a harddisc harddrive), but because you mentioned that Windows performance on a USB harddrive is
 lackluster, I'm considering installing an external harddrive instead. Do you by any chance know if a solid-state harddrive would be better then a harddisc harddrive, and if it would be possible to install a version of Windows XP Media Center Edition with an
 OEM license on such a harddrive? Also, has there been any proof that solid-state harddrives last longer then harddisc harddrives? If it ends up that only a harddisc harddrive would work to re-install Windows XP Media Center Edition, does it need to be the
 exact same make/brand and model of harddisc harddrive? Thanks for taking time to post and answer my questions. &nbsp;

 internal optical drives, and I'm currently using an external USB optical drive, would it work to reinstall Windows XP Media Center Edition with that optical drive? or would I need to reinstall Windows XP Media Center Edition using an internal optical drive
 that was the same brand and model of either of the optical drives originally installed in the pc? Also, I'm not sure if this would even work, but would transferring files from my current internal harddrive to another harddrive that would be used with the same
 pc work for reinstalling Windows XP Media Center Edition? <br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Overly complicated question.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
Windows XP will not run from the external USB drive.<br />
<br />
Windows XP can be reinstalled as many times as you like on that same machine.&nbsp; Changing the hard drive is not a big deal.&nbsp; Changing the motherboard would cause you to lose the license.&nbsp; Everything else is okay.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If you just need a larger hard drive in the current machine (define it as "same motherboard" for simplicity) you can purchase one and most hard drive manufacturers (of any worth) have software that would allow you to CLONE the old drive to the new and utilize
 the full space of the new at the same time.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Make of the hard drive doesn't really matter (since you asked.)&nbsp; Model only matters in-as-far-as being the same size or larger.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The make and model of the optical drive (CD I assume) doesn;t matter *at all*.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>What is it you are actually attempting to accomplish?</p>

            I wish the question could be simpler, but unfortunately that's not the case. I understand that the make and model of the drive doesn't matter, but does it matter if it's a USB multi-drive? (as I mentioned earlier, it's an optical drive that can read multiple
 disc formats.) What I'm trying to accomplish is replace my current failing harddisc harddrive with a new harddrive and install Windows XP Media Center Edition on that new harddrive, most likely on an internal harddisc harddrive or an internal solid-state harddrive,
 because John John MVP mentioned that Windows XP performance on USB is lackluster at best. Also, I'm wondering about what the best possible way to install Windows XP Media Center Edition on the new harddrive would be. Would that be just transferring the files
 from my failing harddrive to the new harddrive? or would installing to the new harddrive from the USB optical multi-drive, with the backup DVDs I created work better?, no other harddrives would be connected at that point, in case you were wondering. I've considered
 installing Windows XP Media Center Edition on a solid-state harddrive, are solid-state harddrives more reliable then harddisc harddrives?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Actually - it is still something simple you are making complicated.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
As long as the optical drive can read CDs and your BIOS can be set to boot from a USB CD drive, you should be good to go.&nbsp; That latter part could be the kicker.&nbsp; Most&nbsp;optical drives are multi-drives now.&nbsp; CD, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW,
 DVD-DL and maybe some versions of bluray or something else?<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>"...because John John MVP mentioned that Windows XP performance on USB is lackluster ..." &lt;-- actually, I believe the overwhelming point was that you are not going to get Windows XP to work on an external USB drive.&nbsp; You may get something like the
<a href="http://www.ubcd4win.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ubcd4win.com/</a>&nbsp;or some type of "BartePE" environment you boot offa CD or USB drive.&nbsp; You, however, are not likely to get anything more than that on your own or even with just instructions from this forum.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If you buy a new hard drive and your old drive is still up to snuff (you can generally boot and use it) then just using a utility to image the old drive to the new drive is really your best bet.&nbsp; You end up doing nothing but your stated goal: "replace my current
 failing harddisc harddrive with a new harddrive" without having to worry about installing much of anything and you end up with the same machine, all data intact and looking like you did nothing from the operating system, desktop side.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As for the Solid State drive - don't do it.&nbsp; Windows XP on solid state, not worth it in most cases and just given what you have - I wouldn't want to put technology like a SSD into a system like that.</p>

I'm confused, what exactly is it that you claim I'm making complicated? I know I had a lot of questions, but I like knowing that I'm sure instead of just thinking that I'm sure. And, being that I've never replaced a PC harddrive before, I had a lot of questions
 and I wanted to make sure that I had the necessary components to install an OEM license version of Windows XP Media Center Edition on a new harddrive and that I knew which kind of harddrive would be the best replacement. How can I be sure that my BIOS can
 be set to boot from a USB optical drive? After reading what John John MVP mentioned about running Windows XP on a USB harddrive, I realized that wouldn't be something I was going to bother with. ubcd4win or the type of environment you mentioned don't exactly
 seem like the solution I'm looking for either. As far as using a utility to image the old drive to the new drive goes, which utility do you recommend?, and, are there any harddrives with a utility software that you would recommend? Once the imaging was complete,
 would I still need to install Windows XP Media Center Edition from my USB optical drive? Also, would I need to purchase an additional cable to connect the new harddrive to my current harddrive? or could I just have both harddrives installed in my PC and start
 the imaging that way? Once the imaging was finished, would there be anything I would need to do other then shut down my PC and disconnect the power cord from the power supply and power outlet and remove the old harddrive? That's useful info about not using
 Windows XP on solid-state drives, and thanks for taking time to post.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

            I think Shenan has pretty well covered it, we now know that your goal is to replace a failing hard disk in your computer.&nbsp; As long as your old drive is still working you do not need to reinstall Windows, all you need to do is buy a hard disk of the same
 type then use a cloning utility to clone the failing disk to the new one then remove the failing disk and install the new one in its place.&nbsp; Most disk manufacturers have free cloning utilities along with instructions available on their web site, typical example
<a href="http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/201991en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a><br />
<br />
All you need to do is make sure that you order the same type of disk (IDE or SATA).&nbsp; If your PC is much older then it probably has an IDE disk.&nbsp; It isn't hard to find out what kind of disk you have, just open the PC case and look at the data cable, IDE drives
 have big connectors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PATA-cable.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">like this</a> while SATA have small connectors
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SATA_ports.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">like this.</a><br />

                    <span>
<p>The problem I'm having is with &nbsp;the handwriting recognition, and windows journal.</p>
<p>I just got a tm2 hp tablet computer/laptop and it came with a pen. I know there is a pen input panel (or something) that recognizes your handwriting and changes it to text, but its been some time now and i can't find this program. I've been through my computer,
 searched it through the start menu and it appears no-where. This is the same for windows journal, and these aren't on my computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get the Input Panel back? Can I download it back?</p>

<p><span>Hi ,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may verify if the Tablet PC feature is turned on in Windows features. If its not turned on you may turn on the feature and check
 if it helps. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.<span>&nbsp;</span>If
 you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From the list find “Tablet PC Components”. Place a check mark on it if it is not checked. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If it is already checked then, Turn off Tablet PC Components by unchecking this option. Wait until the feature is
 disabled, click OK and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Once the computer is restarted, turn it on in the same way by checking the Tablet PC Components back on. Check to
 see if the problem persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below for more information on the above steps to turn off or on the features in Windows 7.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Movie Maker Black Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> budhogan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker Black Screen</h2>
                    <p>With all the complaints about the BLACK SCREEN in Windows 10 Movie Maker it seems to me that Microsoft would fix this Problem as they tell us that Windows 10 will be the greatest system ever.
</p>
<p>I like it, but sure wish they would fix the problems it has if for no other reason then to make it the very best and make us all happy we use a PC instead of a MAX.</p>
<p><strong>Tried every thing but still a Black Screen so&nbsp;I'm &nbsp;still&nbsp;open to any real fix. Updated DRIVERS. tried to run FIXIT but it won't run on 10. I'm not a geek so for any suggestions I need a step by step on how to do it.</strong></p>
<p>IF Microsoft doesn't fix problems that come up then I've lost faith in them and telling me they don't support something is just a cop out as far as I'm concerned.</p>

            <p>Black screen is often not a Microsoft problem, but just an incompatibility problem with some files that are not available for use in MM.</p>
<p>There are literally thousands of video file types, add on all the audio ones and you cannot make an app that will work with them all. Unfortunately whether you feel it is a cop out or not, they just cannot support them all, NO editing programme however much
 you pay supports them all and that is the same with a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could list everything you have tried it will save going over those again.</p>
<p>Can you,</p>
<p>List your file types that you are using and have trouble with.</p>
<p>DO any files give you visuals?</p>
<p>What file type are these?</p>
<p>DId it all work with these exact same files before?</p>
Where did the files come from?
<p>
</p><p>How did you update your drivers? Via your graphics card manufacturers website? This is how it needs to be done.</p>
<p>Did you update from a previous win version to 10 via the online update?</p>
<p>Or did you do a fresh install?</p>

 a solution and found it was a common problem, but had many possible solutions. It seems to be a problem with Windows' interacting with the graphics card, in my case an AMD Radeon 6550M. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and updating the drivers, both
 through the AMD site and via Device Manager. I also ran an install of DirectX, although I think it wasn't needed as my computer seems to have come with DirectX 11. Others on the internet said they also crashed while playing games, and when I tried myself,
 the same was true. 5 minutes into Team Fortress 2 after it loads, my laptop shuts down.</span>

            I don't get an error message, it simply shuts down. Clean boot didn't work, and my laptop is brand new, so optimization mostly doesn't apply, as not much of anything is installed just yet. I ran the performance troubleshooter anyway and it came up clean.
 The Event Viewer has some errors, under the System and Applications tabs, but they don't seem to relate to the video card or display drivers or anything.

            No fix I'm afraid. I just bothered Lenovo's support enough to get them to send me a brand new replacement. It was annoying, but the replacement works like a dream. Good luck with your issue.

            Outlook 2003 is not certified compatible with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You can try uninstall then reinstall it to see if it resolves the problem. Your best option though is to upgrade to a modern version of Outlook such as Outlook 2016.

<p>I'm afraid to loose the archived emails mails and contact lists if I uninstall. I don't even use a few of the old email addresses or accounts that I have saved.</p>
<p>I already have the latest Office 365 however, if I install it, will it copy the old files from a "hidden file" on my computer ?</p>
<p>I tried to find the .pst files to save first, but I can't find them.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            Uninstalling Outlook will not delete the .PST data file stored in the App Data folder.
<br />
<br />Upgrading to Office 365 will migrate your Outlook data to Outlook 2016 and you should be able to access your emails and contacts.

<p>ok, I've just that...</p>
<p>However, the Archives file can't be opened...still... because it says the last programme to use it hasn't closed down correctly and won't open until it's repared !</p>
<p>But I can't open the programme to close it down.</p>
<p>Can this be solved by uninstalling the old programme, or will I use everything ?</p>

            when I open outlook 2016 it's fine but I can't open the Archives file in 2016 because it says the old version wasn't shut down correctly (old version being 2003)

<h2>            Windows 10 Issues after Update &#40;Desktop not found, Token doesn&#39;t exist&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, a forced update came through to my Windows 10 installation computer. I am not sure if there was a problem while downloadng the update and instaling, but once the computer reset, I was taken to a blue recovery screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have any restore points to go back, and choosing to troubleshoot and fix the issue didn't do anything for me. So I select the option of opening with another operating system and choose the Windows 10, which worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was taken to my users login screen. But using one of them, the main admin, throws the error that Desktop is not found and doesn't let me do anything as desktop is black, start menu doesn't works and I can't even reset the computer correctly.<br />
<br />
Using the other user name generates my apps on the desktop, so I can open Chrome, but it says that my profile information can not be loaded. I can't open anything as the Control Panel, through the start menu or the cmd command, as it throws an issue of token
 that doesn't exist or class that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other options like Windows + X, Windows + I don't do anything for me, as well as trying to use the search icon that is besides the start menu one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the only thing that I wish is to be able to format the computer with the option of keeping my files, but I can't seem to open the Control Panel no matter what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through different topics over here, and tried a whole variety of CMD commands, such as scannow, restorehealth, downloading packages, chkdsk and more. And the result is always the same. Upon resetting the computer, I will always be taken to the
 same blue reccovery page (even while trying to load in safe mode) where I will be abe to go to any of both accounts with the same issues.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to fix this problem without having to download the recovery tool on a USB? Is there a way that I can open the Control Panel even with this issue?</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could create a local user but when I tried to login, I got an error message saying that SENS not working and that I needed to contact my admin.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a command for opening a task for the settings directly, to allow me to format the computer and keeping the files?</p>

<p>I managed to open the Files Explorer through the task, and from there, try the Open Settings on This PC, but it didn't open anything.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can open the Control Panel now through task as well, but there isn't much I can do there.<br />
<br />
While checking the information of both users that I had on my computer, I can also see that all my files are missing; it's like if they were brand new folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, the applications are installed as how I have them before. It's just all the documents and other files that have disappear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just checked and no. And we're talking about almost 150Gb of files that I had between documents, books and photos, so it would be pretty complicated to have that all there.
<br />
<br />
I haven't format anything at all on this computer since these issues started, so I am not sure where those files might have gone.<br />

<p>I tried the first solution, to restart the computer until it's fixed, but the first time I restart the computer it spends 30-odd minutes restoring the previous version of windows.</p>
<p>When starting up after updating, though, I do get an error message stating that the desktop can't be found at an incorrect filepath, so I'm wondering if there's a way to maybe set it to the correct filepath?</p>

<h2>            Full size printing using Windows photo viewer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Windows photo viewer and I cannot get it to print a full size page no matter what I try. My paper size is set to letter and I have highlighted 'full-page photo'. I have checked and unchecked 'fit picture to frame'. The photo size looks fine in
 the print preview. However, everytime I&nbsp; print, &nbsp;the size is approximately 3 1/8" x 4 1/4", printed in the corner of the page. This is not a full page as I have requested. I've had to resort to using&nbsp;3rd party software to get the job done, this is not very
 convenient for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the solution to this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dale</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 and iTunes</h2>
                    Got a Windows 8 machine this week - whoa! Cool, but my learning curve will take a while!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone having success with 8 and iTunes? If so, please advise.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I installed iTunes last night to my Windows 8 user account and all seemed to work fine. However, this AM when I re-booted the machine, iTunes is acting VERY strange. It only opened once and only when I opened it as an admin. Won't open at all now and will
 not open for other user accounts on the machine. It gives me weird messages about being in a disk location that I'm not allowed access to? I tried to uninstall and start over, thinking I missed some options in the installation process, but I get a message
 about not enough disk space when uninstalling...&nbsp;</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums!</span></p>
<p><span><br />
From the description, you are not able to open iTunes from the different account and you are not able to uninstall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would appreciate if you answer this question.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the complete error message you get when you try to uninstall?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the complete error message you get when you try to open iTunes?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try troubleshooting to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1: Perform System Restore with the help of the link.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time.</span></p>
<p><span>If you think an app or driver that you recently installed caused problems with your PC, you can restore it back to an
 earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>To restore your PC using System Restore</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<b>Search</b>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<b>Search</b>.) Enter <b>Recovery</b> in the search box, tap or click <b>Settings</b>, and then tap or click
<b>Recovery</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Tap or click
<b>Open System Restore</b>, and follow the prompts.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have done system restore, try uninstalling iTunes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Method 2: <span>Try to run iTunes in a clean boot state.</span></span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and
 startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow Steps to start the computer to Normal startup
 mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If all the steps do not work, then l would suggest you to delete the temporary files and then try to uninstall.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to delete the temporary files.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press ’Windows + W’ key and type ‘%temp%’ and click ‘OK’.<br />
b) Select all the files and press delete.<br />
c) Press ‘Windows + W’ key and type ‘prefetch’ and click ‘OK’.<br />
d) Select all the files and press delete.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. If you need further assistance regarding Windows, please post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            There is no version of Skype that functions in traditional Sleep Mode (Suspend Mode S3). &nbsp;The Windows 10 app can still function in connected standby (CS) mode when a computer/processor exclusively supports it and that support is enabled in Windows 10.
 &nbsp;Standard high power processors do not support CS mode/Modern Standby (Suspend mode S0 low-power idle). &nbsp;That mode would replace the traditional Sleep mode. &nbsp;

<h2>            Microsoft LifeCam HD-6000 Webcam Doesn&#39;t work in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the&nbsp;Microsoft LifeCam HD-6000 Webcam flawlessly up until the windows 8.1 update. From then on the video has completely stopped working. It will load forever in whichever application I try to use. I have followed other guides (as many others
 have this problem) to no avail. The most up to date driver "4.25.529.0" is incorrectly stated as being "Windows 8.1 compatible". Bottom line, we need a Windows 8.1 specific driver. Reinstalling the same drivers/ or different have no effect. Having paid fully
 for this webcam I am disappointed Microsoft has not followed through with a driver to support the hardware. And yet, still sell it in stores? Do not buy till/ if ever a driver is released. As for my question, IS there a driver in the works? or is the webcam
 as good as garbage :/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Thank you for the quick reply. I did try installing with compatibility mode which didn't work. I just tried the windows 7 driver/ program. The program DID install and open, but the camera still doesnt show any video. Not in the Lifecam software or skype.
 I believe the 6000 HD is touchy and just wont budge without the proper driver for 8.1. Thank you again for the suggestion though.

<h2>            Rollback to windows rt 8 when upgrading to windows rt 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I tried to upgrade my Vivotab to windows rt 8.1 through windows store twice.</p>
<p>The upgrade download completes and start installing, but when setting up at 32% the screen shows that 'Windows ran into a problem' and rolls back to previous version.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me?&nbsp;</p>
