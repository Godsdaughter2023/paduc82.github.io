    <title>Gold account not recognized for Crucible play - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Gold account not recognized for Crucible play</h2>
                    
<p>When I try and access the Crucible, I get a message saying Xbox Live Gold required. &nbsp;I do have a Gold account, which I've verified through commerce.microsoft.com, but I still can't pvp. &nbsp;Any ideas about what I can do? &nbsp;I guess I need Destiny to recognize
 my Gold account but not sure how to do that.</p>
<p>I download the free Gold games each month as well, so my Xbox One system is properly associated to my Xbox Live Gold account.</p>

<p>This account (the one I'm posting from) is the account I'm referencing for the game. &nbsp;I'm looking over my account and profile but don't see a reference to my Xbox Live account, so I'm not sure how you're seeing it. &nbsp;None the less, when I review my Microsoft
 account information, under subscriptions, I have an Xbox Live Gold subscription that is set to expire 12/2014.</p>

<p>Ahhh, gotcha and good to know! &nbsp;I contacted MS support and they've confirmed I have a Gold account. &nbsp;They also gave me some instructions to try on my Xbox One to clear out data...but if my account is showing Silver here, then I'm sure the problem isn't local
 to my console.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Contacted Xbox Live support again and they confirmed I have a Gold account. &nbsp;The second agent said to follow the first agents instructions and this has resolved the same issue for other users. &nbsp;I'm posting the instructions they provided here, in case someone
 else needs them. &nbsp;(I'll try out these instructions later today or tomorrow.)</p>
<p>1. Go to Settings &gt;&gt; Disc &amp; Blu-ray &gt;&gt; Persistent Storage &gt;&gt; Clear Persistent storage</p>
<p>2. Go to Settings &gt;&gt; Network &gt;&gt; Advanced Settings &gt;&gt; Alternate Mac address &gt;&gt; Select Clear &gt;&gt; Restart</p>
<p>3. Hard reboot: Press and hold the power button on your console for 5-10 seconds. Once the console is turned off. Please unplug the power supply from the wall outlet, disconnect all accessories and wait for 1 minute then plug it back and turn the console
 back on.</p>

<p>I tried the solutions provided by MS support and that didn't help. &nbsp;I went to Bungie support but I still haven't received a response...but doesn't matter because I chatted with MS support again and let them know that the issue persists. &nbsp;The agent I chatted
 with reset my account from their end and this resolved my problem.</p>
<p>My advice, follow up with MS support and have them look into the account. &nbsp;If your Live subscription is Gold but the game doesn't recognize it, it's a Live issue.</p>

<p>Definitely not the same person as moeszy and again, to clarify, I have always had a Gold Live membership. &nbsp;No idea what happened on Microsoft's side but my problem was their fault...not me using the wrong account (I only have 1 account) and I doubt very
 many people have more than one Live account. &nbsp;I have receipts and confirmation of my Gold membership through commerce.microsoft.com. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I contacted Xbox Live support (3 times total) each agent confirmed I have a Gold membership and found it puzzling that I couldn't access the Gold content (i.e. the Crucible) in Destiny. &nbsp;The first 2 agents walked me through steps to take on my Xbox
 One. &nbsp;The 3rd agent actually reset my Live account (or something like it), which resolved the issue.</p>
<p>The main point I want to make is that, if you're having a similar issue, try the steps Microsoft provided on your Xbox One and if that doesn't work, contact Microsoft Live support (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a>)
 and ask to have your account reset.</p>

<h2>            Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, the forums for this game have 0 activity.&nbsp; There is just one post basically and google gives me little help on this subject.&nbsp; The wiki's don't really help either.</p>

<p>I have been searching all over for guides or something pertaining to what the best mobile suits in this game are to use.&nbsp; I know I could play what I want but I basically need a list of the most efficient suits so I can do some farming and unlocking.&nbsp; I don't
 have this game much longer due to it being a rental and me wanting to get another game on release early in February and going through one gundam at a time just to see who is effective and who isn't is taking up more time than I would like.</p>

<p>I have been using 00 and he is around level 40 right now with level 3 plans but it just doesn't feel right.&nbsp; Seems too easy.&nbsp; I tried Deathscythe and that thing felt weak.&nbsp; If anyone has any helpful info please message me.&nbsp; Anything related to useful suits
 and how to develop them would help greatly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't like giving the forum trolls the attention they desperately crave so I won't be checking back.&nbsp; Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>I feel this is was a staple of the Dynasty Warrior Franchise the downloadable content, constant grinding for plans and the multiplayer aspect when you show up to the fight with a high rank mobile suit that some one did not think would make the cut in a fight
 was down right fun to hear over the microphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope they bring this classic to the backward compatible list for the nostalgia for myself as I think it has to many others.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are many ways to recover your missing files. To provide you the best option, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What procedures are you referring to when you clean your drive? Did you perform a clean install?</li><li>Are your files synced to OneDrive?</li><li>Have you set up a drive for <strong>File History</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If your files are synced to OneDrive, we suggest you go to <a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>OneDrive Online</strong></a> and download the missing files from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also restore files or folders using File History if you have set it up before. You can refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17128/windows-8-file-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for more information about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>You will only be able to restore your files if they have been backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent this in the future, we highly suggest that you back up your files and settings prior to performing a clean installation, a computer reset, refresh, or doing an upgrade.</p>

    <title>Upgrading from 32 bit to 64 bit. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slayingbadger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading from 32 bit to 64 bit.</h2>
                    I am about to upgrade my OS from 32 bit to 64 bit, but before I continue I need a bit of clarification. &nbsp;After I boot up my computer and install the 64 bit version, will I have to reinstall all of the drivers for my computer's components, (i.e. graphics
 card, motherboard, CPU, etc.) &nbsp;or will that remain installed on my computer?

            <p>Well, &nbsp;normally after a fresh install you can go to the website of the manufacturer of your PC / Laptop, go to support page, put in the model number of your system and download a fresh set of 64bit drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I would check this before installing 64bit OS . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also rely upon Windows 10 update to do this for you, but I wouldn't!</p>

            <p>It is not possible to change the "bitness" of any version of Windows from 32-bit to 64-bit, or vice versa. So you can *not* upgrade; you will have to do a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So *nothing* will remain installed. You will have to reinstall all your software and all your drivers. And reload all your data from its backup.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player 12 DRM Security Upgrade 2.5.0.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sylviadymock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 DRM Security Upgrade 2.5.0.1</h2>
                    <p><strong>GOOD NEWS (possibly) for anyone trying to upgrade DRM security of Windows Media Player 12!!</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have, like me, gone to the site <a href="http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/indivsite/en/indivit.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/indivsite/en/indivit.asp</a>. only to discover the upgrade button is grayed out, and stays grayed out EVEN after you have tried to reset your&nbsp; DRM settings (which, if your computer&nbsp;came preloaded with Windows 7, your computer
 will turn all HAL 2000 on you and refuse to let you do), try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, make sure you are running Internet Explorer as administrator (don't ask me why this is necessary, but it is):</p>
<ol>
<li>Left click on the Windows Explorer icon,</li><li>Left click on All Programs, </li><li>Scroll down to&nbsp;OverDrive Media Console folder, left click to show what programs are in the folder</li><li>Right click on OverDrive Media Console icon within the OverDrive Media Console folder</li><li>Choose "Troubleshoot Compatibility" from the drop down menu.</li><li>Choose "Troubleshoot Program" on the "Select Troubleshooting Options" page</li><li>Select "The program requires additional permissions" on the "What Problems Did You Notice?" page,&nbsp;</li><li>Click "Next" button&nbsp;(<em>Note:&nbsp; On the "Test Compatibility Settings for the Program" page, under "Settings Applied" heading, your User Account Control should now read "Run as administrator.")</em></li><li>Click "Start the Program" button on the&nbsp; "Test Compatibility Settings for the Program" page,</li><li>&nbsp;Click "Yes" button&nbsp;when you are asked "Do you want to allow this program [OverDrive Media Console] to make changes to this computer?"
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer will then take you to the internet.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/indivsite/en/indivit.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/indivsite/en/indivit.asp</a>. page, </li><li>Find tools on the topline menu bar, </li><li>Select "Compatibility View" from drop down menu (if the upgrade button is grayed out on the page, there should be a torn page icon next to this item).&nbsp;
</li><li><strong>This will bring up a text box titled "add to this website:".&nbsp; If "microsoft.com" is not already entered in this box, you will want to do so.&nbsp; Click on the add button to the right of the text box, then click the close button</strong>.*</li><li>The Upgrade button should now be black and Windows Media Player 12 DRM security upgrade 2.5.0.1 should be applied when you click it.&nbsp; (<em>Note:&nbsp; If the upgrade was successful, when you click on Windows Media Player Security Upgrade in the Tools drop down
 menu of the Overdrive Media Console program, it will tell you that your Windows Media Player security upgrade version is 2.9.0.1.&nbsp; Don't ask me why it doesn't say 2.5.0.1.)</em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not tell you how many days and hours I spent combing the Internet for the answer to this problem, but I will say that all the instructions I found for resetting my DRM&nbsp; and my User Account Controls--both at the links I followed from OverDrive
 Media site and the Microsoft support sites--did not help.&nbsp; I was&nbsp;also disappointed to find out that Dell,&nbsp;who sold me&nbsp;my Alienware Aurora R4 from 7 months ago, could not help me&nbsp;with this problem because even though they installed the software, it is not covered
 under the warranty.&nbsp;&nbsp;(They would gladly sell me a software warranty for $230/year, though.) Microsoft would not help me--unless I agreed to pay $100 first--because I didn't buy the software directly from them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, if you try this solution and it does not work, please post a response.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am pretty sure I listed all the steps that I took and if I missed any I would like to correct this post with the missing steps/information.&nbsp; I don't want ANYONE feeling as
 frustrated as I&nbsp;was while&nbsp;trying to get this problem resolved.</p>
<p><em>*Please note the new information added in Step 4 on 12/9/2014.</em></p>

<blockquote>I, too, have done everything suggested on every site to install this upgrade. The "upgrade" button has never once been grayed out, but after I click on it I get the error message "Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file."
 I am not playing a file, or music, or anything, just trying to upgrade the security setting,&nbsp;so I'm assuming the upgrade file&nbsp;is what is meant. I had great hopes for your fix! Any other suggestion?
</blockquote>
Debbie,&nbsp;
<div>Just curious--when you went to the indivsite page, did you try selecting Compatibility View from the Tools drop down menu of the topline menu bar before clicking the upgrade button? &nbsp;I know you said your button was not grayed out, but maybe you still need
 to do this before the upgrade can be applied.</div>
<div>If you did select the compatibility view from the tools drop down menu on the indivsite page BEFORE you clicked on the upgrade button, did you get an numerical error code to go with the error message «Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing
 the file»? &nbsp;Please let me know. I have some other suggestions based on your answer.</div>
</blockquote>
<br />
Yes, it is set to display all websites in compatibility view. And no, no numerical error code comes up with the message. Incidentally, if this helps you, after I close the error message the button is grayed out and says "Upgrade Complete." But, no upgrade was
 applied, it's still the version 2.5.0.0. </blockquote>
<br />
I was finally able to accomplish this task by running IE as administrator plus disabling protected mode. Worked like a charm.

    <title>Enable Aero without redoing the entire theme - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slickrcbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enable Aero without redoing the entire theme</h2>
                    <p>Years ago I switched to the "Windows Classic" theme, then customized <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
a lot</span> of things. </p>
<p>Now I think I'd like to try enabling Aero again as I can't recall why I disabled it other than something annoyed me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the only way I've found via searching to do so is to change the entire theme by clicking on one of the "Aero Themes", which resets all my font and other tweaks. I can get it back by clicking on my custom theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some other way to turn on the Aero Glass effects without changing everything else like my tweaks to relative font sizes used in various things, my selection of desktop backgrounds, the custom sounds I've assigned, window colors, etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the things I get by searching say to goto Personalize and choose the Windows 7 Aero theme. Either that, or use the troubleshooter which also resets the theme.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In XP, all effects could be tweaked individually, they weren't a packaged deal. How do I enable Aero without spending at least an&nbsp; hour trying to redo my semi-custom theme?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>* * * </p>
<p>UPDATE: I think my disabling it had to do with Remote Desktop disabling it and making things look ugly when I returned to the console.

            <p>Hi Scotmgp, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the exact issue that you are facing? </p>
<p>2. Which files are you referring to? </p>
<p>3. What happens when you open the files? Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>4. Does the computer came with Windows 8 pre-installed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually&nbsp;System32 folder is residing&nbsp;inside Windows folder in C drive <strong>C:\Windows\System32</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may perform SFC scan to check if there is any system corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><strong><span><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</span></span></strong></p>

            <p>It'll present in the path&nbsp;<strong>C:\Windows\System32</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you seen SysWOW64 folder because of Windows system is 64bit or x64 usually path should be&nbsp;<strong>C:\Windows\SysWOW64
</strong>even in 64bit Windows installation also system32 folder will present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find whether Windows is a 32bit or 64bit follow below steps,</p>

<li>Press Win+R</li><li>In Run, type msinfo32 and press enter.

            <p>Yes, it was a little bit helpful. The files I could not open are/was in my external drive. All my excel files are not there anymore, How could this happen, and how can I get them back?</p>
<p>I did do an sfc now and everything is fine. But I did notice that when I open the external drive it is telling me that I need FAT32, what does this mean? Is this why I cannot open my files?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            I think I figured it out. I do not have wireless connection, I have a modem which I cannot retrieve my files in the apps or where ever they are. So I am working on&nbsp;getting more G's I am currently in 3G which is not enough. And to your question, the external
 drive when I want to retrieve it gave me a message of the files are in FAT32. My other computer is a window vista. This computer I am talking with was preinstall windows 7. then I upgraded to windows 8.1. But originally I had windows 8 with the CD, but the
 CD is not working. And just to make this story a lit bit longer before my supposedly hard drive went on the blick. I had install windows 8 w/cd and upgrade to windows 8 Pro w/media. So when I got my Dell computer back I tried to install my windows 8 w/cd,
 it would not work, I had to purchase a new product key which I think I purchase for a Laptop not a Desktop if this make a difference, I will need a new product key right? What a nightmare. Please let me know what can I go from here!!

            <p>Well, it's looks like I am going to go back to the preinstall window 7. I am going to be sad, I did enjoy the window 8 &amp; windows 8.1 and windows 8 pro w/media. But there is to much to upgrade. I just hope I can get my files back from my external drive. And
 maybe someday in the future&nbsp;I will upgrade again.</p>

            <p>Hi Scot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To retrieve the files from the external hard drive, you can connect this to a different computer and take a back up of the files. After taking the backup of the files, it is recommended to format the hard drive with FAT32 file system. This would absolutely
 bring back your hard drive and continue using with Windows 8.1. We can still investigate if there is any problem with your operating system and troubleshoot it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results. </p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Thank you for this superbly simple (for non techie like myself!!) method of finding which windows operating system my laptops windows 8.1 is using.
</p>
<p>I tried many more methods but was met with info I couldn't work out even with help guides as the posters assumed having a tech level of their own standard.</p>
<p>Yours is the first I found where I can actually understand what im looking at and what my windows version was running on, so again iam very appreciative. Thankyou.</p>

<div>Try clearing the Windows Store Cache.</div>
<div>The simplest fix is to reset the Windows Store cache, which may have become cluttered and buggy over time. To do this, hit
<strong>Windows Key + R</strong>, then in the Run box type <strong>wsreset.exe</strong> and hit Enter. A command prompt window should show up, which indicates that Windows is resetting the Store cache. When the window closes, the job is done, so you can try
 opening the Store again to see if it works properly.</div>

<h2>            Right click doesn&#39;t work after Windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have updated to Windows 10 on my Dell XPS 12 laptop, and the install went find, and so far most things work fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have lost the right click -&nbsp; if I click on the right side of the touchpad mouse, it just does the same as a left click&nbsp;. I have checked for any new drivers, and everything appears to be up to date. I can't find any settings I could usefully change
 either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the "Troubleshooting" utility, and it reported a problem with the USB-IF xHCI USB Host controller driver, but it couldn't do anything to fix it., so this was not particularly helpful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anybody ? Thanks</p>

            <p>I have a Yoga 3 Pro and am experiencing the same issue. &nbsp;Several others over at the Lenovo forums are reporting similar problems (with a few different devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does very much appear to be a driver issue of some kind - at least in my case, I can point directly at the Synaptics driver that is causing the problem. &nbsp;If I revert back to either using the base touchpad drivers (e.g. just removing the Synaptics/Lenovo
 drivers), then the right click behavior works as expected...except that the touchpad itself becomes pretty erratic (insofar as moving the mouse cursor feels like using a touchpad from the early 90s), and I am unable to disable the touchpad. &nbsp;Using the old
 Synaptics drivers (like version 18 or so) also appears to let right-clicking behave properly, but still can't disable the touchpad and, eventually, Windows Update will replace the old driver with the new, not working driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this seems very, very, very much like a driver issue, but I do find it strange that there aren't swarms of people complaining about it. &nbsp;Perhaps right-clicking isn't as important to other people. &nbsp;But I can think of no way of sending a bug report
 or anything to anyone over at Synaptics. &nbsp;Lenovo staff on their forums have not expressed any interest in the problem. &nbsp;I've seen other reports here on answers.microsoft.com when I was googling around for the problem. &nbsp;There was also a reddit topic expressing
 similar symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I dunno. &nbsp;But this is rather frustrating.</p>

            <p>I tried the automatic driver update for the mouse pad, and it told me that I was up to date. However, when I went to the Dell site (I think) I installed the driver from there manually, and after that the right click came back. Still, it's far from ideal
 install drivers manually (you might make it worse). </p>
<p>
</p><p>As usual, the Microsoft support reply is useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case anyone doesn't know, you can generate right click menus via the "shift F10" shortcut, which is what I was reduced to till I found the solution.

            <p>in your PDF viewer, go to File &gt; Page Setup.<br />
<br />
Now some of this might depend on your printer and print driver - but what you are looking for is an option for "Fit to page"<br />
<br />
look for a link or button marked something like "Printer..."</p>
<p><br />
That should open the printer settings, on there will be a button or link to "Properties..."&nbsp;<br />
- where you should find many more options, and hopefully the Fit to Page one!</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 SM Bus Controller and other drivers not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wegthegreat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 SM Bus Controller and other drivers not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I have a problem with my Windows 8.1 Alienware X51 R2 that I've had for a while now and no body was able to help, so I thought this was the best place to look. A few months ago my computer stopped playing sound then I realized I couldn't record videos
 or take screenshots too. So I looked in my Device Manager and there I saw that my SM Bus Controller and all of the drivers in the Sound, video and game controllers had a yellow exclamation mark next to them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since none of those drivers work I do not have sound on my computer and I don't have the ability to record or take screenshots. That's a big problem for me because I bought this computer to do those things and I haven't been able to do most of my work for
 a few months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>William</p>

    <title>Snagit 12 crashed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomgoodson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snagit 12 crashed.</h2>
                    <p>I have had Snagit v.12.4.1 running on Windows 8.1 for over a year until it crashed approximately 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; Techsmith support has been trying to relaunch the program for about 3 weeks, but everything that they have tried has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They now advise me that the issue is a Windows update app, but state that this is a matter that must be addressed by Microsoft.&nbsp; I am not sure if this point is relevant, but I began getting Windows update messages about 3-4 weeks back that would say "unable
 to complete updates; undoing updates."&nbsp; My computer has always been set to "automatic updates" for any files that Windows releases, and, heretofore, I have never had a problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ergo, fearing security issues without current updates I went to Windows update site and manually launched updates.&nbsp; Unique to this instance, I also updated "optional updates, and wonder if this might be my problem?&nbsp; The following verbiage is my last contact
 with Techsmith, but the url provided therein returns a error message so am unable to read article and/or follow any suggestions that might be contained therein:</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Here is the article from Microsoft that goes over this issue: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files">
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files</a><br />
<br />
The next step would be to backup the data on your computer, and follow the steps in this article labeled:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
DISM<br />
If you are on win 8 (and up) you&nbsp; should also run DISM whether SFC found errors or not<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am a true neophyte with all things computer tech, and would very much appreciate directions on how to proceed with possible solutions.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any responses.</p>

</p><p>My apologies for the delay in responding to your input.&nbsp; As previously stated, " am very deficient in knowledge of dealing with things technical."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issues has not been resolved, and Techsmith has basically washed their hands of the matter by stating that my problem is the result of Windows update files.&nbsp; Ergo, I have reached the only decision to just find a source to have my computer drive wiped
 and re-load all files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this is not the approach I would choose if another viable option is available.&nbsp; Please advise your counsel on next step(s) in achieving a satisfactory resolution.</p>

<p>One of the possible reasons why your application crashed is because of an outdated Windows OS. We suggest that you install all the latest Windows Updates by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong>. </li><li>On the top-right corner, type <strong>Windows Update</strong> in the search box and click the first result.
</li><li>Click <strong>Check for updates</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>important update are available</strong> and on the bottom-right corner, click
<strong>Install</strong>. <span>&nbsp;</span></li><li>After installing the Windows Updates, check the application if the issue still persists.
</li></ol>
<p>In the event that you encounter an issue while installing or checking the Windows Updates, we recommend that you run Windows Update Troubleshooter on your computer. To do this, follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong>. </li><li>On the top-right corner, type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the search box and click the first result.</li><li>Under <strong>System and Security</strong>, click <strong>Fix Problems with Windows Update</strong> and click
<strong>Next</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us all know how it goes. Otherwise, we’ll be here if you need further assistance.

            <p>It looks as if you've already tried removing the account and adding it back. The error message doesn't say much, so it's not easy to suggest remedies. Have Verizon confirmed that your account is working properly at their end?</p>
<p>Have you double checked that all your settings are as they should be according to the
<a href="http://www22.verizon.com/ResidentialHelp/HighSpeed/General+Support/Tutorials/QuestionsOne/85649.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Verizon help page</a>? Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties </em>to see the current settings.</p>
<p>Can you access your account via webmail using the same username and password as you have entered on the
<em>Servers </em>tab?</p>
<p>Is your anti-virus set to scan email? If so, tell it not to; scanning mail adds no real extra security and can cause problems.</p>

            If you're seeing the exact same error message as in the original post in this thread, and you haven't had problems with this account previously, then the fault lies with Verizon. If it doesn't go away of its own accord in a day or two, contact Verizon.

Or boot your computer with a Linux Live CD (I use Knoppix) and format the pen drive FAT32 from Linux.

                    I can't get my HP LaserJet printer 3055 all in one printer to print.&nbsp; It keeps coming up with error 79, turn off the printer then turn it back on.&nbsp; This does not work.&nbsp; I've tried for two days to get it to work.&nbsp; I looked online for any updates, but found
 none for this printer.&nbsp; I even tried to reinstall from the original disk which was made for Vista and XP.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 and my husband uses some programs that use Windows 7 format.&nbsp; However we updated his to&nbsp; Windows 10, but somehow when you just
 boot it up, it says Windows 7 Home premium, which we have the disk for.&nbsp; How can I get the printer to print again?&nbsp; Is there a fix? Or do I need a new printer that works with Windows 7 programs on a Windows&nbsp;10 operating system?

    <title>Poor H.264 Encoder Quality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> megajonah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Poor H.264 Encoder Quality</h2>
                    <p>I’m unhappy with the video quality produced by Windows Movie Maker 2012.&nbsp; Two problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the MP4/H.264 files encoded by Movie Maker use the Baseline Profile with only 1 reference frame and the quality seems to max out at around 12 Mbps with no improvement at higher bitrates.&nbsp; My source file is 1280x720, 29.97 FPS at 43.6 Mbps and has
 no noticeable blocking artifacts at all.&nbsp; Encodings produced by movie maker even at higher bitrates greater than 50 Mbps have severe compression artifacts that shouldn’t be present at such high bitrates.&nbsp; For this reason, I wish there was an option to encode
 AVI files using a lossless codec like HuffyYUV or Lagarith, then I could use HandBrake to encode the final MP4/H.264 files with my own preferred encoder settings for optimal results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, the videos produced have moments of choppiness.&nbsp; In the preview window the video is smooth the entire time, but on playback there are several moments in a 3 minute video where the video becomes choppy for a few seconds.&nbsp; I was able to resolve some
 of these moments by splitting the 3 minute video into several segments at points before the problem occurs, but I still feel this might be another problem with the encoder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, I’m really impressed with the design and features of Windows Movie Maker 2012 and I’m happy that MP4/H264 is supported as the default encoding format, but I’m really disappointed with the H264 encoder quality.&nbsp; I know Microsoft can do better.</p>

            <p>Hi, I have the exact same problem. Every time I save a video to MP4/H.264 the video has choppy moments. However, if I save the video to WMV there are no choppy moments. Were you able to figure out a solution to the H.264 choppiness? Please message me back
 and let me know.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm noticing similar. The encoding is Baseline@L3.1 whereas my source videos are High@L3.1. The bitrate of the published video ends up being nearly half that of the source. To me, this makes WMM unusable because I don't want to unnecessarily deteriorate
 the quality of my videos during the editing process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a way to force WMM to use the High or Main profiles?</p>

<h2>            External Speaker Problems with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a set of external speakers that have been working fine on Win10 for nearly a year. &nbsp;Suddenly, my computer won't even recognize that any speakers are even plugged into any or the audio output jacks.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have tried updating the drivers numerous times.</li><li>When I run the troubleshooter, it only tells me to plug in the speakers.</li><li>I can't adjust the volume, because, again, the computer does not believe there are any speakers to adjust.</li><li>I have tried plugging another set of speakers into the computer with no change.</li><li>And, I have tried playing audio from my smartphone on both sets of speakers, and the speakers work just fine.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Really frustrated here. &nbsp;If anyone has any additional suggestions, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

                    <p>1) So ... Win 7 Pro informs me of an important Update (monthly security/fix rollup, of sorts)</p>
<p>2) Multiple Update attempts all FAIL, with ever-so-helpful "<em>Unknown Error</em>" (but, of course, referencing a specific Error Code !?!)</p>
<p>3) Downloaded &amp; applied <em>Update Troubleshooter</em> which repeatedly <em>Falls on its Face</em></p>
<p>4) Did some online research, where Clean Boot is recommended (only after discovering
<em>Updates</em> has been deleted from SAFE mode (along with all references to "Update" in [so-called]
<em>"Help &amp; Support</em>")</p>
<p>5) Decided to try Clean Boot, only to discover that&nbsp; [so-called] <em>"Help &amp; Support</em>" is of no help re"<em>Clean Boot</em>" - reporting "0 results for 'clean boot'" Search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, perhaps it's time to simply substitute "<em>have you tried Google</em>" for most, if not all, Searches in [so-called]
<em>"Help &amp; Support</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, yeah, M$ folk have suggested always going to online <em>"Help &amp; Support</em>" ... but at that point (assuming internet access) I'm only a few clicks away from Google, which invariably seems to be more productive - and with less aggravation!</p>

<h2>            Chkdsk keeps cancelling itself</h2>
                    When I turn on my Dell Inspirron 1501 laptop with Vista I get a message that there are issue with the hard drive and that the computer needs to run chkdsk. It starts to run but then says chkdsk cancelled without me touching anything. I have also tried
 to run it once the computer loads but get told the program cannot lock the drive and needs to run chkdsk on the next boot up. So I schedule it to do it but it starts and then states chkdsk cancelled even though I am not cancelling it. Any ideas how to get
 chkdsk to run so I can potentially fix the issues with the drive?&nbsp;

<p>Unfortunately I dropped my surface pro 3 and the screen has broken (display works, touchscreen doesn't) and I would like to have it repaired/replaced.
</p>
<p>My problem is that I have bought it while I was in the US and now I have moved to KSA and I know there is no official Microsoft repair center here, but is there any in the middle east?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft support page was totally useless -refering me to phone-only repair centers-.</p>
