<h2>            How to create button to go to tab specified by the user..MS Access 2010</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have a form and there are &gt;20 tabs. I'm trying to put a button onto the first page of the tab (value=0) so that people click and go to the desired tab.</p>
<p>For the onclick event of the button, I have TabCtl.Value = TabCtl.Value + 1 ---&gt; for the NEXT button</p>
<p>For the onclick even of another button, I have Me.TabCtl.Value=1 --&gt; to go to page 1. Therefore, if i have 50 pages, i would need 50 different button. What I'm wondering is whether I can have a button or similar method...where people can click, and then
 a box will pop up to ask them which page they want to go to.</p>

<p>If you think your users can manage to navigate by using<br />
page numbers then you can try this:</p>
<p>Dim lngPage As Long</p>
<p>lngPage = InputBox("Where do you wanna go today?", "Woop")</p>
<p>If lngPage &gt;= 0 And lngPage &lt; Me!TabCtl.Pages.Count Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Me!TabCtl.Value = lngPage<br />
End If</p>

    <title>One Drive &#43; Lost major Powerpoint presentation - please help - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            One Drive &#43; Lost major Powerpoint presentation - please help</h2>
                    <p>I was working on a big presentation on Powerpoint for Mac 2016. I went to close the program and it asked for me to save it, which I did to my personal One Drive account. Anyways, I opened it up to work on it today and didn't find it in my one drive. I then
 went to the "recents" tab and there it was but it spit out the dread "Sorry, we couldn't open 'https://d.docs.live.net/....".&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Anyways, here I am and I've test out many different ways to saving a file to one drive and needless to say, that no matter how I attempted to save my file to one drive from within powerpoint, it is not saving at all. Period. When I do a normal save, it shows
 no sign of failure and lets me keep on going, and updating my save. Everything looks perfect but it simply is not saving. What kind of crap is this?! There's no auto recover file and nothing in One Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried signing out and back in and nothing allows me to save it to One Drive. I seriously can't believe this is happening because if there's no solution, I will never use One Drive again, period and will never recommend it. How can I recommend something
 that doesn't work. I guess it's my fault for not saving locally, never again will I make that mistake.</p>

            <p>Hi coastcorp,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that. I can imagine that must be frustrating. Since you are receiving postmaster failed email notification to your account, it is possible that
<span><font color="#000000">a virus&nbsp;might have&nbsp;infected your computer or your account was hacked/hijacked, we recommend that you scan your computer for viruses and malware using a reliable

<span><font color="#000000">Once your computer has been cleaned, I would strongly suggest that you&nbsp;change your&nbsp;password to a strong one and&nbsp;update your account security info&nbsp;in order to make sure that you have sole ownership of your account and other people

<p>Regarding the emails you received from unknown senders, we suggest that you set your account junk email filter to Exclusive level.&nbsp;<span>If you set your junk mail to Exclusive, only messages from your contact list and safe senders will be forwarded to your

<p><span>2. Click <strong>Mail more settings</strong>. </span></p>

Exclusive</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click <strong><span>Save</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: You still have to check your Junk mail folder time to time if there are legit emails coming from a trusted sender that are not added to your contact or safe senders list.</span></p>

    <title>One drive app cant choose folders to sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meshack makungo  say:</h3>
<h2>            One drive app cant choose folders to sync</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing errors with my One Drive app. I have experienced these errors even on the previous updates of the app. In fact for as long as I've started using the app to sync my local storage with my cloud's one. The problem is that as I add new
 files to my local storage, I will later have to remove unwanted ones from the list of folders in one drive settings so that they only exist online as indicated below.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40e2719f-ea41-437c-85a7-9494af0e6bd1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40e2719f-ea41-437c-85a7-9494af0e6bd1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that whenever I try this multiple times it reaches a point where I get the following message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c386c4e8-1b63-4200-8078-2efb91abad8a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c386c4e8-1b63-4200-8078-2efb91abad8a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this issue, I usually have to uninstall and install the app again. As I am frequently uploading my files to free up my local storage, I can only choose folders to sync only a few times until I encounter this error again. Of which I uninstall and
 reinstall the app again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me resolve this problem as I end up creating duplicates of my online files each time I uninstall and reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the latest One Drive app files on demand option comes as a default. This creates a hassle each time I&nbsp;reinstall/sync my files as it syncs all my online folders by default. By the time I disable it I end up with lots of empty folders that the app doesn't&nbsp;automatically
 remove. As a result, I have to remove them manually and this problem leads me to the errors I described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please to make the App user-friendly would you please consider resolving this issue or remove the files on demand option as a default setting to prevent it syncing unwanted folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Meshack</p>

            Hi Meshack,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Let's try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode: Right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar and select Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. Type in taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe to terminate any OneDrive processes and hit Enter. 
<br />Then type in either %SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10 or %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10 and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />After that Go to RegEdit on this path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include OneDrive numeric version 
<br />and from the Account, folders directory remove all the folders inside 
<br />
<br />After that restart the pc and install One Drive latest version from this link:

<br />
<br />After that try to use File OnDemand instead choosing Folders to sync

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I used files on demand more often. But since I have more files online than offline that left a lot of empty folders on my local storage creating navigation difficulties. Also, this becomes more of a problem because there are times where I am mostly
 offline and those folders will get on the way of my work, to a point where it becomes difficult saving and locating my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate it if you could consider developing an interphase that could relieve these issues and accommodate&nbsp;offline workspace. Because as a student, I get access only to One Drive online during schooling seasons. This somewhat makes files on demand
 not as useful and I have relied&nbsp;on "folders to sync" option to prevent unwanted empty folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I would like to know if there's is currently an alternative to prevent "folders to sync" errors except relying on "files on demand" to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Meshack</p>

    <title>AD Photos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisblake3402  say:</h3>
<h2>            AD Photos</h2>
                    
<p>I have on-prem Exchange 2013 and&nbsp;Skype for Business running happily and I'm currently migrating&nbsp;a number of on-prem services to O365.</p>
<p>I've used staff photos in AD for many years so that they're visible in Outlook and Lync/Skype for Business and&nbsp;they've always worked&nbsp;absolutely fine, being visible in both applications on-prem.</p>
<p>I have set up ADFS and have DirSync running and my users are all synced out&nbsp;to AAD without issue.</p>
<p>I'm not seeing their AD photos in Office 365 however.</p>
<p>1. SharePoint Online; they don't show up at all. Should I expect to see them here or is there something I need to do to make them appear?</p>
<p>2. Office 365 Admin, can't see them here either. However, somewhat curiously if I use the Office 365 Admin App on my Windows phone I can see some of them. Certainly not all users, but some of them are there at least. If I use the website there are no photos
 at all.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi ChrisBlake3402,<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, we can upload pictures in <strong>.JPG, .GIF, or .PNG</strong> formats.<br />
The “native” size of user photos is around 100x100 pixels, with a file size of <strong>
10 KB</strong>.&nbsp; <br />
If you’re using a hybrid configuration with Exchange Online, remember that your on-premises organization is authoritative for AD and Exchange user attributes – in other words, you’ll need to make your changes on-premises and synchronize them over with Azure
 Directory Sync.&nbsp; The AD attribute in question is <strong>ThumbnailPhoto</strong>.<br />
<br />
If you make sure the local photo meet the requirement with the ThumbnailPhoto, please also help us run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell and give us the result:<br />
<em>Get-UserPhoto</em><br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jason Jiang</p>

<p>I'm aware of the restriction in photo sizes and can see most of them in the Office 365 Admin App on my phone so they *MUST* be syncing across from our On-prem Active Directory to AAD.</p>
<p>Get-UserPhoto returns no results from Exchange on-line, because only the archive is out there, the primary mailbox is still on-prem and if I run Get-UserPhoto against my on-prem Exchange it does return a result.</p>
<p>Since I'm sure ThumbnailPhoto is being sync correctly, how do I get SharepPoint On-line to display the Photos in AAD?</p>

<p>Hi ChrisBlake3402,</p>
<p>I would like to confirm if you can see the photo in Office 365 OWA. SharePoint Online will retrieve the photo from Exchange Online by default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you could not view the photo in OWA, please check the Dirsync log (you can use the FIM shell: “C:\Program Files\Windows Azure Active Directory Sync\SYNCBUS\Synchronization Service\UIShell\miisclient.exe”). This will help check if ThumbnailPhoto is exported
 to Azure AD. If it is ok, the issue could be caused by the synchronization in cloud.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Johnny</p>
<p>Our Exchange deployment is hybrid (with all our users having on-prem primary and cloud based archives) and I am seeing photos in OWA on all my users.</p>
<p>However if I fully migrate a user to the cloud the photos aren't showing up in that user's OWA instance.</p>
<p>I've recently migrated DirSync to AD Connect and can various rules pertaining to SharePoint an Exchange online, all of which suggest that the thumbnailPhoto attribute is being synced across.</p>

<p>Hi ChrisBlake3402,</p>
<p>The thumbnailPhoto should be synced to cloud via AADSync/Dirsync. Do you mean you have migrated the user mailbox to cloud, and the user photo is still not shown at Office 365 OWA?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned early, we need to check if the thumbnailPhoto can be exported to cloud successfully. Please access C:\program files\microsoft azure ad sync\uishell\miisclient.exe. You can try to upload/edit photo to local user, and run full sync. After that,
 please check if the changes take effect via miisclient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Johnny Zhang<br />

<p>Or "AD Connect", which has replaced both DirSync and AADSync... Not relevant really as I had this issue prior to upgrading to this.</p>
<p>As I have stated repeatedly:</p>
<p>THE ThumbnailPhoto ATTRIBUTE FROM ON-PREMISE AD ***MUST*** BE SYNCING TO AZURE AD BECUASE I CAN SEE THEM IN THE OFFICE 365 ADMIN APP ON MY PHONE!</p>
<p>I cannot see photos anywhere else, not Exchange On-Line, SharePoint On-Line or even in the Office 365 Admin Portal website.</p>
<p>AD Connect is not showing any errors. DirSync never did either. We're sending photos out to AAD, because, again, I can see them in the Office 365 Admin App!!!!!</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I have migrated a user fully to 365 and&nbsp;CAN see the photos for that user in OWA (and Sharepoint On-Line). It seems that once the mailbox is fully O365 this starts working. However, for the moment ALL my users are retaining an On-Prem Primary mailbox with
 an Archive in 365. How do I get these photo to appear in the scenario?</p>

<p>Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
Based on my experience, we can use the following PowerShell command change the photo:<br />
<strong>Set-UserPhoto "username" -PictureData ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:\test.jpg"))</strong><br />
Could you please try it and give us the result?<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
Since the account is a mail user, I’m afraid we cannot set the photo for the mail user in Office 365.<br />

<h2>            Is Windows Phone really unpopular or is it just that they arent available in any stores you can walk into&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to go and shop for new windows phones several times now and the only real place you can browse them is online. Stores simply don't carry them, at least in San Diego and Los Angeles areas, 2 densely populated areas. I even went into a microsoft
 store and the only phone they had was an Elite X3, but no other options, and here's the kicker, when I voiced my frustration the sales rep in the Microsoft Store asked me what I had against iPhones and Androids. LOL SERIOUSLY?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No cellular providers seem to carry Windows Phones, no Electronics stores carry them, Microsoft Stores barely carry them (some don't). So seriously should we expect there to be a rebound for WP when there is no representation in the end user environment?</p>

<p>I totally agree with you. I made this posting:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>I
 have had a smartphone since 2002. </span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Granted,
 it was not a Windows phone, just a Palm. Back then, they were the most technically advanced (our friends from the "fruit" only made computers at that time).
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>But
 my first Windows phone was an hTC Tytn I, running Windows Mobile 5, in 2004 (I replaced my Palm because I accidentally dropped it in a WC, don't tell anyone, please!).
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What
 I mean is: the first iPhone came out ten years ago, in 2007. Smartphones had been around for some five years at that time (eons, in technology time!), and yet many people believe the Jobs (he was alive at the time) guys invented the smartphone concept.
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>My
 Windows 5 phone had a touch screen, full internet, full compatibility and sync capabilities with anything I had on any of my computers (I used three back then, because I managed a company in Guatemala, my office was in NYC and I had a personal PC at home).
 Oh! And it ran a full (not mock) version of MS Office!</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Since
 then, I have had several smartphones, all of them Win Phones: hTC, Samsung, LG, Nokia and now a Microsoft Lumia 950 (I keep my hTC M-One 8 and an old Nokia 600 as "muletti", which I use when traveling, both running Win 10, although older versions of the OS).</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>My
 Lumia (which is two years old in my possession, although the model had been out for about a full year when I got mine) has face recognition (granted, sometimes it says it does not recognise me, but Apple’s iPhone X’s face recognition feature failed twice during
 the demonstration, talk about an embarrassment!) and many other features that are being taunted as “new” by Apple.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Where
 I am going is: You guys have had the most advanced phones for way longer than Apple had a phone, and not many people even know they can buy a phone with full Windows 10 in it. What is wrong with you? Android is fine, if you are a kid who wants to play and
 do social media, watch videos and listen to music (all things which I do on my Win phone, by the way, since the very early days!). Apple is fine for snobs who try to impress people with the brand name on their devices.
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>However,
 if you want a smartphone that works, and helps you work, you need to go Windows. There is no way around it.
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Please,
 do not make it hard for the general public! You have the best product around, by far. Show it!</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

 Surface Phone is long overdue! However, if for some reason that escapes me you are not comfortable offering the best equipment in the market, just license your OS to everyone! It would take you like, maybe, fifteen minutes to have more phones running Win 10
 OS than Android. I can assure you that. You already have more devices running Windows than any other OS in the PC/tablets world.</span></p>

<p>EW1955 is basically my real name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;What I mean by (quote) a&nbsp;phone running a full version of windows 10 (unquote) is precisely that: I have Windows 10 as my phone's OS (build 16236) and both my PCs' OS (build 16278). There is nothing I do on the PCs that I cannot do on my phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am not sure if it is actually a full-full version. I participate in the "Windows Insider" program ("Slow Ring"). If you don't, I encourage you to do so, there are three different "rings", and the "Slow" one is the middle one. Read what they say, it is
 pretty clear what you get with each one.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 "build" 16278 on my PCs, and "build" 16236 on my phone (Lumia 950, the regular one, which I got from AT&amp;T for little money).&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am saying is that everything that I do on my PCs I have been able to do on my phone. Granted, I do not do too much, but I can run full MS Office, have like five different email accounts on Outlook format, have AutoCAD "Mobile" (which is a little more
 limited than the regular AutoCAD, but it's free, several apps (including the usual social media apps, several news and newspaper apps, ESPN, an FM radio and a TV app, Kayak and other trip apps (I travel a lot), WhatsApp, Netflix, several cloud apps, including
 OneDrive and DropBox, Pandora, "Scan2PDF" (which I find very helpful many times), my Starbucks card, my town's emergency app (just in case!), TED, Uber, YouTube, Viber, Zip-Unzip, Waze, the Yellow Pages and a couple of games (nothing too fancy, but, as you
 probably garnered by now, I'm not a kid, and would not know how to play them even if I had them installed) and a couple of printing apps (I find that my wife's HP printer responds better if I use its app).</p>
<p>My phone has not lost any of its original functionality, and, of course, each app or software piece comes with its own tutorial or instructions.</p>
<p>I don't know if you can actually do, for example, development work, on a phone running Win 10, but I don't need that, anyway.</p>
<p>I hope I have been clear. Please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any comment or questions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, because, you can't. Windows 10 mobile is not the same as Windows 10 for PC. The development of W10M was split off from W10 back in April (<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/04/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-16176-pc-build-15204-mobile/#JR9VLBKoIIf3RouH.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/04/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-16176-pc-build-15204-mobile/#JR9VLBKoIIf3RouH.97</a>)

<p>I understand, and that's what I thought, but there are some smart people out there that have done some pretty ingenious adaptations. When someone says they have done something I ask them to explain what they mean first, rather than telling them they are
 wrong and being a smart-allick, lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that WP10 is unable to handle x86 applications, but I have also read where some people have adapted with emulators some full versions of Win10 if only in a limited functioning way to Mobile Platforms. So while it is unlikely that someone has done
 this, its not completely bonkers that some have tried with limited success. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post though. :)</p>

<p>Yea, it really is sad that MS and their Partners seems to be "Reactive" instead of "Proactive". They seem to be waiting for people to start speaking well of their platform before trying to do anything about their image. Sadly their competition is proactive
 and cutthroat with smear campaigns. </p>
<p>What I mean is, most tech savvy people with "first hand experience" (not the arm chair experts) know that overall most Windows Phones especially the upper end models have awesome hardware and the OS is easy to use and stable. I don't know for sure what MS
 did to tick off their big corporate competitors but whatever they did has had their competition in overdrive mode trying to kill them. Maybe MS trying to break out into the hardware business has made their once partners turn into their Nemesis. But whatever
 the case the smear campaign ever since MS started their new direction has had so many people badmouth the whole thing that the average consumer is unwilling to even try it out and Independent Developers are no doubt turned off by MS trying to protect themselves.
 Big business is a severe hardball game, people don't realize how deep the game goes, the big boys don't just let the market dictate their profits, they engineer the market to insure them, it's simply how big business and the advertising industry works. But
 I hate to see good companies suffer because of it, especially when the company was trying to do something that the consumer was going to benefit from, instead the consumer gets hornswoggled into thinking he ought to avoid the very thing he was going to benefit
 from. Sad really, but ironic...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion for MS? They need to make a new phone quickly, actually multiple models. Sure fine, make you top notch phone that most cannot afford, but then you MUST make a good, stable, full featured entry level phone, one that everyone can afford that
 will&nbsp; make it worth it to the average person to try out the platform. DO NOT CUT CORNERS on the entry level phone, its sole purpose would be to demonstrate to the general public that all the negative hype was just bull'ony. After its release you must carefully
 monitor the negative troll reviews that the competitors will undoubtedly release just like always. You must also start a campaign to win over the hearts of Developers, like, YESTERDAY! You must be proactive in the marketing side of things, I used to think
 that over time the product would speak for itself, and it normally would, but not in today's world. Those who remain silent allow their competition to dictate what people believe. Sad. I have been in this game since windows 3.1 was cutting edge, I have seen
 the way the market has progressed and the way the competition has always been trying to get the upper hand through marketing and word of mouth. I have always enjoyed MS (except the Millennium OS and RT &gt;:(&nbsp; LOL). MS is quite innovative but for whatever reason
 they seem to have a divided focus, on what else I am not sure, but for such a big and accomplished company their mind seems definitely to be somewhere else. Who knows maybe they are working on something so big it will change everything. Maybe a Mobile OS that
 has a secondary x86 environment that operates independently within shielding the phone from legacy malware attacks. But whatever the case, the longer they leave what customers they have left wondering whats going on, the harder it will be to regain a profitable
 composure. They need to at least keep people in suspense with something.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been encountering the same problem for about the last month.</p>

</p><p>No matter what workbook or section I try and send a meeting to, I get the same error but with a different reference id each time it happens.</p>

    <title>Outlook choose profile pops up when I start windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susan3008  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook choose profile pops up when I start windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 profiles on Microsoft Outlook. &nbsp;The problem is that as soon as I start my computer, even before I open Outlook, the Choose Profile window opens up. &nbsp;It also tends to pop up when I "wake up" the laptop. &nbsp;The Choose Profile window that opens when
 I boot up is not real. &nbsp;By that I mean that if I choose a profile and hit OK, Outlook doesn't open. &nbsp; I still have to click on the Outlook icon and choose a profile. &nbsp;How can I get rid of the Choose Profile that opens when I am not trying to open Outlook?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I thought I had uploaded this screenshot as requested a week ago but I guess something went wrong. &nbsp;Anyway, here it is. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am confused by what you mean by "ticked on the wrong product." &nbsp;The screenshot below is what I see when starting the computer and when waking it up. &nbsp;The yellow Outlook opening window is not present behind the Choose Profile window as it is when properly
 opening the program. &nbsp;This window closes when I click OK or the X in the upper right hand corner. &nbsp;I would like to prevent this from automatically popping up.</p>

<p>How do I tell if they programs in the task are are shortcuts or not? &nbsp;The icons don't have the arrow on them. &nbsp;Does that mean they are the actual programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the startup folder on my computer (<strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) &nbsp;</strong>There were 4 items in the folder: &nbsp;</p>

<li>HP Digital Imaging Montitor</li><li>ISCTSystray</li><li>McAfee Security Scan Plus (which I would like to remove)</li><li>RealPlayer Cloud Service UI</li></ol>

            <p>McAfee Security Scan Plus can be uninstalled via Programs &amp; Features&gt;Uninstall a Program</p>
<p>That utility is often included in a free download, eg Adobe Flash Player; when you install any free software you should always pay close attention to any installation options.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84c569e3-7b9c-40e8-b7ff-777c8a6cee4a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing else untoward in the start-up folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the outlook data file on the desktop is the actual data file being used by outlook, when/if you move it to a documents location, when you next start Outlook it will complain that it cannot find the data file, you would then need to browse to the location
 you moved it to, to select it. OL will after this open without problems.</p>
<p>Since the desktop is not a standard location for an outlook data file, a user must have, for some reason located that data file on the desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you hover your mouse pointer over a task bar icon, eg Word, if its a shortcut, it will simply 'say' Word, if its the actual program running then a small window will appear, and clicking the window will bring the actual program window into focus</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open msconfig, the Startup tab, is there anything referencing MS Outlook there?

            <p>I moved the Outlook data file as you suggested and followed your instructions to have Outlook "find" it after rebooting. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hover over the Word icon in the task bar at the bottom of the screen I see Microsoft Word 2010 appears before I click it to open the program. &nbsp;Does that mean it is a shortcut? &nbsp;If the program is already open and I hover over the icon, then I see a
 small window or windows with all the open documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened msconfig, the Startup tab and was instructed to open the Task Bar to manage startup items. &nbsp;When I did that I got a long list of programs. &nbsp;Among them is Microsoft Office 2010 component and Microsoft Office Document Cache, but nothing specifically
 about Outlook.</p>

            The tabloid size is 11" x 17" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#Loose_sizes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#Loose_sizes</a>). Most inkjet and laser printers in US homes, schools, and offices can't handle any paper wider than 8.5".
 That means you'll have to select a software-only "printer" such as PDF output, and set the page size.
<br />
<br />
On the Page Layout tab of the ribbon, click Size and then click More Paper Sizes. In the dialog, click the paper size list and choose Custom Size at the bottom. Then enter the width and height as 11" and 17". If you get a warning that margins are outside the
 printable area, click Ignore.<br />

<h2>            Office 365 OneNote throws Error code&#58; 0xE402005F when trying to Sync some Sections of a Notebook</h2>
                    <p>I'm have an issue with one of my users and one of his OneNote Notebooks. The Notebook in question was created and saved into his OneDrive. When he opens the Notebook most of the Sections load correctly and display the information within them. There are 10
 Sections that do not load. No information is displayed in these Sections other then "We Couldn't open this section." I then check and noticed that there are sync errors for each of these 10 Sections which state "We're sorry, something went wrong during sync.
 We'll try again later. (Error code: 0xE402005F)." I then had the user check using the OneNote web client and the message of "Something went wrong and we couldn't load this content. Refreshing the browser may fix the problem" appears. A refresh does not fix
 the problem. This Notebook has existed for roughly a year. The user got a new laptop roughly 3 months ago. The user states that its been over 3 months since they tried to access these Sections so I'm not sure if the new laptop plays a part in the issue. I
 tried to look up this error code with only a few people stating the same issue but no real answers being provided. Any help in trying to figure out how to get these Sections back would be helpful or understanding what the problem is and how to prevent it in
 the future.</p>

<p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I notice you get the error message of "Something went wrong and we couldn't load this content. Refreshing the browser may fix the problem" appears in OneNote Online and
 an error message of ""We're sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again later. (Error code: 0xE402005F)." in OneNote desktop application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you try this: on the same computer, try opening the problematic notebook in OneNote Online in different browsers or starting the browser in private mode.</p>
<p>A.If these problematic sections can be opened in OneNote Online, please
<a href="https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio9diDnaDWAhWDw7wKHdsMDu0QFggpMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.office.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2FClose-a-notebook-in-OneNote-2016-for-Windows-d4b52723-6f33-430b-b1f7-35dbb07548a8&amp;usg=AFQjCNF294A4AwTmuVVvwFeDtRDyTLLAcw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
close the notebook in OneNote 2016</a> first and click Open in OneNote button to open it in OneNote 2016 to check if these sections can be synced.</p>
<p>B.I these problematic sections can't be opened in OneNote Online after you have tried the suggestions above, I'd suggest you check the followings:</p>
<p>1)Connect to a different network and try the steps above. For example, if you connect to your company network,<span>
</span>you can try to connect to your home network to check the outcome.</p>
<p>2)Try to open the notebook in OneNote Online and OneNote 2016 on a different computer to check whether he can sync these sections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps can't fix the problem, please let us know the outcome of them and we'd like to confirm some information for investigation:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>A screenshot of the error message of "</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Something
 went wrong and we couldn't load this content. Refreshing the browser may fix the problem</span><span>" appears in
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OneNote Online</span><span>
 and another one for the error message of "</span><span style="font-weight: bold">We're sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again
 later. (Error code: 0xE402005F).</span><span>" in OneNote 2016.</span></li><li><span>Is the notebook stored on the user's OneDrive personal or OneDrive for Business?</span></li><li><span>If the user creates a new notebook in his OneDrive, can the notebook be synced to OneNote 2016 without sync error?</span></li><li><span>I notice that you mentioned "The user states that its been over 3 months since they tried to access these Sections", what actions did the user
 perform before he gets the sync error? For example, share the notebook, change notebook locations and so on.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joanne</p>

<p>Hi Joanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried to open the Notebook in the web client in IE, Chrome, and Firefox with all three stating the same message ""Something went wrong and we couldn't load this content. Refreshing the browser may fix the problem"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried opening the file from the web from outside the corporate network (my home network) with the same results as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the user share the Notebook with me and then I opened it on my computer through the web and in the desktop client with the same results as the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information you have requested:</p>
<p>1. Desktop Client<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f491dbf9-4b8d-4993-a16a-068641582751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f491dbf9-4b8d-4993-a16a-068641582751" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>3. The user can create a new Notebook (saved to his OneDrive account) without issue. He also has several other older Notebooks that he uses that do not have this same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The only action in that 3 month window that the user can recall was getting a new computer. It had not been shared with anyone prior to today. It has never been moved from its location in his OneDrive (which when he got the new computer it automatically
 synced to his computer).</p>

<p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update and sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the screenshot you provided, I can see the problematic sections can't be opened in OneNote Online. And I notice you mentioned this has been over 3 months since you try to sync the notebook to
 a new PC.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this situation, I would suggest you go to the old computer to check whether these sections are synced to OneNote Online successfully.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you encounter any sync issues when syncing the notebook to OneNote Online from old PC, welcome to create a new thread in our forum and we will continue to help you.&nbsp;A new thread is opened to avoid
 the confusion and let other users in this forum refer to information clearly as well as effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone does charge through the USB cable with the PC though.</p>

<p>It is only one month old and bought from new on Orange contract. &nbsp;However I am not in the UK again until November.</p>

            Check whether the pin inside the charging socket of the phone is intact or broken. If its broken, take it to Nokia care and get it fixed.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>same problem occurred two days ago with my C7. Charging works fine with USB, none of the wall chargers works with the C7. They do charge a n X3-02 though, thus I know they do not cause the problem.</p>
<p>The center pin of the C7's charging socket is still visible, not bent, no apparent damage. Any other proposals before I take it to a nokia service point?</p>
<p>thx,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RoadsterQP</p>

            Just adjust the position of the charging head of the charger. There may be loose contact within it. If its not working, then a visit to Nokia care is the only option.

            probably a problem with the charging port.

<p><font>Same case here. </font></p>
<p><font>After about &nbsp;11.9 months, it charges well on USB but unpredicatable (<strong>but no loose contact for sure!!)</strong> on wall charging.</font></p>
<p><font>Other points:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font>Wire at the adapter end has got skinned. This is a Nokia basic design/quality problem because other 3-4 yrs old chargers with more abuse/use are still intact</font></li><li><font>The led promptly glows while charging is on for 8 hrs but holds no charge</font></li><li><font>suddenly yesterday the charging was full, for a change. I had stopped using the wall charging for &nbsp;a while &amp; then decided to go to nokia care to sort out &amp; as a cross check I tried &amp; it worked . Need to check if it is auto corrected!! Will
 decide after some more trials.</font></li><li><font>After this problem started, I am not on 3g always &amp; keep it on gsm only mode &amp; use power saving mode tp keep the charge longer.&nbsp;</font></li><li><font>I suspect that power saving mode &amp; 3g power sucking &amp; processor overload has also something to do with this problem.</font></li></ol>

<h2>            Outlook 2013&#47;2016&#58; More than one assigned category causes scrolling</h2>
                    <p>Starting with what I think was an Office update via Windows Update a few months back, when an email is assigned to more than one category, the second category is pushed down causing only the first to show along with a small scroll bar which you have to click
 to see the second category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The view used to appear as this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1ae1cfe-d4f3-4fd2-8e7d-ed4ac1f8d858" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Outlook renders the categories like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d12583f1-f79c-46c5-a9cc-05885e0eaca7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you scroll down, the second category will start to appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18abc9c5-1f1f-4579-877d-b537dda4cf26" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem only happens when an email message is assigned to two or more categories. If only one category is assigned, the problem goes away. The problem also temporarily disappears if you change the horizontal width of the reading pane, only to return
 after another message is selected. The problem seems to go away if the reading pane is set to appear at the bottom instead of the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen something similar in their copy of Outlook and know of a resolution?</p>

Any progress on this issue?<br />
I use categories for organizing my emails so it is quite annoying to have to scroll or resize to see all categories.</p>

<p>Hello Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. Generally, we don’t suggest customers install both Lync 2011 for Mac and Skype for Business on one device. It is suggested to delete Lync 2011 for Mac completely from your Mac and then just use Skype for Business for Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then open <strong>Keychain Access</strong> from <strong>/Applications/Utilities</strong> folder, delete all keychains starting with Skype for Business and Lync. After doing this, close all other applications, just open Outlook for Mac and Skype for Business
 for Mac, make sure that you have signed in the same account. If the presence still doesn't sync with Outlook for Mac, please follow the instructions in my first reply and collect the logs from Skype for
<strong>Business-&gt;Preference</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then upload the logs via private message. Please click on the link below to access your Private Message :

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried removing memory card if present to see if makes any difference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although you would need to backup essential data first, you could always try a reset to "out of box" state by keying in *#7370# followed by 12345 (default Nokia lock code unless altered by user)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As previous poster suggested, if after trying <font color="#00FF00">re-install</font> existing software using Ovi Suite problem remains this would point towards hardware rather than software issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>I have a thread with the same problem mentioned. In the meantime, if you wish to use the missing group, find a previous email that used it in your SENT mailbox and open it. Use copy and paste to copy the contacts into your new email. I copied all my groups
 this way into a WORD document so that I can bring it up whenever I am sending group emails using the same copy/paste method. Hope this will help until a solution is identified.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have actually recreated new groups using the technique you described and copying and pasting all the email addresses at once &nbsp;from previous sent emails into the new groups. I'd still like to know what happened to the original groups though - I'd assumed
 that my contacts were safely stored but not so confident about that now.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook thinks there are message unsent where there are no messages.</h2>
                    Upon closing Outlook which is with my Office 365, I get the following message: "You have messages in your Outbox waiting to be sent.&nbsp; If you exit now they won't be sent until the next time you start Outlook."&nbsp; There are no messages waiting either in Draft
 or Outbox in any folder.&nbsp; I have gone to each account and have and opened the Outbox and the Draft folders and clicked the "Cancel" button in the send/receive section.&nbsp; I still get the message.&nbsp; I am Windows 10 (I don't know what version but regularly update)
 and new to Office 365.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to get rid of this message?

    <title>internet explorer characters scrambled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryan_111222  say:</h3>
<h2>            internet explorer characters scrambled</h2>
                    <p>I have IE version 9 with a windows 7 OS.&nbsp; When I use IE, after awhile the characters become scrambled when I type in any type of input box, such as Dogpile searches, user ID, passwords, etc.&nbsp; To fix it I turn the caps lock on and back off and I can type
 again.&nbsp; But as soon as I tab to the next input box&nbsp; or visit another webpage the characters are scrambled again.&nbsp; If I reboot my computer it works for awhile without hitting the caps lock, but eventually the characters start scrambling again and I have to
 keep hitting caps lock.&nbsp; There is no problem in Windows Live, MS Word or any other program except IE.</p>
<p>What can I do to permanently fix this?</p>

<h2>            &#34;Cannot open item&#34; error from Outlook 2007 with public folder...</h2>
                    Hi Everyone,<br />
<br />
I have a client with Outlook 2007 (12.0.661.5003 sp3 mso 12.0.6662.5000) that can't open some public folder items.&nbsp; They can open calendar items, but not public folders that use a custom form.&nbsp; Other Outlook clients work just fine and can open the same item.&nbsp;
 We are using Exchange 2007.&nbsp; Oddly he can right click and print the item, or save the attachments just fine, he just can't open them.<br />
<br />
We've tried a detect and repair, wiping the OST file and letting it resink, clearing the forms cache.&nbsp; Any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            <p>The most important thing that was not mentioned was "what is the error that is being encountered"?</p>
<p>#1 - Is this custom form in question properly published to either the Public Folder itself or the Exch Org forms library and does the user have proper permissions to access everything?</p>
<p>#2 - Is it possible that not every contact created with a custom form of the same name used the same custom form from the same forms library or the form itself was initially published in one library and then deleted/published in another? Have seen cases
 where problems have occurred specifically because of that </p>

No, everyone else is fine and they can open items without a problem.<br />

            <p>As mentioned in a previous message - issue should be posed in the Exch client forum but a couple of last questions</p>
<p>Suspicion is that this problem is related to the custom form itself as it pretains to this system and items just based on similar things encountered with others but that could just be a coincidence. To that end</p>
<p>#1 - where has this custom form&nbsp;been published - Personal Forms Lib, Exch Org Lib and/or Public Folder itself? Is this form published in more than one library on the systems where everything works?</p>
<p>#2 - is this a case where these exact items could be opened previously and now cannot or is that something which isn't known with absolute certainty?</p>
<p>Everything points to this being an issue related to the custom form itself for whatever reason but that needs exact information regarding this particular system particularly as compared to the others and whether or not this is something that has gone from
 a working to non-working scenario.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We've tried uninstalling and reinstalling.&nbsp; I've wiped the forms directory and let it recreate it.&nbsp; Still no luck.<br />
<br />
Errors are now:<br />
<br />
Opening a custom form item in a public folder:<br />
<br />
The messaging interface has returned an unknown error<br />
if the problem persists, restart outlook<br />
<br />
Trying to open a form:<br />
<br />
The form you selected cannot be displayed<br />
<br />
The form is published in the public folder...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Alan<br />
<br />

            <p>Since you are working on an Exchange Server environment, and the issue is related to opening or creating custom forms, you may also post your question in Outlook IT pro:</p>
