            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Sounds like an inkjet All-In-One (AIO). See if Windows Update has a driver for you. Before you do however, make sure your printer is reflected in Device Manager. First, make sure your printer is plugged into a working USB port on your laptop. Then, go to
 Control Panel, click on Devices and Printers.&nbsp; Does your printer show up there? Is there a yellow triangle with an exclamation point in it? If there is, click on it, what does it say? Can you fix whatever problem it lists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it says no print driver is installed, does it give instructions for downloading a driver? Can you follow those directions? If it says to download a driver, does it give you a location, and can you get there (online)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't, go to Control Panel | Device Manager, navigate to the item in the tree called "Imaging Devices", click on that. Does your printer show up, if so what does it say? Is there a yellow triangle with an exclamation point in it. What is the error
 message? Can you fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't, go to Control Panel, last Item, Windows Update; double-click on it and when it opens navigate to the left-hand side of the window and find the "Check for Updates" option. Run it and select the driver which matches as close to your printer
 as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you come up with it? Post back here with what your results are, and we'll go from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Practically Get Computer to Turn On - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicmce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Practically Get Computer to Turn On</h2>
                    <p>So I have this problem where whenever I try to turn on my PC (Dell XPS), it will go through a short series of automatic repairs, run into some problems, and ultimately not turn on. (<strong>The problem has changed. It is described in paragraph 7, but feel
 free to read the rest for extra info</strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some backstory: The most, if not, one of the most recent Windows 10 updates caused my speakers to not work. They would occasionally produce a weird buzzing sound, but no audio from a&nbsp; game or Youtube video would come through. So, I reverted back to an older
 version of windows, and all was good, however the computer kept trying to automatically update me back to the update where my speakers broke. (It was one of those unavoidable updates where all you can really do Is postpone the time.) So I had to ultimately
 revert back a few times and just though: "If it will only do it when I'm not using my computer, then I'll just unplug it every time I go to bed. No power = no updates." So I did that and this morning when I turn it, on, well it doesn't really turn on. I think
 what happened was I jumped the gun on unplugging it, and shutdown my computer in the midst of doing something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great, so now you have a backstory, here's the problem, as described in order from pressing the power button:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powers on, all seems fine and is normal...</p>
<p>-Loading Icon Appears...</p>
<p>-Disk Checking, with the option to skip it...</p>
<p>-Whether skipped or not, disk checking leads to "Your PC ran into a problem", the all blue screen with a big ":(" a qr code, and a code: "BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO"</p>
<p>-Preparing Automatic Repair, --&gt; Diagnosing your PC --&gt; Automatic Repair: "Your PC did not start correctly"</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I can either restart my computer, which will just bring me back to where I already am, or choose "Advanced options"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advanced Options</p>
<p>&gt;Continue: Exit and Continue to Windows 10 --&gt; things listed above</p>
<p>&gt;Use a device: Use a USB drive, network connection, or Windows recovery DVD --&gt; Choose between "Onboard NIC (IPV4)" or "Onboard NIC (IPV6) (I don't think this is really an option for me)</p>
<p>&gt;Turn off your PC --&gt; Just restarts the whole cycle from the beginning</p>
<p>&gt;Troubleshoot: Reset your PC or see advanced options --&gt; Reset your PC/Factory Image Restore/Advanced Options</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting My PC Won't work: It runs into a problem and can't do it</p>
<p><strong>Factory Image restore</strong> --- Ok so there was an option to "<strong>repair system</strong>" here, so I did it while writing this just to see what it did, and there was an issue with the partition table that it repaired. I restarted the system
 and now I'm just in an endless loop of "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart", and restarting. There is no opportunity to access the desktop at all. I have no clue as to what to do: there's no buttons to click on, nothing.
<strong>Just an endless cycle of restarting and blue screen error messages</strong>. And now I'm disappointed because I thought I was getting somewhere and also I wrote most of this for nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I have figured out how to navigate to the <strong>boot options menu</strong> (F8 -&gt; F12), and "<strong>BIOS Setup</strong>" (F8 -&gt; F2), however I have no clue as to what to do in said menus; I need lots of guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is now pretty much unusable, any and all help is greatly appreciated. Please let me know if you have any knowledge of this issue or a solution,</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information that you’ve provided, it’s most likely related to a faulty driver. Since you’re able to navigate to the boot options menu, we suggest that you try to select
<strong>Startup Repair</strong> and check if it will help resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa6b6d1a-11da-455e-bde1-fe5180e5ffd6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa6b6d1a-11da-455e-bde1-fe5180e5ffd6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, if it’s still the same result, let’s start your PC in <strong>safe mode</strong> from the
<strong>Advanced Options</strong>. This will proceed to load Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services to help us troubleshoot further. From the boot options menu, go to
<strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong> and Restart buttons. Next, select
<strong>Safe Mode</strong> from the Advanced Boot Options list.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5f52779-163a-4601-8bfa-863bc1b8c0c0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5f52779-163a-4601-8bfa-863bc1b8c0c0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you’ve entered the Safe Mode environment, we recommend that you <strong>uninstall
</strong>and <strong>delete </strong>the <strong>display driver from Device Manager</strong>. After that, restart your computer to reinstall the drivers automatically and check the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b4b1691-4980-4530-ba92-30401b7b0f13?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b4b1691-4980-4530-ba92-30401b7b0f13?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We’re just here if you need further help.</p>

            I appreciate you help, however that is not the boot menu I am talking about. Or at least, I don't think it is. If I can somehow find that specific menu you mean, that would be amazing, but the menu I can access with the F8, F12, and F2 keys is very minimalistic,
 with a darker blue, and grey pixelated text, controlled by the arrow keys and enter. The first image is of the boot menu options (F8 + F12) and the second is of the BIOS setup (F8 + F2), or the first option in the first menu under "other options". The other
 4 pictures are just the different tabs under BIOS setup.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1383ca2d-4d84-4184-bffe-6914ef6aaa8f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1383ca2d-4d84-4184-bffe-6914ef6aaa8f?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1597c530-cccb-4a79-b997-e1f6e62ac1b0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1597c530-cccb-4a79-b997-e1f6e62ac1b0?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9eedf87-a8c0-4681-bda4-19f7677d5242?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9eedf87-a8c0-4681-bda4-19f7677d5242?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecc49018-5550-4a05-b502-5512f1

<p>
</p><p><strong>What is Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 is the name for Microsoft's next generation client operating system.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happened to Windows 9?</strong></p>
<p><span>There was never a Windows 9, Microsoft skipped this number and went to 10 instead. Company officials decided to choose 10 because they believe this release is a 'Perfect 10' and to also signify this is the last major release of Windows. There will
 still be revisions of Windows 10 called Feature Updates, just don't expect there to be a Windows 11, Windows 12 etc. Initially revealed at BUILD 2014 as a minor update called ‘Threshold’, Windows 10 was originally intended be a minor Update 2 for Windows 8.1.
 Somewhere along the way, plans changed and the operating system evolved into the major revision we have today.</span></p>

To date, Windows 7 introduced the most editions (Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate, Enterprise, Embedded). Since the release of Windows 8, many of these editions have been consolidated to more specific devices and form factors. In addition to SKUs, Microsoft also provides Windows specific architectures that target the CPU (brains of your computer) in what are known as 32 and 64 bit versions.

</p><p><strong><span>Is build 10240 of Windows 10 made available July 29th 2015 recommended for everyday use?
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The Windows 10 (which&nbsp;was made available to the general public on July 29th 2015)&nbsp;is a complete copy of the software that is designated as ready and fit for use in production environments. To reach this milestone, a particular build has to go through
 a series of thorough regression test and optimizations to reach a level of quality satisfactory for production.&nbsp;Unlike pre-release builds of Windows 10&nbsp;the Windows 10 available today&nbsp;does not expire.</span></p>

</p><p><strong>Will my Antivirus be compatible with Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely not. Windows 10 will require that you have a version of your Antivirus or other security software&nbsp;that is designed for Windows 10. It is recommended that you uninstall your current Antivirus before intiating the upgrade. If you have a subscription
 that has not expired, contact the developer to find out about Windows 10 support. Most Antivirus utilities should be upgraded by the time Windows 10 launches. If your subscription is still active, then you should be entitled to a compatible update for Windows

My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan.

<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens to the recovery partition used by my previous version of Windows?</strong><br />
In some cases, it might become&nbsp;inoperable. That is why it is strongly advised you backup before upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Suppose I need to go back to Windows 8 or Windows 7?</strong><br />
You will either need to have recovery media or request recovery media from the manufacturer of your computer or try rolling back within the first&nbsp;10 days of upgrading.</p>

</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, emails, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords,

</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for Windows
 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

<p>Windows 10 uses approximately 10 GBs of disk space. The minimum disk space available is to facilitate the installation process. Some install files are compressed and need to be expanded during setup. Some files are temporary and are deleted during or after
 installation. Also, because you might have data and apps on the hard disk, they will be moved around during migration.</p>

</p><p><strong>Will Windows 10 require UEFI and Secure Boot? </strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 works just fine on legacy BIOS systems. New devices that that come preinstalled with Windows 10 later this summer must have UEFI by default and Secure Boot enabled at the factory.</p>

<p>Windows 10 will certainly be available as a digital download of course. You can always create your own backup copy too either on a USB thumbdrive or blank DVD. Microsoft has&nbsp;provided an updated Media Creation Tool for Window 10&nbsp;which streamlines downloading

<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What does lifetime of the device mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, Microsoft will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows
 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and&nbsp;5 years extended support.</p>

</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>

<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>

<span>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.

<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am on a slow connection or I don't have access to the Internet. Is there an option to request backup media?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft says: "We’ll have options available for users who can’t download through Windows Update." These options have yet to be announced.

<p>Microsoft recently noted the following options available:</p>

<p><strong>What happens if I reinstall Windows using the recovery partition? </strong>
</p>
<p>Windows 10 will be reinstalled.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I get a product key, can I get a product key?</strong></p>
<p>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-activate-the-latest-windows-10-build/33f31475-93b3-4d1c-812f-4b21fbd807a7">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-activate-the-latest-windows-10-build/33f31475-93b3-4d1c-812f-4b21fbd807a7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

</p><p><strong>What does Windows as a Service entail?</strong></p>
<p>Since the introduction of Windows Update as part of Windows, Microsoft has delivered updates as way to keep Windows updated and secure. This has always been the way the company keeps commercial versions of Windows on the market current.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10, Microsoft is making significant changes to this model by delivering new methods of servicing Windows. Taking into account we now live in a mobile, constantly connected world, where threats happen all the time. Part of the solution to this
 is to keep users current by providing the latest updates&nbsp;as soon&nbsp;as they are&nbsp;available in addition to delivering features as soon as they ready too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will do this using three types of service branches for Windows 10:</p>

<p>No, Enterprise customers will continue to service and manage their Windows 10 clients the same way they do today. Here is what Terry Myerson had to say:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>We understand that businesses require choice in how updates are delivered, and at what pace. So as I discussed on September 30th, with Windows 10, businesses will be able to pick the speed of innovation that is right for each
 group of their users, rather than rely on a one size fits all solution.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Business customers will be able to opt-in to the fast-moving consumer update pace, or lock-down mission critical environments to receive only security and critical updates to their systems. And businesses will have an additional
 option for systems that aren’t mission critical, but need to keep pace with the latest innovations while having the benefit to install updates after they have been tested in the broad market. And the choice isn’t one or the other for businesses; we expect
 that most corporations will require a mix of these options to accommodate their business scenarios. Take for example an investment bank, where mission critical systems on the trading floor receive only security updates, whereas mobile devices for financial
 advisors are kept up to date with the latest feature innovations – enabling the appropriate pace of updates for each device.</em></p>

            Syncing is handled through OneDrive, there is no local network syncing, which I personally think would have been a great options for users with limited bandwidth.

<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 had introduced local [USB, hotspot]&nbsp;syncing I could&nbsp;consider Windows&nbsp;tablets &amp; phones in the future. I quite like the idea of having the same OS on everything.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>way back, early 2013, for a limited period of time one could purchase an upgrade from Windows 7-&gt;Windows 8.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Meaning to say that once upgrade of version 10 is being installed on a -clean- HDD formatted pc,
</p>
<p>the setup will require both the Windows 10 key, then notice it is an upgrade, and subsequently ask
</p>
<p>for either the Windows 7 or Windows 8 key (OEM or retail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way it is not necessary to first install 7 or 8 and then install v10 over it.</p>
<p>

<p>it is an upgrade and the key of a previous version should additionally be entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: </p>
<p>I am using full retail versions only, i.e. sofar I have never installed a Windows upgrade,

            <p>Thanks for the information in the article.&nbsp; One thing that was not answered is the question of which most concerns me.&nbsp; Will the Windows 10 upgrade fix the multiple problems I have encountered with Windows 8.1?&nbsp;&nbsp; These problems include but is not limited
 to the following:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; Constant freezing and shut down of Excel while working with the product.&nbsp; Message - "Microsoft Excel has stopped working"&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;Attachments not appearing in my e-mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) After upgrading from windows 8 to 8.1 several programs stopped
 working correctly such as scanning from my printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the answer to any of these problems is no I don't think I will be continuing with windows products.&nbsp; After the frustrations I have encountered with windows 8.1, I was on the verge of ditching the whole system to try out Apple products until a friend mentioned
 that they are about to release Windows 10.&nbsp; So, one more chance to get it right Microsoft people.&nbsp; I am looking forward to an upgrade away from 8.1
<strong>forever!!</strong></p>

            <p>If it printed in Windows 7 it should work in Windows 10.<br />
Just wait, a driver ought to be released - by the company or in a Windows 10 update version.<br />
<br />
No specific driver released for Windows 7 or 8 even released for my old HP printer.<br />
In Windows 10 I can use it to print, installing nothing, using a driver for the HP series detected by Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; However it fails to provide all the options - SOLVED rather easily:<br />
I&nbsp; installed my favorite ArcSoft image processing program (for XP) into Windows 10 and printed using that no problem at all.&nbsp; Note that program wouldn't install in Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However an even older printer&nbsp; - no luck in Windows 7-8-10,&nbsp; only XP actually prints.<br />

<p>Is this a required program to run on my system?</p>
<p>Is it necessary to be there???</p>

<p>

                    <p>After a windows 10 update on Dec 16th, my laptop will no longer connect to the internet. &nbsp;All the other computers in the house still connect with no problem. &nbsp;Troubleshooting report tells me that the Windows Sockets registry entries required for network
 connectivity are missing. Also says one or more network protocols are missing on this computer. &nbsp;Yesterday it told me the update number...today it shows no updates....should I just Uninstaller it?</p>

<p>Hi MaW FURY.</p>
<p>I am in the same situation. I have tried connecting the Xbox One Kinect. I just thought it would be compatible. Obviously not. I have not been able to find anything else so I will be interested in any comments on here.</p>

<p><span>To use your existing&nbsp;</span><strong>Xbox One Kinect</strong><span>&nbsp;Sensor with a new&nbsp;</span><strong>Xbox One S</strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong>Xbox One</strong><span>&nbsp;X console, you'll need an&nbsp;</span><strong>Xbox

 360 Kinect</strong><span>Sensor is not&nbsp;</span><strong>compatible with Xbox One&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Thanks Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't know until tomorrow if your solution worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Apps I am talking about (starting randomly) are Microsoft Apps, browsers, Filezilla, etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically maybe any apps in the taskbar (most likely) or maybe apps I have used that day?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get up in the morning or have not used my computer for a while during the day, when I come back there are several windows open on the desktop (HP All-in-one computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There appeared to be some error(s) in your script so I'm not sure if it ran successfully.</p>

            This sounds drastic, but I recommend you perform a reset.
<br />
<br />Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset

<p>I contacted HP yesterday and they suggested it was a touch screen issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Problem disappeared once touch screen HID was disabled in device manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I enabled touch screen again about 6 hours ago (also cleaned screen) and problem has not reappeared since even tho I now have put 15 apps on taskbar.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">So hopefully problem is solved.</span></p>

<p>?? juste gears? y'a le moteur de recherche BING qui va être intégrer au LIVE, y'a G.R.F.S. (ubisoft) qui va se jouer avec Kinect, tous les futurs jeux Tom Clancy's vont être compatiblent avec la Kinect, 4 grands titres EAsports vont arriver sur Kinect en
 2012 (PGA tour, NFL, FIFA et l'autre n'a pas été révélé), StarWars Kinect, Youtube sur le LIVE, Interface a commande vocal, TV live sur la xbox 360, Halo Anniversary, Halo 4 (même si je ne trippe pas sur la série), Forza 4, MW3, BF3, Gears3, jeux au format
 XGD3, Elder Scrolls: Skyrim et plus encore! &nbsp;Moi je suis satisfait des nouveautés annoncés d'ici 2013 (délais de 1 ans et demi). Je suis aussi content qu'ils décident d'exploité le capteur Kinect. Et la 3DS moi je ne trippe pas du tout. Il parrait que ce n'est
 pas très "exitant" de jouer au 3DS... TK c'est ce que j'ai entendu dire! Sans rancune! A+

                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I having been suffering a weird problem with my Win 8.1 machine. Sometimes, either on cold boot or restart, my desktop icons won't load until after 10-15 seconds. During that period I cannot right click on the desktop, or access it with via Explorer.
 Once the icons loads, it's just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there is a solution! I am now hesitant to put any files on the desktop in fear of unable to access them during an emergency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Muffa,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for your posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue could happen due to any third party program or any corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span>I would also suggest you to run Microsoft Safety Scanner to ensure that your computer is free from virus.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></strong></span><strong><br />

<p><span><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the issue if it persists in <strong>Safe Mode</strong>, if the issue doesn't persist in Safe Mode then place the computer in Clean Boot state and check which third party program or app is causing this issue<strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: Follow the link below to boot your computer in safe mode:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue does not persist in the safe mode with networking then there is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer is causing the issue.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest that you perform clean boot and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<br />In the run dialog box, type in inetcpl.cpl and press Enter.
<br />
<br />Go to Connections&gt;LAN Settings.
<br />
<br />Is "use a Proxy server for your LAN" checkbox checked?

            Hello,
<br />
<br />This is widely reported and known issue at the moment with Photos app. We're expecting a fix from Microsoft, in upcoming Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />As of now, you can use classic Windows Photo Viewer to view photos:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/open-images-with-windows-photo-viewer-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/open-images-with-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />To edit Photos, you can use MS Paint or third-party program such as Paint.net, IrfanView.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi Frank,
<br />
<br />This is caused by a bug in the latest Windows 10 update
<br />
<br />Hundreds of users have been reporting this over the last few days
<br />
<br />Hopefully Microsoft will release a patch for this bug soon as there is no fix currently
<br />
<br />Please report this on the Feedback Hub, the more users that report this, the quicker Microsoft will come out with a patch
<br />
<br />On your PC, press the Windows Key + F to open the feedback Hub

            I reported this on the Feedback Hub and then I tried the Virtual Agent which was virtually useless, kept asking if I was having a problem with installing something on Xbox, and after I kept hitting NO that's not my problem, it did ask if I wanted to chat
 with a live agent and BINGO!&nbsp; I let a Sarah Ruth D have remote access and she did her best to fix it then she bumped me up to a Level 2 Tech, Dave P, and he's the MAN!&nbsp; It took about an hour and a half total but he fixed it and I can now open pics in Photo
 no problem and it didn't cost me a dime.&nbsp; Thanks again Sarah Ruth D and Dave P for all your help.&nbsp; You guys are GREAT!<br />

                    I have a few friends that prefer Ps over than xbox, they asked "why i prefer xbox?", that because im not a fan of halo or gears (im mostly a fable fan, but you know theres not much of that) but it was so easy for me to say that i prefer xbox because of
 the community and how xbox its always so cool with his customers, so.. now i wanna hear your reasons.<br />
<br />
You may comment in the language you prefer.<br />
Btw if you are multi thats cool too.<br />
<br />
Tengo algunos amigos que prefieren PS sobre xbox, ellos me preguntaron "porque prefiero xbox?", eso porque no soy un fan de halo o gears (soy mas un fan de fable, pero ya saben que de eso no hay mucho) pero fue muy facil para mi decir que prefiero xbox por
 su comunidad y como xbox es tan genial con sus clientes, asi que.. ahora diganme sus razones.

Pueden responder en el idioma que quieran.<br />

            I'm primarily Xbox because I just prefer the console &amp; the games available on it.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I've got a PS4 there too which hasn't been on for months now but it's still there should I fancy picking up God of War or trying to play The Last of
 Us, but most of my gaming happens to be on Xbox.&nbsp; The added value of Game Pass (and even more now I have Ultimate!) is a key factor as well, lets be honest here having over 100 games at my disposal is a bit of a god send for those days where boredom sets in!

            I am a 100% Xbox player. Probably the biggest reason I stay Xbox is to maintain and continue my gamerscore. After that, I obviously love the services they provide like games with gold and gamepass. I will be here for a long time to come. :)

<p>Games, friends, features, and controller. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit - I'll expand a little. I'm a big fan of Gears of War, and I've grown to love the Forza Horizon series too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went with the Xbox One at the start of this gen because I was more interested in the games that were coming at launch and the ones that were on there way but got delayed or canceled. (Ryse, KI, Titanfall, Sunset Overdrive, Quantum Break, Scalebound).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, Microsoft bought the Gears IP, which pretty much guaranteed a new game was coming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also liked some of the features and the "all-in-one" focus. From voice commands and Kinect games, snap mode (it's gone, but at least there is an achievement overlay now), and the HDMI passthrough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having the best graphics has never been a priority for me. If it was, I'd upgrade my PC. For me, I like having a game console that can do almost anything else too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that in mind, I love how much support the Xbox team has given the console this gen. Sure, I might not use all of them, but it's nice knowing the options are there just in case. Whether it be external hard drives (which the PS4 eventually got too), or
 different media / video formats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I feel like the Games with Gold program, Microsoft Rewards, and the odd promotional offer have provided me with lots of value / content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example, I had Gold until January 2022 thanks to Microsoft Rewards, and I also took advantage of the $1 upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate. This means that I not only get 4 games every month (half I get to keep), but it also gives me access to the 100+
 titles in Game Pass including Microsoft's first parties on the day they launch.&nbsp;</p>

            I had a PS4, it sat there for year collecting dust so I sold it. The Xbox &amp; Switch get used the most in this house, with that being said I game mostly on Xbox. Some of my favorite franchises are on there .... Halo, Gears of War, Fable. Also the whole argument
 about exclusives is old, most of my buddies game on Xbox so thats where I’ll be!! Besides its about how much fun you have while gaming!!

            Also wanted to add that I find the controller vastly superior. That that is arguably one of the things you interact with the most when gaming. :)

            The only reason I'm still w/ Xbox is because I'm stuck with it. Mobile gaming isn't an option as my phone has only 2gb of free space. My Dell Inspiron 15 3000 series can barely run any games.

<p>I started on playing on a PS1 and then got a PS2, I then got a Xbox 360 when it came out and I have stayed with Xbox since. The reason I have not gotten a PlayStation is because of the amazing support Microsoft have giving to Xbox. I never look at the exclusives
 but the systems instead and for me Xbox is superior. But&nbsp; that's just my opinion.</p>

            So, I've been doing some research on this make and model and it turns out the Zoostorm 7010-0317B dates back to 2014. This does not make it impossible the system is simply not compatible with the Creators Update. My advice is to try downgrading to an older release such as Windows 10 1607 or reinstall the original version of Windows that came with the system.

Step 1: follow instructions to download the Windows 10 1607 ISO:
https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/24-how-to-download-the-latest-windows-10-iso-files-directly-using-your-web-browser/

Step 2: create a bootable copy:

Step 3: perform a clean install:

You should also contact Zoostorm support directly and asked them about compatibi

<p>Hello Bjartmar Egill Harðarson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the issue: Skype for Business show Blank or black screen when sharing, you may try to update device drives via Windows Device Manager, close all applications that may be consuming
 your bandwidth or decreasing performance, and if there’s any anti-virus or scanner, temporarily disable it to test this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’d like to confirm whether this issue occurs when sharing in meetings, or in calls? Could you please provide the full version number of Skype for Business desktop client? If
 you have any updates regarding this issue, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 559 laptop. Last week it self installed the latest Build, moving the old build to Windows.old and promptly becoming so unstable it wont even run long enough for the 'Go back to an earlier Build' without the BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried booting from DVD, activation the Administrator account, a six hour chkdsk c: /f /r, restore to a previous version (it said it failed because of AV???).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am left with pulling the hard disk and manually restoring the stuff in Windows.old folder.</p>

The expectation among users should be that they will either need to upgrade to final release or reinstall their previous version of Windows after they have completed their evaluation of the Preview. Microsoft officials recently indicated the intention of having the preview releases support upgrades to the final version. This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM. With the excitement surrounding the arrival of a new major release of Windows and the more public approach to testing Windows pre-release version in comparison to previous releases under development, a lot of persons who are normally not exposed to beta testing are jumping in without hesitation.

<h2>            Secondary drive folders in root are showing on desktop</h2>
                    I'm having an issue where folders stored at the root of my secondary drive (W: in my case) are displaying on the desktop.&nbsp; For example, if I have a directory called W:\foo, a folder named 'foo' will show up on my desktop.&nbsp; The Properties window shows the
 location correctly (W:\), but I don't understand why it's showing up on the desktop as well.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?

            Hi Zachary
<br />
<br />I have seen this many times before, at some point someone tried to move your Desktop folder, possibly by accident . . .
<br />
<br />This will most likely need a Registry fix . . 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address Bar at the top and hit Enter
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />Please provide a screenshot of the resulting Registry Editor window . .
        </p>

<p>Have you closed your previous account (Windows Live ID) permanently? Or did you delete your profile from your console (Delete Profile Only/Delete Profile and Items)?</p>

<p>Your membership is tied to that account, if you only deleted it from your console then you can just download it again. You will need the e-mail and password you used when you first made that account in order to download the profile again. Follow the instructions
 in taidara's post.</p>

<p>You will need to contact XBOX Support and give them the gamertag and they should be able to tell you the e-mail associated with the account as long as you can answer their questions. With that e-mail you can then reset the password.</p>
