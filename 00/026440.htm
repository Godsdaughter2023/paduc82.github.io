<h2>            Unstable mouse cursor on Outlook home page</h2>
                    
<p>I've recently installed Office 2016 and everything appeared to be working fine until I launched Outlook 2016. The mouse cursor vibrates between circle (wait) and pointer VERY rapidly - not allowing me in most instances to access anything on the left side
 or&nbsp;on the rest of the screen for that matter&nbsp;- like other folders / e-mail boxes, etc. When it does allow, it is VERY slow and the mouse cursor continues to 'vibrate' making Outlook 2016 just about unusable. I've launched all other 2016 applications like Word,
 Excel, PowerPoint, Access, etc., and the problem never occurs -&nbsp;just in&nbsp;Outlook. I've rebooted numerous times - but when you launch Outlook 2016, it's right back. When I can get an e-mail to open, the cursor within that window is stable and allows normal things
 to be done with the mouse. So, it appears only the main Outlook page trying to look at e-mail (not the Outlook today page). Running on an HP ENVY Desktop with Windows 10 and Kaspersky / Malwarebytes installed. Also running Logitech control center with MX-10
 Logitech mouse.... HELP!!</p>

<p>Hi Will,</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.Do any other users in your organization encounter the same issue?<br />
2.To check if the issue is related to the profile, try to create a new profile via Control Panel-&gt;Mail-&gt;Show Profile-&gt;Add
<br />
3.How do you install Office 365 suites? Do you download them in the portal?<br />
4.Which plan are you using, Office 365 Business, Office 365 Enterprise or else?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Zoey</p>

<p>Ok - so I uninstalled Kaspersky, rebooted, Outlook worked as expected. Rebooted, reinstalled Kaspersky, problem in Outlook was back. Thinking the problem is with Kaspersky. Installed Bitdefender, all is working as expected. As far as in concerned , problem
 resolved. </p>

    <title>Facebook issues with Internet Explorer 11. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Facebook issues with Internet Explorer 11.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, bought surface with windows 8 onboard and was excited how awesome IE10 is, but when I updated to W8.1 and IE11 I can't say that anymore. Amongst other issues the most annoying is that I CAN'T browse Facebook normally as if I scroll down a post and comments
 in my newsfeed it suddenly jumps to the very beginning of the post unless&nbsp;I&nbsp;hold the screen all the time. The same happens if I click links or likes in FB comments. There was no such problem with IE10.</p>
<p>And yes, I tried compatibility view and all other hooks from knowledgebase and forums, all the same. I would be also happy to roll back to IE10 but suspect it's impossible. Very annoying, please help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I did, however since I have vision problems&nbsp;the app&nbsp;is not good option for me as the font is too small and is not adjustable unlike webpage.</p>
<p>In addition the app is not user friendly and does not have lots of must-have customization features unfortunately.</p>

</p><p>You may check if issue persists in Clean Boot.</p>

</p><p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />

    <title>create an unbound report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwarren78  say:</h3>
<h2>            create an unbound report</h2>
                    <p>Here's my Objective: I'm creating a report that totals data from a query and compares it to the previous year from another sub query. Each query is set on a date range set by the user using an unbound form (same unbound form for both queries). eg. 9/1/12
 to 9/17/12</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current Year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous Year</p>
<p>Store&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Claims&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ Written&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Store&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Claims&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ Written</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Queries work properly now but when I try to creat a report they conflict each other (only diplays #NAME?)...so I'm trying to create an unbound report that will show the data from both queries on one report.&nbsp; Unfortunately I'm still showing the #NAME?
 when I view the report. What am I doing wrong here? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW: Name of main query is CCRv2 sub query is CCRSub (shows previous year's data)&nbsp;and Date range form is YearComp</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I run each query by themselves they work like they are suppose to</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the current SQL data source for the report.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT CCRv2.[Store #], CCRv2.[Start Date], CCRv2.[Claim #], CCRv2.Expr1, CCRv2.Expr2, CCRv2.[Insurance $], CCRv2.Expr3, CCRv2.[Written Sales], CCRSub.[Store #], CCRSub.[Start Date], CCRSub.[Claim #], CCRSub.Expr1, CCRSub.Expr2, CCRSub.[Insurance $], CCRSub.Expr3,
 CCRSub.[Written Sales] FROM CCRSub, CCRv2;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with that SQL there is no relationship made because if I make one it shows the data from one but not the other.&nbsp; In doing that though it says that CCRv2 can refer to more the one table listed in the FROM clause</p>

            <p>An unbound report is very unusual and I can't see how it would help in your situation.</p>
<p>It appears(?) that both your CCRc2 and CCRsub queries are Total type queries.&nbsp; If so, then you should be able to Join them on the Store#, and I assume you are doing that.&nbsp; The problem I think you are having is that the field names are the same in both queries,
 or those queries include multiple tables with some field names in common.&nbsp; In either case, you can get what you want by just aliasing the names so they are different when you use your posted query.</p>
<p>For example you really need to cgange the default field names from Expr1, 2 and 3 to simething distinctive like ThisYearTotalX, Y and Z and PrevYearX, Y and Z. Similarly for other fields with the same name.</p>
<p>If that doesn't allow you to Join the tables correctly, the problem may be in the&nbsp;CCRc2 and CCRsub queries and if you need further help, we'll have to see those queries too.</p>

            <p>I think the issue might be that these queries are both getting their data from the same tables</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SQL for CCRv2: SELECT [Insurer Contacts].[Claim #], [Insurer Contacts].[Store #], [Claim Dates].[Start Date], [Insurance Status].[Current Status], IIf([Current Status]="Cancelled" Or [Current Status]="Marked Not Sold",1,0) AS Expr1, IIf([Insurance $]&gt;0,1,0)

FROM ([Insurer Contacts] LEFT JOIN [Insurance Status] ON [Insurer Contacts].[Claim #] = [Insurance Status].[Claim #]) LEFT JOIN [Claim Dates] ON [Insurer Contacts].[Claim #] = [Claim Dates].[Claim #]<br />
GROUP BY [Insurer Contacts].[Claim #], [Insurer Contacts].[Store #], [Claim Dates].[Start Date], [Insurance Status].[Current Status], [Insurance Status].[Insurance $], [Insurance Status].[Written Sales]<br />
HAVING ((([Claim Dates].[Start Date]) Between [Forms]![YearComp]![Start Date] And [Forms]![YearComp]![End Date]));<br />
</p>
<p>SQL for CCRSub: SELECT [Claim Dates].[Start Date], [Insurer Contacts].[Claim #], [Insurer Contacts].[Store #], [Insurance Status].[Current Status], IIf([Insurance Status]![Current Status]="Cancelled" Or [Insurance Status]![Current Status]="Marked Not Sold",1,0)
 AS Expr1, IIf([Insurance Status]![Insurance $]&gt;0,1,0) AS Expr2, [Insurance Status].[Insurance $], IIf([Insurance Status]![Written Sales]&gt;0,1,0) AS Expr3, [Insurance Status].[Written Sales]<br />

 #]<br />
WHERE ((([Claim Dates].[Start Date]) Between [Forms]![YearComp]![Start Date]-360 And [Forms]![YearComp]![End Date]-360));</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently I have taken off any relationship on the 2 queries in the report til I figure this out. When I run the query builder that way all the info shows but I get that prompt about the FROM clause if I run the report. When I create a relationship, data
 from one query will show but not the other. The queries are actually set up to show all records and I was going to hide that in the report, only showing the totals</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh and my primary key is actually by the Claim # to keep duplicate data from happening. That is the one thing that is unique to each record</p>

            <p>Well, that's not what I expected.&nbsp; I can see no reason why the first query is a Totals type query since you do not use an aggregate function on any field.&nbsp; If you turn off the Total row, the query will be simpler and use a WHERE clause instead of incorrectly
 using a HAVING clause.</p>
<p>But as I said before, I think the primary problem is that both queries return the same field names.&nbsp; I think you should at least&nbsp;change the second query to something like:</p>
<p>SELECT [Claim Dates].[Start Date] As PrevStartDate, [Insurer Contacts].[Claim #] As [PrevClaim #], [Insurer Contacts].[Store #] As [PrevStore #], [Insurance Status].[Current Status] As [PrevCurrent Status], IIf([Insurance Status]![Current Status]="Cancelled"
 Or [Insurance Status]![Current Status]="Marked Not Sold",1,0) AS PrevExpr1, IIf([Insurance Status]![Insurance $]&gt;0,1,0) AS PrevExpr2, [Insurance Status].[Insurance $] As [PrevInsurance $], IIf([Insurance Status]![Written Sales]&gt;0,1,0) AS PrevExpr3, [Insurance
 Status].[Written Sales] As [PrevWritten Sales]<br />
FROM ...</p>
<p>Then the final query (and report) can refer to the fields unambiguously.</p>

            <p>I think the unbound report was my suggestion, and I'll stand by it. You can create an unbound report by creating a new Report, and just not selecting ANYTHING as the recordsource. You can then add your two reports (current and previous year) to it as Subreports,
 with nothing in their Master or Child Link Fields.</p>

            I was able to figure it out. I changed the query to do the totals instead of listing all records and changed the Expr like you suggested.&nbsp; It worked! I'm finally moving forward. Thanks guys!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this ARRAY formula and see below on how to enter it. ARRAY enter and drag down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=MAX(FREQUENCY(IF(A2:M2=0,COLUMN(A2:M2)),IF(A2:M2&lt;&gt;0,ROW(A2:M2))))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.<br />

<p>Hello i have a technical problem with my new Nokia 5310 XpressMusic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have saved people's UK numbers in my phone in the format 0797.... When people ring me, the phone displays the name that is calling. But when the same person sends me a text message, it comes up with the number and doesn't indicate the name. This is frustrating.
 I have tried to save the mobile number as +44797...., but the opposite happens where the phone recognises the text message name, but when they ring me it just hows the number. please help me fix this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If you got your phone through an operator then this is almost certainly a result of operator branding. I think you'll find that this only happens on branded models, not on models bought SIM-free from 3rd party retailers or directly from Nokia.<br />
<br />
Of course, this theory gets blown out of the water if yours <u>was</u> bought SIM-free...

<p>Hi Grschinon,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I bought the phone off eBay and it was SIM free. The phone is new and is branded&nbsp;Orange. My SIM card is also from Orange and was originally purchased as a&nbsp;SIM only contract (contract is monthly with bundles).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I put the SIM back into the old phone the problem goes away. So it must be something to do with the new phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>Matt</p>

            Yep. It's the phone allright. Orange are notorious for messing things up like that.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there's not alot you can do about it. The official way to remove the operator's mess is to get written permission from the operator to remove their firmware and install generic Nokia firmware in its place, and take the phone unlocked to a Nokia
 Care Point with that written permission. The NCP will do the deed, update Nokia's database and print out a new product identification label for you. Your phone will be officially debranded and will still be eligible for support from Nokia.<br />
<br />
Your biggest problem here is twofold. Firstly, it's Orange who did the branding. Talking to them about debranding and written permission is about as effective as talking to a brick wall. You'll never get past tier 1 customer support, where they'll think you're
 asking for a phone upgrade. Secondly, you're not even the original owner of the phone and therefore not the person on the contract it came with.<br />
<br />
There are other, unofficial methods to remove the branding, but you're on your own. Such an operation will not only void any warranty on the phone, but also Nokia may refuse to support the phone altogether (even if you offer to pay for repairs) if it's been
 tampered with in this way. Because of this, we cannot discuss how to do it here on the forum.

            I can only suggest you use a search engine and take full responsibility.<br />
<br />
There is a non-negligeable risk that this will brick your phone (ie. render it totally unusable) and because of the way it happened, you will end up with no way to get it fixed. I don't want to be partially responsible for that.

    <title>Replace a double chr&#40;10&#41; characters with a single one - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Replace a double chr&#40;10&#41; characters with a single one</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have a string variable sRisk that is the product of concatenating three string elements in an array.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I output sRisk to a cell, there are cases of double carriage return/line feeds (I don't actually know which), resulting in something like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First line of text</p>
<p>Second line of text</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third line of text</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&nbsp;I want to have is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First line of text</p>
<p>Second line of text</p>
<p>Third line of text</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried varous combinations to identify and replace the double CHR(10) combination with a single one, but can't get it working. this is the closest I have been able to get (ie it doesn't generate an error message!) but for some reason this deletes most
 of the text (assume all the appropriate variables have been Dim'd):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sRisk = "Risk" &amp; Chr(10) &amp; vRecords(l, 1) &amp; Chr(10) &amp; Chr(10) &amp; "Causes" &amp; Chr(10) &amp; vRecords(l, 29) &amp; _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chr(10) &amp; Chr(10) &amp; "Impacts" &amp; Chr(10) &amp; vRecords(l, 30)<br />
lChr = InStr(sRisk, "chr(10),chr(10)")<br />
sRisk = Replace(sRisk, lChr, Chr(10))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should point out that the double CHR(10)s that I want to get rid of are contained in the strings in the array, not the ones put in at the first line above!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone can suggest some code that will do what I need, I would be hugely grateful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dave</p>

                    I ordered a $5 Amazon Gift Card through bing rewards on 6/9 but it still says "in progress". I even did the cell phone code confirmation. It has never taken this long before so I was wondering if something was wrong.<br />

            This is typical of the ramshackle way SP is put together and Msft's disregard for customer support. While much of the core functionality is shared across SP 2013 and SPO, &nbsp;a competent support curator would make sure that what product the materials apply
 to was clearly stated. It wouldn't matter so much if SP was better made because well made products don't require as much support/training, but obviously &nbsp;that's not the case with SP.&nbsp;

            @ webbrewers - I think Microsoft realized a long time ago that ordinary users were making better support videos than their own staff and have stopped trying to outdo them. I think you'll find some excellent videos on YouTube.

<p>I was aiming at saving a selection of a Powerpoint presentation (which was saved a few times) under a different name. So I deleted majority of slides - and hit "Save" instead of Save As.</p>
<p>Is there an chance that I retrieve the pre version of the -now much shortened- presentation?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any help - I lost tremendous amount of work from 2 days...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The is no way to revert to previously saved version unless you set in preferences to create File back up then you could have opened a previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if your using Time machine you could go back to an hour or two before you made change and restore file in this case when doing restore I would choose keep both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did neither then,&nbsp;I am afraid &nbsp;you have to get out the crying towel and try to re-construct your presentation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6303 - firmware update failed, only black screen</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>today the Nokia Ovi Suite said that there is a new Firmware Update for my Nokia 6303.</p>
<p>I wanted to install it but after 1,5h and only 60% of installation the connection between the 6303 and the PC disconnected.</p>
<p>Now the display of the mobile phone is black. If I connect it to the pc Windows can't find drivers and the 6303 reconnect every 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Do you know how I can solve the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Access 2013 Row Count equivalent&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Access 2013 Row Count equivalent&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the life of me I can't seem to figure out how to do something I would assume to be simple in Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to add a row number for ordering in a query. I've found an example that just copies my id column and my current solution does not really work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the example found:</p>
<p><code><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DCount(</span></code><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><code>"[ID]"</code><code>,</code><code>"[tblNames]"</code><code>,</code><code>"[ID]&lt;="</code></span><span>
</span><code><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&amp;
 [ID])</span></code></p>
<p>My
 Current solution is to just create a table on the front end that I delete and reset the counter on an autonumber field. but if for any reason that table is open when I want to reset it, the table fails to update the counter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to add a simple row 1 = 1; row 2 = 2; etc. to a query? I have the table working the way I want, but when selecting, Access adds undesired sorting on the indexed columns.... even with an explicit ORDER BY statement...</p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><blockquote>...........do I need something special to download off onedrive?
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>No, it's a straightforward download.&nbsp; If you are trying to download it at work, however, your system might not allow downloads from OneDrive for fear of introducing malicious content.&nbsp; What people generally do in that situation is download the file at home
 and email it to themself at work, or transport it via a portable medium.<br />
<br />
The following are three queries from the demo which order rows sequentially by transaction date, using the primary key TransactionID as the tie-breaker where two or more transactions take place on the same day.&nbsp; The first two are non updatable, whereas the
 last is updatable, do can be used as a form's RecordSource for instance, where data is to be inserted or edited in the form.&nbsp; This is far less efficient than the first two, however, due to the DCount function calls.&nbsp; Of the first two, that using a JOIN is
 more efficienmt than that using a subquery.<br />
<br />
SELECT COUNT(*) AS RowNumber, T1.TransactionDate, T1.CustomerID, T1.TransactionAmount<br />
FROM Transactions AS T1 INNER JOIN Transactions AS T2 <br />
ON (T2.TransactionID&lt;=T1.TransactionID OR T2.TransactionDate&lt;&gt;T1.TransactionDate)<br />
&nbsp;AND (T2.TransactionDate&lt;=T1.TransactionDate)<br />
GROUP BY T1.TransactionDate, T1.TransactionID, T1.TransactionAmount, T1.CustomerID;<br />
<br />
<br />
SELECT <br />
&nbsp; (SELECT COUNT(*)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Transactions AS T2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE T2.TransactionDate&nbsp; &lt;=&nbsp; T1.TransactionDate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND ( T2.TransactionID &lt;= T1.TransactionID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR T2.TransactionDate &lt;&gt; T1.TransactionDate)) AS RowNumber, <br />
T1.CustomerID, T1.TransactionDate, T1.TransactionAmount<br />
FROM Transactions AS T1<br />
ORDER BY T1.TransactionDate, T1.TransactionID;<br />
<br />
<br />
SELECT DCOUNT("*","Transactions","TransactionDate&nbsp; &lt;=&nbsp; #" <br />
&amp; Format(TransactionDate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#&nbsp; <br />
AND (TransactionID &lt;= " &amp; TransactionID &amp; "&nbsp; OR TransactionDate &lt;&gt; #" <br />
&amp; Format(TransactionDate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#)") AS RowNumber, <br />
CustomerID, TransactionDate, TransactionAmount<br />
FROM Transactions<br />
ORDER BY TransactionDate, TransactionID;<br />
<br />
Fundamental to ordering rows dynamically in a query's result table is that the result table must be ordered on the basis of values in one or more columns.&nbsp; It is the order which determines the numbers.&nbsp; If you wanted to number the result table of a query which
 is not specifically ordered, then you would have to create a base table, much as you are doing, but without relying on an autonumber to assign the 'row numbers' or deleting and recreating the table each time; you'd just empty and refill it.&nbsp; This would be
 done by including a column of straightforward integer number data type in the temporary table, and then executing some VBA code which establishes and steps through a recordset of the table's rows, and assigns an incrementing integer number to each row.&nbsp; I
 do something similar, for instance, in a form based on a table of regular payments from an account, which are made in a specific order determined by a PaymentIndex column:<br />
<br />
Private Sub cmdReindex_Click()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rst As DAO.Recordset<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strRS As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim n As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Dirty = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "SELECT PaymentIndex FROM RegularPayments ORDER BY PaymentIndex"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rst = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset(strSQL)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With rst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .MoveLast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .MoveFirst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do While Not .EOF<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Edit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Fields("PaymentIndex") = n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Update<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = n + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .MoveNext<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rst = Nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Requery<br />
<br />

            Hi Jake
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />This might be a regression bug that has been reintroduced with the Windows 10 1903 update. Your best option is to probably wait until a fix is issued or use Microsoft for the time being.
<br />
<br />Other steps you can try...
<br />
<br />Click Start, type: internet options
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click the Advanced tab
<br />Click Reset
<br />Click Reset again
<br />
<br />Restart the browser then check if it loads the web page.
<br />
<br />
<br />It simply be that many web pages are not officially supporting Internet Explorer anymore. Internet Explorer 11 is hardly being maintain and is still around as a legacy web browser for Intranet websites and LOB apps that require ActiveX controls.
<br />
<br />You really should switch to a modern web browser such as Firefox (preferred) or Google Chrome.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Uncheck Internet Explorer
<br />Click OK
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Check Internet Explorer
<br />Click OK
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />
<br />Check if its working again.

<h3> mark blaise  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;ve some emails simply disappear from Inbox and Sent folder - anyone else see this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've used Outlook on my desktop/laptop for years. I have Outlook 2013 on Win 8.1 Pro configured to view Gmail and hotmail accounts, as well as my main company email. A few weeks ago, I switched to Outlook.com - uploaded my email folders (of which I have
<strong><em>many</em></strong>), the works. And I'm using the Android Outlook Preview (now
<strong><em>that</em></strong> needs some work!). So I can still use Outlook 2013, or Outlook.com in a browser or my Android phone - they all have stayed in sync. Outlook.com is configured in Outlook 2013 as an Exchange ActiveSync account</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been pretty good, but over the last few days, I've seen some very odd stuff - emails just up and disappearing from my Inbox and Sent emails folder. Just today the following happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working in Outlook 2013, I received email A from a colleague. I replied to it (email B), but the reply never showed up in my Sent items folder. I was starting to wonder - did i really send it? It was not in Drafts or Deleted folders, or anywhere else, according
 to <em>Advanced Find</em>. Then I received an email from the same person (email C)- this was a reply to my reply (B). And her reply (C) had the text of my reply (B) in it - so it really did get sent. I close the window for email C and then, right in front
 of my eyes, email C just disappears from my Inbox! Nowhere to be found in any folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no Outlook rules that would cause this to happen, Symantec Endpoint Protection has no risk or event logged that may have caused it. I have no filtering in my view. No idea WTH happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better yet, 2 days ago ... I was looking for some older email messages. I used Advanced Find (which I like because it can tell me
<strong><em>where</em></strong> the found item is located), and, among other emails, I find one I'm looking for. I have a Quickstep that simply marks an email as unread and moves it to my Inbox (good for hadling emails that are not junk but wind up in the Junk
 email folder). I select the email of interest and click the quickstep. It is removed from the Advanced Find results panel, and because I have the Inbox displayed, I see the email appear in the Inbox, and it's bolded (unread). Great, only after about 5 seconds,
 it just plain disappears from the Inbox. Again, nowhere to be found. Advanced Find cannot find that email again - it's just gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone throw me a hint as to WTH is going on here? I would be grateful.</p>

 got disabled, still the screen resolution got to be lost in that only a small part of the screen is readable), the problem is that computer resources are shared by default with other computer materials for finding agreement with the Excel producer upon wiring
 it into a console in my sense is the only possible means to this instrumental end. I, Kevin Genest, am in the right of requesting that this claim be heard and that its sounds be acknowledged from the
</span><strong>Microsoft Community. We are talking about my use of methods for generating graphics with Excel Spreadsheet, upon which usage only graphical analyticity and the cell grids are necessary for handling the production task. Therof, without submitting
 a samples of my product, without submitting theoretical details, and/or without refering to Kevin Genest's Excel World as a commercial strategy that involves reference to inherited features aren't detailed enough for handling this case with a superior technology,
 it is not the burden of intellectual property upon subject matter to have protected intellectually an utility model that requires the use of technology as an instrumental means forwards improving the intended use of the very technology: this is neither a process
 for having access to use claims, nor is it a commercial strategy interest that of using methods in order to avoid obtaining patent protection upon the use of technology as a whole in this aggregated sort of claim, but only because the actual use of the generated
 design</strong>&nbsp;isn't limited or restricted by the issue at hand but is inhibited of development into its innovative process along with royalty conflict if obtaining more advanced computer materials in order to use Excel as for design application must signify
 that minimum requirement for using Excel depends on the royalty conflict to unfold in agreement to wire Excel (as I claim that
<span>Excel Spreadsheet Must be Wired in Order to Use Graphical Analyticity for Design Application). I must have reached every member of staff that may help with this case, and I must have collaborated to the communicative process
 with the assigned member of staff, but offering new options upon not affording wiring Excel for its slef-commercial use, or my offering a book to explain the technique towards generating a replication of Kevin Genest' Excel World, wouldn't extend the current
 potential for innovation in this matter. Only if it was possible to protect an utility model in Canada, must I have opted for this outcome rather than interfering with Microsoft commerciall strategy for its sales of Excel 2010 products. Must

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials freezes Explorer windows 7 x64 Professional</h2>
                    Salutations,<br />
<br />
Well, I was using MSE for years now by me and my clients, but I was forced to go back to KiS. Dudes, do something about faultyness in MSE pls. It was a good AVS, now I have to go back to good old KiS.<br />
<br />
It started after latest updates I guess, and when I open explorer, I cannot right click any file, and it freezes automatically, no icons are cached, nor anything. I uninstalled MSE, installed KiS and voila, works like charm,<br />
<br />
please fix it asap, so I can go back to MSE,<br />
<br />
regards<br />
<br />

<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>

<h2>            Contacts</h2>
                    
<p>So I got a Lumia 920, a mobile <strong>PHONE</strong>, and I set it up, hotmail, gmail, facebook, twitter, etc. then I went to make a call and this is when I became confused. My contacts were there but so were 1000s of&nbsp;other ones. Weird I thought so I searched
 and scrolled and found them. Played around with the settings and saw I could filter accounts. Sweet I thought, no longer will I have 1000s of contacts but only&nbsp;the few with phone numbers I know in real life and would need to call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HANG ON A SECOND!!! This is not what happened! Even after copying phone contacts from my E7-00 they weren't there?! Why? Because they had been synced to my hotmail. **bleep**?! I don't want my phone contacts on my hotmail list and I don't want every single
 social networking contact to appear in my phone book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I thought, hmm I should be able to delete the contacts from my phone and keep only the ones with phone numbers. How wrong I was. This deletes it not only from the phone but from&nbsp;hotmail on the "interwebs"&nbsp;:S **bleep**.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since when has Microsoft started fellating Steve Jobs' idea of the "Cloud"? If I want the email address of my facebook or hotmail contact I will use my very expensive PC I bought to do the job of email and internet. I bought a phone to make calls and&nbsp;send
 messages to other mobile phones&nbsp;which have a phone number not email address,&nbsp;and play the odd game when I'm out and about. It has me wondering if I even bought a phone at all since I can't have phone contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I hopped on my expensive PC, not my mobile "phone", and searched google's full desktop site, not mobile site on my mobile "phone", to find a solution. There is none!?!?!?! A "workaround" is to create a new hotmail with just phone contacts? Double&nbsp;ewe
 tea eff? Using more resources out there somewhere on the "cloud" just to make a simple phone call that man has been doing since the dawn of time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it really that hard to filter phone contacts only? Is it such an impossible feat of strength that the software can't be coded to save local contacts? Surely you can summon Zeus himself to do something less retarded&nbsp;than the current system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really though Nokia was different, and especially teaming up with Microsoft I thought it would be a winning combination. I held out buying a Galaxy because I didn't want to be bombarded with Google's marketing&nbsp;and having to read about&nbsp;every geek who thinks
 because they own an Android they are now Linux users. I would never touch an Apple device even if Steve Jobs rose from hell and offered me his entire wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will you, Nokia, give me a refund on my Lumia 920 because it is a clear violation of Australian advertising law. You advertise a phone but you are really&nbsp;selling a link to the "cloud".</p>

<p>Please, do not blame Microsoft, Nokia or anyone else for not reading terms of use and conditions when you start using a phone. There are some very basic and simple ways to keep contacts separate or keep contacts offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basic instructions as well as the T&amp;C you agree to when you start using the phone clearly lay out how this works. The many, many support sites available have numerous postings and articles explaining how this works. Just because you ignored getting yourself
 informed does not mean you can go around ranting and complaining about the way Windows Phone works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integration of social media into the phone is a major point with Windows Phone. It offers an integrated environment where all these come together seamlessly and interact without any effort. If this is not what you want then maybe Windows Phone is not what
 you should&nbsp;be using although the reset if the smartphone world is not much different really.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You choose to connect an existing mail account with a great many contacts unrelated to use on the phone as main account to a phone which is well known to have a live sync relationship with said account. So in fact by not informing yourself and blindly pressing
 'I Agree' without finding out what you agree to to now blame Nokia/MSFT for your own actions or lack thereof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let's see if we can get beyond the rant so take a deep breath and chill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Phone uses what is called a Microsoft account to store and backup your personal data and settings. Your text messages, media and more will sync to it and can be retrieved when required during a reset or shared between different devices using the
 same account. This can be your Hotmail account but does not have to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you want to keep your phone contacts separate from your Hotmail account go to
<a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.com</a> and create a new account for this. Remember this account will be used for interaction with several parts of the OS such as the store. Once you set up this account, first use Nokia Suite to
 sync your original E7-00 contacts to this account. If you still have the contacts on the E7 see
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/5227AE35-4B12-4E64-8F23-1E4DF55C7045">
THIS</a> on how you do that, else you'll find more options <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/2AF1BAE0-D742-4890-9588-70930A5DC367">
here</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should reset the 920 using <em>settings&gt;reset your phone</em> and use this new account as your primary account. You can add the Hotmail account as a second account later and choose whether or not to include the contacts available there when you have
 set it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you, for whatever reason, do not want to use online sync you can setup a dummy account for that. C<span>reate a 'dummy account' on&nbsp;</span><a href="http://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.com</a><span>&nbsp;and set it up on the phone.
 Then in&nbsp;</span><em>settings&gt;email+accounts&gt;[dummy account]</em><span>&nbsp;set</span><em>Download new content</em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;</span><em>manual and&nbsp;</em><span>select only&nbsp;</span><em>contacts</em><span>&nbsp;as items to sync. Now when adding contacts make sure you select&nbsp;</span><em>[dummy
 account]&nbsp;</em><span>as the account the contact is linked to</span><em>.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any further questions feel free to ask, but please try and keep an open mind, I can understand you may get lost in the way Windows Phone works when coming from some other platforms, but in general and especially with smartphones there really
 is not much different except for the fact that Windows Phone much more integrates your social media and phone contacts and provides for several ways to easily use any of these intermixed..</p>

            To the OP if all you wanted was a phone to make phone calls and send messages to other mobile phones then you've spent an awful lot of money needlessly.<br />
<br />
If you are happy to conduct your online activities via a pc or laptop rather than via a smartphone (whether Windows, Android or iPhone) that's your choice but you're missing out on using the full capabilities of the 920 or any other smartphone.I now go weeks
 without switching on a pc. Lumia 800 and my other phone whose brand shall not be mentioned do it all.<br />
<br />
Finally if you're on a contract package rather than pay as you go I expect your network provider will be delighted to have sold you a deal where they will have been expecting you to use up data on emails etc and you're not using it.<br />

<p>I swear to god the amount of nonsens people sell here to defend this horrible phone.<br />
I just stepped into the store, asked for the phone, payed the money and that was it.<br />
Nowhere was I ever informerd that managing my contact list was such a nuance, I mean a dummy account, really?<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/5407DAA9-3444-4BC4-9E40-83670EA14530"> I have to compensate for horrible design again?!</a><br />
Worst part is the store does not want to give me a full refund.</p>

<p>First off, quoting an entire post (without the need to) to add a single paragraph response is considered bad etiquette and makes your response harder to read then needed. It &nbsp;also tells more then you'd like on your general attitude and kind of explains your
 issue before you even start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The terms and conditions you agree to when you start to use the phone clearly state the phone syncs data to the 'cloud'.&nbsp;<span>The point here is that IF you feel this is so horrible for whatever reason you have options which allow
 you not to do that. Takes 2 minutes once and you'll never have to look back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Phone is centred around integrating your social media with your phone. There is no denying many, if not most users of smart phones do use it to a high degree to interact with their social media contacts, h*ll FB just basically copied the concept
 from WP on their 'Home' sin for Android.&nbsp;<span>Quite honestly I just do not see the issue with syncing contacts to my Microsoft Account. It's safe, convenient and I have all my contact details available to me whenever, wherever.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing your contacts on a Windows Phone is easy and transparent. It being live and synced with your Micorsoft Account is information both readily available on the internet as well as stated in the T&amp;C on the phone. When you start the phone for the first
 time it clearly tells you what you are about to do and what will sync. If you then choose to sync with an account where you have contacts you do not want to sync for whatever reason that is entirely on yourself. Creating an account dedicated to the phone is
 easy and painless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will always be a handful of people kicking up a storm on this. Besides personal preference there is no real argument to be made against the way Windows Phone handles this though. Anyone who does should also stop using Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and
 actually the world wide web in genersl. You should go back to sending people smail mail and use a wired landline and also get yourself a couple of tinfoil hats just in case aliens are around reading your brainwaves.</p>

If it is so easy and transparent then why can't I just filter out the contacts without a number, or hey how about this? Delete contacts from the phone but not my account. No, to complicated to achieve, I have to make a dummy account just for this phone? I have
 a better idea, I'll just demand a refund and buy a phone that has the ability to store contacts on the phone (and yes this witchcraft is possible).<br />
<br />
And if you're curious on why I dislike having another account it is because I already manage 2, one for work, one for private life. Now I suddenly need to take in a third just to be able to store my contacts in an organised fashion, all because the developers
 of the phone I bought refused to think clearly for a second and now I am the one that has to compensate for their incompetence, which by the way is not the first instance this has occured with this terribly build device.</blockquote>

            OP, it's not just Windows OS that works like this. Android up to Gingerbread allowed contacts to be saved to the phone only. When my other phone whose brand I will not name updated itself to ICS that function went. As far as I know all Androids running
 ICS and JB will save your contacts to your Google account. I neither know nor care what iPhone does.<br />
<br />
It means when swapping devices all info is there is there when you add the account and Windows will allow sync of Google contacts and Android of Windows live contacts.<br />
<br />
I really cannot see what the issue is in the phone storing email addresses as well as phone numbers.<br />
<br />
So far as Facebook etc if you don't sign up for that on either system it won't load your Facebook etc contacts.<br />

<p>Please, do not blame Microsoft, Nokia or anyone else for not reading terms of use and conditions when you start using a phone. There are some very basic and simple ways to keep contacts separate or keep contacts offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basic instructions as well as the T&amp;C you agree to when you start using the phone clearly lay out how this works. The many, many support sites available have numerous postings and articles explaining how this works. Just because you ignored getting yourself
 informed does not mean you can go around ranting and complaining about the way Windows Phone works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You cannot read the T&amp;C without buying the phone first. You cannot return a phone just because you don't agree with the T&amp;C as it comes under change your mind and in Australia retailers have every right to refuse a refund, and since I am with a plan I signed
 a contract. But anyway I took your suggestion. I went to the Lumia 920 official website. There were no T&amp;Cs. I found a link saying Switching to Lumia. Looked promising. Nope. So I went to the FAQS for Lumia. I typed in "contacts". I found an article explaining
 how to transfer old contacts and it says "Online account (recommended). Notice it does not say "required". Then it shows you more ways to transfer and under bluetooth it has Transfer my Data which I performed but it still uses my online account. Maybe hidden
 in the text is a link to the developers' minds where I can find out that a Microsoft account is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having owned Windows phones and Symbian phones before one would think that they would stay consistent.</p>

<p>You choose to connect an existing mail account with a great many contacts unrelated to use on the phone as main account to a phone which is well known to have a live sync relationship with said account. So in fact by not informing yourself and blindly pressing
 'I Agree' without finding out what you agree to to now blame Nokia/MSFT for your own actions or lack thereof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nowhere on the Lumia 920 website does it mention sync relationships with an online account. Nor does it mention that it is so social network focused. It has three huge blurbs about how great the camera is, one for office but not a single thing about social
 networks unless you count the specifications page which says that you can install facebook on the phone &gt;_&gt;</p>

<p>Windows Phone uses what is called a Microsoft account to store and backup your personal data and settings. Your text messages, media and more will sync to it and can be retrieved when required during a reset or shared between different devices using the
 same account. This can be your Hotmail account but does not have to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to keep your phone contacts separate from your Hotmail account go to
<a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.com</a> and create a new account for this. Remember this account will be used for interaction with several parts of the OS such as the store. Once you set up this account, first use Nokia Suite to
 sync your original E7-00 contacts to this account. If you still have the contacts on the E7 see THIS on how you do that, else you'll find more options here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should reset the 920 using settings&gt;reset your phone and use this new account as your primary account. You can add the Hotmail account as a second account later and choose whether or not to include the contacts available there when you have set it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you, for whatever reason, do not want to use online sync you can setup a dummy account for that. Create a 'dummy account' on
<a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.com</a> and set it up on the phone. Then in settings&gt;email+accounts&gt;[dummy account] setDownload new content&nbsp; to manual and select only contacts as items to sync. Now when adding contacts make sure
 you select [dummy account] as the account the contact is linked to.</p>

<p>No I said I wanted it also for gaming if I'm out and about and obviously social networking as everyone seems to be on Facebook these days. I got the phone after looking at several others which just didn't cut it for what I was looking for. I've always bought
 Nokia for personal and Windows phones for business. I love my E7-00 but the lack of applications and even a proper facebook app is sad. Games made for it can't even run because Belle is so slugish and buggy.</p>

<p>Hi AndrewKing271</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experienced the same thing on my Lumia1520 which started yesterday. My OS build is 10.0.14393.1198 and I've checked that the device has the latest updates as of 10:26am today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first noticed the issue when the phone started flashing while I was on a call. The whole background with apps went berserk. Today I can't get the People app to stay open long enough to select someone. I had to coax it to find a contact to call under the
 phone app - which it finally did and it took 8-9 taps to get it to actually call the number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled the issue and found that others were being advised to do a hard reset. I'm not sure how to do that as I'm not an IT-savvy sister. Perhaps someone could explain that? AND would it resolve the issue?</p>

            With respect a hard reset is not a satisfactory solution. The issue is clearly introduced wit an update. MS must either issue a fix asap or role back to the previous version. Come on Microsoft, lift your game. &nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I agree, if the issue was caused by an update, that MS should fix it immediately. I'm sure we're all way too busy with work, family, demands of&nbsp;life etc to be worried about our phones not functioning properly and the frustration&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;software&nbsp;unreliability.</p>

<p>So having the memory card with my music and photos saved a lot of heartache. &nbsp;It took a while to get the apps back but the phone is much quicker and have rationalised the apps as a consequence. &nbsp;Retaught myself about custom ringtones. . .
</p>
<p>People app works fine. :)</p>
<p>Not the quick solution I was after but happy that the phone is working as it should.</p>

                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can help me with this problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to prepare a new cash flow model, this will be prepared on a daily, weekly and monthly level therefore 3 separate tabs.&nbsp; The weekly and monthly tabs will be driven from the daily sheet, hopefully totalling all specific line items for a specific
 date range.&nbsp; My summary data example is below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore for the weekly summary I would like to total all Income (ref 1.1.1) for the date range
01/3/15 - 07/03/15</p>
<p>For the monthly summary exactly the same only for a larger date range 
01/03/15 - 31/3/15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried sumif(b:b,"1.1.1",d2:j2) however this only returns the first value (100), what do I need to change in this formula to total all items or (100 + 200 + 300 ..... &nbsp;2800)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can someone please recommend a formula or method to enable this?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows Update will be set to automatically install important updates as they become available. You won’t be able to turn off automatic updates in Windows Technical Preview and the
</span></span><span>ISO files only become available once a build is released to the Slow setting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Additional information.</span></p>
<p><span>Latest build released is 10159: </span><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/30/whoa-another-pc-build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/30/whoa-another-pc-build/</a>

                    <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depuis cet après-midi, il m'est impossible de me connecter à Onedrive.</p>
<p>Le nuage gris apparait dans la barre des tâches, puis disparait dès que j'entre mon identifiant de connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ce fait arrive juste après que j'ai essayé la double identification, et un changement de mot de passe.</p>
<p>J'ai supprimé la double identification, mais ça ne resout pas le problème.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comment faire pour me reconnecter ?</p>

            J'ai enquêté dans notre communauté et ne peux trouver aucun cas de ce genre. À ce stade, et comme nous ne savons pas exactement quelle en est la cause, je vous recommande de réinstaller le onedrive.
