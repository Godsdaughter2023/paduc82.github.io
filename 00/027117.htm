<p>Recently i have seen a quick remedy for those who forgot their password. I hope it will help you as well. So what you need to do is to:</p>
<p>Turn on the Nokia E63</p>
<p>Wait for it to boot up.</p>
<p>When phone displays the enter lock code interface</p>
<p>Dial 112 and press dialling key (emergency call)</p>
<p>Wait for 3 to 5 seconds</p>
<p>and than disconnect call</p>
<p>By doing this it will open your mobile.</p>
<p>Regards.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Adding an Inline Image to an email fault, new Outlook web app.  Displaying a tiny Fault image, not the desired image.</h2>
                    <p>It looks like I finally have the much anticipated new Outlook.com web application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During composition of my second outgoing message, I needed to include an Inline image. &nbsp;But, after browsing my computer and selecting the image, the desired image was not displayed. &nbsp;For a second, a dotted outline of the actual image was displayed, then
 it reverted to a tiny image of a sheet of paper with torn corner is displayed as follows.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c80941f-110c-4452-afcb-64a1bcfb87b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c80941f-110c-4452-afcb-64a1bcfb87b1" /></a></p>
<p>A second attempt to add an image did not result in the fault image, after the 1-second image outline display.</p>
<p>This was the second failed image: (Wow it works here...)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d781cf9-7423-4924-84d5-5c1579de9ea7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d781cf9-7423-4924-84d5-5c1579de9ea7" /></a></p>
<p>The above image added inline perfectly yesterday in the old Outlook.com web app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old Outlook.com web application displayed and sent my selected images perfectly each time used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Win 7 Sp1, Chrome. (Not that it should matter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice appreciated.</p>
<p>Inline images are an Important feature to me.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t activate Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickcasher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Was insider for Win 10 but always gave best(fastest) pc to wife or sons(when they were in college). Naturally bought wife new touch-screen&nbsp;pc for her Win 10. while I took here older but faster than my pc to use with the Win 10 I downloaded supposedly for
 participating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The downloaded copy would not accept the key I had originally and installation stopped immediately. This older insider release&nbsp;didn't accept the code either but at least allowed me&nbsp;to continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I give up and go back to Vista?&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is ok if they don't need or want any further input from myself or family on problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Guess there isn't a reason to keep the iso then. Kind of sorry i made such an effort in the insider program. If someone needs my help concerning &nbsp;Windows 10 in our senior community I'll probably not volunteer saying I used to have a copy while i was an insider
 and I forgot most I knew saying 'if you don't keep using it you loose it'.</p>

            Patrick, the reason for no keys was to keep people from&nbsp;jumping on at the last min to get the "free" copy of windows 10,and the keys were stopped on July 15&nbsp; (as spelled out in the agreement that you needed to keep your system on during the preview to
 receive upgrades) and everyone that was active&nbsp; on the Preview got an upgrade and permanent activation at that time, now to get a "free" version you need to upgrade from an active version of Preview, Win7sp1 or Win8.1.&nbsp;

            the only way you can do it is to format the memory card and you will lose data, now there is no guarantee that the memory card will also allow you to format. unfortunate thing about memory cards is that they do get corrupted more often then others. give
 it a try and see if you can at least still use it after a reformat.&nbsp;

<p>You can stick the memory card in a card reader and hope the data's still there. back it up then format the card from the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have access to another phone that utilizes the same type of card, you can see if your card can be read there as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the thing with digital files, it's so easy to lose them so keep backing up. and back up your back up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;good one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is giving you an option to format just do it,I was not able to format when I got such error. I tries sevaral combination to get format enabled on my card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if u r extremly lucky than you may try once in ur PC and see if you can recover something. Otherwise just format it and restore the latest backup.</p>

<p>PS About opera, I have discovered that actually Nokia web browser is better when writing answers on the web, for example: using discus account logins.</p>
<p>Opera doesn´t manage that at all. Strange...Well, sometimes Opera is better (smal font web pages) and sometimes Nokia is better....:smileyindifferent:</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feeds, also known as RSS feeds, are content listings published by a website. They're used for news and blog websites, but are also used for distributing other types of digital content, including pictures, audio, or video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A feed can have the same content as a webpage, but it's often formatted differently. When you subscribe, Internet explorer automatically checks the website and downloads new content so you can see what is new since you last visited the feed.</p>
<p>

            The notes taking and audio recording functionality of Microsoft OneNote is built into Microsoft Word on the Mac. In Word, choose View &gt; Notebook Layout View.<br />
<br />
Another option is to use Microsoft SkyDrive, which has a light version of OneNote that runs in Safari or FireFox. It's here:<br />

    <title>NOKIA CUSTOMERS STILL BEING RIPPED OFF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madmick69---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            NOKIA CUSTOMERS STILL BEING RIPPED OFF</h2>
                    Me again<br />
<br />
Just to explain to all users of Nokia handsets to be extra carefull when having your mobile updated in a service centre.<br />
Check for the latest version on line for your mobile either by looking at the NSU list or checking with dicussions.<br />
The reason why is these centres are deliberately using out of date firmware for all handsets so as to make extra cash from the out of warranty handsets and Nokia is doing nothing about it.<br />
This obviously affects in warranty handsets too.<br />
Here is an example the present firmware release for the 6230i is 04.22 but when you go to a service centre right now it will offer you 03.80 or 03.88 .<br />
These centres deliberately hold back the most up to date firmwares so as to recharge you weeks later for the correct firmware.<br />
This is by definition FRAUD and should be punishable but isnt.<br />
There is more than one cure to this issue.<br />
<br />
1.The NSU release an update immediately for this handset for online updates.<br />
2.Nokia contact all Service Centres and force them to provide the latest firmwares.<br />
<br />
I am sending all this information to a number of newspapers and reporting this to trading standards as I and many others see this as a serious issue .<br />
<br />
Nokia is failing to protect thier customers on this matter even though they can cure the problem by publishing and releasing all the latest firmware for this and other handsets a lot quicker than present.<br />
<br />
Please provide your support for this matter by contacting nokia directly and also posting your complaints here concerning this matter.

            When you entered the NSC armed with the knowledge of the current up to date firmware ,and you were informed of the current available update ,did you challenge them on this , and if so what was the answer they gave you ?<br />
<br />
When a firmware update is released do all NSC get them at once.<br />
<br />
Did you check out a number of outlets to get a broader spectrum if this is an issue.<br />
<br />
Im not defending Nokia or the centres just that a post like this needs facts and figures.<br />
<br />
Have any other forum members had this issue ?<br />
<br />
Maybe the moderators could shed some light on this raised possible issue please.

            Went to a NSC here in Lisbon this weekend (though it wasn't related directly to the firmware), and they have the latest for the 5300, which is version 3.92 (I updated my phone over NSU previously).

            I´m not sure about that, but I think that the service centers don´t have access to a firmware by any other way, unless, on-line, like we do!<br />
So they, put the phone on-line, maybe with strong passwords and I know that they do not use NSU tool, but is on-line the same way we do, so they can´t manipulate the firmware version they put inside. Not 100% sure about that, but I think is that way.

Hi Guys <br />
<br />
We've been in contact with the Nokia people controlling software updates and 3.88 is definitely the latest version for the 6230i handset.
<br />
<br />
As always bear in mind their will be different SW versions for the various operators and regions but 3.88 is the latest.
<br />
<br />
Thanks

            please check your facts moderator the latest firmware for 6230i has been well talked about on this forum and is definately without a shadow of a dought version 04.22.<br />
as 04.22 was released in november the looooovely people at nokia are now working on another release for this handset but the main problem is not the firmware its the fact that its not added to the NSU list IT ISNT IN THE NSU LIST YET....<br />
this handset is by far overdue the present online release and should have been the very first to be allowed to online update when NSU started as this handset as well stated by myself and others has the most bugs over and above any other handset especially below
 version 03.80.<br />
<br />
remember 03.80 and 03.88 are only whats being offered at service centres and I as well stated am not ready to be ripped of a second time for an out of date firmware....<br />
Whilest nokia drag out more releases at snails pace out of warranty and in warranty nokia users are being ripped of as remember updating online is free if and when you have a firmware to update<br />
<br />
BUT EVERY TIME YOU GO TO A SERVICE CENTER IT WILL COST YOU £20 TO £30 THIS PHONE HAS ALREADY SET ME BACK OVER £200 AND I AM DEFINATELY NOT PAYING ANOTHER PENNY .

            Yeah, this must be a big conspiracy against you. I don't know who originally started talking about SW v. 4.22, but why do you think his words are more credible than mod's words?<br />
<br />
And U know, maybe it's not technically possible to make 6230i support NSU...<br />
<br />
What kind of bugs have you experienced with the 3.88?

            Surely if you don't have faults then you wouldn't want to upgrade FW anyway right? As fo rthe MOD being right, they are not always but may be this time. Not all regions have the same FW so 3.88 might be for britain where as the 4.22 could be asian or something.
 If it is done online through Nokia at the NSC then Nokia would obviously have control over what they are supplying and would remove previous FW so as not to confuse right?

            I can understand where the OP is coming from, i have a Nokia 6630 with generic firmware version 6.03.40 which has been on my phone for two monts now. If i go in to a NSC i get told that the latest version for the Nokia 6630 is version 6.03.08, if i enter
 my product code here &gt; <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4305060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4305060</a> i still get told that the latest version is 6.03.08 even though i have version 6.03.40 installed. Here is my product code so you can check it out for your self &gt; 0517773, also here is a link &gt;

<p>I just bought 2 Nokia 113s from Carphone Warehouse. Nokia suite tells me that the software is outdated and I need to update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Conect via a USB cable" says the program. This is not possible with the 113. Why can bluetooth not do the job?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It just cost me over £26 through t-mobile to do a 20 min download &amp; update when the phone logged on to the Nokia website!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has to be a better way than this. Come on Nokia, play the game a bit fairer than this.</p>

<h2>            Difference between sharing and installing Office 356 Home</h2>
                    I do not understand the difference between sharing and installing Office 356 home. I have installed on 5 family members' computers. Why would I share as well? Can I just share instead and not install, it seems that you get to download all the applications
 when someone shares with you. What is the difference and when is what required?

            Either you can install on those 5 computers or you can share. You do share when the computer is not accessible to you and you can't install. Installation will be done by the person who you have shared with. (This means that you need not share your Myaccount login and password with somebody else)

            Installing using your email account means that you "own" and control it on all machines.  The others may be able to run it, but you will own it. You have only the 1 x 1TB onedrive space allocation and 1 x 60minutes per month skype time.
<br />
<br />If you "share" your Office 365 Home license with those other people they also get a separate 1TB allocation of OneDrive space and a separate allocation of 60 minutes of "Free" skype time each month.  They have control over what computer(s) they have installed Office on. They still have their separate Outlook email account.

<h2>            Outlook Web App - unable to book a room</h2>
                    <p>I have to use Outlook web app for work. However, when I go to schedule a room, I can't search for my rooms, so I have no way to create events. As you can see, after searching, the selection box is way too short and doesn't show any results. Since my organization
 has many rooms and not all of them are loaded, and there is no way to load more, I can't make an invite to my conference rooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this in the old and new version and there is no way to perform this.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />When you search for the rooms, it only shows you the ones that are available at that date and time you want to make the meeting.
<br />
<br />If you can, use the meeting scheduling assistant option, so you know if the rooms you are looking for are occupied or not at that time.

<p>Thanks Vladimir, but that's not the issue. As you can see my above photo, the room with AMS in the name is Available, but does not come back in the search. I verified my room is available at the time I'm trying to book, but because the list is not fully
 loaded, and the search functionality does not work, I cannot select my room. The scheduling assistant uses the same process to pick a room, and I cannot get to my rooms.&nbsp;</p>

            Question: In the Global Address List can you see the room?
<br />Maybe the room is hidden from the Global Address List and that's why you can not find it in the search.

            I see that you have restrictions on that PC, this may be affecting that functionality in OWA.
<br />If you can do the test on another PC, better if that PC is on another network, because the restriction could also be on the network.

    <title>Excel VBA will not execute Macros on signed workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil m. johnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel VBA will not execute Macros on signed workbook</h2>
                    <p>We have a product based on Excel spreadsheets which is running on a large number of client workstations across multiple versions of Excel. &nbsp;It uses VBA which is signed with a Thawte certificate. &nbsp;We have two machines now with Office 2007 that refuse to run
 the Macros in the VBA, with the message to the effect that Macros have been disabled for this workbook. &nbsp;We have changed the security settings for Macros from 'Execute Signed Only' to Execute all, we have added the workbooks to the trusted workbooks path in
 the security center, and nothing will enable the macros on these two sites. &nbsp;We have even created a basic Hello World workbook and signed that, and it works fine, but the main workbook will not run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Thawte certificate is valid, and we have even hand-imported it into Windows, clicking on it, indicates that it is valid until December 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far this has only shown up on sites running Office 2007, on both Windows 7 and Vista platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to what is causing this? &nbsp;Or what else I could check to troubleshoot it?</p>

            <p>Denis, you are correct, we have run into this problem before and have done all of the steps a number of times. &nbsp;It is just on these two machines that it doesn't seem to work. In checking further, one of the machines does not have any anti-virus installed
 (used to have Norton). &nbsp;The message displayed when I start the workbook is that it is encrypted, and that no security software can scan it. &nbsp;Now the workbook is signed, and the VBA is protected, but that hasn't been a problem on hundreds of other machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am installing Windows Security Essentials to see if this is a workaround. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Personally, I would run the Norton removal tool again just in case it was not run at the time of uninstallation.&nbsp; When I once failed to do this, it caused a baffling fault two years later [<em>other computers could not copy large files t0 this computer even
 though every other aspect of network use ran correctly</em>].&nbsp; I ran the removal tool and the network then behaved correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See <a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/kb20080710133834EN_EndUserProfile_en_us?abproduct=home&amp;abversion=1&amp;pvid=f-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download and run Norton Removal Tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And then repeat this for any other non-MS antimalware applications that have ever been on these computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then you can install MSSE again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this will achieve is ensuring that Norton is not contributing to your fault symptoms.&nbsp;

</p><p>Office Diagnostics fixed an identical problem for me only a month ago - Word, Excel &amp; Outlook suddenly stopped allowing macros to run on two computers.&nbsp; I could sign macros or add folders to Trusted locations as much as I wanted but it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office diagnostics did not tell me what the fault had been but it did report that its final module [<em>I think it is divided into 26 modules</em>] fixed something but I never found out what the cause of the hassle had been..&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>This is only a shot in the dark but the thought does occur to me that the error message might&nbsp;be a red herring.&nbsp; There might be some functions within your code that are failing and Excel then just does its best to interpret the fault condition but comes
 up with the wrong answer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you try removing any triggers [WorkBook_Open events etc] so that the code is completely inactive for the time being and then just add in a simple Hello world macro [to a copy of the proper file rather than a specific test file] &nbsp;to see if that can
 be made to run with the workbook in a Trusted location?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It ought, at least, to run during the Excel session during which it is written so the real test will be after closing then reopening Excel.&nbsp; If it does work then that points, in the first instance, to active triggers such as WorkBook_Open events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just an idea.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Denis, I am getting nowhere with this - I am now at the point where some selected spreadsheets run, some have their Macro's disabled, and others won't open without getting a found unreadable content in workbook message. &nbsp;The frustrating part is I can
 be in goto assist, open a workbook, close it, upload it to the client, and immediately it gets these messages. &nbsp;The client is running Windows 10 with Office 2007. &nbsp;It would be much more useful if everything failed. &nbsp;Having some workbooks in the same directory
 not work, and others work is frustrating. &nbsp;All of them have essentially the same VBA code, they are all signed with the same digital signature and they are all protected with the same passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The client has never had Norton on this laptop - that was only the one that I tried it on. &nbsp;He is running Windows Defender and we have even excluded our product directory from the virus scan. &nbsp;I have checked the properties on each of the workbooks, none
 of them are blocked. &nbsp; However, I did download and ran the Norton Remover - just in case it had ever had Norton on it, and the client didn't know. &nbsp;I am waiting for him to reboot to see if that has any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an internal black list somewhere that Microsoft Office keeps of workbooks that it puts things on, and then won't take them back off?</p>

            <p>No Joy - ran Norton removal tool - it actually did remove Norton - and rebooted. &nbsp;Still the same problem - some workbooks still have their Macro's disabled. &nbsp;Others report their content is unreadable. &nbsp;This may be some sort of weird office 2007 issue. &nbsp;I
 am out of options. &nbsp;Even enabling all Macro access has no effect. &nbsp;And Excel 2007 does not provide much in the way of reporting on the problem. &nbsp;I also notice that our certificate no longer shows up on the list of trusted publishers. &nbsp;An old one was there
 which had been revoked, deleting it has not effect.</p>

<h2>            Disclaimer HTML not working</h2>
                    
<p>Good Afternoon,</p>
<p>Multiple clients using 365 have been using the disclaimer rule to have a company wide signature. This has been working fine for months on end, however suddenly the last day or two the HTML is not working correctly &amp; Images are not working it just shows the
 syntax and rest of the html code.</p>
<p>Is this related to the current exchange problems listed on the dashboard or is this a new problem / have Microsoft disabled this?</p>
<p>This is on multiple domains / portals and different end email clients - Google, Hotmail, user exchange. Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge (all the same result)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kyle,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates. I understand the issue occur in iPhone and OWA.</p>
<p>For iPhone, probably because the emails are sent in Plain Text, the disclaimer is not appended correctly. I suggest you follow the steps below to make the emails sent in HTML and see if the issue persists:<br />
1.&nbsp;Go to <strong>Settings -&gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars -&gt; Signature</strong>. <br />
2.&nbsp;Tap and hold on your current signature and tap <strong>Select All -&gt; B<em>I</em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">U</span></strong>.
<br />
3.&nbsp;Make the text bold or italic and then tap <strong>Mail..</strong> at the top left of the screen to save the settings.</p>
<p>For OWA, I have tested with the codes you provided and cannot reproduce the issue. I’d like to collect the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;Does the issue occur to internal users or external users?<br />
2.&nbsp;Does the issue occur to specific recipients or random recipients?<br />
3.&nbsp;If the issue occurs to specific recipients, can you always reproduce the issue with every email sent to those recipients?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

                    <p>I hope I am posting in the correct place for my question, here goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for whatever reason my iphone is unable to access youtube.com/pair. &nbsp;I have to enter though the mobile youtube site to even enter the code provided my Xbox one to pair with iOS. &nbsp;Once paired my youtube app on the Xbox one says generic "iPhone" instead
 of the actual name of my phone. &nbsp;Once "paired" I cannot for the life of me get any videos to send to my Xbox one. &nbsp;The icon isn't there in the app, or through mobile youtube through Safari.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice to help to this issue? &nbsp;Searching through the youtube app on the Xbox one via controller is such an inconvenience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my roommates windows phone works flawlessly.</p>

            <p>Hello Headrone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having playing YouTube videos to your XboxOne.&nbsp; This is not the best place to post this as this process does not use the Xbox Video application and does not involve a Windows Phone.&nbsp; I was however
 able to do a bit of testing on this process and did confirm playing to the Xbox One from a iPhone is supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will document how I went about this.&nbsp; I will follow this up with some thoughts or suggestions if you continue to find this process to fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am using a iPhone 4s running OS version 7.1.1 (11D201).&nbsp; I am using YouTube app version 2.7.0.11277.</li><li>I launched the YouTube app on the phone and then I started the Xbox One and launced the YouTube app.&nbsp; Signed in with my account and then went to sign in and settings.&nbsp; Selected the "Pair another device" option.</li><li>At this point there was a code displayed on the Xbox console.</li><li>I then went back to the YouTube app. on the phone and opened the settings.&nbsp; Here I located the "connected TVs" option and tapped it.&nbsp; Here I saw a TV display with a gray box to enter the pairing code.&nbsp; I proceeded to enter the code from the Xbox One.</li><li>After the code was entered and recognized the "ADD" button in the upper right corner lit up and I tapped it.&nbsp; The iPhone was then displayed on the Xbox console and Xbox One appeared as a paired device on the phone.</li><li>Finally, I located a video and tap the video.&nbsp; I was then given the play option and the TV que opt
<p>I was also able to successfully pair the phone via the site as well but I found the app to be easier.&nbsp; With this said, my suggestions are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try resetting the network you are connected to.&nbsp; There is a chance the issue is related to the connection an this might help smooth things over.</li><li>Try unplugging your console for 5 minutes and then reconnecting.</li><li>As this seems more to be related to your phone, as others connect without issue, it might be time to look into the OS version running on your phone or the app version running on your phone.&nbsp; Check for updates of the phone and app.&nbsp; I might also suggest
 you consider uninstalling the YouTube application and maybe look for another app on the store.</li></ul>
<p>If the issue continues from here it might be time to consider posting to the Xbox forum,&nbsp;<span><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4274.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4274.aspx</a>
 .&nbsp;&nbsp; If you cannot find the help you need here,&nbsp;consider discussing this with the YouTube app developer or iPhone support.</span></p>

    <title>upgrading from Win7 SP1 thru Windows Update fails, but Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjuw  say:</h3>
<h2>            upgrading from Win7 SP1 thru Windows Update fails, but Windows Update log says it was &#34;sucessful&#34;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have&nbsp;an issue installing Windows 10 Technical Preview, build 9926 ,as an upgrade , both thru Windows Update and from a flash drive, on Windows 7 SP1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The Win10 TP 9926&nbsp;showed up as an available "update" in Windows Update, after all other available Windows 7 updates had been installed. I chose it for installation, and clicked ok. It came up with the&nbsp;installation screens and seemed to install normally.
 The computer rebooted twice or more&nbsp;during the install. It went thru the entire install,with no error messages, hangs, etc. But when the install got to the step of "finalizing settings" etc (the screens that are different colors and messages as it goes along),
 it seemed to finish and reboot again ,but it booted back into WINDOWS 7. The Windows Update log showed that the Win 10 TP "update" had installed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I thought I might have missed an error message that flashed by quickly, so I went thru the same process again. Same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I then tried installing Win 10 TP from a USB flash drive made from the downloaded ISO file, again as an upgrade, keeping everything (the default choice). It again went thru the entire install, set up, etc. But this time at the end, instead of rebooting,
 it stopped with a message saying Win 10 couldn't be installed because of a problem, and it was now going to revert back to the original operating system. Under the message was the<strong><em>error code
</em></strong><strong><em>0xC1900101 - 0x4000D</em></strong> (and a button to click ok). The installation then reverted my computer back to Windows 7, with no errors or glitches. Everything is as it was before I started.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;In googling the error code, all I could find was that it usually meant your graphics driver needs updating before the upgrade will install successfully (in reference to a Windows 8 upgrade). There are no newer graphics drivers available from the computer

<p>&nbsp;I know a clean install would probably be successful , but I would rather do an upgrade if possible. This computer came with Windows 7, wasn't upgraded from XP or Vista. It has never had any problems, either hardware or software related. I uninstalled all
 anti-virus and anti malware before I started, and after running scans in each. No problems were found.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anybody have any suggestions about what to try next (short of a clean install)?

</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you will likely have to avoid installing Windows 10 for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of testing Windows 10 on a physical&nbsp;partition&nbsp;or hard disk&nbsp;versus a Virtual Machine include full access to the hardware, which includes memory, graphics and input/output performance of the local disk in addition to the ability to fully experience
 all features of the operating system that are not accessible in a virtual environment. The biggest benefit is, you don't lose your production installation of Windows and you can reboot into it at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to consider before:</strong></p>
<p>Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making signifcant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> recommended! See links to resources about backing up by clicking the link for the respective version of Windows you are running:

<h2>            Branch selection for Office 2016 deployment</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am looking at the deployment options for Office 2016 via Office 365 and understand that the release branch can be specified at the point of installing when customising the Click To Run which is fine. How can you control clients installing it directly without
 the customisation as I want all machines on the same branch. I have looked at the Group Policy options but I have no idea how to see if the group policy settings are doing anything?</p>
<p>Any advice would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi April,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. It's good to know that the default is the one I would want us to be on. I have been playing with the Group Policy templates already but I'm not sure how to find out what branch the local machine is updating against just so I know if
 group policy is working correctly?</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>The name of the Group Policy setting is Update Branch. You can find this policy setting under Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Office 2016 (Machine)\Updates. The relevant choices when you enable the Group Policy setting are Current,
 Business, and Validation (Validation is the setting that you use for First Release for Current Branch for Business).</p>

<p>hi chris,</p>
<p>to my knowledge, there is no such configure file or option in applications&nbsp;to say the update branch. in my opinion, we may check the office update settings on local specific clients like this: according to the table below, when no future updates and non-security
 updates come out every month, then the update branch is <strong>current branch for business</strong>. and so on.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. I was hoping to see something within Office to confirm the branch. The About Updates section would make sense and at least you know which branch you are aligned to rather that waiting to see if you get updates or not.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t View Google Toolbar in View&#62;Toolbars even though it is enabled in Tools&#62;Manage Add-ons</h2>
                    My google and yahoo toolbars disappeared the other day. When I go to View&gt;Toolbars I only see the standard Menu, Favorites, Command, and Status Bars (no yahoo, google, etc.). When I go to Tools&gt;Manage Add-ons, my google and yahoo toolbars are present and
 enabled. What can I do? I tried unninstalling and reinstalling the toolbars and that had no effect Please Help! Thank you.

<h2>            Network time and appointments</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Samsung I760.&nbsp; It supposedly will change the time on the phone depending on the time zone I'm in.&nbsp; The settings are correct, but it doesn't work.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, my previous device (a palm device) would adjust the time zone of the appointment.&nbsp; Can Windows Mobile do this and what settings do I need to use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>So if you have enabled the time zone time adjustment, when you arrive at your destination it should reflect it.&nbsp; If not, turn your phone on then off and I expect it will.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for appointments, you can set the timezone in Outlook on your PC.&nbsp; That should work for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some folks don't use that feature and when they make an appointment for a different timezone, they adjust the time accordingly for the timezone they are in.&nbsp; Then when they change timezones and the phone changes, the appointment is adjusted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never got into doing that only because I rarely traveled but now that I am traveling a lot, I am using the TimeZone on my PC Outlook and so far I like it a lot.</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer.&nbsp; I wish it worked, but it doesn't.&nbsp; I turned off the phone (using soft reset) and when it started again, it was still on the&nbsp;"home" time zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't know about the multiple time zone option in Outlook on my PC, but I may use that.&nbsp; Because of this bug (?) in Mobile 6, I may be forced to just manually adjust the time when I travel.&nbsp; Might need to start wearing a watch!&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>For quite some time I would uncheck USE NETWORK TIME when I traveled so my appointments would not get screwed up .... I used a watch to tell time.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6630 and Pc Suite 6.80.22</h2>
                    Hi, i've a problem.<br />
<br />
This Morning i updated my old version of pcsuite 6.5 to the newer 6.80.22 .<br />
<br />
After that i tried to connect the mobile phone by USB cable to PC using the Wizard connection. Windows finds a New Hardware but while it tries to find the right drivers for it, says that it was impossible to find driver and the hardware could not function properly.<br />
<br />
Could someone help me to find out a solution?<br />
thank you

            YOu can choose to stick with 6.5 or manually uninstall 6.5, then boot PC and download 6.80.22 and install that.<br />
Make sure you do not have your phone connected before you have installed and only connect when PC Suite asks you to do so.

    <title>Outlook search as the query is typed&#58; Can I increase the time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roeexj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook search as the query is typed&#58; Can I increase the time before the search starts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I saw this complaints in other threads (for example <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/nasty-focus-change-while-typing-in-search-box/9f59bc19-f24d-4054-a70d-13cfc4b5c5ba">
here</a>), Outlook 2013 starts searching too soon. You type in the name in "from" field, and if you pause for a millisecond before typing the next letter the search start and the next letter is added before the "from" field. So if you want to search for emails
 from 'John' you find yourself searching for "hnfrom:jo".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can cancel that altogether by ticking off the check box for 'When possible, display results as the query is typed' - but I don't want to cancel it completely, just increase the time before the search start - or alternatively prevent the focus change
 so that any letter typed after the search has started will be typed in its intended place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to make that feature <em>work properly</em> and not just cancel it?</p>
<p>It worked just fine in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tx,</p>
<p>Roee.</p>

            <p>This also drives me crazy. I thought Roee's description was perfectly clear -- this happens if you are typing in a subfield such as the FROM field. If you're typing in the FROM field and pause, outlook starts searching and jumps the cursor back up to the
 start of the main search field such that the rest of your typing shows up in front of the "from:xxxx". Here's a screenshot:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Even more annoying -- this only happens sometimes -- it's not even a consistent behavior.&nbsp;</p>
