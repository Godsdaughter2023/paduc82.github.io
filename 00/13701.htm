<h2>            Connection Failed to Skydrive from Document Connection</h2>
                    I'm trying to sign into &nbsp;Microsoft Document Connection that came with my Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac. I'm putting in my correct Skydrive ID and password, and my internet connection is working properly, yet I keep getting an error message saying "The
 connection failed." Any solution?

<p>Alas,&nbsp;a lot of us have this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason that not even Nokia has been able to explain, the new firmware cannot be installed on phones RM-505* phones. They told me that it will be available before sept. first, and that it is a mistake they made when they released the firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*If you run Nokia Software Updater on your PC it will tell you the RM-number on the left of the screen where it tells you which firmware you are currently running. You can also read the product code directly off of you phone - it is hidden behind the battery
 at starts with 05xxx...</p>

<p>just to clarfiy, that is not ALL RM-505 models, my n97 is RM-505 and I was able to see the update as soon as word of it was on the forum, and updated without issue, why some do not appear is beyond me?</p>

            There's no Junk filter in the Mail app (or even an option to label messages as junk), so even if you create a folder it won't automatically put junk messages in it. For that kind of capability, you're better off with Live Mail.

            <p>The presence of a Junk folder will depend on it's existence on the server. Outlook.com accounts have a Junk folder as do Exchange/Office 365.&nbsp; POP3 accounts have a Junk folder as well; I confirmed this&nbsp;on&nbsp;a Comcast account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While there isn't currently a quick option to mark an item as junk, right clicking on the message and selecting Move will allow you to move the select message to the&nbsp;Junk folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the file has been moved to the Junk folder it is listed as being marked
 as Junk.</p>

            <p>Assuming this is a recently modern PC within a few yers old these times and numbers of files seem reasonable.</p>
<p>The reason the number of files may seem to be less is that MSE will only scan about a third of the files it does if the MSE Real-time protection has been disabled recently.&nbsp; Since restarting the system shuts down the Real-time protection, it will always
 need to run a larger scan if this has occured since the previous scan.</p>
<p>You can prove this yourself simply by restarting the PC or just going into the MSE Settings and disabling and then immediately re-enabling Real-time protection, as this will trigger the requirement to scan more files.&nbsp; Then immeditaely scan again and the
 file count will be reduced to the smaller number again.</p>
<p>This is a symptom of a caching feature of the scanner which recognizes these differences and acts accordingly.&nbsp; If MSE has been continuously running it has more confidence about the protected status of your system and so doesn't need to scan everything that
 it does when the recent status of the operating system is unknown.</p>

            Clearing the cache doesn't solve the problem, it never solves the problem yet that is the standard reply given at MSN no matter what the problem is. Sooner or later MSN will stumble across the solution and institute it . .&nbsp; .without any announcement or

    <title>Citrix Access Gateway cannot connect through Nokia Lumia 630 Wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> britishsummertime  say:</h3>
<h2>            Citrix Access Gateway cannot connect through Nokia Lumia 630 Wifi hotspot</h2>
                    <p>My work (NHS) provides me with a Nokia Lumia 630 with 2gb a month mobile internet access for me to use when out and about, specifically for tethering my work laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The organisation uses Citrix Access Gateway VPN which is installed on my work laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution works fine with my home internet, and other WIFI when out and about. &nbsp;It works fine with my personal Android mobile phone. &nbsp;It works fine with my personal Huawei MIFI. &nbsp; However, it does not work with my Nokia Lumia 630.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine when I connect but as soon as it tries to VPN it cannot display the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT decided it was an old laptop and therefore I had a new work laptop, and that worked - for a time. &nbsp; However, a few days later the new laptop presented the same problem. &nbsp;The work laptops are running Windows 7. &nbsp;So other than the Citrix Access Gateway
 it is all Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find any settings on the phone to change which would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My theory, having looked elsewhere, and not found much, was that it was a Windows update which meant that both Windows 7 and the Windowsphone were trying to use some new Microsoft technology that the CItrix could not use and therefore when it got to the
 VPN bit Windows and Windowsphone tried to use a new technology which Citrix could not understand. &nbsp;However, I went through Windows update and since receiving the laptop I can only find Microsoft Office updates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on the latest updates on the Lumia 630 and my work seem relatively up to date with Windows Updates. &nbsp;I can probably find out which version of the Citrix Access Gateway the company are on if that is relevant.</p>

<br />
OK, then what is the problem with centering? Was the size of your original publication the same as the A6 card? I must admit that I don't think in ISO sizes. What is your default paper size for your printer? You&nbsp; may need to change that.<br />

<br />
<br />Adding a Phone number to your Skype account will not in any interfere with your use of Skype, it just provides another method for people to contact you on Skype from a landline or Mobile Phone, rest assured, it will not affect the way you currently use Skype . . .

    <title>Save keyboard customization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jnelson522  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save keyboard customization</h2>
                    <p>I had saved an extensive number of keyboard customizations (for commands, characters, and macros). When Word released its latest update for Office 365, the new "normal.dotx" template no longer has those custom commands. I will now have to reassign each of
 those keystrokes individually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way of storing keyboard customizations, so that they can be easily retrieved and copied?</p>

    <title>something that bugs me in speech Recognition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janetbaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            something that bugs me in speech Recognition</h2>
                    <p>My problem may come from expectations formed from using Dragon speech recognition software. I own it but it keeps crashing, and physical problems have turned me once again to the Windows alternative, where I have just encountered a familiar problem. The
 software quits recording my dictation. It will happen, let me make up a quick example, &nbsp;in a sentence like,
<em>"I understand."</em> I will go to edit that sentence, to insert more words, and to do it I place the cursor before the<em> I
</em>and after the opening quotation marks, and dictate <em>I know, </em>with the expectation that the new sentence will read,
<em>"I know, I understand." </em>But this dictation will not go through, and the software begins making loud ugly beeps indicating its confusion with the dictation, which&nbsp;interrupt my thought (I'm writing fiction, that matters). To make the software accept
 the dictation, I have to go make a space there, between the opening quotation marks and the first
<em>I</em> in <em>I understand</em>, and then the dictation will go through. Dragon doesn't make you do this (no, its dictation just goes off the rails for other reasons!). I am hoping there is some formatting option I could select somewhere that will work.
 I hope there is. Frustration with this inability to dictate with the cursor 'against' another word caused me to quit using the software before, and now my arm pain is back! One inserts and edits a great deal in writing and my habit of just putting the cursor
 where I want to do so appears to be quite well established!</p>
<p>

<p>I too have on occasion noticed this behavior. I just tried the following in Word 2013:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dictated, “I understand the problem to be is”</li><li>Issued command, "go to I" and cursor inserted before word I</li><li>Dictated, “I know you think” </li><li>Sentenced appeared correctly as “I know you think I understand the problem to be.”</li></ol>
<p>Are you using Word 2013 or another software? If another software and the above steps (issuing the go to command) do not work, after inserting cursor in correct position, issue the command, "no space" before dictating what you wish to insert.</p>

            <p>So, I tried using the Go command to place the cursor, but I got the same result (in 2007) as my manually placing the cursor: the machine does not understand my subsequent dictation, although I no longer think it has to do with the cursor being 'up against'
 an existing word, since in the interim I successfully added material <em>after</em> a word and before a period, the opposite of my first example, where the cursor was after a mark of punctuation and before a word. However, when I used the word 'insert' (I
 inadvertently used it in my test of the first kind of condition) the machine read every word after that as dictation and processed it right. &nbsp;So I sort of accidentally cured my problem: I can use 'insert' and get the right formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the 2007 version I am using, Speech recognition opens a double quotation with a space after it. In my trials, I have always first manually corrected it (it is incorrect formatting for the submission of material for consideration in the publishing world),
 and I'm wondering if that has anything to do with my experience, because my first example began with a quotation mark. Maybe if you move the quotation mark right next to a word, Speech Recognition gets confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do consider this item 'closed' since I can use 'insert' to get my result. Thanks for your kindness!</p>

<p>There is no settings place to set formatting rules in WSR. However, you could create and name a&nbsp;macro to accomplish things like one space after a period. As for the no space after the quotation mark command (I use Open Quote):</p>
<p>" this is what happens when you pause slightly and see the " appear before continuing to speak.<br />
"This is what happens when you do not pause between issuing the command and the next word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to create multi-step&nbsp;nested macros which are a series of commands, formatting or navigation orders, you can do this&nbsp;programmatically. There is also a&nbsp;utility that allows you to easily create these with a step by step wizard, but this venue does
 not allow references to the Microsoft Certified Software that does this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to nice service are you comparing to Dragon/Nuance's abysmal&nbsp;support? Are you the Janet Baker who developed the original Dragon back in the late 80s early 90s? Responses to WSR questions in this Microsoft Community is for the most very general. Most help&nbsp;refers
 users to cookie cutter Knowledge Base answers. Personally&nbsp;I have 20 years speech recognition experience including having&nbsp;developed a&nbsp;utility&nbsp;for WSR which adds many features Dragon has but are not in WSR.&nbsp; I have published articles for using&nbsp;WSR and a book
 for programming WSR macros. In addition even though not a Dragon dealer, I was invited to a Dragon dealer/distributor conference to give seminars on speech recognition microphones and WSR. However, when I refer to anything not in the Microsoft Knowledge Base,
 even obliquely, the moderators here, who for the most part don't even use WSR, remove the references.

            Oh Marty let me add one little thing I noticed late: &nbsp;how justifiably bitter you sound about the ridiculous limitations there are on sharing knowledge. &nbsp;Would I be out of line if I pointed out that it stems from our capitalist economic system, with its
 extremes of competition, when we could have a perfectly reasonable one based on broadly distributed ownership and cooperation in gains rather than competition, which, as you express so eloquently, limits growth of a highly useful product. Yes, it did, it does,
 it will. Enough! Lets go back to the late medieval economy just after the serfs had finally become free in Europe.

<h2>            Disabling Click to Next Slide or Enabling Kiosk Mode PowerPoint Online</h2>
                    <p>I'm setting up a Powerpoint presentation that uses action buttons to maneuver through slides.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For example, depending on the button that's clicked, it could move from slide 3 to 7 or from slide 3 to 9.<br />
<br />
I need the buttons to be the only way to change slides or the user of the PowerPoint could accidentally click on the slide and bring them from slide 3 to 4 when slide 3 only correlates with slide 7 and 9.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Actions buttons are not available on PowerPoint Online. So I set them up in the desktop PowerPoint and upload it to PowerPoint Online and the buttons work.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem I have is that I need the Powerpoint to be in Kiosk mode so the user of the Powerpoint cant click/use the arrows to move to the next slide(which 9 times out of 10 will be the wrong slide). This works on the desktop PowerPoint but breaks when I bring
 it over to PowerPoint Online.<br />
<br />
I found a resource online, a guy saved it as a PowerPoint Show before uploading to PowerPoint Online and said he got it to work the way he wanted.

<p>
</p><p>I've tried that and many other options and haven't been able to get it to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Spongetatle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, currently the Kiosk Mode is not available in the PowerPoint Online.</p>

<h2>            Find my phone is not updating the location when I click refresh.</h2>
                    When clicking refresh on the find my phone page it prompts me for my phone number and I check the box to agree to the terms and click done.&nbsp; It does not refresh the location of my phone.&nbsp; The location is still saying that it is from July 5th.&nbsp; I have lost
 my phone is there I can do to fix this or is there another service I can use to locate the phone.&nbsp; My provider said they will not disclose the location because it violates user privacy laws.

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">Lindsey Ath</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are&nbsp;not able to see&nbsp;the latest location on the phone when using Find My Phone on the windowsphone.com, even after refreshing nothing is changing.</p>
<p>Did you used this&nbsp;service before on your phone?, as this might be due to the settings on your phone.
</p>
<p>To use this service you would need to have your phone set up with the Find My Phone, please have a look at the site below;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/basics/find-a-lost-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/basics/find-a-lost-phone</a></p>
<p>...both options under "To change settings for Find My Phone" must be selected on your phone.</p>
<p>Are you able to use other functions like "lock your phone and show a message" or "erase your phone"
</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<h2>            How do I Change the Default Paragraph Font Style in Word 2016</h2>
                    I got it once, but I don't think I applied it to all new documents. Basically it has somehow changed to italics, so now when I paste from certain programs, it comes in all italicized, which isn't great because once I remove the italics I lose all italics
 formatting, which I don't want.

            <p>I doubt that advice on changing the default font style is going to help with your problem. It looks like more is involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest posting a sample document exhibiting this problem to OneDrive or DropBox and sharing a link to it here. (You could send me such a document but then no one else could help you with it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that you have your base style set to automatically update. Note that the
<em>Italics </em>setting in Word is a toggle setting. You may want to look into using the Emphasis paragraph style instead.</p>

</p><p>You actually sound like you know what you're talking about. The poor girl from Microsoft who was trying to help me didn't have a clue. She kept blaming the programs and wondered if removing all formatting was an acceptable workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using regedit to reset Word. It hasn't reset everything and to be honest it didn't look like it was doing anything. But now it seems to be copying and pasting from the programs in question with proper formatting in place. I was just about to send
 you something via Google Drive, but now I'm not sure I have anything to send. Could it be because I opened Word with a new document rather than a pre-existing one?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>When importing files into Access, the fields are not in the same order - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> etlb  say:</h3>
<h2>            When importing files into Access, the fields are not in the same order they were in the Excel or text file they were in.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently made the jump&nbsp; from Access 2003 to 2010.&nbsp; When I go to import a file (Excel or text, for example), the fields (columns) are all out of order.&nbsp; Where the Excel file might have them:</p>
<p>Prefix, First Name, Middle, Last Name, Suffix, Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip</p>
<p>once they're imported into a table, they're random:</p>
<p>First Name, Prefix, Suffix, Middle, Last Name, Address 1, State, Address 2, City, Zip</p>
<p>Now I realize that I can move the fields around, but I'm constantly importing files (of different layout) and it's really obnoxious.</p>
<p>Any way to fix that?</p>
<p>Thanks, Ted</p>

            The field order among themselves should not be a problem, the importation Wizard should allow you to define each field that should receive each Excel column (if you don't click on FINISH too fast).

            thanks, but that doesn't address my issue.&nbsp; I'm not having issues defining fields.&nbsp; The problem is, Access puts the fields in a different order from what they were in in Excel (or text file, etc).&nbsp; I want Access to keep the fields in the same order that
 they're in in Excel

<p>Records in tables do not have a specific order.&nbsp; The order is imposed by using sort specifications in a query.&nbsp; You can think of the table of records as a big bag of marbles.&nbsp; The only way to impose an order on the marbles is to have a number on each marble
 and after you pull it out of the bag you can use the numbers to line them up in an order.</p>
<p>If you predefine the table, you can assign a sequential autonumber field and that will normally keep the records in order (you can sort by the autonumber field).</p>

<p>OK, I guess I'm not making myself clear.&nbsp; I'm not concerned about the order of the<em>rows</em> .&nbsp; I'm concerned about the order of the
<em>columns</em> .</p>
<p>Where the Excel file might have them:</p>
<p>Prefix, First Name, Middle, Last Name, Suffix, Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip</p>
<p>once they're imported into a table, they're random:</p>
<p>First Name, Prefix, Suffix, Middle, Last Name, Address 1, State, Address 2, City, Zip</p>
<p>I've been working with Access since it came out - almost 20 years now.&nbsp; Every other version (not sure about 2007, as I skipped that one) would import the fields (not rows) in the same order as they were in the file being imported.&nbsp; That's what I'm looking
 for.</p>
<p>Also, John, I always have Access assign an autonumber ID field.&nbsp; It always used to put it as the first field.&nbsp; Now it might be there, it might be in the middle or anywhere else!&nbsp; It's maddening!</p>

<p>I just tried this in Access 2010 with an Excel 2010 file and that did not happen.&nbsp; Are those the only columns in your spreadsheet?&nbsp; Are you importing an Excel 2010 spreadsheet?&nbsp; Anything you can tell me to help me reproduce would help.</p>
<p>Also, what John says also applies to column order.&nbsp; Since one should be using the table for anything but holding data.&nbsp; If you want a specific order, use a query.&nbsp; That being said it is odd behavior...</p>

<p>Hi again, Gina.&nbsp; It happens when I import Excel 2010, 2003, csv files, txt files.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to do it when I'm importing dbf files.&nbsp; and it doesn't always do it, but it does about 80% of the time.</p>
<p>No, those aren't the only fields in the file I'm importing.&nbsp; But I mostly deal with address files, so that example of switching around the fields was one that I thought would make the most sense.&nbsp; But there can be five fields or 25 fields and the fields
 end up in a weird order and the autonumber ID field Access assigns will always end up second to last instead of first like it's supposed to.</p>
<p>It's really weird!&nbsp; Would you like me to send you a file?</p>
<p>Thanks, Ted</p>

<p>AutoNumber field???&nbsp; An import operation can not create an AutoNumber field, so, if you really have one, the table nust have been precreated and the import is using the field order in the precreated table.</p>

            It's always created an AutoNumber field.&nbsp; When you run through the import wizard, the second to last screen asks you if you want it to create a Primary Key.&nbsp; If you say yes, it creates a field named ID that is an AutoNumber.

            No need to send a file...&nbsp; I have plenty of file to test with I just thought perhaps yours were special but I see not based on your description.&nbsp; So... how are you doing this import?&nbsp; Are you using an Import Specification?&nbsp; Have you confirmed the order
 of the Import Specification (if you are using one)?

            It would be helpful if you told us how you were trying to do the copy and what happens when you try.<br />
How big is the file?<br />
How much spare space is there on the disc?<br />
Is there a previous copy on the disc?<br />
Does the same happen if you try copying other files?

            <p>What happens when you try to copy it to disc? Are you doing a Save As from within Excel to save the file? You shouldn't do that. Instead, save it, close it, and drag the file to the DVD drive in Windows Explorer. Beyond that, this isn't really an Excel issue;
 take it down the hall to the Windows Shell gurus.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mobile on Lumia 640 issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thealaskan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile on Lumia 640 issue</h2>
                    <p>I have installed windows 10 mobile insider on my lumia 640.</p>
<p>Most things work well and I really like some of the changes.</p>
<p>Some of the items that are not working right now:</p>
<p>1.) Using phone as WIFI hotspot does not work. It gives me an error saying its not availible right now. It worked fine on this same phone with windows mobile 8.1.</p>
<p>2.) The Calendar fonts need to scale better. The text in the day, agenda, today views ends up getting cut off at the bottom.
</p>
<p>3.) the outlook mail app only shows one folder/account at a time. Under windows 8.1 you could view multiple email accounts under a single lynced folder. With 10 you can not view them all together you have to goto the menu and switch to one of the other accounts.
</p>
<p>The new arrangement for settings actually makes sense and is a nice improvement.</p>
<p>Battery life is good and everything else looks good so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the things i don't like about the lumia 640 are that it does not support the 5ghz band of wifi. This is crazy and any new phone should support whatever wifi bands and networks are currently availible. Another negative is the fact that the phone only
 comes with 1GB of ram and 8GB of storage. Sorry but if you are going to write bloated code you need to make sure the ram and storage is much more. And one last negative is the fact that the phone does not support wireless charging.</p>
<p>Hopefully the 'so-called' flagship phone will have support all availible wireless bands, have at least 4GB of ram, 32GB of storage, a removeable and wireless chargeable battery, and a microsd slot!</p>
