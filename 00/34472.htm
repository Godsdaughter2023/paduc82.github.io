    <title>Xbox Rewards Quest not updating achievements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> threesiren99466  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Rewards Quest not updating achievements</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Wolfenstein 2 for the game pass quest and completed 2 achievements. For some reason the quest marked earning a second achievement as complete and bypassed the first challenge to complete any achievement. I tried to wait and then complete
 a 3rd achievement but progress has still not updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what has caused this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Update 1709 installed but Update History shows requires restart</h2>
                    <p>I installed 1709 tonight on Win10 and it shows as fully installed but is clearly not (the signon screen image hasn't changed as it should etc. ). I checked Update History and it says an restart is required. But restarting does nothing to change the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the windows update troubleshooter and it shows two errors fixed -- service registry missing or corrupt and Check for Pending updates. I then tried a restart. No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc /scannow and no errors showed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I just remove the update entirely and try again? It's a very long one.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            The only thing that worked for me, and I've tried every other suggestion I could find, was to create a recovery drive on a USB stick and run it to repair windows, you can keep all your files and settings and you don't need an activation key, that's all
 done automatically with windows 10, it didn't work on boot up, I had to start windows normally then go into files on USB stick and select "set up" and just follow instructions, it didn't work first time I tried it but did on second attempt, it took hours to
 complete so make sure you have plenty of time to try it, now when I check windows update there were three updates which all installed fine, I ran it twice more to check and it says all up to date.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may occur because camera roll folder is where all your photos are stored. It is a system folder which is required&nbsp;by OneDrive to sync your photos on cloud if you choose to use the feature.</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend not to rename the folder to avoid any system settings corruption.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this post is helpful. Get back to us with the results. We are happy to help.</span></p>

<p><strong>zZzDestinyzZz</strong> as this sounds like the issue appeard out of a sudden and you did not had that problem earlier, the only solution may be to have the One restored to factory defaults. We had this issue in some cases lately and if all other
 options like powercycle and system cache resets failed this is the only way to get this fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dirrty30</strong> as your problem is different to the OP and is not related to any Teredo issues please stick to the thread you already opened up here:&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4269/t/1845378.aspx</p>

Thanks for posting. You will need a third party software for this. Xp does not contain gadgets. I use

<p>I had played Ghosts on the 360 and bought some DLC back when it was new.&nbsp; I have had my XBOX One for a few months and decided to buy Ghosts used.&nbsp; Should my DLC show up?&nbsp; My multiplayer progression showed up just not the DLC.</p>

<p>You could upgrade for free for a limited time (until May 31, 2014). So you would need to purchase the DLC if you want to use it on the One.</p>

<p>I recently put an SSD drive in my computer. Using Paragon I was able to copy from my original drive to the SSD. The new drive worked well as a C drive. I then hooked up the OLD drive via eSATA. (Direct connection, not a PCB) Even if I select the OLD drive
 as a startup using F12 ( which brings up the bios boot drive selector in my bios) - I still can't boot from the OLD drive (which was the boot drive before I moved it). The boot process defers to the new drive during the boot process.</p>
<p>So, do I have to switch the internal connections to allow the OLD drive to boot? Or is there a bios selection that I can use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            Hi Marhkco,
<br />
<br />You will need to change the boot order within the BIOS. If you go to the following website, it will show you a rough guide on how to do this (varies between different motherboard manufacturers): <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/change-the-boot-order-in-bios-2624528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/change-the-boot-order-...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

            Hi Mahrko.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this is the modern UEFI BIOS then the Windows BOot Manager must remain set to boot first at all times in Setup.  To add the other drive to a Dual Boot menu to boot it, install EasyBCD and choose Add OS Entry, choose the old OS by it's drive letter.
<br />
<br />If this is older Legacy BIOS, try booting the old drive alone first to see if it has its own boot files.  If not try adding the other hard drive, setting it first to boot.  Again, if it fails you can put the new drive back as it was to start it and add the other one using EasyBCD.  
<br />
<br />If you want to replace the new with the old hard drive, in UEFI you can just remove the old one, then remove the Boot Menu in EasyBCD or msconfig &gt; Boot tab.  For Legacy BIOS move the Bootmgr to the old drive when booted into it using this method:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/209885-bootmgr-move-c-easybcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/209885-boo...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>That would probably work.</p>

<h2>            AV receiver problem with Xbox One</h2>
                    
<pre><span>My Xbox One doesn't seem to like my AV receiver. I have a Pioneer VSX-1022 and when I connect it via HDMI I get audio but no video. I've tried various cables and all six inputs on the AVR but still no dice. The Xbox One works perfectly fine when connected directly to the TV, just not through the AVR. My AVR has never had this problem with any other device I've connected it to - I have an Apple TV, cable box, PS4, Wii U and DVD player connected to it and they all work fine.</span><br /><br /><span>I booted the Xbox One in safe mode (480p) and was able to get a signal that way and could even boost the output to 720p in settings but when I tried to set it to 1080p I get bounced back to the original resolution. So there's something about 1080p video from Xbox One that this receiver doesn't like.</span><br /><br /><span>In the meantime I've got the Xbox One going directly into the TV and if I can't fix it will run optical audio from the Xbox One to the receiver so I can get surround but I'd much prefer

<p>There is a firmware update out for that receiver, I would first run that and try again. &nbsp;If that doesn't work, go into the xbox settings and set the receiver type, then connect the xb1 to the receiver and see if that helps. &nbsp;Also make sure you are using
 hdmi 1.4 (or better) cables. &nbsp;Last, try a different HDMI port on the receiver.</p>

            Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />		Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from it then choose the option at the Install Now screen to Repair your computer.
<br />
<br />This will boot into the Advanced recovery environment.
<br />
<br />Now, we are in recovery manager. We are looking for "Use another operating system". There would be 2 or more instances of Windows 10. Choose the second or the third, machine will restart. Don`t boot again from recovery drive, you can pull it out. Your computer should start properly without any errors. Now we have to make a fix in bootloader. Start cmd as administrator and type:
<br />
<br />bcdedit
<br />
<br />Here you can find all your windows instances with identifiers. Find a registration with path \Windows\system32\winload.exe and check out the indentifier, it`s probably {current}. Type this, ID is your registration identifier:
<br />
<br />bcdedit /default {ID}
<br />
<br />For current you type:
<br />
<br />bcdedit /default {current}
<br />
<br />Restart your PC. 
<br />
<br />You can also delete corrupted instance, there should be "$" in its path. Use this:
<br />
<br />bcdedit /delete {ID}
<br />
<br />Exit then restart into Windows.

            Hi,
<br />Please use Treesize and see what folders in User folder are taking so much of space.
<br />Treesize should tell you which files and folders are taking up space.
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />It is worth checking the Users folder and its subfolders with it.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            <pre>It could be a variety of things thats eating up space, which includes Windows.old and the CBS log folder.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder. 
Other options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.

Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
You can also use TreeSize to help find what else might be using up disk space:

<h3> slkipp  say:</h3>
<h2>            LifeChat LX-3000 USB - Can&#39;t disable microphone live playback in any speaker without disabling microphone.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Pro, 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Problem:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While recording sound through the LX-3000 USB, it always plays back through the headset (or any other speaker set to default.) None of my attempts to "mute" the microphone sound itself has worked - It either A: Disables the microphone completely and then
 &nbsp;I can't record my audio/chat with others; or it always plays back to me through the speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've previously managed to work around this issue when I was using 32-but 7 Ultimate; but there is no option or combination of options I can find in 7 Pro 64-bit that allow me to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Record audio.</p>
<p>2. Listen to sounds from the computer.</p>
<p>2. Not have to listen to the audio I am recording feeding back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Other info:</p>
<p>Using Fraps to record gaming with commentary.</p>

<p>These are all available through the Bungie iPhone application.</p>
<p>I have sent you an all star nameplate through my app, it should now be available for you to change on Bungie.net.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>[/quote]Is it possible to send to more than one person and if so could I trouble you to send it to me as well? I'll pay you in internet cookies.

<h2>            Connection problems between Surface 4 and sculpt ergonomic desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>if I connect the microsoft sculpt ergonomic desktop to my Surface 4 via the docking station, it loses its connection to mouse and keyboard after a short period of inactivity. If than moveing the mouse, it reacts with a lot of delay. Or start typing, the
 first keystrokes are lost. Sometimes a key is repeated as often as desired.</p>
<p>If I connect the receiver directly to the surface, the mouse and keyboard work perfectly.</p>
<p>Is there anyone who has the same effect?</p>
<p>What can I do to get rid of the effect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours </p>

<p>Hi Das,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You mentioned that there's no problem with the mouse and keyboard when connected directly to your Surface Pro 4. In order for us to isolate the issue, we'd like to ask you some questions so we can get this resolved quickly:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using a Surface Dock or a third party docking station? </li><li>If you're using a Surface Dock, have you tried <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/update-surface-dock?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">updating</a></strong> it?
</li><li>What type of cable are you using when trying to connect your devices to the docking station?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out to your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>Monday Feb 25 2013</p>
<p>I finally fixed it, (sort of). but another one of my child accounts has started doing the same thing! &nbsp;At least I know how to fix it. (The 'sort-of' comment is to do with an email address that I deleted, which is causing concern). Read later..</p>
<p>I stuck with the Solution 1: Verify your Microsoft account security information!</p>
<p>Refusing to go with the delete profile and clear cache solutions because I am certain that doing that previously, actually lost me my Battlefield 3 PREMIUM membership via my ONE-TIME-PASS. I am going to start a new thread about that issue later, but for
 now, here's how I fixed it. Blow by blow.</p>
<p>I got a little irate at times on here in my previous rantings and in my article below.
</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE FIXING THIS ISSUE - KEEP THIS IN MIND, You will HAVE TO go round and round in the security system several times to get your emails and passwords added. &nbsp;THIS IS WHAT WAS THROWING ME!
</p>
<p>Everywhere-else I go, (and I have a lot of password &nbsp;and high security sites I sign into daily), don't have this much back and forth with passwords, email and phone verifications. Usually you add an email and get a confirmation in that email, and at any
 previous email; that you have added an extra email (or phone number to accept confirmations codes) and you are done. This system even asks you to confirm the confirmation email!
</p>
<p>WHAT I WAS MISSING was not clicking to confirm a second time, (because I knew I had already done it once).</p>
<p>THEN - If you change or delete an email, that will complicate the issue, as it also did with me. &nbsp;I sat over two hours going back and forth! And with respect &nbsp;to the time it took, I was also writing down a step by step report of everything I did; copied
 page text when I saw it and put my thoughts down on the issue. &nbsp;If you want to read the long step by step version, read on, the short answer is to just keep going round in the security steps, it should eventually work!</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>The account in question is asking for my password via the xbox live family email.</p>
<p>1, (I don't actually have access to this XBOX LIVE FAMILY ( *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) email account do I)?</p>
<p>2, If I have, I've never known of it, as far as I know, I access all of my accounts through my PRIMARY account. Is that right?</p>
<p>I assume those answers are:-</p>
<p>1, NO you don't have actual access to an @xboxlivefamily.com email address, you cannot login and read email there!</p>
<p>2, Yes, you access and manage all of your child accounts under your primary account.</p>
<p>ACTUALLY I CAN STILL DO THAT! </p>
<p>I can sign in with my primary account, and alter all the features of the other accounts like customize the profile or set parental conditions etc. So, my question is, if I have this PRIMARY parental control over this account, why can't I verify the sign-in
 details from within my primary account.</p>
<p>On the xBox machine.</p>
<p>I try to sign in with the xbox family live email address, but no-password is accepted.
</p>
<p>I don't expect it to be, because I usually sign in to my profiles on the xbox machine its-self. &nbsp;And am not asked to sign in with email and password, but usually if I am asked, I enter my primary accounts details and that then signs me in. But, this now
 no-longer works! No combination of password or email works!</p>
<p>And I NEVER get asked for my password to my child accounts via the xbox live family email (the one that is set up when you create an account). Since they are all under my PRIMARY xbox live account, I usually have to go through my primary account to make
 any alterations. Which is how it should be!</p>
<p>ONLINE ON THE PC</p>
<p>I try to verify the account, all of my primary details are done, extra email address and telephone, with the exception that trusted PC which only takes me as far as a blank screen, (that's a separate issue, not related).
</p>
<p>I have access to my primary account on the xbox console and online. So, it is not that AND it is not my PRIMARY account that is asking for sign in with email and password, it is one of the child accounts.</p>
<p>VERIFYING THE CHILD ACCOUNT!</p>
<p>So, I try to verify that child account online, and enter the only other email address, (other than my primary account email address), that I have for that child account. This is a @xboxlivefamily.com address! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I go through the enter email and password, that takes me through the jumbled capture letters routine, that I can never figure out if caps or lower-case. After several failed attempts I get past that to RESET YOUR PASSWORD screen.</p>
<p>MY PAGE OFFERS THESE TWO OPTIONS.</p>
<p>----Start of SCREEN---</p>
<p>Reset your password.</p>
<p>Select an option for resetting your password.</p>
<p>1, Email me a reset link.</p>
<p>2, I can't use any of these options.. &nbsp; &nbsp;- You can still get back into this account by filling out a questionnaire. We'll get back to you within 24 hours (typically a lot sooner).</p>
<p>----end of SCREEN---</p>
<p>I SELECT 'Email me a reset link'. - my primary accounts email is already available (as it should be).</p>
<p>I receive the reset link in my primary accounts email, I sign in to the child account.</p>
<p>I go to the xbox console, and try to sign in with the child account - I'm back to where I started, it is asking me to sign in with email and password and still not accepting anything. I test signing in on Primary and all other child accounts works.</p>
<p>I go back to PC online, still signed in. But it looks odd, I refresh the page. &nbsp;I then get asked to improve the security with adding a telephone number (I already did this on my primary account, that is the parent account of the child account in question,
 so why am I being asked again), anyway, I set this up to my landline telephone. </p>
<p>MY POINT HERE IS - THIS IS A CHILD ACCOUNT! I don't want anyone else to be able to access or alter any details, or to have access to confirmation emails and to be able to accept telephone codes sent, via the child account if things go wrong. I only want
 access and control via the MASTER PRIMARY ACCOUNT! </p>
<p>I've no other option but to do what the Xbox live security wants. So I enter my home phone number again.</p>
<p>The phone rings I get the reset verify code, I enter it, it is accepted.</p>
<p>Then I get a message on the console that says:</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU CAN USE THIS PROOF IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED. </p>
<p>To Confirm, go to <a href="https://account.live.com/p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/p</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;or use the link we send you..</p>
<p>I go back to my email account, and find another confirm the email that is asking if the number I have just confirmed is right, Even though I just answered the phone and got the code and entered it once already.</p>
<p>THIS IS THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE STOP! </p>
<p>Now I go back to my xbox console. I try to sign in again and I get even more security warnings!</p>
<p>It says:-</p>
<p>Your account needs to be more secure. This is the only way we can send you security codes: (My Primary email shown).</p>
<p>It asks: Can you trust messages there?</p>
<p>You then select an answer, Yes or No - I select:-</p>
<p>YES THIS ONE WORKS!</p>
<p>Then you get a message that states.</p>
<p>ALREADY ON YOUR ACCOUNT:</p>
<p>(Shows my primary email again).</p>
<p>ANOTHER QUESTION - IS ASKED.</p>
<p>Pick which one to set up next.</p>
<p>The only thing left is text (AND I DON'T WANT TO DO TEXT). I REFUSE TO! </p>
<p>IS THERE NO LIMIT TO THIS CRAP?</p>
<p>I decide to add yet another email. And go through the whole back and forth with email confirmations again.</p>
<p>It sends a code to that email account, </p>
<p>I log in to that email on PC and get the code and enter it into the xbox console.</p>
<p>WERE NOT DONE YET!</p>
<p>The console reports...</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU CAN USE THIS PROOF, IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED. ARRARRARGGGGGGGG!</p>
<p>To confirm, go to <a href="https://account.live.com/p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/p</a> or use the link we send you.</p>
<p>THIS TIME I DO NOT RECIEVE A LINK IN THE EMAIL. </p>
<p>Now I'm confused???? </p>
<p>AM I supposed to recieve a link in my primary account email address or the one for the added security?</p>
<p>I check both and I have recieved no-more emails.</p>
<p>So, I go to <a href="https://account.live.com/p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/p</a> again (already logged in though, but I am not sure on which accont anymore. I suppose I am now in my child account, because my primary account had the phone and extra email accounts showing, this doesn't),</p>
<p>And this time I decide to re-enter the same phone number and same email address, (logically) since no-email addresses or phone numbers are showing. even though, I just went through all of that hassle.
</p>
<p>Plus - I only have one phone number that I want to use, and I only wanted to use a max of two emails toward my Xbox-live security. &nbsp;Most people won't have more than one or two emails - What do they do?
</p>
<p>I'm not touching the TRUSTED PC thing yet. (It usually goes to a blank white screen and nothing)!</p>
<p>Up to now, I have been working on this for TWO HOURS this saturday morning, and I still cannot sign in on that child account. Saturday 23rd Feb 2013.</p>
<p>Then I clicked to save info, (There was no save button before, or I would have clicked it).</p>
<p>Now I get a message that I cannot enter the same email that I have already used for this account! However, the phone number is the same and that has now updated and is showing on the screen,</p>
<p>I enter a another different THIRD email address, and that goes through the confirm email, routine as before - again.
</p>
<p>I decide to have a break.. </p>
<p>Returning to it, I try to log in first at my accounts on the xbox, each individually are now working, except a different account is not requesting to sign in with email and password. Oh Noooooooo!
</p>
<p>I 'CANCEL' - and can actually sign in on that account - WHATS THAT ALL ABOUT???</p>
<p>It seems a bit stupid to me, to have all that security hassle on one account, yet another identical child account under my primary, only has to be clicked 'CANCEL', and it lets you sign in? &nbsp;</p>
<p>This just actually makes me more angry with Xbox live, after putting me through all of that other crap!
</p>
<p>Wouldn't you be annoyed? </p>
<p>My point here is that the MASTER PRIMARY ACCOUNT should be the only one that I have to update and all the other child accounts below that account should take on the same properties, except that the child accounts have limited options as set-up in the primary
 accounts. Seems logical to me, but this is microsoft!</p>
<p>Another issue is that a while ago, (I don't remember when), I took off another email address on my primary account that I no-longer have access to. (I'm in my child account NOW, and I see the message about that, which seems confusing to me. &nbsp;Am I in my primary
 account at Microsoft or my child account? YES Definately, I'm in the child account, so why should I see activity of my primary account? - Too confusing to worry about.. ).</p>
<p>This deleted email will be removed on 17th March 2013 the message states. </p>
<p>At that time, when I deleted it, I logged in with all my 'then-current'- security information to remove that address.
</p>
<p>Yet, even though I have added a new email address since then, and again today, it states that this new email address added today, will not become active on this account until the 17th March 2013 when the othe email is removed. &nbsp;WHAT? -</p>
<p>Listen Microsoft... &nbsp;I've told you that I don't have access to that email address anymore, but it is still an active email address, so that must be a big security hole. I passed all the security in place on my account at the time when I deleted the email.
 It should be gone already, AND I should have immediate access to the security via the new email address! SINCE I HAVE PASSED ALL OF YOUR NEW SECURITY CONFIRMATIONS ALREADY - Haven't I???
</p>
<p>So why leave that old address in place and active over and above my new security. You have wasted a lot of my valuable time sorting this out and it is still not acceptable. I definitely will be buying a PS4 when that comes out!</p>
<p>It seems to me, ridiculous that I HAVE TO add extra security emails to get access to my account, yet, for the one email I've told xbox live about, that I no-longer have access to it, xbox live is treating it like a swap-over, instead of adding these extra
 email addresses immediately. All the checks and confirmations have been done on the new emails and telephone, to receive codes. and - they have been accepted.</p>
<p>What more can I do. </p>
<p>I test and sign in, all accounts are now working, except the security sign in on another account, mentioned above. It is still asking for email and password, but I CAN JUST CLICK CANCEL to get in. That's nice and tight security, isn't it? &nbsp;Why break in,
 when you have just left the keys in the door?</p>

            <blockquote> 
 <p>
</p><p>Monday Feb 25 2013</p>
<p>I finally fixed it, (sort of). but another one of my child accounts has started doing the same thing! &nbsp;At least I know how to fix it. (The 'sort-of' comment is to do with an email address that I deleted, which is causing concern). Read later..</p>
<p>I stuck with the Solution 1: Verify your Microsoft account security information!</p>
<p>Refusing to go with the delete profile and clear cache solutions because I am certain that doing that previously, actually lost me my Battlefield 3 PREMIUM membership via my ONE-TIME-PASS. I am going to start a new thread about that issue later, but for
 now, here's how I fixed it. Blow by blow.</p>
<p>I got a little irate at times on here in my previous rantings and in my article below.
</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE FIXING THIS ISSUE - KEEP THIS IN MIND, You will HAVE TO go round and round in the security system several times to get your emails and passwords added. &nbsp;THIS IS WHAT WAS THROWING ME!
</p>
<p>Everywhere-else I go, (and I have a lot of password &nbsp;and high security sites I sign into daily), don't have this much back and forth with passwords, email and phone verifications. Usually you add an email and get a confirmation in that email, and at any
 previous email; that you have added an extra email (or phone number to accept confirmations codes) and you are done. This system even asks you to confirm the confirmation email!
</p>
<p>WHAT I WAS MISSING was not clicking to confirm a second time, (because I knew I had already done it once).</p>
<p>THEN - If you change or delete an email, that will complicate the issue, as it also did with me. &nbsp;I sat over two hours going back and forth! And with respect &nbsp;to the time it took, I was also writing down a step by step report of everything I did; copied
 page text when I saw it and put my thoughts down on the issue. &nbsp;If you want to read the long step by step version, read on, the short answer is to just keep going round in the security steps, it should eventually work!</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>The account in question is asking for my password via the xbox live family email.</p>
<p>1, (I don't actually have access to this XBOX LIVE FAMILY ( *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) email account do I)?</p>
<p>2, If I have, I've never known of it, as far as I know, I access all of my accounts through my PRIMARY account. Is that right?</p>
<p>I assume those answers are:-</p>
<p>1, NO you don't have actual access to an @xboxlivefamily.com email address, you cannot login and read email there!</p>
<p>2, Yes, you access and manage all of your child accounts under your primary account.</p>
<p>ACTUALLY I CAN STILL DO THAT! </p>
<p>I can sign in with my primary account, and alter all the features of the other accounts like customize the profile or set parental conditions etc. So, my question is, if I have this PRIMARY parental control over this account, why can't I verify the sign-in
 details from within my primary account.</p>
<p>On the xBox machine.</p>
<p>I try to sign in with the xbox family live email address, but no-password is accepted.
</p>
<p>I don't expect it to be, because I usually sign in to my profiles on the xbox machine its-self. &nbsp;And am not asked to sign in with email and password, but usually if I am asked, I enter my primary accounts details and that then signs me in. But, this now
 no-longer works! No combination of password or email works!</p>
<p>And I NEVER get asked for my password to my child accounts via the xbox live family email (the one that is set up when you create an account). Since they are all under my PRIMARY xbox live account, I usually have to go through my primary account to make
 any alterations. Which is how it should be!</p>
<p>ONLINE ON THE PC</p>
<p>I try to verify the account, all of my primary details are done, extra email address and telephone, with the exception that trusted PC which only takes me as far as a blank screen, (that's a separate issue, not related).
</p>
<p>I have access to my primary account on the xbox console and online. So, it is not that AND it is not my PRIMARY account that is asking for sign in with email and password, it is one of the child accounts.</p>
<p>VERIFYING THE CHILD ACCOUNT!</p>
<p>So, I try to verify that child account online, and enter the only other email address, (other than my primary account email address), that I have for that child account. This is a @xboxlivefamily.com address! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I go through the enter email and password, that takes me through the jumbled capture letters routine, that I can never figure out if caps or lower-case. After several failed attempts I get past that to RESET YOUR PASSWORD screen.</p>
<p>MY PAGE OFFERS THESE TWO OPTIONS.</p>
<p>----Start of SCREEN---</p>
<p>Reset your password.</p>
<p>Select an option for resetting your password.</p>
<p>1, Email me a reset link.</p>
<p>2, I can't use any of these options.. &nbsp; &nbsp;- You can still get back into this account by filling out a questionnaire. We'll get back to you within 24 hours (typically a lot sooner).</p>
<p>----end of SCREEN---</p>
<p>I SELECT 'Email me a reset link'. - my primary accounts email is already available (as it should be).</p>
<p>I receive the reset link in my primary accounts email, I sign in to the child account.</p>
<p>I go to the xbox console, and try to sign in with the child account - I'm back to where I started, it is asking me to sign in with email and password and still not accepting anything. I test signing in on Primary and all other child accounts works.</p>
<p>I go back to PC online, still signed in. But it looks odd, I refresh the page. &nbsp;I then get asked to improve the security with adding a telephone number (I already did this on my primary account, that is the parent account of the child account in question,
 so why am I being asked again), anyway, I set this up to my landline telephone. </p>
<p>MY POINT HERE IS - THIS IS A CHILD ACCOUNT! I don't want anyone else to be able to access or alter any details, or to have access to confirmation emails and to be able to accept telephone codes sent, via the child account if things go wrong. I only want
 access and control via the MASTER PRIMARY ACCOUNT! </p>
<p>I've no other option but to do what the Xbox live security wants. So I enter my home phone number again.</p>
<p>The phone rings I get the reset verify code, I enter it, it is accepted.</p>
<p>Then I get a message on the console that says:</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU CAN USE THIS PROOF IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED. </p>
<p>To Confirm, go to <a href="https://account.live.com/p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/p</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;or use the link we send you..</p>
<p>I go back to my email account, and find another confirm the email that is asking if the number I have just confirmed is right, Even though I just answered the phone and got the code and entered it once already.</p>
<p>THIS IS THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE STOP! </p>
<p>Now I go back to my xbox console. I try to sign in again and I get even more security warnings!</p>
<p>It says:-</p>
<p>Your account needs to be more secure. This is the only way we can send you security codes: (My Primary email shown).</p>
<p>It asks: Can you trust messages there?</p>
<p>You then select an answer, Yes or No - I select:-</p>
<p>YES THIS ONE WORKS!</p>
<p>Then you get a message that states.</p>
<p>ALREADY ON YOUR ACCOUNT:</p>
<p>(Shows my primary email again).</p>
<p>ANOTHER QUESTION - IS ASKED.</p>
<p>Pick which one to set up next.</p>
<p>The only thing left is text (AND I DON'T WANT TO DO TEXT). I REFUSE TO! </p>
<p>IS THERE NO LIMIT TO THIS CRAP?</p>
<p>I decide to add yet another email. And go through the whole back and forth with email confirmations again.</p>
<p>It sends a code to that email account, </p>
<p>I log in to that email on PC and get the code and enter it into the xbox console.</p>
<p>WERE NOT DONE YET!</p>
<p>The console reports...</p>
<p>BEFORE YOU CAN USE THIS PROOF, IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED. ARRARRARGGGGGGGG!</p>
<p>To confirm, go to <a href="https://account.live.com/p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/p</a> or use the link we send you.</p>
<p>THIS TIME I DO NOT RECIEVE A LINK IN THE EMAIL. </p>
<p>Now I'm confused???? </p>

<p>I check both and I have recieved no-more emails.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 &#38; Playon Streaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> margueritesummers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; Playon Streaming</h2>
                    <p>I am still trying (since early January) to adapt to the issues related to streaming to a WD My Cloud network device. So far I have managed to access the device in Windows and with&nbsp; Power Media Player 14. My efforts to use Playon to access it have failed.
 I am totally out of ideas. Previous access was done by adding a mapped network drive to the Playon library. Worked great in Windows 7. In Windows 10, the mapped drives are just not there when adding folders to the library.&nbsp; I especially like Playon for its
 commercial skipping ability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Trying to find a different OS for my month old computer is not an attractive option but I might consider it as a last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks All</p>

            Hi Marguerite
<br />
<br />Since its a WD drive, try Mapping the drive in File Explorer.
<br />If you are trying to log onto it, use your current account username and password.
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of the computer?
<br />Are you connecting to a USB 3 or 2.0 port. 
<br />
<br />Open Notepad, copy and paste the following into it:
<br />
<br />@echo off
<br />
<br />:Start
<br />timeout /t 5 /nobreak &gt;NUL
<br />if exist X:\NUL goto End
<br />net use X: \\server\share /USER:domainname\username /PERSISTENT:YES
<br />if ERRORLEVEL 1 goto Start
<br />:End
<br />
<br />Replace the domainname\username portion with the appropriate values.
<br />
<br />Save it as mapnetwork.bat
<br />
<br />Right click it then click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Restart your computer then check if it now works.

<h2>            Download management on the Xbox app</h2>
                    Is there any way for me to check the progress of games and/or apps downloading on my xbox without the need to manually check on the console? I would use this feature a lot to check on games downloading on my console on my xbox app. Mostly b/c I travel
 a bit and want to see if my game is finished downloading or has some extra file to go.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your question is a little confusing.<br />
<br />
There are two totally separate computers and not a dual boot situation?<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to run both computers with an updated version of Windows (assuming<br />
they can run the version you want to update to) that OS would take the place of the XP or<br />
Vista that you upgraded to.<br />
<br />
So since the new OS takes the place of the old OS do you have enough room to update with<br />
that in mind. <br />
<br />
How much room is on the C:\ for each computer now and how much space does the present OS<br />
take up on each now.<br />
<br />
Also if needed and the drive(s) are partitioned into more than one partition then you can<br />
eliminate a partition and expand C: . Keep in mind when you eliminate&nbsp;a partition everything<br />
on it removed. Also you could shrink a partition and expand C: in many case which would leave<br />
the partition you shrink and the data on it. <br />
<br />
Be sure to make data backups before you do anything!<br />

<p>Sorry, but your question is hard to understand. Is the following what<br />
you mean?</p>
<p>You have two computers, and each has two partitions--C: and D:. On<br />
each computer, you want to remove the D: partition and make the C:<br />
partition the full size of the physical drive?</p>
<p>If that's what you mean, yes, you can do that. You can do it directly<br />
in Vista, but in XP, you need third-party software.</p>
