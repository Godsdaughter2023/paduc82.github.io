<h2>            Dell - Windows 10 crash</h2>
                    Hello.&nbsp; We bought a new Dell that had Windows 10 preloaded.&nbsp; After about 45 days, we got the blue screen of death.&nbsp; We called Dell and they did a diagnostic and it's not the hardware but the Windows 10 that is causing the problems.&nbsp; We now have to find
 a way to get a USB and reload Windows 10 onto the brand new computer.&nbsp; Anyone else have this problem?&nbsp; Dell won't send out a tech as they say it's not their problem.&nbsp; Thoughts?&nbsp; Thank you.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can get the windows 10 from here on a different computer.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If you need any help let me know. I would have thought that Dell would have helped you resolve the problem, even if only to provide good customer service.</p>

            <p>BSOD is normally caused by a driver issue, so in that respect Dell are probably correct, as Windows 10 Updates will update your drivers, and this may be the cause of your issue. You don't say what the message on the BSOD was. I would try the Dell Support
 Page for your System and see if there are any updated drivers that will rid you of the Bluse Screen of Death issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If however, you do want to perform a clean install of Windows 10,&nbsp;<span>Click&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>HERE</span></a><span>&nbsp;to
 download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO, create Installation media on either a Flash Drive (min 4GB) or DVD</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, Boot your System from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When this window appears, select bottom option (Custom: Install Windows Only)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>During the installation process select 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital
 entitlement stored on the Microsoft Servers</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I Hope this Answers your
</span><span>Question</span><span>!</span></span></p>

            <p>You might also go to the Dell site and check for updated drivers and Bios updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a new Inspirion 17 and there I was still showing the original bios but there was an update to version 3.&nbsp; Of course, updating a bios can have problems.&nbsp; Did Dell ask you anything about your bios version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This system Blue Screened three times in the first 30 minutes of activity.&nbsp; Those have now stopped.</p>

            Thank you.&nbsp; We are back up and running.&nbsp; I've also heard that the crash was because Windows 10 runs updates automatically without notification.&nbsp; What happens if you shut your computer down while it is updating?&nbsp; I am wondering if that is what happened
 to us.&nbsp; Also, is there a way to tell if the computer is doing updates?&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

            You highlight them and delete. You can highlight many at once with the mouse cursor or holding down the Ctrl key while clicking on each. Or delete entire folders. Or, just reinstall Windows.

            Click on&nbsp;'My Computer' and click on the c: drive and then find the search box.&nbsp; You said documents as in Word although you could have meant anything.&nbsp; So.. If you want to get rid of word docs then type *.doc in the seach box.&nbsp; This will bring up all the
 Word documents, then highlight and delete.<br />
If you want to ake anything else off just look at the last letters and do the same thing as above.

<h2>            AOL icon on System Tray</h2>
                    I was recently hired as a CSR to work from home. One requirement is that AOL needs to be deleted from my system tray. PLEASE HELP!!..&nbsp; I really need the job.

<p>Hi Annette,</p>
<p>Unless you really need AOL, you can just uninstall it. I’ve attached a link below with their steps on doing so:</p>
<p><a href="http://help.channels.aol.com/kjump.adp?articleId=218220#first" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.channels.aol.com/kjump.adp?articleId=218220#first</a>
</p>
<p>If you still want AOL but don’t want it to startup with Windows and appear in your system tray, do the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click <b>Start</b></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In ‘Start Search’ type <b>msconfig</b></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Press Enter, or click <b>msconfig</b></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the window that appears called “System Configuration”, click the tab entitled
<b>Startup</b>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once in that tab find the “Startup Item” for AOL and
<b>uncheck</b> it.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click<b> Ok</b></p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You will be prompted to restart to see the changes, which you can do at that moment or later.</p>
<p>Alright Annette, we hope that one of these solutions provide you with what you were looking for. If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>

            I figured out that converting my HEVC (h.265) file to h.264 allows the video to play at regular speed. Not sure why this is but it works.&nbsp;

<h2>            File Complaint- Tells kids to kill themselves after losing a game... </h2>
                    
<p>Today while playing Call of Duty, I ran in to a special type of person (Detroit mindset). We played a few games, me and mine came out on top, and a simple, completely genuine "Good Game" from my mouth after a very good, close game of KC, spurred this man
 to release a flurry of insults, the worst of which was to tell me to quote "Take my disk out, break it and slit my wrists with it and let myself bleed out to do the whole world a favor"</p>

<p>Now I can deal with trash talking, but this hits home. A few years ago 9th grader I knew was picked on and very depressed. One day kids ganged up on him and told him to Kill himself... So he did. He went home and ended his own life. He was in such a dark
 place that someone pushing him to end his own existence, saying it would benefit his family and friend if he were dead, made him end his life. I for one lost people when I was very young and went through dark times. I don't believe this person should be going
 around using this as an insult. You never know where the childs mind could be, when he heres those words. Talking smack is one thing. Telling someone to off themselves over losing in a game is crossing a line. I was told my MS support to post on the forums
 to get the community to report him, so please help the XBL community by filing a complain on
<strong>Detroit mindset</strong>. Thank you.</p>

<p>A great post Iam a mature aged gamer and I am sick of some if the abuse I cope on Call OF Duty. I play for fun and in one game I was leading, like everyone else hiding in corners and this one particular player decided it would be fun to send me a lovely
 message it was so insulting I decided to report this player to XBL. The problem is I believe that these kids are to young to be playing things like call of duty online or they are just not educated enough to handle themselves in the multiplayer environment
 and like everyone else I pay my $79.95 a year to access this service and I should be able to play these games the way I want to without getting insulted. I was going to replay but in the end it's not worth it.</p>

<p>You can't name and shame on the forums. It's against the rules. We don't know if this person did what you say, so we can't just go around and report him for something we did not here. All you can do is mute, block and report the man who did this, you can't
 get anyone else to do it for you if they weren't there to hear it, sorry it's just how it is. Also, if you don't want to deal with players like this, there's a mute function for a reason, use it and move on. You could also stick to party chat like I do so
 I never have to hear a bunch of kids complaining often. </p>

<h2>            Want the Search Bar in Windows 10 not Contana</h2>
                    I want to see the search box and not Cortana on the task bar. I can get rid of Cortana through&nbsp; properties but there is no option to show the search box instead. I have spent hours online trying to find a solution to this problem but have been unsuccessful.
 I just recently upgraded to a HP desktop with Windows 10 Pro installed.

            <p>I have only ever seen good reviews of Classic Shell, but I don't use myself. It's not that there were any bugs or anything, I just didn't like it. I use Start10 from Stardock</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you install Classic Shell and try it. If you don't like it, uninstall it and try something else. Start10 does come with a 30-day free trial. There are other programs that do the same job to varying degrees but these two are the most popular that
 I am aware of.</p>

<div>Why doesn't the Surface RT allow apps from outside of the Store to be downloaded?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It seems to me that this sort of limitation is giving the Surface RT a 'lifespan' from a user perspective. I have apps that are on my home computer from outside the store that I have been unable to take with me on the Surface because someone thought that
 was the right way to go about it, but yet there are not nearly enough suitable apps in the store that could supplement how businesses operate.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It also seems that retailers selling this product are not being armed with the right/or enough information to assist consumers in making the right choice. I feel like now I have this tablet that I can't do anything with. Very disappointed on so many levels
 right now, and if anyone knows a way around it, I'd love to know.</div>

<div>Why doesn't the Surface RT allow apps from outside of the Store to be downloaded?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It seems to me that this sort of limitation is giving the Surface RT a 'lifespan' from a user perspective. I have apps that are on my home computer from outside the store that I have been unable to take with me on the Surface because someone thought that
 was the right way to go about it, but yet there are not nearly enough suitable apps in the store that could supplement how businesses operate.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It also seems that retailers selling this product are not being armed with the right/or enough information to assist consumers in making the right choice. I feel like now I have this tablet that I can't do anything with. Very disappointed on so many levels
 right now, and if anyone knows a way around it, I'd love to know.</div>

Hello sportsmad2, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very simply, because they won't work on a RT device. They aren't designed to work with either the processor or OS. If they could they would be offered in the Store, all the developers have to do is submit them to Microsoft.

I think sportsmad is talking about being frustrated that the programs that run on Windows, which he already has on his regular PC, aren't able to be run on the Surface RT, and he wasn't warned about this by the retail staff when he purchased it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sportsmad; you need to buy the Surface <u>Pro</u>, which can run any program that&nbsp;runs on your&nbsp;Windows PC.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Surface <u>RT</u> that you bought,&nbsp;has a weaker processor inside, similar to the kind of processor in an iPad, and uses different Operating System that has&nbsp;been optimized to run on that weaker processor&nbsp;and use less power (and last a longer time without
 charging) and only runs programs that have been similarly optimized to work with that OS and that chip...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you can get a refund or exchange...I have to imagine you have 30 days to go back and get your money back, or at least trade up to the Pro model.</p>

Hello jaybart, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sure wouldn't assume any of that - every retailer is different and has different return policies. If he wants to return the Surface he should contact the place he bought it and find out the policy.

That's completely up to you, isn't it? &nbsp;Just like any other decision that led you to respond in this conversation that you have no other history in...?
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, perhaps it would be wise to figure out what you need &amp; want and what devices get you closest to fulfilling those things before you continue playing the 'purchase, frustrate self, return &amp; repeat' game?</div>

            <p>Thanks for those replies. As jaybart guessed, I was referring to programs that I already run on my other Windows devices. In short Shenan, I don't want an Android product; if I did I would have gone down that road from the get-go.&nbsp;Windows has an excellent
 product and as an existing Windows user&nbsp;I expected full functionality when I purchased the Surface. Pro was not available to me, and when I discussed how I would be using the product (i.e., for business) the&nbsp;retailer did not see any reason why I would have
 had any difficulty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact I have now had the RT for six months and the Pro is only going to be newly released makes its purchase for me prohibitive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike Apple, who inundates the consumer with its flashy stores, the option to talk to someone with 'real' knowledge about Windows does not exist for me. Had I had that opportunity, I might have held off on the purchase until Pro became available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I can say is that I'm disappointed. I don't feel that I am making best use of the RT. It might be geared similarly to iPad, but personally I find it a far superior product being 'kept back' by development constraints. Pro, for me, is not worth the money.</p>

Right -my bad as well - you did not get a Windows 8 tablet - you got a less expensive (for a reason) Windows RT tablet. &nbsp;Windows RT &lt;&gt; Windows 8 as it runs on a different platform. &nbsp;If you wanted a Windows 8 tablet - that would have been a Surface Pro. &nbsp;Along
 the lines of the Surface Pro vs Surface RT - there were other options already out there when you got your Surface RT that ran Windows 8 Professional (likely) and would have worked the way you seemingly desire.
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Apple iPads do not run everything Apple Macbook Air's do. &nbsp;Different platforms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>I've been to Apple stores, I have been to a Microsoft store - in either case - I got my information I needed from the Internet before I ever went and it was more of a physical touch/feel series of questions then (and perhaps a few just to see if the sales
 people had a clue about what they were selling and verify what I thought I knew.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I am saying is that the information was published before you purchased the device and once you purchased it and determined it was not for you - the information you needed to decide to return it was still there and the option to return it probably
 was too.</div>

<div>As far as RT being held back by 'development constraints' - please explain. &nbsp;Just like Apple doesn't make the majority of apps for its device - Windows does not make them for its device. &nbsp;There has been a pretty big jump since its release and it is YEARS
 younger than an iPad. &nbsp;Early adoption always has had its drawbacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>A good example of a company trying to prevent what you are experiencing by delaying the release while developers create and perfect more things for their product: Leap Motion. &nbsp;Will it work out for them? &nbsp;Only time will tell. &nbsp;I pre-ordered one last July.</div>

<p>﻿I'm sorry but your question is very unclear.&nbsp; All versions of Windows since XP have had the ability to read and write ZIP files.&nbsp; The BIOS is the Basic Input Output System - a chip in your computer that contains the low-level code it needs to start up and
 operate properly.&nbsp; The BIOS has never had the ability to read or write ZIP files.</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>
<p>1. Windows 7 (and also Vista and XP) <strong>does</strong> have the built-in capacity<br />
for unzipping zipped files. The zipped files will appear as a folder.<br />
Simply double-click to open the "folder" and get to the files<br />
contained within the zip file.</p>
<p>2. This has nothing to do with the BIOS. It's a Windows function, not<br />
a BIOS function.</p>
<p>3. Neither Windows 7, nor any other version of Windows, has a BIOS<br />
unique to it. The BIOS is matched to the motherboard, not to Windows.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As per the information, did you open System Configuration by typing in the same on the search bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have open the window from the source mentioned above, I suggest that you try opening via&nbsp;Run Command and check. To&nbsp;open the Run Command dialog box, tab on
<strong>Win+R.</strong>&nbsp;In the dialog box type <strong>msconfig </strong>which will open the System Configuration window. Make sure that you restart the PC after making the desired changes.</p>
<p>

            I suggest you to try updating using Update Assistant:

<br />
<br />Before, you can perform a filesystem check:
<br />
<br />1. Type "cmd" in windows search bar
<br />2. Right click on  "Command Prompt"
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator"
<br />4. Type "sfc /scannow" without quote and press ENTER

<p>Hello everyone&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I sincerely apologize if this is a dumb question, but I am curious about it.&nbsp; Thank you very much for your assistance regarding this matter, I really appreciate it&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Is the Xbox 360 using dedicated servers now or is it still on the old servers?&nbsp; Furthermore, are all of the games that were out prior to the release of the Xbox One going to run on dedicated servers or not?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>Personally I have very little understanding about how servers work and what makes them differentiate from other types. So long as they play well I am happy :) thankfully the days of 'host leaving ends the game' are behind us. CoD4 was amazing but that was
 a pain in the neck!</p>

<p>Hello "CloudStrife 900" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>I don't know much about how servers work either LOL &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>But, if I were to guess, it means that the server purpose is to only run that game; not multi-task like the other servers (example: run a game / games, run company website, etc...)</p>

<p>At the time you wrote that post it was my afternoon, so thank you very much :)</p>
<p>Yeah that would be my guess too. I can't understand how they operate but you are probably right with what you say. I saw a room full of servers on google and thought...wow. It also makes me curious about how servers stop working and how they get fixed. Must
 be like from the TV with a guy that slides out a piece of the server and hooks a laptop to it. Guessing again of course lol!!</p>
<p>You have a nice day, afternoon or night too Lei :D</p>

<p>The concept of having a dedicated server is absolutely awesome, but I wonder if it still lags a lot because while it may not be lag-proof, it should almost be lag free LOL &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Hey there :D</p>
<p>From the little experience I have with dedicated servers, they seem a little bit better or should I say more accurate with in-time online play. Though I am probably just off there and not making much sense lol.

<p>Hello "CloudStrife 900" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>As you know, I very rarely play multiplayer, but the experience with dedicated servers SHOULD be much better than running off from regular servers; leaving the users internet connection as the major deciding factor on the smoothness of the on-line experience.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MobileDeviceHelper</strong> connects and syncs your mobile devices to the computer and app, while
<strong>distnoted</strong> provides mobile device support which processes data exchange between your computer and mobile device via USB cable. To get a better grip of the two programs, and it's best to get in touch with the app manufacturer.</p>

<h2>            Optimizer doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>My win 8.1 computer is very sluggish. Computer will be 2 in Dec. I had not done any maintenance on it so I decided today to do that. Drive showed no errors but was 19 % fragmented. Seems it is set up for auto on both. I don't think thats is working. So I
 tried to do it manually. I click the drive and then optimize&nbsp; and it does nothing. Any help would be appreciated. I upgraded from 8 to 8.1 quite a while ago.</p>

            Hi JeffreyWee,<br />
<br />
Since you were able to update some of your PCs when you tried removing them from your network domain, there is a possibility that a configuration on your group policy is causing the issue. With that said, I suggest that you get in touch with your Network Admin
 to get help on reconfiguring your group policy in order to install the latest update on your client PCs.<br />
<br />
For further assistance with the group policy, I suggest that you post your concern on
<strong>IT Pro TechNet</strong> forums since it’s happening to multiple machines with a domain environment. Please post your question in the
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Search/en-US/Technet?query=network&amp;beta=0&amp;ac=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet Windows 10 Networking forum</a></strong>.<br />

Regards.

<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>If one is 32 bit and the other one is 64 bit, then you may have to perform a clean installation of Windows
 7.</span></p>
<p><span>This issue can also occur if the ISO file is corrupted. I would suggest you to get another copy of the upgrade

    <title>Unable to save or share screenshots and clips&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to save or share screenshots and clips&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>This has been driving me nuts.&nbsp; No matter what game I take a screenshot or make a clip in, I am both unable to save them and cannot share them either!&nbsp; I have tried a hard system reset.&nbsp; I have checked, double checked, and triple
 checked my privacy settings.&nbsp; I have toggled allowing broadcasting on and off.&nbsp; And I have had XBL Gold for 11 years straight.&nbsp; My NAT is Open.&nbsp; NOTHING I do seems to affect my ability to save or share. :(&nbsp; Eventually any screenshot I take just disappears
 because they are just temporary if not saved and I can save none.&nbsp; 1TB model with over 60% free space.&nbsp; I just want to be able to use the Game DVR feature that comes with the system for once!</p>
<p>Can someone please help me with this?</p>

<p>BMLIMO the error code you run into seems spread when using DVR in saving game clips and I hope someone will come along to solve it once and for all.</p>
<p>An improvised way to go around it is this, when the error code appears: go to end clip now and keep the last 5 min. Most of the times the clip is saved.</p>

<p>M3tal Daz3, Yeah, like I said it will make clips and take screenshots, I just can't SAVE any of them. &nbsp;Going into Game DVR I can either select one and get this message:</p>
<p>"Capture not saved</p>
<p>Sorry, the capture you selected was not saved. Please try again."</p>
<p>Or all of them and get this slightly different one:</p>
<p>"No captures saved</p>
<p>Sorry, none of your selected captures were saved. Please try again."</p>
<p>And no other info is provided as to why. No error code. And after awhile, unsaved screens/clips get deleted automatically. :(</p>

<p>The same thing been happening to me and it just happened out of no where? I recorded clips &amp; screenshots, everything there on my game DVR but it won't show on my activity feed? Nothing sharing but the last feed from 1-3 days ago etc. The funny part is that
 I can't see no one feed but their achievements, who they added as friend, or broadcasting. Nothing of screenshots or clips? It's very annoying &amp; wondering if any of you problem fix or anyway to solve it??

<h3> whalah1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center will not scan digital channels</h2>
                    I have an 8200n with Vista.&nbsp; It came with the tv tuner built in and it was sold to me under the assumption that it WAS GOING TO WORK WITH THE DIGITAL TRANSITION.<br />
<br />
Well..that day came and went and since that time my computer has been at BEST BUY more than it has been in my home.<br />
<br />
I have windows vista prem. edition and my media center is version 6.0<br />
The tuner card was called "defective" at best buy and since replaced. BUT....it still says not digital signal when you run a scan.<br />
Prior to the transition....the system worked perfectly.<br />
Everything I find on the net says that there is a compatibitly issue with the tuner card installed and the media player.<br />
The system has and Hauppauge wintv HVR-1800 (Model 78xxcombo atsc/qam) card.&nbsp; That is what they replaced and reinstalled.<br />
My cable provider is broadcasting clearqam and I have had them out to check the signal.&nbsp;
<br />
NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW TO GET THIS THING TO WORK.<br />
Best Buy wants to blame the cable provider and says that if I would switch to the dish it would work fine.<br />
What does that have to do with anything?&nbsp; Isn't this think supposed to recieve a digital signal?<br />
I purchased a service agreement with Best Buy and my year of support with HP has run out.<br />
Ultimately....Best Buy has to figure out a way to make this right....but they are clueless.<br />
<br />
It is also IMPOSSIBLE to get any help from HP or Microsoft.&nbsp; Their customer support website is pitiful and all they want is you to pay for support.<br />
<br />
Somebody...somehwhere has to have an idea as to what can be done to make this work.<br />
<br />
And...no....running it thru the cable company box does not work. It can not find the IR cable and you can only view channels on channel 4 via the box. So...the whole glamor of the media player....play and record is USELESS!<br />
<br />
Please HELP!<br />
<br />

Thank you for choosing Microsoft answers forum for Windows Vista.<br />

When scanning for channels you probably want to select the QAM-256 modulation and the standard cable frequencies, but it is possible your cable operator uses HRC or IRC. Some rural operators use QAM-64. It is possible to scan only the higher frequency channels
 if your system is a hybrid system with analog channels utilizing the lower frequencies.<br />
<br />
<strong>Scanning for channels:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Warning</strong>: the program 'dvbscan' on some systems is actually 'scan', if you try 'dvbscan' and get an error, try 'scan'.<br />
<br />
First a list of the receivable channels must be created. Be sure to have your hardware installed properly with the DVB drivers and firmware loading. Watch your /var/log/messages file for errors as your run these commands and address any problems you find.<br />
<br />
You must have already installed Dvb Apps. The relevant tools for this procedure include:<br />
<br />
dvb-apps/util/scan/scan<br />
dvb-apps/util/szap/azap<br />
<br />
Run scan with the default table as an arguement, for open signals on a cable line, one of these two should work. HRC and IRC are different frequency methods that can be used, its hard to tell which your cable company uses without trying both. You may also not
 receive any channels this way, and may have to manually run the next step using all frequencies. More on this later. First, lets at least try atscscan. Note that atscscan does not automatically generate an output file. You probably want to redirect output
 when you begin this long process.<br />
<br />
cd /usr/share/doc/dvb-utils/examples/scan<br />
or<br />
cd dvb-apps/util/scan<br />
./scan atsc/us-Cable-Standard-center-frequencies-QAM256<br />
<br />
This process may take considerable time and report a lot of tuning failed messages. Let the entire process complete. If you do not find any channels with this freqency list, you can try some of the others like:<br />
<br />
us-Cable-HRC-center-frequencies-QAM256<br />
us-Cable-IRC-center-frequencies-QAM256<br />
<br />
You may also have to extend the frequencies if your cable provider uses higher frequencies than those in the file. To do this follow the increment, ie for HRC add 6 MegaHertz for each additional channel.<br />
The output at the end will look similar to:<br />

            Ok&nbsp; Savan H.<br />
Thanks for your response. I am glad that someone is listening.<br />
The only problem is....I am not a computer expert and that was in a foriegn language!<br />
The only thing I know how to do with Media center is run a channel scan and answer the prompts
<br />
As far as choosing what type of cable and where to select that....I don't see that as an option with Media Center.<br />
I did notice that with wintv, but that is not the type of program I want to use.<br />
Unfortunatly since the transition.....even the geeks at best buy can not get the wintv to work on this system either.<br />
Can you put your directions in a "computers for dummies" version?<br />

<p>Thanks again.....I have already seen all those links...and for what they are telling me..this thing should work.<br />
<br />
I transported my computer to a nearby town that uses a different carrier.&nbsp; Boom..back up and running.<br />
So....I assume that it is my cable company.<br />
I took my computer back home and called the cable company and was ready to let them have it.<br />
<br />
Well...sorry to say that according to them......they have been in contact with microsoft and found that Windows Vista does not support the digital tuner card that was factory installed in the computer.
<br />
<br />
You have to understand that in my town....lil old Wooster Ohio we took the digital transition seriously and have already made the leap to QAM.&nbsp; There isn't a set in the town that will run without a cable box attached.<br />
<br />
So....I wondered why my computer would work on a different system and it was explained that they have not made the entire transition that has been mandated over the next five years.<br />
<br />
BINGO...that is what I was told 4 weeks ago and tried to tell the GEEKS at Best buy.<br />
<br />
So......what is the solution?&nbsp; I was told that the ONLY thing that will work is to dump VISTA and install WINDOWS 7 when it becomes available.&nbsp; My cable company techie said he has the same system and was given the opportuntiy to see the new software.&nbsp; He installed
 it and now Media Center runs fine.<br />
<br />
So......why did they make a computer with the guts to do something and not the brains to run it?<br />
And.....who is responsible for the fix?<br />
I bought this computer under the assumption that it was going to work because it was advertised to do so.<br />
Best buy just wants to install new tuners and from all I can see that is just going to waste more of my time.<br />
I am not dealing with any signal other that QAM.<br />
<br />
Please be honest with me!&nbsp; Is this true?&nbsp; Will Vista Media Center support the QAM tuner and RUN?</p>

            Whalah, I posted this in the thread that you 'ranted' in.&nbsp; I'll post it here, too.<br />
Media Center for Vista, as you've learned, doesn't have native Clear-QAM support.&nbsp; Reason:&nbsp; it wasn't really necessary when Vista shipped.<br />
However, Hauppauge wrote a utility to 'enable' (in a roundabout way) that functionality on several of their tuners, yours included.&nbsp; Most other tuner manufacturers have also done this (Hauppauge, BTW, wasn't the first.)<br />
You can read about it (as well as download it) from <a href="http://www.shspvr.com/smf/index.php?topic=11509.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.<br />
<br />
(side note:&nbsp; Google search for hvr-1800 qam vista will yield a lot of info on this. ;)&nbsp; )<br />
<br />
HTH,<br />

            Now that wasn't very nice.<br />
I didn't think I "ranted".&nbsp; I was in fact stating what I believe to be a fact.<br />
Unfortunatly most people buy a computer and expect it to do what it was advertised to do.<br />
All that I read and find states that Vista will not support the card that was installed in the computer and that in fact it will not tune QAM even though it was marketed as it would.<br />
<br />
I bought the computer and was told that it would work only to find that even the Geeks at Best Buy are scratching their heads and not honoring the warranty they sold me stating that it is and will be Microsoft's problem and not their responsibilty.<br />
<br />
I tried that link that you sent me....and even though I registered i was unable to download the update as it would not let me past the login.<br />
<br />
I tried it from a different link after I googled it....just as you suggested and that did not work either.<br />
<br />
I do NOT need a set top box to view channels with my cable.&nbsp; My 52 inch flat screen has a qam tuner and it brings in the channels just fine.&nbsp; I spoke with my cable company and they said that time warner, dish and other broadcasters are not using the TRUE QAM
 signal yet.&nbsp; When they do....this problem will be even more widespread.<br />
<br />
I just want a solution......not the run around.<br />
And.....I bought a warranty......and got a useless computer with a tv tuner .....but it's got a warranty!<br />

            Whalah, I didn't mean to offend.&nbsp; I called it a 'rant', because it seemed (to me, anyways) a somewhat off-topic gripe, rather than an actual request for help.&nbsp; It also wasn't your thread.&nbsp; ;)<br />
You already had your own thread running.&nbsp; Respectfully, it wasn't needed.&nbsp; :)<br />
<br />
Back on-topic:<br />
Had to look around for a bit, but...<br />
The Hauppauge QAM plugin is available at Hauppauge's FTP site:&nbsp; 
ftp://ftp.haupauge.com/Support/MCE/&nbsp;.&nbsp; Grab the "mce_qam.zip" file.&nbsp; Once extracted, you'll find the driver setup app, as well as a .doc howto.<br />
(I'm sorry.&nbsp; I didn't know that shspvr.com password-protected their FTP site.)<br />
And, <a href="http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/1/262919/ShowThread.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this thread at thegreenbutton.com</a> discusses some of the trials, tribulations, tips, and tricks to a proper setup.<br />
<br />
Again, though, this really points back to the PC manufacturer kind of implying that you should get Feature X (because the hardware is there), even though the OS (or, specifically, Media Center in Vista) really doesn't support that feature.&nbsp; Many third-party
 TV/PVR apps (such as BeyondTV) do; TV Pack 2008 for Vista Media Center does (but, trust me, you don't want it); and, as your cable guy said, Media Center in Windows 7 does, as well (and, I like it! :) )
<br />
But, again, that's why the various tuner manufacturers (Hauppauge, Avermedia, and SiliconDust, to name a few) wrote their workaround BDA drivers to "enable" Clear-QAM tuning, even though Media Center didn't support it.<br />
<br />
HTH,<br />

            Ok. Apology accepted....but I am no where closer to a solution.<br />
I was able to find that link..do all that you said...followed the directions to a T.<br />
Got to the signal strength....and NOTHING has changes.&nbsp; I get only a weak (red) signal strengh reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
It tells you to say that you are using a "digital antenna" even though you are using cable. That I don't understand.<br />
I went to the program library on Media Center as intructed and scanned for clear qam. NOTHING.<br />
<br />
So.....what I need to know is this.<br />
Regardless if Hauppauge has a fix for this.....what would you suggest?<br />
Best buy is backed into a corner because I bought a warranty package from them&nbsp;and will install Windows 7 when it is released&nbsp;on my system for free if that will fix it.<br />
I don't want to waste my time.....so all I am asking is....will that be the EASIEST &nbsp;fix for&nbsp;this thing?<br />
<br />
I would also love to be proven wrong and see this thing work as you say it will without going to Windows 7 but...........?????

            Whalah, re-reading the thread, I caught this:<br />
<em>&lt;You have to understand that in my town....lil old Wooster Ohio we took the digital transition seriously and have already made the leap to QAM.&nbsp;
<strong>There isn't a set in the town that will run without a cable box attached</strong>.&gt;<br />
</em>Are you saying that even a TV with a build-in Clear-QAM tuner won't work on your cable system, and
<em>requires</em> an STB (set-top box) to tune <em>anything</em>?<br />
Does a regular old TV plugged&nbsp;straight into the cable feed&nbsp;get any channels without a box?&nbsp; (Please, do just that:&nbsp; connect a TV straight to the cable jack, run a channel scan,&nbsp;and post back with results.)<br />
<br />
The above statement by you has me wondering about something - I'm wondering if your cable co changed their network to an SDV (Switched Digital Video) system.
