    <title>IF function with three outputs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IF function with three outputs</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to use a function that will allow three outputs based on the values in two different cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(AND(H2&gt;I2),-27,-11,IF(AND(H2=0,I2=0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the formula I'm trying, but it tells me I have an error.&nbsp; I can get the first part to work, but not the second half.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If H2 has a balance I want the value to be -27, if I2 has a balance I want the value to be -11, if neither H2 or I2 have a&nbsp;balance I want the value to be 0.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p>
                </div>

<p>You didn't mention what you wanted if both H2 and I2 have a balance, so this formula doesn't account for that, but this will do the rest of what you want in the order of checking H2 first, and then I2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(H2&lt;&gt;"",-27,IF(I2&lt;&gt;"",-11,0))</p>

            They will never both have a balance at the same time.&nbsp; Thank you so much!&nbsp; That worked!

<p>The problem is that the updates are being saved to a directory that requires root (or at least sudo) level to access. &nbsp;I was successful in (accidetally) finding the directory that the updates were saved in and moving them to a folder on my desktop. &nbsp;Unfortunately,
 I didn't save the path and am now in the process of once again delving into the directory structure in an attempt to find the directory where the files are located. &nbsp;Once I find that directory, I will post the location.</p>

<p>What was the path to the updated files?&nbsp; I updated by getting root access and running MAU2.0.&nbsp; Prior to this, I found the files (can't remember the path which is why I asked you for it), created a Update folder on my desktop and copied the files into that
 folder.&nbsp; I then opened a Terminal window, changed to Desktop/Update folder and ran sudo outlookupdater.delta.app and then outlookupdater.app.&nbsp; I did this for all 4 applications (4 delta files, 4 update files) and successfully updated.&nbsp; I'm not 100% sure you
 need to run the delta files (even though from the name it sounds like they determine changes necessary to the existing files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post the update file path so that I can try this with the next update to verify that it will work successfully.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> smokiet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook sending legitimate emails to junk folder</h2>
                    <p>Lately Outlook.com has been sending a lot of legitimate emails to the junk folder.&nbsp; Many of these are from senders that have been sending messages for years. They are in my address book and many of them I have rules created for so sort to different folders
 to keep things more organized.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's getting pretty ridiculous having to check the junk folder several times per day because too many important messages are being sent there.&nbsp; Recently when i checked the junk folder there were 30 messages in there and not a single one should have been
 junk.&nbsp; Every single one is in my address book so it should be obvious that they are legitimate.&nbsp; Selecting the message and clicking not junk only sends them to the primary inbox I don't have the benefit of the rules I created for sorting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any settings to fix this?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi Smokie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We need to determine the reason why the emails you are receiving are being saved on your
<strong>Junk email</strong> folder instead in your <strong>Inbox</strong> folder. With that said, we need to gather additional information to have a better view on this concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes to your email account before you encountered this issue?</li><li>Aside from removing the emails from your <strong>Junk email</strong> folder, what other troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Have you tried reconfiguring the rules on your email account?</li><li>Is this the first time that you encountered this issue?</li><li>When did you notice this issue?</li><li>Are you referring to Office Outlook installed on the computer or the <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook.com</a> website? </li></ul>

<p>Hello and thanks for responding.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>I am referring to the Outlook.com website.&nbsp; </li><li>I haven't made any changes other than adding a new folder and rule when necessary.
</li><li>As for troubleshooting, I have now tried much of anything.&nbsp; I would generally check the messages that are not junk and click the "Not Junk" button.&nbsp; Occasionally I would check my contacts to verify I had added them and check the rule to see if it was still
 in place.&nbsp; I have searched Google and Bing but have not been able to find a solution.&nbsp;
</li><li>I have not tried to reconfigure any of the rules on my email account.&nbsp; I would check to verify they existed and were pointing to the correct folder
</li><li>This is not the first time I've encountered this issue.&nbsp; It's been an ongoing problem that is getting worse.&nbsp;
</li><li>I first noticed the problem over a year ago.&nbsp; I can't remember exactly how long ago but it was around the time Outlook.com did a major update.&nbsp; The update removed all my rules so everything from the various aliases I use filled up the main inbox.&nbsp; After
 that, rules would randomly disappear and every so often a valid message would show up in the junk folder.&nbsp; The rules are not disappearing now but a lot of important emails are landing in the junk folder.&nbsp; I just checked my junk folder and there are currently
 14 emails in there and only one is junk.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for responding.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Still being a pain.&nbsp; I am spending too much time on trying to figure out why Outlook.com decided to start calling email junk when I've been receiving email from some of these sources for several years without an issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of the two junk mail options are worth bothering with.&nbsp; They both seem to send everything to junk but exclusive will leave it only if they are in the contacts.&nbsp; So once I switched to exclusive, the messages that were not being sent to the junk folder
 on the other setting are now being sent to the junk.&nbsp; I get a crap load of emails that I will never need to reply to so there is little reason to save a noreply@ to my contacts but if I don't fill my contacts up with junk, outlook.com fills the junk folder
 up with non junk.&nbsp; When messages are in the junk folder and I check the box and click on the not junk box, should that not indicate to outlook.com that it is not junk so stop putting that sender in the junk?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I turn off this feature completely?&nbsp; I would save countless hours if I just delete the occasional junk mail I receive rather than having to check the junk folder for massages I've been expecting.&nbsp; Today I have removed over 20 messages from the junk folder
 that are not junk.&nbsp; So 20 messages in the junk folder, 0 actual spam.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting to the point where I have to start considering other email solutions.&nbsp; I recently discovered that the support messages from a company I've been purchasing from your several years is blacklisted from Outlook completely.&nbsp; Not just my blacklist
 settings but all of Outlook.com.&nbsp; I had to switch to a gmail account so I could get support messages.&nbsp; I've chatted with the owner and he does not know why he's blacklisted but I'm the third customer who actually uses Outlook.com so it's not worth spending
 a lot of time and effort trying to contact MS and get it fixed.&nbsp; I get the newsletters and update notifications as well as responses to support tickets from gmail just fine so why the blacklisting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I don't know if this is a system wide glitch or just a bug in my account but this is getting to be more annoying than getting spam in my inbox.&nbsp;&nbsp; If spam hits my inbox, I can simply delete it and move on.&nbsp; But when valid messages end up in the junk folder
 I need to go to the junk folder, click the checkbox, select "Not Junk", then go to my inbox and if it was supposed to be moved to a folder with a rule I have to manually move it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some humor to be had from this annoyance though.&nbsp; In the last couple of days, messages from microsoft.com ended up in the junk folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really hoping for a solution or workaround.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ok I've done as you requested and at the bottom I checked the box to stop processing more rules.&nbsp; Afterwards, I expected everything to end up in my inbox but noticed some rules were still being processed and sorted into folders and some were staying in the
 inbox.&nbsp; When checking my email later, I noticed that several messages that were in my inbox earlier were now moved to the junk folder.&nbsp; None of them were junk and didn't expect any rules to process with the box checked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I edited the rule you suggested and unchecked the box to stop processing more rules and it seems to be working as I would expect it to work with the box checked.&nbsp; Things are all showing up in my inbox and staying there right now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really starting to consume a lot of time.&nbsp; Not having a spam filter and simply deleting any junk that shows up in my inbox would be less of a hassle.&nbsp; The 5 to 10 junk items I receive in a typical week are deleted quickly at the push of a button.&nbsp;
 Moving valid emails from the junk folder and manually sorting them is more time consuming.&nbsp; Over time, shouldn't the system be learning as I select not junk?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running out of options.&nbsp; When I made the switch to Outlook.com, it was the best solution and worked great for what I needed.&nbsp;

<p>This is really getting to be a pain to deal with.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the latest steps I've taken to try to resolve this problem.</p>
<p>- Deleted all existing inbox rules</p>
<p>- created the inbox rule mentioned above to move all incoming mail to the inbox</p>
<p>- created new inbox rules for the various alias folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>The results are not always what they should be.&nbsp; All messages seem to be showing up in the inbox however many are sent to the junk folder shorty afterwards.&nbsp; The rules for the individual alias emails work sometimes but not always.&nbsp; For example, a vendor
 sent me two messages within an hour of each other.&nbsp; The rule didn't work for the first one so it wasn't moved to the correct folder.&nbsp; The second one did.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just before posting this I checked the contents of my junk folder and there were 9 messages in there. 7 of them are pretty important and are in my contacts.&nbsp; The other 2 were not all that important but not junk or spam.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this problem happening to anyone else?&nbsp; Is anyone from MS trying to solve the problem on the server side?&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just bought a Nokia C5. After a lot of trouble with connecting it to my computer, I finally made it. From my last Nokia mobile, I exportet a .csv file with all my contacts. But ay Nokia Ovi Suite there is no option about importing any files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get my contacts into my C5 phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had the same problem and after several days of madnes I did it.</p>
<p>Here is the way how I made it:</p>
<p>Before C5 I had an SE K770 and first I dwlded from SE site the whole phonebook&nbsp;to PC as vcf. I tried to import in outlook but it failed, it shows up&nbsp;completely messed with commas and other markings. Then I &nbsp;have imported vcf into the gmail contacts.&nbsp;All
 contacts&nbsp;look just the way&nbsp;they should be. After that, from gmail contacts you have to export to pc as CSV file so you can import that CSV file into outlook. I was satisfied cause all fields were matching their places.</p>
<p>Go to ovi pc suit and in the <font color="#ff0000"><strong>sync options</strong>
</font>choose <strong><font color="#ff0000">contacts</font>,</strong>&nbsp;then on the right side you have to find and check option to
<font color="#ff0000"><strong>sync with outlook</strong></font><font color="#000000"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and press the bottom button
</font><font color="#ff0000">save it</font><font color="#000000">.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Connect your device to pc and after syncing you should see all of your contacts in ovi pc suit. I recommend to sync pc suit with ovi contacts on the web, as well.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I hope this will help you.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Cheers.</font></p>

<p>I forgot to tell you that I have imported my all mailing list in the pc suit but it is easy to delete it. So, dont forget to do it before syncing otherwise you will import all email addresses in the phone and they will not take the right matching if u know
 what I mean.</p>

<p>At this time, the Fast ring insiders build are not compatible with AVAST per Microsoft and the builds are supposed to be blocked. If you got stuck in the middle and your machine failed a reset to the previous version I think you may have to do a fresh install
 of Windows and start over w/o Avast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this time, the Fast ring insiders build are not compatible with AVAST per Microsoft and the builds are supposed to be blocked. If you got stuck in the middle and your machine failed a reset to the previous version I think you may have to do a fresh install
 of Windows and start over w/o Avast.&nbsp;<br />

<p>It worked to restore the previous version, it was my next step, but I'm looking for a solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, OneDrive and Office 365 (which is the main topic here) didn't work. All of them seems to be the same problem. Avast didn't work also, but is the least of my problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know those versions are for testing, I'm here just to say what happened to me, and check if there's a solution, actually I didn't want to have to restore. But I really need Office 365 in my daily tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            &nbsp;3rd party antivirus programs are intermittently incompatible with Insider builds, and can cause unpredictable results.&nbsp; Solution: Do a clean install without any 3rd party antivirus software and use Defender (which is integrated with Windows 10).

<p>A clean Install is not from Windows 7 that is an Upgrade and is not as good as a clean Install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if you are trying to use the Supplied Windows Image backup Microsoft has advised to use Third party Image backup software for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do a clean Install you would need to use the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Media Creation Tool</span> to make&nbsp; a USB key Installer.</p>
<p>When The Installer starts you would need to use the Custom or Advanced Install Option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you would Format your OS drive so it is Unallocated Space then select that Unallocated space to Install the Public Build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When The Public Build is Installed you would need to check for Updates so it can Move to 17134.81.</p>
<p>Then you would need to reinstall all of your Apps and Move all your documents and files back to the OS drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a lot of work but You get a clean Windows 10 and a clean Registry with only Microsoft Software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Media Creation Tool</span> can be downloaded at the Link below.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Edit: &nbsp;&nbsp; And Yes if the Win 10 you have now is Activated the new one will also Activate. Doesn't madder if it is Public or Insiders for that.</p>

<p>In your description of what is wrong sounds more like you are one of the Insiders that lost the Administrator account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Because if you were to create a user account and did not make it&nbsp; an Administrator they would need permission to use many apps and could not Install new Apps or Remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a thought. If that is what is going on you might be back to Admin with the next Build and not have to do anything except wait for the next build.</p>

<p>i am waiting till the next build (or update) before i take the plunge</p>
<p>it's just so strange that MS will release a build and not even MS office will work</p>
<p>the error message on all apps is something like Ocx0000005 which i have researched means incompatibility, go figure</p>

<h2>            Clock on task bar has changed to black fonts which I can&#39;t see on the dark purple background</h2>
                    <p>Well, with another huge Windows update that does nothing for me other than cause headaches, and after hours of figuring out how to sign on without my PIN, or old computer password, or my newly resent MS account password, and finally getting on using my OLD
 MS account password which is a lot to have to type to get onto my own home computer, anyway, I've noticed the clock down on the right of my screen has gone to black fonts I can hardly see at all. &nbsp;The old white I could see. &nbsp;Seems to be no way to change this,
 and now maybe I'm going to have to go buy a wall clock I can see so I can see what time it is when I'm sitting at my desktop computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody figure out the hack to change this setting? &nbsp;And this is yet another setting MS just hauled off and changed, after promising that by shifting to Windows 10 they would never change any of my settings--maybe in celebration of their anniversary, but
 at least they didn't uninstall apps or change who I use for various things this time, not that I've discovered yet at least. &nbsp;Just that I couldn't sign onto my own computer with my own PIN or password, and that took a long time to figure out how to sign onto
 my own computer, and the font color of my clock having been changed, that's all I've notice so far, other than browsers seem to open slower, start up takes longer, but this being the only significant change really. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody tell me how to change clock's font color back to what it was or at least something I can see?</p>

            <p>I just discovered I had the same problem and through trial and error, changing background colors, etc, I discovered that switching the Taskbar option for "Use small taskbar buttons" to OFF changed my clock font to white. So if you're ok with the larger taskbar
 buttons, maybe this will work for you also. The other change I made before this was to use a lighter theme color which made the clock with the black font barely visible but it was visible. I understand your frustrations. So much for UAT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option is use High contrast settings but frankly these are hideous.</p>

<p>I did not make any change to the computer before this issue</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is repeatable on my machine</p>
<p>1. Click Window button</p>
<p>2. Click "All apps"</p>
<p>3. Click the top caption title of the all application list, then the <span>alphabet list shows up. At this point, do not click any of the
</span><span>alphabet letter. In stead, click the icon of your ID and choose something else like "change account setting"</span></p>
<p><span>4. Come back to start menu by click windows button</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click "All apps" again, then on my machine above case appear again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope I can get an answer for this</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>There definitely is!! I've paid the money so I don't know why it wont work and followed the steps so I don't know why it wont work!!!!!</p>

    <title>Problems opening Excel formatted XML files from web - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems opening Excel formatted XML files from web</h2>
                    <p>Long time reader, first time "asker"....</p>
<p>
</p><p>At my company we export data from SAS to excel, in XML file format. This exported file is saved to a UNC path and an ASP page on our intranet presents a link to this xml file. &lt;a href="//unc/path/to/file.xml"&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are in the process to upgrade all our office installations to office365, and we have noticed that when office365 (streamed version of office2013) is installed on our computers we cannot open this XML file from the ASP page in excel any longer, it only
 displays the xml file directly in IE. It did not do this when we had office 2010 installed, nor when we had local installations of office2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing office 365 the file association for .xml gets changed from "microsoft office XML viewer" (or something like it) to "Microsoft Application Virtualization Virtual Process Launcher" (wow.. thats a mouthful). and i think this is where the problem
 lies. Microsoft AppV does not care about the header information in the xml file and thus reverts back to displaying directly in IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file header of the exported file looks like such:</p>
<p>&lt;Workbook </p>
<p>xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet" </p>
<p>xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"</p>
<p>xmlns:x="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel" </p>
<p>xmlns:ss="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet" </p>
<p>xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"&gt; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;DocumentProperties xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"&gt;</p>
<p>...............................................</p>
<p>
</p><p>File associations for .xlsx and .xls and all the others are "Excel (Desktop)" according to "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Default Programs\Set Associations"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i right click the file and save it locally to desktop or whatever (or go to the UNC path with Explorer), and then doubleclick it, the file opens in Excel as it should..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to set Excel as default program for .xml files but IE cares not about that</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh i probaby should say we are running windows 7 PRO x64 on a VDI environment, IE 11 is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What more information can i give at this moment?!?!.. </p>
<p>dunno.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow.. Does anyone have an idea on how we can get this working again?!</p>
<p>a workaround would be to tell the users to go to the unc-path and doubleclick the file, but you know.. end users... change is not something they are comfortable with...</p>

<h2>            How do I &#34;copy&#34; a DTPicker value</h2>
                    I have a Datepicker in a cell on sheet 1 (Thanks Gord, it works). I would like to copy the value to other sheets in the workbook .
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know I can do it via a macro using "sheetname.dtpicker1.value" but for user simplicity I would just like it copied to the appropriate cells (... like "!'sheetname'C12"....</div>
<div>To simplify, I guess I am trying to say how do I reference a dtpicker value in an excel formula ???</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> troysvt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My mate has just recently updated her laptop to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now there is a huge issue as, when you turn the laptop on it doesn't even start to boot.&nbsp;power light comes on, Wifi and Hdd light flicker at the same time&nbsp;as if the computer just keeps restarting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Weird thing is if you either keep turning computer on and off it eventually boots and loads windows or if you leave it turned on for hours, sometimes 24 hours it'll load up, other times it just wont load at all regardless of I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried reverting back to windows 8 and I've also done a full system recovery which reinstalled the windows system files and still not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>if anyone has an idea of how to fix or what the issue might be I am all ears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Have you tried using the highlighter? As far as I can see, the 2010 pen is as thick a line as the 2007 felt tip pen line...</p>
<p>Oh, and have you seen the pointer when you hold ctrl &amp; click? Just thought I would mention it as it overcomes the whole laser pointer/colour blind members of the audience issue :-)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you also tried using Windows Device Recovery Tool (WDRT)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar to a hard reset, this would rectify the software of your device and can also be used when you wish to revert the updates on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To learn more about it, you can check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Similar to a hard reset, WDRT would also remove everything on your device, so make sure you still have your files backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hit us up once you have used WDRT.</p>

            Are you using outlook installed on your desktop or outlook.com in a web browser? 
<br />
<br />The instructions you found are for the desktop version. 
<br />
<br />Do you have more than one computer accessing your mailbox? Rules forwarding email? Both of those can cause mail to be marked read. 
<br />
<br />
<br />For the web version, hold shift or ctrl as you select messages then click the link to mark unread in the reading pane area.

<p>Shop around. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be other electronics or computer stores in your area that still offer product keys. Or you can buy them online. Of course that is more risky, so it is best to stick to well known stores. The advantage of buying some place other than MS is that
 you may be able to get it on sale.&nbsp; What you can do is buy a key now and use it, but keep your eyes open.&nbsp; Now is a good time to find keys offered on sale. You can buy multiple keys, on sale now, and use them later.&nbsp; You can also activate up to 5 years worth
 of keys on your email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint: there is an undefined "grace period" between when you license expires and when the features are degraded. Some people have reported up to a month "free".&nbsp; So, buy a key, but don't activate it until you start losing features.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Aliases </strong>are additional email addresses associated with your Outlook.com account and is like a nickname for your account which can be an email address, phone number, or a Skype name. You can use the same inbox, contact list, and account settings
 as your primary email address and you can also sign in to your Outlook.com account with any alias as they all use the same password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, the email address or phone number that you use to sign up for your Microsoft account is considered the primary alias. Your primary alias shows up as the main account name when you view your profile information. This can be changed at any time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other aliases are considered secondary aliases. You can control which secondary aliases can be used to sign in to your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can have up to ten aliases on your Microsoft account at any given time.</p>

<p>Ok, Lets start. I have heard that many people are having the same issue like you that there phones are charging slowly. But unfortunately, I haven't faced the issue. There four ways to fix it. I am telling you all the four point wise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) First make a soft reset. (None of your personal data will loss): To do a soft reset hold the volume down key and power button at the same time for 15-20 secs then your phone will restart with a vibrate. Check if it fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) you have to go for a hard reset.: Before you do this I would recommend you to make a backup of your phone to avoid personal data loss. to hard reset go to settings&gt;system&gt;about&gt;reset your phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Use the windows device recovery tool to downgrade to windows phone 8.1(You can always upgrade again): to do so. download the recovery tool from here: https://adf.ly/1ePK5d As you mentioned that your phone is not detected then do this. first go to the
 recovery tool and then click on my device is not detected. then click on Lumia. then it will show waiting for connection. leave it as it is. now switch off your phone and then press and hold the volume down button. By holding the button plug in your phone
 with your pc. Your phone will vibrate and start but don't leave the volume down button. then the recovery tool will detect the phone and will download and install the package.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Wait for the next build till Microsoft solves the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If still the problem not solve. make a video of what it happening and upload it to any hosting website like onedrive&nbsp; or dropbox and send the link to us to help you better.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your phones resets and work perfectly then mark the post as answer to help others to find the perfect answer. Thanks have a nice day :D</p>

<p>1. A soft reset isn't effective for my device.</p>
<p>2. A hard reset also turned in a false one.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;this time i have decided to visit to the customer care executive at microsoft device care..lets see what they can do....</p>

</blockquote>
<p>why the third option didn't work tell me clearly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp;case you have to visit the customer care. I would suggest you to call at 1800 102 1100. If you live at India. because Microsoft is only good at telephonic customer care. their service center sucks. call them explain your problem. they will give you a
 support ticket number. visit service center with that number. then when the service center people will give you a jobsheet then call the customer care number and give them the jobsheet number for best solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: Oh sorry I forget to tell you that they have updated the process. first call the customer care and tell them the problem and the service center you are going to visit. then they will contact with them. you just visit there and submit your phone and
 told them that you already talked with the customer care about it and submit the phone. the service center people will take your phone and you will get a jobsheet. call the customer care and tell them the jobsheet number for better assistance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also ask for a standby device from the service center. </p>
<p>

            Hello Jim,<br />
<br />
I would require additional information for better assistance:<br />
<br />
1) Did you uncheck 'All day event' option from the event?<br />
2) Are you experiencing this issue even on new meeting?<br />
3) What type of email account are you working on?<br />
<br />
Reply with necessary information for further assistance.<br />

<p>Yes, the 'All day event' is unchecked each time.</p>
<p>And, yes, it happens on every new meeting and when trying to change existing meetings.&nbsp; The drop down slider is just frozen in place.</p>
<p>This is a gmail IMAP account.</p>

It appears that this is a problem within iCloud.&nbsp; The gmail calendar works fine, but the iCloud calendar in Outlook is the one that has the problem.

            Hello Jim,<br />
<br />
Are you referring to Gmail webmail calendar or Outlook calendar?<br />
<br />
If you're able to set start and end times for default Outlook calendar and not for iCloud calendar configured in Outlook, contact the Non-Microsoft support for further assistance regarding this issue.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.</span><br />

    <title>SharePoint document locked for editing by other user - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SharePoint document locked for editing by other user</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am asking on behalf of one of our clients who use SharePoint Online (with Office 365) heavily for document storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of users who are experiencing issues accessing documents on sharepoint as when they open the document in the Office package, it is coming up with the error</p>
<p>
</p><p>READ-ONLY This workbook is locked for editing by another user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand what this means but the client can assure me that nobody else is using the document and if they were I would hope the collaborative functionality to work in this instance anyway. This does not happen with every document or document library however
 the majority of those affected tend to excel workbooks which are encrypted and so can only be opened in the desktop application. Additionally these are quite heavily edited documents - over 50 versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does also not affect all users. Some may experience the error with the document, yet others do not have a problem with the same document. In the first instance I have go the affected people to clear the cache from the Office Upload center and tick the
 box that deletes cached documents when the document is closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else that could be causing this or can help with the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks,<br />
Fraser</p>

<p>Hi Fraser,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a user wants to edit the workbook in the Excel client, please make sure the workbook is not opened in the browser or the Excel client by another user.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And then check if the file is stuck in the upload center. If it is not stuck, the file should be opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still can't open the file, please let other users close the browser and Excel clients on their PC.<br />
<br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Felix</p>

            I understand exactly what you're referring to &amp; that's what need be done to change it. The User Information &amp; your Personal Contact interact with each other. Only certain fields are accessible directly from Word&gt;Preferences&gt; User Information, however.
 To edit other aspects of the Personal Contact record - such as Country - you have to modify your Personal Contact record. Anything you change in the one will be reflected in the other.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Excel 2019 Page Layout View issue</h2>
                    Our company has many spreadsheets in 2016 format, but when we open them in 2019 they take about 2 minutes or so to open and then the format looks totally different? Why?

            The documents in question are on our company NAS and open up just fine in 2016 in page layout format. When they are opened in 2019 they take usually around 2 minutes to open and the page layout format looks like it's all in blocks. The issue is the same
 if I copy the documents to the local Drive&nbsp; as well&nbsp; so it's definitely an Excel&nbsp; formatting issue&nbsp; and not a network issue. I will submit you some pictures in the morning when I get up. Sorry we are Pacific Standard time and I'm off to bed.

<p>Thank you for your support. Using ProceXP64.exe we were able to determine the cause of the issue. The page layout view was opening in blocks or "labels" because the default printer was set to a Dymo label printer causing the splwow64.exe process to hang.
 We killed that process and Excel opened the document correctly. We then changed the default printer to the correct printer.</p>
<p>

<p>It appears that you have fallen victim of an encryption virus. If you follow the instructions you posted then you will probably be asked to pay a few hundred Dollars to get the pictures decrypted. Whether the scammer will stop there or keep asking for more
 money is anyone's guess. You might face an even larger demand for money in a few months time. Your machine is now compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this was my machine then I would completely erase the hard disk, then re-install Windows and restore my files from my external backup. You might want to seek professional advice to solve your problem.</p>

    <title>How do I disable Outlook completely and forever&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> everyothernameistaken  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable Outlook completely and forever&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an <span>Office 365 Home subscription, and only really care about Excel, OneDrive and a little Word.&nbsp; I abandoned Outlook 10 years ago and will never go back.&nbsp; It's my understanding that I cannot avoid installing Outlook without creating my own installation
 media which, as a consumer (in this context) I have no intention of getting into.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the past I have used several methods of preventing Outlook from bothering me including adding Group Policies to ban it and renaming the exe.&nbsp; This usually lasts a few months then one day I start my machine to be confronted with the Outlook startup
 wizard, in which the "never bother me again" is conspicuously absent.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that the Outlook product team probably don't put a lot of thought into the use-case of&nbsp;a user who only installed&nbsp;Outlook with no intention of ever using it,&nbsp;but that constituency is probably bigger than they like to think!, especially
 under Office 365&nbsp;Home.&nbsp; It's bad enough that there is no option to omit it from the installation, but for it do default to automatic startup with no obvious way to disable it, even by renaming the exe, puts it in the same category as the malware that comes
 in disreputable installers.&nbsp; Task Manager's startup tab does not appear to show any item I can disable to prevent this.&nbsp; There are no obvious services to be disabled.&nbsp; I can see no general "Office options" panel in the start menu.</span></p>
<p><span>Please can you let me know if I'm missing a simple way to&nbsp;rid myself of&nbsp;this for good?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            Thank you for your reply, but I think you've missed my point.&nbsp; I don't have an Outlook account.&nbsp; This is an issue of OUTLOOK.EXE the Windows desktop application executing at Windows startup when just because I installed Office 365.

            <p>Office 365 any version, when installed does not set MS Outlook in any Start Up folder (And no other Office license exhibits this behavior)</p>
<p>Unless MS Outlook, the profile has been configured MS Outlook will not start or trigger in any way.</p>
<p>What exact msg regarding MS Outlook do you see when you start the PC?</p>

            <p>Here is the offending window, which is part of the process OUTLOOK.EXE.&nbsp; I gather it's the message one would expect when deliberately starting Outlook for the first time without having configured it.&nbsp; I have never used Outlook on this machine and this only
 started appearing recently, presumably as a result of an Office update which reversed whatever I did to shut it up a year or so ago.</p>
