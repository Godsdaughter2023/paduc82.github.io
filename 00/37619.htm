<h2>            Surface book 2 is not turning on when I press the power button</h2>
                    After the last update, my laptop takes a lot of time to turn on. I have to try several times before it starts to power on. I have already downloaded the surface diagnostic tool, it says there are no problems. My windows version is 1803.&nbsp;

<p>I have the same problem since August firmware updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem expresses itself in 2 ways:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 When pressing "power" the keyboard quickly lights up, goes out again and nothing more happens. Neither when ketting the button go nor when pressing it constantly (&gt;1 minute).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 When pressing power, nothing happens for ca. 30 seconds, then a full reboot starts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting: When shutting down and restarting almost immediately, the surface starts as usual.</p>
<p>This leads me to think that the issue is possibly connected to "quickstart" and it's"hiberfil". I am currently looking into this theory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried all recommended fixes, with no avail (so please do not repeat the endless litany "run diagnostic toolkit" etc)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 DiectX &#58; Runtime Version with Hardware supported version</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I just upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Intel Graphics Driver download site have the graphics driver for Windows 10 that match with my processor and graphic cards.</p>
<p><strong>Processor: Intel Core i7-4510U</strong></p>
<p><strong>Card: Intel HD Graphics 4400</strong></p>
<p><strong>OS: Windows 10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intel Graphics Driver : 15.40.10.64.4300 (20.19.15.4300)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The new driver that I downloaded from Intel site contains the newest <strong>DirectX 12.</strong></p>
<p>After I <strong>installed</strong>, the system information inside the Control Panel shows Directx version:</p>
<p><strong>Runtime Version : 12</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hardware Supported version : 11.1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ba837e9-fe05-40ab-9038-995abf2ca8fe" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Inside the <strong>Directx Diagnostic Tool. It shows </strong><strong>version 12
</strong>too.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/653aa25f-6c3c-46e5-baca-5a19e49c4876" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one question.</p>
<p>Will the <strong>new "Graphics Driver" (Directx 12 with Windows 10) works with the</strong><strong> H</strong><strong>ardware Supported Directx version (Directx 11.1) "Graphics Card"??</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about my English.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Yes DX12 runtimes should work in DX 11.1 which is what your hardware supports.

<h2>            Problems with MSCoree.dll</h2>
                    I am attempting to launch a game launcher known as NCSoft, however I am met with "C:\windows\SYSTEM32\MSCOREE.DLL is either not designed to run on windows or it contains and error. Try isntalling the program again using the original installation media
 or contact your system administration or the software vendor for support" I ran a SFC and it said there were some corrupt files that we not able to be fixed. This also happen when I try to launch other games. However my computer boots up normally just fine.
 Any ideas?

            <i>"Try isntalling the program again using the original installation media "</i><br />
<br />
You have uninstalled, rebooted and reinstalled&nbsp; the relevant game, or the&nbsp; NCSoft client software ?<br />
<br />
<br />
- Have you installed all the 'important' Windows Updates (don't install the 'optional' updates<br />
unless you know you need them, and don't use Windows updates for graphics drivers)<br />
including up dating&nbsp; Microsoft .NET Framework to&nbsp; .NET&nbsp; 4.0 ?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=17851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">.NET 4.0 download -</a><br />
<br />
- While updating .NET is important for some applications (AMD graphics drivers&nbsp; require&nbsp; .NET 4.0 ) ,<br />
but apparently .NET 4.0 can also have an issue&nbsp; with mscoree.dll. This can often be fixed by&nbsp; running
<br />
the .NET 4.0 installer again and have it&nbsp; do a 'repair'. <br />
It is said the 'repair' process will fail, but not before reinstalling the mscoree.dll, after which<br />
.NET should be OK.<br />
<br />
Another option is to download a mscoree.dll from a trusted site and copy it into System32 to<br />
replace a potentially corrupt mscoree.dll.<br />

<h2>            Error code 0x80240031 installing 8.1 from WIndows Store</h2>
                    <p>I'm on a self made PC running Windows 8 - I have 16&nbsp;MB RAM - an AMD 2 Phenom processor. I had previously installed the 8.1 preview on this machine and ran it for about 8 months. About a month ago I wiped my drive and reinstalled Windows 8. For the past two
 days I've tried to install the final 8.1 from the Windows Store - I'd say that I've tried about 12 times. At first I got a message that said try again, try again...It downloads and then ends up says that the app cannot be installed. Try again. So I found the
 App Troubleshooter and ran it. It said it found some security settings wrong. I assume that it fixed them. So I tried again. Once again it failed. But instead of the "Try again" message it gave me an error code: 0x802400031</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Vipre Internet Security but before I tried to install the update I turned it off and set it to not turn back on until I told it to do so. Is this related to my AV? Should I uninstall Vipre and try? And what is that error code trying to tell me?</p>

<p><span>Hi Tom,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could be either due to some incompatible driver issues on the computer or it could be due to the conflicts from the Viper Internet Security program or any other programs on the computer.</span></p>

<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you get the notification to download Windows 8.1 from the Windows Store and were you able to find it in the Store?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When exactly do you get this error code? Is it at the download phase or installation phase of Windows 8.1?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you disable the Viper Security program completely or is it only some of its features that you have disabled?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you install all the important updates via Windows Update before you started the Windows 8.1 installation? Are all the device drivers updated to their latest version on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you have any external hardware device (except the mouse and the keyboard) connected to the computer?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Method 1: <span>Disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard)</span></span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard) and then check if you still face this issue while installing Windows 8.1. This is to check if the issue is caused by any external devices
 connected to the computer.</span></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello Rajesh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are answers to your 5 questions...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Yes, I received an email from Microsoft telling me to go to the store for the 8.1 update. I tried installing from there about 8 times.&nbsp;The next day I&nbsp;did a Bing search for 8.1 download and wound up back at the store. Those attempts failed. These first
 failed&nbsp;attempts on the 17th &amp; 18th&nbsp;failed at install - the red&nbsp;texted link said that I should try again. I did and I got nowhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;I got the error message after the program was finished downloading - the failure message was after it attempted install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) I completely disabled Vipre - Firewall &amp; Active Protection. I assumed that stopped the program, but I cannot say for certainty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Yes, it installed something but it was done very fast and went on downloading. It only installed something the very first time that I tried. Never again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) No. Just the wireless dongles for my mouse &amp; keyboard. I unplugged all USB devices like my printer, etc. I do have 5 SATA drives installed internally in this PC. Once I had trouble reinstalling Windows 8 until I unplugged all the drives except the one
 that I reserve for my OS only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not get the error code 0x802400031 until Saturday the 19th. Once again I had the red text link with the message that "This App wasn't installed" - instead of the usual message to "Try again" I received the typical error message with the code number.
 That's when I made my posting here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I will try Method 2 &amp; 3 and I will report back. I intend to uninstall Vipre before trying both. Method 1 is moot because I've already removed any external devices. I'm also unplugging my speakers as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could give me some feedback about my PC having 5 internal SATA hard drives? I've wondered if that had anything to do with t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And - I almost forgot this - when I ran the App Troubleshooter it fixed a security thing - I don't know what - and it made me&nbsp;re-enable my Raid 5 controller. When I first installed 8&nbsp;when it went on sale&nbsp;my PC would crash constantly. My screen would go berserk
 and&nbsp;then Windows would crash and start back up. It took me a&nbsp;while to figure out the cause. Because my monitor went crazy I assumed wrongly that it was my video driver. I installed Who Crashed and found out that it was the Raid 5 driver. I disabled that driver
 and solved the problem. I turned it back on at the insistence of the App Troubleshooter. That driver issue must have been fixed because all is well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just ran the App Troubleshooter and it says that my display driver might be out of date. My video is embedded in my ASUS&nbsp;system board. It's an ATI and when I went to AMD and tried using their tool it couldn't figure out if I needed a new driver or not.
 Would this affect the 8.1 update? It makes no sense to me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;tried Method #2 - I uninstalled Vipre &amp; I cleared the Store Cache. After the file downloaded and attempted to install (I'm assuming) it failed. It told me to try again and gave me the same error code as before.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try the clean boot method next.</p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pls find the steps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on Windows key + F</li><li>In Search box type CMD</li><li>Now Right Click on Command Prompt under Apps and click on Run as Administrator</li><li>Type the command "ipconfig /release"</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note: This will release the IPAddress that you're receiving from your service provider.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now type another command "ipconfig flushdns"</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note: This will remove the cache store inside your windows for some websites.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After releasing and flushing the IP Address we need to get the IPAddress again. So pls type the command "ipconfig /renew"</li></ul>
<p>Note: This will help you to obtain the IPAddress again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If if this doesn't resolve the issue pls make sure that you hardwire your internet connection as this is mostly an error from Service Providers end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pls let me know if this help you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks,</strong></p>

            Dear Harsh..
<div>Thank you very much for your solution. Step 2 is worked for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried all the above steps. But couldn't. Since, I am having two network providers, I have switched to the other network provider, the download been started. So, it is purely from the Service Providers end.. :)</div>

            <p>No - Like before it failed. I've even tried using all the fixes that you've supplied - in order - clearing the store cache - the clean boot - then the release/renew of my IP. I'm getting really frustrated. I used the 8.1 preview for quite a while and I want
 it back!! This is crazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what's next? Wiping my hard drive, reinstalling 8 and then try to install 8.1 from the store?</p>

            <p>Harsh, I have a question...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm watching the green&nbsp;download line progress - it got to the end &amp; started over. is this typical and do you know how many times should it do this? I have a high sped cable connection of 30Mpbs. Before I haven't watched the download progression constantly.
 But I know that once it downloads and tried to install it immediately gives me the error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thought. A month ago I performed a reformat &amp; clean install of Windows 8. I downloaded a new copy of the 8.1 Preview. It repeatedly failed. His was around the very end of October. I made a post somewhere here on Microsoft and the consensus was "Why
 bother - just wait until the final version of 8.1 comes out on November 18th?" That's what I did.

            <p>Well, now it's become a download issue. It won't download the file. The green line will go as far as the "P" in Windows 8.1 Pro and it restarts downloading. It's done so 3 time and it just restarted the download again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I have 4 hard drives installed on my PC. Does that matter?</p>

            <p>I guess I've been abandoned out of frustration. Here's an update: I am no longer getting the error messages. I've allowed my PC to attempt downloading 8.1 for 7 hours now. On the first attempt the green line went about 2/3 of the way and then my cursor began
 spinning - the page told me that it was installing - I was very happy to see that - but it stopped and started to try and download again. Now&nbsp;the green download indicator goes about 1/3&nbsp;and starts over again - and its been repeating this for 7 hours.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas of how I can get this update? I'm thinking of buying a new hard drive and start all over fresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help so far!!!</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I’m sorry to know that you are getting an error while creating the Media Creation Tool to install Windows 10. I’ll certainly help you with this.</div>
<div><br />
If your computer is UEFI based, these are normally systems that come pre-loaded with Windows 8 or later, you will need to prepare the ISO file for such a configuration or you will receive an error message during setup.</div>
<div><br />
How are you downloading the MCT on your computer? I would suggest that you download the MCT on a USB drive and then install Windows 10 from it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Before downloading the MCT, format the USB drive and then download it. Follow these steps to format the USB drive.<br />
1. Connect the USB drive to the computer and right click on it.<br />
2. Select <strong>format </strong>and set the file system to <strong>NTFS(default)</strong>.<br />
3. Now select click on <strong>Start </strong>to format the USB drive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Download the media creation tool from the following link.</p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/C/4/1C41BC6B-F8AB-403B-B04E-C96ED6047488/MediaCreationTool.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10_1511 Media Creation Tool</a></p>

            Ramesh, thank you for the response. I'm not sure what I may have done last night, but I shut my computer off to allow it to install Windows updates, and this morning, the issue was resolved. Thank you again for the assistance, the other discussion thread
 would have been just what I needed had this not fixed itself.

<h2>            Removing duplicate app entries from the default files list</h2>
                    I removed a program (Firefox) from my system, but when I go to Default Apps and click on the default (now Chrome) browser, Firefox remains in the options list even though I just uninstalled it. I uninstalled Firefox because I was getting multiple entries
 for it in the Default Apps list, and intended to remove the remaining duplicate entry. How do I do that?

            Jaune Bel, I finally got rid of the bad entry by deleting a bunch of Firefox folders on C:;. The duplicate entry is gone, so I can reinstall Firefox.

<h2>            Microphone&#47;driver problem&#59; Quiet Recorded voice, Loud noisy Boost</h2>
                    <p>Without boost my voice is extremely quiet (not understandable) despite the recording volume being set to max, but boost has really annoying white noise that increases disproportionately as it is set higher. 10+ boost is doable but not practical (voice is
 still too quiet, boost is still too loud), setting the boost higher overpowers my voice.</p>

            I installed the new driver Lead3 posted (those exact links seem to direct to faulty .exe files, but I downloaded somewhere else), took a bit of faffing around trying to get around plug and play (still not sure how I did it) but it works.

<h2>            Resize pagefile.sys size on system with too much ram</h2>
                    I have 24GB of RAM on my Windows 7 laptop.&nbsp; I watch the RAM meter and have a hard time getting it to 10GB when I'm working it hard.&nbsp; Since I only have a 256GB SSD and a 500GB disk drive, I would like to reduce the size of the pagefile.sys file which is
 currently 25GB.&nbsp; Is there any need to have that large of a file when 16GB of RAM would have been more than enough?

<h2>            &#91;Issue&#93; Unusual Grid Lines Appearing on Monitor Screen - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody! I'll be quick and straight to the point with my problem, while giving as much information as I can. Ever since I successfully upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, my display monitor has been displaying a weird grid. The grid seems to consist
 of a slightly transparent, white color and takes up the entire screen. Sometimes, however, it may not be clearly visible when blended in with certain other content within the display. This annoying detail is most noticeable on the Windows taskbar and the app
 menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>___________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>- Screenshot -</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8589c55c-8b00-4382-bc0f-68fa9fd1b346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8589c55c-8b00-4382-bc0f-68fa9fd1b346" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>___________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Here are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">steps</span> I have taken to try and solve this problem:
<ul>
<li>Updated my drivers (graphics card, display adapter, etc.)</li><li>Updated the Windows operating system via the 'Settings' app.</li><li>Ran a virus/malware scan.</li><li>Adjusted the screen resolution to see if the problem still existed, by which it did.</li><li>Hard rebooted the PC</li><li>Troubleshooted problems using the Windows troubleshooter packages.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I am baffled as to what to do next. I have searched countless times online in attempts to finding someone else with the exact same problem. This grid-like thing sitting on my screen has got to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would highly appreciate any assistance
 regarding this topic, many thanks.<br />

<p>I haven't tried that yet. Time management hasn't been very friendly to me lately(thus the late replies). I will see if the grid still appears on my screen, and update you as soon as I can. Thank you for your patience!</p>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:

<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Yes, that does help.
<br />
<br />The minidump file points to the sbwfw.sys :
<br />
<br />BugCheck D1, {ffff9e81386d7014, 2, 0, fffff809143c85e8}

<br />Probably caused by : sbwfw.sys ( sbwfw+185e8 )
<br />
<br />The sbwfw.sys appears to be a third party firewall driver and appears to be dated from 2017.
<br />
<br />Which third party antivirus and firewall software are installed?
<br />
<br />To stop the blue screen errors you could try uninstalling all third party antivirus and firewall software and use Windows built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.

            Hi there, thanks for your question. Hopefully I can help!
<br />
<br />As a first step, I would recommend updating your graphics drivers to see if it fixes your issue. Depending on the brand of your graphics card, you can find the drivers here:
<br />
<br />AMD Radeon:
<br /><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amd.com/en/support</a>
<br />
<br />NVIDIA GeForce:
<br /><a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.geforce.com/drivers</a>
<br />
<br />Intel Graphics:
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />If your drivers are up to date, I'd recommend reinstalling them. Please let me know if you have any other issues! Thanks!

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />E. I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi CT.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />From Safe Mode with Networking go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If these fail then move into Repair Mode to try the Reset:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I've been having the same problems with a lot of games. It dowloads the whole thing, then says it "Can't download [game]", no reason given for it; it just can't download it. I even downloded the trial of an arcade game with my boyfriends profile so I had
 the game on my 360 and then tried downloading the full game again and it still said the same thing. Did you ever get an answer what the problem is? I've contacted xbox support a few times but I never got an answer.</p>

            This would require a complete reinstall of the operating system and if your machine has 4GB of RAM or more, would severely affect the available memory to apps. Why do you want to do this?<br />

            <p>Well, the more logical thing to do would be to run a compatible version of Windows you have a license for such as Windows XP or Windows 2000 in a Virtual Machine utility such as Oracle Virtual Box or VMware Player. Then install your DOS based program in
 it.</p>

                    Hi,

</div>
<div><b>Second:</b> I really let Windows 7 up to date. However, it couldn't recognise this first device highlighted. So how can I let Windows recognise this device. &nbsp;I even don't know the first device highlighted under'<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Console

<div>I really didn't plugin any new devices.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Third:</b> There is a Bluetooth@2.0 +EDR listed on the specs of my Acer laptop. However, there is neither unknown device nor known device as Bluetooth in the device manager as you see in the above screen shot. Thus, how can I let this device shown in
 the device manager or at least it is functioned in the windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Finally: </b>As you see in the screen shot above of the device manager fro the Acer laptop, there is a modem device. However, for my other laptop whose brand is HP, there is no Modem device at &nbsp;all.</div>

2. Have you connected any soft modem or phone to the computer?</p>
<p><br />
The IrDA Fast Infrared Port component defines a protocol suite transfers data between two devices over a short-range, point-to-point infrared link at speeds between 9.6 kilobits per second (Kbps) and 16 megabits per second (Mbps).
</p>
<p>Infrared (IR) hardware is included in many portable devices, such as notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cameras, and cellular phones. Users can easily add IR hardware to a desktop computer by attaching an IR adapter to a serial or USB port,
 or by adding a card and an IR adapter. The simplicity, proven interoperability, and low cost of IR hardware are key factors in its widespread acceptance.

I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>1. What is the model number of laptop?<br />
2. Have you connected any soft modem or phone to the computer?</p>
<p><br />
The IrDA Fast Infrared Port component defines a protocol suite transfers data between two devices over a short-range, point-to-point infrared link at speeds between 9.6 kilobits per second (Kbps) and 16 megabits per second (Mbps).
</p>
<p>Infrared (IR) hardware is included in many portable devices, such as notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cameras, and cellular phones. Users can easily add IR hardware to a desktop computer by attaching an IR adapter to a serial or USB port,
 or by adding a card and an IR adapter. The simplicity, proven interoperability, and low cost of IR hardware are key factors in its widespread acceptance.

Thanks a lot,

<div>The model number of my Acer laptop is: (Exstensa 5220 series) Model No: MS2205</div>
<div><br />
<div>No I &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Haven't &nbsp;connected any soft modem or phone to the computer.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>Although I have save a screen shot of device manager with all devices known on my laptop while a Win xp was installed(screen shoots below). However, this didn't help me to know which device that is still unknown after &nbsp;installing a Win 7 and why Bluetooth
 wasn't recognized by Windows 7 and it was recongnised by Win xp.</div>
<div>Also, there is an internal modem&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is in Arabic, but you can understand from some English content there is a Bluetooth and modem and so on.</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;From the comparison between the device manager while win xp was installed and while win 7 is intalled, I would guess that the device still unknown in Windows 7 and it was known in Windows xp it is:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9d815948-7e73-4583-9640-45f949dde7d5" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>If the device is still unknown in device manager for Windows 7 is Bus host controllers, then how can I let it known. How can I get its derive?&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Could you please confirm if Infrared (IR) hardware is where express card/54 can be plugged in.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, you don't reply what the other device which&nbsp;is still no recognised by Windows is for? And how how can I define it because I don't that device is&nbsp;for what?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Second:&nbsp;I couldn't find any modem listed in the devidc manager on my other HP laptop. Then, is this a internal modem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finally: Why is the bluetooth not listed in the device manager, although there was a bluetooh in the specs of my computer and it was listed in the manager device when a Win xp was installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The laptop on which&nbsp;I have reinstalled a Win 7 came from the factroy with the Win xp installed and all devices&nbsp;were shown in the device manager and recognised. Fortunately I backed all data before reinstalling a Win 7. Thus, &nbsp;I found now&nbsp;a folder called
 a driver with my data backed up when I checked the data backed up,&nbsp;however, I want to know what driver will define the device unknown in the device manager&nbsp;as in my first screen shot&nbsp;. Also, I don't know what driver will let blutooth shown and function because
 there are a lot of bluetooth in that driver folder as you will be seeing in these screen shots below::</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, could you advise me what other drivers above should be installed? I really noticed that only one device is unknown and the bluetooth is still not shown at all in the device manager after Win 7 was installed. In other words, I didn't installed any drivers
 above&nbsp;after Win 7 completed installation, all device were defined automatically by Win 7, except the one unknown&nbsp;above and bluetooth is still not shown</p>

Thanks a lot, but if you have a look at my screen shot in my very first post, you will see&nbsp; there is only one device needed to be recognized by Windows 7 and that device I really don't know&nbsp; what it is for. That device has a Exclamation mark in front of it.<br />
<br />
However, Card Reader, and Infrared are defined/recongnised by Windows 7, there are no Exclamation mark.<br />
<br />
However, how did you judge that these the Card Reader, Infrared and Fingerprint Reader need the drivers?<br />
I really don't have any <u>Fingerprint Reader..<br />
<br />
</u>Finally, in that very wide list of drivers&nbsp; I have post its screen shot in my last post,&nbsp; maybe I&nbsp; find&nbsp; there is a driver for defining that unknown device . Haven't had a look at it?<br />

<p>Although I really was seeing bluetooth listed in the device manger while Win xp installed, it is no longer listed while Win 7 is installed. But if a bluetooth device&nbsp;were a part of my laptop and it isn't recognized by Windows 7, then it was supposed to listed

<p>Yes, but I really&nbsp;know the Fingerprinter Reader very well because I have and use it&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;another HP laptop of mine.&nbsp; It was sponsered by AuthenTec. It is device located on the the board to swip a finger on it if you want to log in.</p>

<p>You said that the the three devices 'Card Reader, Infrared and Fingerprinter Reader' you have pointed out are the one least likely to be found by an upgrade to Windows 7, then I would be say if so, they they should have been listed under the 'other devices'
 category to let the user know they are still needed to be defined.<br />

<p>I really don't know how I can have to go through every driver until&nbsp;eventually all&nbsp;devices are found as long as
<u>I don't have all drivers in hand</u>. Also, even I had, I don't know what specific&nbsp;drivers are desinged to define specific devices. In other words, ' if I you mean with 'having to go through every driver until&nbsp;eventually all&nbsp;devices are found' with install
 all 20 derivers&nbsp; or what I have, then I think some&nbsp;&nbsp;drivers software or parts of them will be installed, although they are&nbsp;redundant/ not needs to be &nbsp;installed.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;I really would to give you an example of defining undefined-unknown and undefined- known&nbsp;devices .</p>
<p>In the first time, I don't know which drivers will be going to define the unknown device, although I have all devrivers in hand. This is experience of mine for my&nbsp;other HP laptop. Yes&nbsp;eventually I succeeded to define all devices very well, but I really have
 &nbsp;recorded notes to help me if I need to do this later.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;you have a look at at my&nbsp;above screen shot, you will see in there are two unknown devices under other devices. &nbsp;Thus, I, myself, don't know which drivers software can be let these devices to be defined(known) by the computer, although I have all drivers
 and software downloaded from &nbsp;the hardware mfg web site. </p>
<div>For the other devices located under the 'other devices' category, such as 'Ethernet controller' or Network controller' and so on, I know which drivers software can be defining these devices because the devices named by names 'Ethernet controller' and 'Network
 controller', which means &nbsp;the drivers of networks adapters. Thus, simply, I will look up in the CD looking for 'Ethernet controller(Realtek FEGbE Family contrloer(LAN)' and 'Network controller(Broadcome 801 Wireless LAN Adapter)</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, unknown devices located under the 'other devices' category I don't know &nbsp;which drivers software can be defining these devices because there are no names. Thus, what should I look up in the CD of drivers?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Because the laptop is mine, and I have the CD containing all drivers and software for my laptop devices, I have tried clicking 'right click' on the unknown devices, then chose 'update driver'. After that, 'specified the path containing the driver software.
 Finally, the driver got known by the computer.</div>

<div>However, for Acer laptop,&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have the CD containing the drivers and software.

            Hi jwalke61, because the mrxsmb10.sys file is a Windows Operating System file it is not recommend you download this file from any website . . .
<br />
<br />Open a Command Prompt window as Administrator
<br />(click your Start Button, type cmd, then right Click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Admintrator')
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />
<br />Wait for the command to complete, close Command Prompt and restart your PC

<p>Andre, my only concern with doing that is that it will downgrade me from W10Pro...I also don't have any kind of hard disk. When Windows gave the free update to windows 10 i went ahead and upgraded. Should I be concerned with losing the pro version and other
 apps? Or will that not happen? i Have fully blown versions of matLab, VS ultimate and labVIEW Pro that were pretty pricey and of course have no disk to reinstall from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Question, are you able to at least boot to the desktop or are you seeing that error outside of Windows?
<br />
<br />If you are able to boot to the desktop, you can download the ISO, double click it to mount it, then start the upgrade.
<br />
<br />A repair upgrade preserves your personal files, apps and settings while repairing broken Windows 10 files. If you have Windows 10 Pro, that is exactly what it will reinstall.
<br />
<br />You can always perform a backup in advance for some peace of mind:

<p>And I also uninstall the old drivers and download the new drivers and install the same.</p>

<p>
</p><p>any free driver update software which really works for the same.&nbsp;</p>

                    I faced several problems after I installed windows 10. I do not need very advance features in my PC. Therefore I decided to stop windows 10 update. Can responsible engineer in Microsoft company give a easy method to permanently stop windows 10 updates.
 If it is easy that is good because I can start updating my PC when I need it after several years.&nbsp;

            Hi MSS,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />More improvements are coming in the future over Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />
<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.
<br />

            Hi #MSS.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The only stable way to stop WIndows Updates install is to set a Metered Connection which is the only way to turn them off in Home version that lasts:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/226722/how-when-and-why-to-set-a-connection-as-metered-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/226722/how-when-and-w...</a>
<br />
<br />There are even good reports from users now who've had them shut off for awhile and only install the Version Upgrades twice a year from the Media Creation Tool which is the most stable method anyway, and includes all previous Updates rolled in. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Dear Mr Sumit and&nbsp;<span>Greg,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the replies. I go through them and found following things. The changing of active hours cannot be used in my PC because settings ask for 18 hours duration. The metered connection method cannot be used because
 I use mobile connection (dongle) and that setting cannot be changed for mobile connection. Even I change window updates in control panel (administration tools =&gt; service), it again changes to manual and downloads updates (I did it before). Therefore, I decide
 to use third party app such as win updates disabler v1.0. I have not used it yet. Does it have problems with aspire E1-431. I also wish to make my web camera which does not work after a update. Do you think does Microsoft company make that error from a update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Change file type association back to unknown</h2>
                    <p>Good morning all,</p>
<p>I was importing an image into my autocad program that has the file ext. .gp4. That is a file type no longer in use and supported ( I think it might have be called "Fastlook"). Whilst importing I accidentally hit Adobe pdf to associate to these file types.
 Obviously we don't have the program anymore and I have googled far and wider to find a solution to re-associate these file types back to "unknown".&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Make sure you can see file extensions - In Windows File Explorer, on the View Ribbon check the 'File Name Extensions' box</li><li>Close Windows File Explorer</li><li>On your Desktop, right click and select 'New' - Text Document</li><li>Name the file xxx.bat - make sure to remove the .txt and replace it with .bat</li><li>Right click any .gp4 file, select 'Open With' - Choose Another App'</li><li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open .gp4 files'</li><li>Scroll to to bottom of the list, click 'Choose another App'</li><li>Scroll to the bottom of this list and select 'Look for another app on this PC'</li><li>Navigate to the file you created on your Desktop (xxx.bat) and click open</li><li>You will probably get an error trying to open the file - this is OK</li><li><strong>IMPORTANT - </strong>Delete xxx.bat from your desktop </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now the file association will be set back to unknown . . .<br />

            Hi André, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />The first step I'd take is to confirm whether it actually is a background task/service causing the issue, and the easiest way to do that is to perform a clean boot:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you've clean booted, see if the CPU fan is still maxing out.
<br />
<br />If it is, then I'd have a look at your BIOS settings to see if the CPU fan speed is set to automatic or some other setting.
<br />
<br />Once you've done that, please let me know what happens and I'll provide further steps! Thanks!

</p><blockquote>Hi Mark, <br />
<br />
Right click your Taskbar, choose Taskbar Settings...</blockquote>
<p>My Windows 10 (v. 1511, build 10586.122) has no such setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember seeing it somewhere and turning off "Combine Taskbar Buttons", but I don't remember where I found it. Certainly, 'Taskbar Settings' does not appear, and the 'Properties' context choice ... oh, there it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's set to "Never combine".</p>
<p>
</p><p>...I think you misunderstood the problem, Dave. The buttons aren't combined. They're grouped. When I open a new instance of Notepad, for example, instead of appearing at the right end of the task bar, it appears with other instances of Notepad. If I try
 to move it, all the Notepad tabs move as a group.</p>
