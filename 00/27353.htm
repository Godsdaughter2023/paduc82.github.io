<h2>            Outlook - Attachment Icon column</h2>
                    <p>How come you cant resize this column when you choose the attachment icon?? weird.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It has to be at least 2 in width which i dont like. It is too wide for me.</p>
<p>Also, i set it to centered and it isnt centered. It looks to be to the left. Why is it set to the left? &nbsp;The centering doesnt work and this needs to be fixed. ALso, give adjustability to the user too. &nbsp; Strange how it is this way. Not sure who thought of
 that.</p>

            <p>yeah, not sure why it cant be centered or the width of the column easily adjusted. Too much space there.</p>
<p>Also from the leftmost column to the folders view there is a space that is bigger than i want, but i cant change that. WIth a 14in screen, i want to view more of my emails. Oh well.. it has its limitations. Need to hand over some control to users to make
 it look how we want. &nbsp;Things will improve in future releases.</p>

<h2>            Spell check invoked for no reason - can&#39;t close</h2>
                    
<p>I was creating a new document when all of a sudden the spell check window appeared.&nbsp; There was no way to close the window.&nbsp; Even when it said "spell check complete" the window wouldn't close.&nbsp; I had to go to task manager and abort the program.&nbsp; This has
 happened twice to me in Word 2010 and once in Excel 2010.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Space before&#34; Heading on a new page is not there</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong><span>Hello.<br />
<br />
I have edited Heading 3 to have a "Space before" value of 18 pt. It works perfectly under regular conditions. However, when I write some text on the page before and Heading 3 is automatically "pushed" to the next page, there is just a Space before the Header
 of the page of 2 pt.&nbsp;<br />
I can force Word to insert the 18pt manually, if I select "Page break before" from the Paragraphs-Menu. (However, when there is for example just one line of text on the new page, Heading 3 is automatically moved to the next page and I have basically a whole
 page with just one line of text on it).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there any way to automatically tell word to insert a Space before of 18pt, even when the Heading appears by coincidence on the top of a new page?</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Here are some pictures of my problem:<br />
<br />
This is the regular case:&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/ihzbT.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/ihzbT.png</a><br />
<br />
This is what happens, when the Heading happens to be on top of the page:&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/FzV4a.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/FzV4a.png</a><br />
<br />
<br />
This is what I want it to look like in the end (but without adding the page break before manually):&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/Dmics.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/Dmics.png</a></span></strong></p>

            <div>Word automatically suppresses Spacing Before at the top of a page following a "soft" (automatic) page break. If you want to retain the spacing, you will need to apply "Page break before" formatting to the heading or (less desirable) insert a manual page
 break before it. There is really no way around this.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Compatibility Option to "Suppress extra line spacing at top of page" applies to line spacing within a paragraph, not Spacing Before, and is irrelevant here.</div>

<p>The message indicates that the attempt to remove subtotals from the selected range failed.</p>
<p>That suggests that there were no subtotals within the selected range.<br />
Possibly because your previous run of the macro had already removed them.<br />
Or possibly because the range (of cells) you had selected was not the range containing the subtotals.</p>
<p>If the first macro added the subtotals then you might want to run it again before running the second macro.</p>
<p>You probably used the macro recorder to generate the macro?<br />
<br />
It is a useful tool, but in order for the macro to do the same job on a second run it generally has to be started from the same initial state (what sheet is active, and what range is selected).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
With a little extra&nbsp;care you can make it work from a wider range of initial states (e.g. by starting the macro recorder with a different sheet active, it will record the additional steps of you activating the sheet you need and selecting the range you want
 to work on.<br />
<br />
If you want to work on the entirety of a table, regardless of how big it has become it is wise to start the macro by selecting the top left corner and then using Ctrl+* to select the region of occupied cells surrounding that initial cell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Let me help you with your concern regarding your lost emails. Below&nbsp;are the possible reasons why emails got lost/deleted from a Hotmail account:<br />
<br />
1. Messages were manually deleted either due to accidental deletion or were moved or deleted due to your account filter settings.<br />
<br />
2. Messages were deleted due to account compromise issues where a hacker might have gained access to your account and deleted the emails.<br />
<br />
3. If you are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account. This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option “Always leave a copy of the message on the server” is not selected.<br />
<br />
4. The account was marked as “Inactive." Accounts become inactive if you don’t sign in for more than 365 days or within the first 10 days after signing up for an account.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">5. If the feature Conversation Threading feature is turned on.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>You can click </font></font></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/organize-your-inbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><font color="#0044dc">here</font></span></span></a><span><font color="#000000"> to know more about Conversation Threading</font></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">7. If you rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked you – ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your
 renamed account.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">8. If you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn’t log into your
<b><font>web account</font></b> for over 365 days, you may lose emails due to inactivity in web account.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under ‘Folders’. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Please note that by upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox<br />
<br />
You can use the recover deleted / lost emails feature in Outlook.com to bring back your lost emails. However, when&nbsp;Outlook.com recover missing / deleted emails, our system restores as many emails as it could regardless of its dates. We do not have the option
 to choose the range of dates of the messages. And there is no guarantee that the messages that you are looking for will all be recovered. You can refer to the solution article below for the steps: &nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>Note: The system can recover messages but not the folder itself. Recovered messages will be presented in your Deleted folder.&nbsp;</span><span>Emails will not be recovered via recovery link if they were deleted from email clients
 like Windows Live Mail, MS Outlook, etc.</span></font></p>

<h2>            Nokia 2630 Volume.</h2>
                    Does the radio volume control also adjust the 'phone volume for speech during a call. If, this is not so, how can I adjust the reception volume.<br />
Thanks for your help / advice.

Use the left-right navigation keys during the call to set the volume.

<h2>            missing navigation bar on outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I noticed the other day when my daughter logs on her outlook.com account that she sees the bottom left navigation bar. She's able to switch between mail, people, calendar and tasks just like you can in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>When I login on my account or my wife's account we don't have this navigation bar.</p>
<p>We've all been migrated to the new Outlook.com interface for a few weeks now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something? I tried different computers/browsers and I get the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for whatever reason I can no longer my favourites under People (Contacts).</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes that's the exact nav bar I was referring to!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually ended up speaking (online chat) with one of Microsoft's support tech and was able to confirm that apparently my account and my wife's account haven't been fully migrated to the new system yet. This is why some newer accounts already have all the
 enhanced features of the new outlook.com and some don't.</p>
<p>When they checked my account they saw I was still being migrated. Even the tech didn't have that nav bar on his account.</p>
<p>I had to show them using remote assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issues I'm having with People (contacts) is because of the same reasons they gave me for the nav bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I just have to sit back and continue being patient for all the new features to be activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply still!</p>

<p>I have the same question. I redeemed skype 60 minutes credit via Microsoft bing. My skype's account shows $1.86 but whenever I try to make a call, it prompted me to buy credits and update billing address. I know it's not expired because I bought just a week
 before. I contacted someone via chat and she&nbsp;said she had put my request in the priority list, and I will get a response within 12 hours but it's been 4 days, I haven't heard from anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to use my credit before it expires.</p>

            Thank you for responding. I cannot delete or open the event, in list view or any other view. So obviously I cannot edit it. &nbsp;I don't understand why the duration would be invalid, as it was created exactly the same way as other events. At one time I synced
 with iCloud, but it was such a mess that I deleted it and went back to my regular calendar.

            I am a computer consultant, and have worked with several clients trying to sync iPhones with PC's through Outlook. I have only one client where it has worked well. All the others have had problems, where items will not sync, and problems like this. The
 Apple iCloud just does not seem to "play well" at all with PC's, and from studying the various forums, it appears it has a lot of issues with Mac users as well. It's a real problem!

            Does the start or end date fall in March? I've seen weird errors when the appointment ends in the DST delta period of mid march to early april. This is the period when older systems aren't updating for the new DST and not all countries have switched.&nbsp;
 It seems more of a problem with apple devices for some reason - i don't know if that is because of their popularity or with the code.

            I have Microsoft Outlook Calendar on my desktop in Windows 7 which synchronizes with calendar on IPhone). &nbsp;Suddenly found same problem (ie couldn't edit a 5 week calendar entry in Outlook on desktop because 'You must have a positive duration' - whatever
 that means (who dreams up these meaningless to the common man expressions?). &nbsp;Couldn't edit it on desktop whether in day/week or month views. &nbsp;Abandoned that and turned to IPhone where (in list view) I deleted the entry. &nbsp;~It deleted. &nbsp;I then closed and reopened
 Outlook calendar, and it had disappeared from there too!

            Well, it's been a year and this problem is not solved, even with an upgrade to Office 2013! Thanks for your reply, Nigel. I am not syncing with iPhone. In fact, this is my husband's computer I am working with, and he doesn't even own a smartphone. At one
 time, he tried to sync with his iPod touch using iCloud. But he was so alarmed when iCloud wiped out his Outlook calendar and replaced it, that I took out the iCloud and restored his Outlook calendar. He no longer syncs anything to the iPod. But this problem
 does not seem to have a solution.

            <p>I'm syncing Outlook 2010 with both iCloud and my Android phone calendar. This has worked seamlessly for a couple of years, but I just recently encountered the problem addressed in this post and the accompanying thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurred only with an all-day event that was scheduled from January 27, 2016 until March 2, 2016. I found that I could edit and delete it in the iCloud calendar and it would sync with Outlook, but I could only delete (not edit) it in the Outlook
 calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some experimenting, and here is what I found: If I edited the dates to be from January 27 through February 19, the Outlook calendar worked as normal. However, if I went one day more, to February 20, then the problem occurred. I do not understand why
 this is so, and I did not discover a solution. But the work-around is pretty obvious: Just duplicate the event for the remaining days. In other words, after entering the event for the January 27 to February 19 time span, I just began again at February 20 with
 an end date of March 2. Outlook thinks it's two events; I know it's just one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just out of curiosity, I did some more experimenting and found that I could enter long-duration events in other months with no problem. However, in doing so, I did find some other odd quirks in Outlook that defied explanation, and I'm not even going to try
 to elaborate on them here.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have a Win7 machine that I use Office 2010 on and I sync Outlook to Icloud and with contacts and calendar items to my apple devices.&nbsp; CodeTwo is how I do the cross-connect since Icloud won't do it straight away with Outlook.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep track of tons of short events as well as my basic work schedule as a 28-day all-day calendar event.&nbsp; I don't do recurring as the dates sometimes change a fews day or so give or take.&nbsp; The problem is that only on some of these longer multi day events,&nbsp;they
 change&nbsp;the duration to 0 and Outlook says It cannot&nbsp;open them, they must be a positive duration.&nbsp; It does not happen on all of them and I see no pattern like day, month or time zone other than it happens only for some of the work events I&nbsp;create&nbsp;and keeps
 happeneing not only to the same ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I look at the list veiw of them&nbsp;and sort by duration, the offenderes are at the top as they supposedly have 0 duration, but shows the proper start and end dates. I tried to edit the dates in List view, but it wont
 save as it save the duration is still screwed.&nbsp; Calendar view shows them properly but it still gives the same error when I try to open them to edit.&nbsp; I tried drag/drop and same thing.&nbsp; I tried to change the category and SOS.</p>
<p>Just today I tried to enter some test events with date in Location and shorter durations to see what happens.&nbsp; Oddly, for two times I worked for 22 and 12 days each, those events were not effected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The only fix I can see is to delete the event and reenter each one, a real PITA.&nbsp; But I did just&nbsp;that and it happened again a week later to about 10 of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have messed with changing the time zone on my laptop as I travel, but it didn't make any diff.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it could be Oultook, Icloud or CodeTwo that is causing it?&nbsp; As usual, I suspect the Mac/PC interaction, but just don't want to give up on this one.&nbsp; I see upgrading to O2013, likely wont help...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any new ideas other than Mac don't do PC?</p>

            It is most definitely an issue with march. &nbsp;After March passes, I no longer see the recurring event allocated across the entire month.

            <p>I'm not really sure I understand what you're asking.....If you make calls on a phone via your Google Voice service, the Google Voice number shows up on the caller ID of the person you are calling.&nbsp; There are no user options to set on the phone or within
 the Google Voice website that controls that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no official Google Voice app for windows phone and Google crippled the few third party apps that used to be available in the Windows Phone Marketplace so much so that the good ones (in my opinion anyway) were removed by the developers (Google actually
 sent cease &amp; desist letters to some of them).&nbsp; But you can make phone calls from a Google Voice number via a Windows Phone by going out to the Google website and placing your calls from there.</p>

<h3> billy murray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 950</h2>
                    I've been having the same problems as almost everyone else. Had it since December last year, about May of this year, just had it restarting itself, not charging properly, black screen when the phone is still on, the screeching sound sometimes, which is
 terrifying at night.<br />
However, recently, I decided I had enough and sent it off to Microsoft for repairs, and as it's a known problem, thought that they would help me. So, sent it off two weeks ago, and recieved it back today, same phone, no repairs, all because there's a crack
 in the screen, and they're telling me that it's my fault that the phone is broken. I've tried to contact them, but seems I can never get through. Can anyone give me advice? Thanks in advance

                    <p>I wanted to try a different font, so I selected all the text in my document, change the font, then increased the size (since the new font showed much smaller). Somehow, after that, all the chapter titles (just numbers) seemed to just vanish!</p>

<h3> richardlellis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Links in copied emails don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 7 SP1 with Outlook 2016 installed via a 365 account.&nbsp; When I drag-n-drop an email from Outlook into any folder (my desktop, on a server, My Documents, whatever), any links in the email stop working.&nbsp; I drag that very same eMail back into
 Outlook and they work again.&nbsp; I need them to work regardless of where they're saved.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>These messages are NOT junk, they are not spam, they were originally received via a POP3 account directly into Outlook and the links worked until I copied the message out of Outlook.&nbsp; I've reset Internet Explorer (which is my default browser).&nbsp; If I type
 a hyperlink address into my start menu, it works fine.&nbsp; Not sure what other information I can provide to help indicate the exact problem, but will answer any questions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for not reading my post.&nbsp; If it's determined that this is a problem with how copied messages in Outlook 2016 are intended to work, then I will consider your inappropriate reply.&nbsp; In the meantime, please allow people to actually review the trouble
 I'm having and see if anyone is aware of a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone else,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reason to believe that this is NOT an issue with Outlook, rather it may be a corruption of how messages interact with Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Mostly, I'm hoping to find if anyone out there has run into and perhaps solved this obviously problematic issue.</p>

<p>I hate to tell you this but Windows Vista/Windows Mobile/Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 are not compatible due to all the bugs and glitches between them.&nbsp; I have a Windows Mobile Device and I have had the same issues.&nbsp; I have even had Windows Mobile tell
 me:</p>
<p>To synchronize your device you must use ActiveSync 4.1 or higher on desktop PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no fix for this and numerous have complained.&nbsp; Will Microsoft have a fix for this.&nbsp; They might, when the new version of Windows that comes out after Vista is released.</p>

<h2>            This is driving me crazy&#33; the mouse pointer started blinking between the pointer and the system busy symbol &#40;the spinning circle</h2>
                    I had Office 2007. Yesterday, In Word, the mouse pointer started blinking between the pointer and the system busy symbol (the spinning circle) It was completely obscuring the insert point symbol (capitol I), and when I moved the mouse pointer off the window,
 the insertion point only appeared when I was using the arrow keys. I spent hours uninstalling, reinstalling, updating mouse software, changing mice and checking settings. Nothing worked, so this morning I installed Office 2013, and everything was fine for
 a while. Then, after I had opened Word 2007, the problem started in Word 2013, with one slight difference - The insert point symbol remained visible. I then uninstalled 2007, and reinstalled 2013, and the problem went away for a while. Two hours later it is
 back. HELP!&nbsp;

    <title>Turn off date autoformatting in Excel &#40;Office 365&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willcleve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off date autoformatting in Excel &#40;Office 365&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My primary use for Excel is for copying information from auto-generated usernames and passwords for my company's application. When a password is generated, it takes the first three letters of the person's first name, and assigns a four-digit number at the
 end. So someone named Mary, for instance, would have something like Mar1111</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I encounter is that when I then copy this information into Excel, the password will frequently get changed automatically to a date. Selecting a column of cells, right clicking, selecting format cells and selecting text BEFORE copying and pasting
 does not work. Then, when I right click the formatted cell after the information has been entered in and change it to text format, the information is just a string of numbers, not what I copied. I then have to refer back to our application, find the correct
 password, and type it in manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is incredibly tedious, especially if I have a large number of information to enter. I've been unable to find a workaround so far.</p>

            Hello ABRILMAIG,
<br />
<br />If you want to report this the best suggestion i can give you is to contact a Microsoft engineer:
<br />
<br />Ask a question to the virtual manager and click on "talk to a person"
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/</a>
<br />
<br />Phone number by region
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope it helps, have a good day       
        </p>

<h2>            Chat History - Windows 8 - 10</h2>
                    <p>I need to find the History in my Skype chat please. I am using Windows 10 and I have tried looking through directions only to find nothing. This path is not taking me to my message History...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Roaming all I am finding is roottools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your history for Skype for Windows Desktop is located in your main.db located here:</p>
<p>C:\Users\<strong>UserName</strong>\AppData\Roaming\Skype\<strong>SkypeName&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My path looks like this...&nbsp;C:\Users\<strong>UserName</strong>\AppData\Roaming\Skype/roottools&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to get my History from a conversation I had and all help would be appreciated. I have tried finding a contact number for customer support for Skype but only run into dead ends. Can someone please help with this also? My conversation history
 was erased also and I'm just stuck with this huge mess. My computer was Windows 8 but then I upgraded to 10 so part of my chat history was in windows 8.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span><span>I guess that you don't have Skype for Windows Desktop installed on your Windows 10 computer, but have the new Microsoft Skype for Windows 10 (Skype UWP) application installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Location of the main.db file used by the Microsoft Skype UWP application is different. However, it will not help you to find the missing chat history in this main.db file. The old
 conversation history from Windows 8 installation is not transferred to the new Skype UWP, so it is now lost.</span></span></p>
