    <title>Various Programs very slow Save As and Open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> puck90aa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Various Programs very slow Save As and Open</h2>
                    <p>I know this question gets asked a lot, and it's always the same answer, and none of those answers fit with my circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 Professional</p>
<p>On local Windows AD domain</p>
<p>8GB of ram</p>
<p>Core i7</p>
<p>New hard drive as of about 6 months ago</p>
<p>Office 2007</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that anytime I Save As or Open in various programs (I'm usually using Office), the Save As/Open dialog is very slow. It brings the computer to a screeching halt for about 30 seconds to a minute, then it finally lets me click save and everything
 is fine. During that whole minute, the hard drive activity light is going nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People seem to always say it is a network drive with connectivity issues. Here are the reasons I think that is not the case. The problem still occurs even when I:</p>
<p>-Disconnect all network drives</p>
<p>-Turn off network discovery for all networks (public/work/domain)</p>
<p>-BOOT INTO SAFE MODE WITH NO NETWORKING</p>
<p>-Sign in to a different profile on this same computer (local administrator which has no network drive mappings)</p>
<p>-Disable network controllers and disconnect all network drives</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem DOES NOT occur when I sign in with my same domain account on a different computer running Office 2007 and with all of my same GPO network drives present. Save As pops up immediately, so there is probably not an issue with networking in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem DOES NOT occur on my computer when I attempt to save a file in Notepad or Paint.net, and this is with all my network drives connected. So if it were a networking issue and not an OS/App issue, then the slow down would still occur. The problem
 DOES still occur if I save a PDF document in Acrobat Professional. So it isn't limited to MS Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Chkdsk, disk defrag (which it does on a schedule anyway), CCleaner, Office Repair, Registry hack to remove Network Places from windows explorer (I restored that setting after it didn't fix the problem), removed Office File Validation. Windows/Office
 are up to date. I have checked Windows system Logs. I'm not finding any errors that coincide with the Save As operations (no similar time stamp). I try to watch task manager when I'm doing save as. Nothing looks too out of the ordinary. svchost.exe is running
 high up, and I have checked those services, but nothing appears out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't made any changes to the computer recently. My guess is it has nothing to do with polling slow network locations. I think it has something to do with the file type associations with Office and Acrobat (similar document types maybe), and it is hanging
 up when trying to assemble those various Save As/Open file type options (but I'm not sure why). Logic would tell me this since Save As does not hang up when using programs that have very small associated file lists, like Notepad, or different file type options
 like Paint.net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try?</p>
<p />

<h2>            Windows 10 Disabled Microphone still causing Speaker feedback</h2>
                    After updating from Windows 7 to 10, I started experiencing feedback from the microphone to the speakers. I disabled the microphone and I still get feedback in the speakers. I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop which never had an occurrence of this issue
 until after Windows 10 was installed. Again, the microphone is already disabled and feedback/"hot mic" is still happening! Thanks in advance.&nbsp;

<p>I solved my microphone feedback to the speakers on Windows 10 by doing the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. left click speakers at bottom of taskbar</p>
<p>2. Select playback devices</p>
<p>3. Highlight the default speaker or speaker you want to use</p>
<p>4. Click properties</p>
<p>5. Select Levels Tab</p>
<p>6. Disable Microphone FP. (enabling it causes the feedback of microphone&nbsp;to the speaker)</p>
<p>7. Click Ok</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The feedback problem should be resolved.</p>

<h3> bsmooney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continue playing music when desktop is locked</h2>
                    Hey there! Whenever I try to play a file with audio (Media Player Classic, or any other standard file player for that matter) it gets automatically muted when I lock the desktop.<br />
<br />
How do I lock my desktop and continue playing my audio from my files in the background?<br />
<br />
NOTE: The music app can play audio when the desktop is locked, but the music app does not have access to codecs for playing x265 HEVC video files that some of my music is encoded in, or other miscellaneous file types. So, the question remains... how do I get
 Windows to stop auto-muting my desktop when I lock it? Is there somewhere that I can "allow" a specific app to play audio when locked?<br />
<br />

<p>Are there any scratches or cracks on the disc and do you have issues with your Xbox One reading any other games? If you haven't already give your Xbox One a quick power cycle by holding the power button down for 8-10 seconds, then try again. </p>
<p>let us know what's going on :)</p>

<p>I just did this with some one and it worked for them if what Mister Maka said does not work you can try this it worked for the user I was helping Earlier he unplugged cable and did the below steps and he was able to install the game.
<br />
<br />
Disconnect and reconnect your console's power cable <br />
<br />
1.Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the Xbox button on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
<br />
<br />
2.Unplug the console's power cable. Wait 10 seconds. Important Be sure to wait 10 seconds. This step resets the power supply.
<br />
<br />
3.Plug the console power cable back in. <br />
<br />
4.Press the Xbox button on your console to turn on the Xbox One.</p>

<p>Hi Payne0420</p>
<p>Can you please try these steps below for me.</p>
<p>Go to Settings &gt; All Settings &gt; Disc &amp; Blu-ray &gt; Blu-ray &gt; Persistent Storage &gt; Clear &gt; Restart.</p>
<p>Make sure the disc is not inside the console while doing the steps.</p>
<p>Try the Xbox 360 disc to see if it will automatically install. </p>
<p>Cheers! </p>

    <title>Win 10 installation - Zemana Antilogger - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tilou62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 installation - Zemana Antilogger</h2>
                    <p>Hi. After successful installation of Win 10 onto my 32bit PC, am trying to install on my 64bit Acer laptop, with current OS Win 7 Home. Installation falters due to message telling me that I have to manually uninstall Zemana Antilogger. Problem is - Antilogger
 is NOT installed on my laptop! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do subscribe and have Antilogger on my 32bit PC, which has taken the Win 10 installation cleanly and successfully. Prior to that subscription I had tried to install (unsuccessfully) a trial copy onto the laptop. I have used all the available clean-up tools
 to ensure that nothing is remaining of the trial version and also checked in the startup and regedit - there is no visible evidence whatsoever of the program being on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there is no over-ride feature on the Win 10 installation to bypass its command to manually uninstall a piece of software that doesn't exist, I am at an impasse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem and found a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I am using the download tool having not prior registered for the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for you prompt response to my dilemma.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions and placed the computer in a Clean Boot for the installation, however it was halted by the same command to uninstall Zemana Antilogger, which is not installed&nbsp;on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to successfully install Win 10,&nbsp;I had to choose the installation&nbsp;option of only preserving personal files, which of course means that my existing programs were wiped from the machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI here is a screendump of the message that I was unable to deal with during the installation process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that there were absolutely no hidden or registry files relating to Antilogger on the laptop, having used all available software to check for this after failure of the original installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tilou</p>

<p>Hello acharia</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you set User Account Control settins to Never Notify on your computer? </li></ul>
<p>If you have disabled User Account Control and set the level to 'Never Notify', enable it to the default levels and check if you have the same issue.</p>
<p>If the UAC is enabled on your computer and set to default levels. I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the gadgets that came with windows 7. To do that: &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right -click the desktop, and then click Gadgets.<br />
2. Right –click a gadget, and then click Uninstall.<br />
3. You may restore the Desktop Gadget Gallery back by using the below mentioned steps –</p>
<p>Click Start, and then click Control Panel. In the search box, type Restore Gadgets, and then click Restore desktop gadgets installed with Windows.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the below mentioned links for additional help –</p>

    <title>Why Has MS neglected the 10 foot interface&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raid517  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Has MS neglected the 10 foot interface&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi with huge TVs the order of the day it has become increasingly confusing to me why MS has not promoted the 10 foot interface in its line of products more than it has?</p>
<p>
</p><p>85% of my home based computing needs, such as writing emails, surfing the web, watching movies and listening to music, games is now done via a HTPC hooked up to my 65 inch LG UHDTV, but this seems to be an area that MS has barely scratched the surface of.
 So much so that even the newest 'metro' interface of Windows 8.1 is almost unreadable at a 10 foot distance, even on such a large TV. Surely this is a substantial market that MS has failed to exploit? Intel has seen this gap and has come up with the concept
 of the mini-pc, an extremely compact and extremely powerful miniature PC, with the aim of enabling a powerful computing experience at the heart of everything we do. My own system is a variation of this, with an extremely powerful graphics card for gaming jammed
 into it for good measure too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can and do use Windows on my TV, but it involves making a great many compromises in terms of usability and graphical incontinences. If one changes enough settings, the system can become just about usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why do I have to do this? Why can't I just select a setting in control panel to have everything smoothly adjusted for optimum use as a 10 foot interface? Surely this is logical?</p>

            If what you suggest could be done, can it be done so that selection be adjustable dependant on the size of the TV, because what may be good on 65in TV,&nbsp;may not be suitable for a larger or smaller screen?

            <p>Well yes, clearly the size of the TV should be detected and an option offered to automatically adjust it for the best "10 foot" living room experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems an incredible omission that MS have not thought of the 10 food&nbsp;paradigm when designing it's 'Modern' UI. This UI is almost useless under these conditions. Right now I have to live with the worst of most worlds, as I have had to adjust all windows
 8.1 icon sizes and text sizes manually etc. Some of it works OK, some not so good. It is hardly the modern integrated seamless experience one would expect from such an interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably the reason not so many people (although numbers are growing) hook computers up to their big screen TV's is because is involves quite a considerable amount of configuration to make it useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Big TV companies would clamour to help MS and Intel &nbsp;make this possible. So OK we have had smart TV's. Where next? Well how about super smart TV's. There has been talk for the last 15 years about 'convergence' between TV's a computers. Previously the technology
 wasn't there yet. Smart TV's were a step along that path, but ultimately they have proved too restrictive (few people who own a SmartTV actually use any of the SmartTV features. There are some exceptions I suppose but not many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel's NUC is a game changer in my view. OK so Apple did it first, but no one else yet has sought to put small powerful computers at the heart of the hime experience. They have always been pushed to the side, part of the home perhaps, but on the periphery.
 That can change if MS and other interested companies wis it to.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>To be clear I have something that is very, very useful - and has proved a game changer for me. A small livingroom PC, no bigger than 6 inches square (half the size of an Xbox 1), with a screamingly fast graphics card that can play all modern PC games. flawlessly,
 which has UHD 4K support, loads of ram and massive storage. I believe it's based on the Intel NUC platform, but has been heavily customised by a company called Zotan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is not to boast about my set up but rather to simply point out how useful this thing is and how much more it could be improved if some thought were put into it by MS to deliver a true high quality living room computing experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It almost seems from MS's perspective that very large, super high resolution large TV's/screens have not yet been invented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely this is an ideal opportunity for anyone interested in making the most of the potential that home based computing offers? Right now the way we interface with home based computers is extremely crude. Why should we be stuck at a desk and a chair when
 we wish to perform some computing function or other?<br />
<br />
I am not. If I want something done I just tell my livingroom computer to do it, using Voccommando and event Ghost. I'm already living in the future - and it's really good. But this technology and a useful 10 foot interface should be available inn all modern
 Operating Systems by default. They should be made simple for even the average consumer to set up.</p>

            Unfortunately, Microsoft's goal is to support the mobile market right now so I don't see them putting your suggestion into the works right now. But it is a good suggestion for those types of consumers.

            <p>With such a vast potential market, with millions of large screen Livingroom TVs sold every year, it would be bizarre for MS to ignore it. The 'stationary', or living room market, is almost certainly just as potentially vast as the mobile market.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And 'those types of consumers', will probably be you in another 4 or 5 years time. It is simply a matter of constructing the right interface. Computers are moving to the livingroom, whether MS cares to meet this need or not.</p>

            I totally agree with this! It is a billion dollar market emerging here with set-top boxes. Android is already beating Windows there with Android TV. The Nexus Player, the Nvidia Shield TV...Razr Forge. If Microsoft were to make some tracks now and be an
 early player in this space, they could hold a large percentage of the market share. The idea of smart TV's is flourishing, though the idea of them being built is is becoming null. People want the set top box (or possibly computer!) to be stand-alone so they
 can upgrade components separately. Microsoft has a great thing going with the Xbox One interface. Now...I don't want games, I want to use my computer with an air mouse, which I do, but I would like a nice 10 foot interface to do so with. BertUI is an interesting
 project if you want something in the meantime... http://www.geekjosh.co.uk/software/bertui/

<h2>            Icon for &#42;.ico on desktop won&#39;t refresh after editing underlying image&#59; Win 7</h2>
                    
<p>I placed an foo.ico file on the desktop, and Win7 displays the icon's image on the desktop.</p>
<p>If I edit that icon, and then resave it, Win7 does not change the icon to its current image.&nbsp;&nbsp; Renaming causes the new desktop icon to display the correct image, but if I rename the file [but not change the contents] back to the old file name, Win7 regenerates
 the old and incorrect desktop icon.</p>
<p>If I copy/paste into a new file [foo-copy.ico] -that- file has the correct image. &nbsp; If I rename this -new- file to the old name [foo.ico] the incorrect image appears.</p>
<p>I have rebooted, deleted the desktop.ini file, desktop refreshed, all to no avail.&nbsp; Nothing I can do in this situation refreshes the icon image on the desktop.&nbsp; It's like the "fileName" is permanently trapped/bound up with the first image it ever had.</p>
<p>What is this happening?&nbsp; Where does Win7 store the icon image?</p>

<p><span>Hi Engrattny,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to create a new folder on your desktop and try to move the<span>foo-copy.ico<span>&nbsp;
</span>file that<span>&nbsp;</span>has the correct image and try opening it and check if it displays the correct image and post back the result.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to check in the safe mode if it works fine. To boot to the desktop in safe mode
 keep tapping F8 key during restart. Once you see the option to boot in safe mode select it and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link to know more about how to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></p>

<p>I have already moved/copied the file to a new folder, and it behaves, there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already started up in safe mode since this surfaced, and so I know that safe mode does not, at least, cure, the defect.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will start in safe mode, and see how the file
 behaves -while- in safe mode.</p>
<p>Where is the icon image stored? Not, I presume, in an INI file stashed in the given folder, like XP used to do?</p>
<p>I point out, in the context of your testing suggesting, that the FOOCopy works.&nbsp; If I rename a FOOCopy to the original name, despite that it is the -same- new file, that is when it retrieves the OLD icon image on the desktop.&nbsp; That is why I wonder where
 the desktop icons' images are stashed.</p>

<p>Yes, it would be better to post a new question than to add to a 4 year old post.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the reason for this issue is the fact that Windows caches icons to speed up desktop painting.&nbsp; It would probably refresh the image at some point, but it can be forced by rebuilding the icon cache.</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding GTS-NJ.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As it turns out, I have already gone through the "delete the icons DB file &amp; reboot" routine, but that resolved nothing (sorry, perhaps I should have mentioned that but I was trying to be brief).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A BIT of an update: I read in another thread that "that will only help IF the files are there in the first place".&nbsp; Thus I started the quest of finding out where these files are supposed to be.&nbsp; That way I can either verify that they ARE there OR clear anything
 that may be preventing them from being re-loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specific problem in my case stemmed from the fact that I have migrated from one PC to another without using any "migrate software".&nbsp; I copied the links (files) from one machine to another (the files in the desktop folder).&nbsp; I suspect that my problems
 stemmed from the fact that&nbsp;the supporting infrastructure (files/settings/switches?) was not updated "in sync" to enable the icons to work as hoped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record: FUNCTIONALLY, these links all work, but the pretty-factor is way down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another little nugget I found on yet another thread was the suggestion to resize the icons - something in that process worked for the majority of the missing icons.&nbsp; Even after resizing BACK, the icons were retained.&nbsp; Armed with this new info/tactic, I think
 that I will be able to "fix" the rest with some cache clearing and revisiting the websites combo to get the remaining icons set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it would still be nice to know where the icon files reside, so I can verify "what is truth" in trying to resolve what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks genius'</p>

Hi, I'm new and here this is my first post.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I'm going through this nightmare for several months, any help would be more then highly appreciated.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A&nbsp;<span>huge</span>&nbsp;list of applications are keeping on crashing again and again, between them are:&nbsp;Windows Media Player -&nbsp;VLC - COM Surrogate -&nbsp;Windows Live Photo Gallery -&nbsp;VirtualBox -&nbsp;Microsoft Silverlight -&nbsp;Windows Explorer
 - XPS Viewer - Windows Live Mail - doPDF8 -&nbsp;PerformanceTest -&nbsp;HP SimplePass -&nbsp;TeamViewer - Windows media center - And many many more.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
When looking in windows "Action center" at the "Reliability monitor" most of them have listed at the "Fault Module Name" field something "StackHash_" followed with four numbers or digits. for example "StackHash_7001" or "StackHash_4ac5". The few other crashed
 applications is the faulting module "ntdll.dll".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
Iv'e searched all around for solutions on this miserable problem, the only so-called solution for this i found some answers to&nbsp;that it might have to do with DEP, and they advised to&nbsp;disable&nbsp;the DEP for these&nbsp;crashing&nbsp;applications, But this isn't a solution
 at all since my system is a 64-bit and so are most applications and "You can not set DEP attributes on 64-bit&nbsp;executables".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">

                    <p>I just updated everything from windows update and got the "Get Windows 10" notification</p>
<p>HOWEVER,</p>
<p>as i opened the tab on the left and pressed the "Check your PC" text, Windows says that i cant run Windows 10 because of iDisplay</p>
<p>here's a screenshot of the window:</p>

<p>BTW, I have a Sony Vaio Duo 13</p>
<p>If somebody out there have the same problem as i do using the same machine, maybe the problem lies in VAIO?</p>
<p>Anyway, any solutions would be greatly appreciated :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Uninstalled iDisplay, removed any trace of iDisplay on the program files and turned the computer off for a night and Windows now says that my computer is compatible :)</p>

                    <p>Original title:- Node.exe being a CPU hog</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is taking up a ton of CPU power, and I have no idea what it is or what it's doing. If I end the task, it just reappears moments later. It's within the Adobe directory on my computer, but when I approached Adobe about it, they didn't seem to think it
 was part of their products' doing. <a href="https://forums.adobe.com/message/8687950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
I made a similar post with Adobe too.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if it's a virus. Perhaps even if the actual node.exe isn't a virus, perhaps a virus could utilize it? I did a virus scan with Windows Defender and found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The path of the file is&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Creative Cloud\CCXProcess\libs\node.exe -- but like I said, Adobe doesn't seem to think it's part of their product, and the program launches without me doing anything with the Adobe suite. Help?</p>

</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Let

<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the Node.exe is taking up too much of CPU memory on your Windows 10 computer.
</span><span>Node.exe is not essential for Windows and cause issues on the system. It is not a Windows core file, and has the capability to monitor as well as manipulate other programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform a full system virus scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner to check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>

            I just got done watching the video. From the looks of it maybe your controller might have gone bad. You can request to see if you can get your Xbox controller serviced @

            Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power
 cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>

<h2>            honest hearts BROKEN DLC, are their requirements that my xbox dont meet&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>everytime on every file i try to start the honest hearts dlc, i put all my stuff in the crate tell him i'm ready to go, everything looks fine loads for about 4 seconds then everything freezes and goes black, i've tried everything from deleting my dead money
 dlc to just clearing my cache, nothing works. Uninstalled from hd then reinstalled and still nothing, i haven't tried with a new character with out the dead money dlc loaded, but i shouldn't have to because my friends loaded up no problem and he had all dlc
 loaded. I bought this dlc at 11am est&nbsp;and still haven't been able to play it</p>

<p>Okay, so every occurrance of this crash has been with the same save file/character, correct? Can you try accessing the DLC with another character, to see if it's perhaps a corrupted save file?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and <br />
drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Try the HP Print and Scan Doctor for Windows<br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c03286146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c03286146</span></a><br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<h2>            Cursors jumps one space to the right in Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    When typing in Windows Live Mail under Windows 7 the cursor sometimes jumps one space to the right after the insertion point has been placed. Both hands are well away from the trackpad (Dell Inspiron 6400). Only recently started happening - almost like
 a virus but PC is protected with Norton. Very annoying because I keep having to go back and correct the gibberish created - any help gratefully received

<p>I don't have an answer for you, but it doesn't sound like a virus to<br />
me.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wanted to comment on your sentence "almost like a<br />
virus but PC is protected with Norton." Two points:</p>
<p>1. In my view, and that of lots of others of us here, Norton is among<br />
the worst of the available anti-virus programs.</p>
<p>2. No anti-virus program, not even the best of them, is perfect. Even<br />
if you were at this moment protected again 100% of the viruses out<br />
there (and nobody ever is), minutes later there would be new viruses<br />
out there you were not protected against. All the anti-virus programs<br />
get updates to protect them against the new threats, but they are<br />
always playing catchup--between the time a new virus hits the street<br />
and the time the anti-virus has been updated for it (usually a few<br />
days) you are exposed to that threat. </p>

    <title>Missing coprocessor in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don b.davidson iii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing coprocessor in Windows 10</h2>
                    How critical is the missing coprocessor? Under "Devices &amp; Printers" I discovered that my desktop pc is missing the coprocessor driver and I am unable to locate this driver. &nbsp;That said, my PC appears to be functioning flawlessly. Should I just ignore this?
 &nbsp;I have read several posts and they all appear to be RE: video issues NVidia to be precise.&nbsp;

            Similar issue but this is under "Other devices" for what he's referring to this Coprocessor. My Nvidia Geforce GTX 560 is installed and updated to the latest driver version but it's under "display adapters". So I guess what he and I'm wondering is "other
 devices" and coprocessor ....
