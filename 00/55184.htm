<h2>            Windows 10 installed with the &#34;wrong&#34; default profile - how to change</h2>
                    After installing Windows 10 with express settings under my primary user, I log in, with those credentials, only to find that all the default locations and settings were pulled from a secondary user id. Is there a way to point the system to use MY id/profile.
 I see that they are all there in System Profiles/User Settings, but there is no way to change the default.

            I had done that, but could not access the primary user. The primary user was a local account from windows 7 not linked to a Microsoft account. I ended up rolling back to see if there was any option to choose which profile to default to, there was none.
 Ended up moving all the other user's files and info to a subfolder and deleting that user and reinstalling. Annoying process as I had to restore/recreate that user.

    <title>windows 10 mail password issues&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wendal lee  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 mail password issues&#63;</h2>
                    i enter the account info, in advanced settings, including my pop3 and smtp info, and password. then when i re-open the settings because i'm getting no mail, i see that the PASSWORD BOX CONTAINS MANY MORE DIGITS THAN MY ACTUAL PASSWORD, which seems to me
 that it's not accepting what i keep entering..... what in the world is happening here? i have re-entered the correct password many times, only to get the same result.......so, i went to the control panel to see if it was saving some bogus password info, but
 i could not locate anything. &nbsp; what should i do? this is a brand new computer i just bought on 12-30-15, with windows 10 already in it. should i uninstall mail and download something else? IS THERE A FIX?

<h2>            Xbox one Home account family sharing</h2>
                    <p>Alright, just bought a second xbox one for the house that is going in my teenage daughters room. Her account is currently on the main (home) xbox so the new one doesn’t gave an xbox live subscription under her name. Ive read about changing the home accounts
 to get this to work which ordinarily wouldn’t be a bug deal, however my youngest daughter, my wife and myself all use the “main” xbox in our living room with our own accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question is, can i get her going on her new xbox in her room without effecting the other 3 accounts and withour purchasing a seperate xbox live sub.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being that i cant set hers up as home, because well teenagers aren’t going to let parents and younger siblings in her room.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, in this case since <span style="color: rgba(0, 64, 0, 1)"><span>y<span>ou cannot designate more than one Xbox as your home Xbox and
</span></span></span>you want to share the gold features with two different console's it would require a subscription for her.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the fact that if you make her Xbox the home Xbox it will remove the sharing features for yourself and everyone else who uses the main console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The only other way around this (It also depends on how often the profile that has the gold subscription plays at the same time as your daughter) would be to have her be signed into the profile that has the gold subscription at the same time as her profile
 on the non home xbox this would then allow her to use the gold features.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>With this route though the gold subscription account would not be able to be signed in at the same time on the other console because you can only be signed into one xbox one console at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ill give you an example by how I have it set up at my house&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Xbox one S in the living room and an OG Xbox one in my bedroom My account has all the games and subscriptions on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Xbox one S as home so no matter who signs into that console they can play the digital games and use my subscriptions&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>then if my wife wants to play games or use a subscription in the bedroom she just signs in with my profile at the same time as she is signed in with her profile and can still play my digital games and use my subscriptions on the console in the bedroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not affect me because I do not play either one of the consoles that much and if I do I stream it to my PC and play it.</p>

<p>Since your daughter is the one playing "alone" on her own console in her room, you should cancel the Xbox Live Gold subscription from any other account, and have the Xbox Live Gold subscription on your daughter's account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That way, your daughter can play Xbox Live Gold multiplayer on any console she wants. Be it in her bedroom, on the "family console" in the living room, at her friend's console etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then your daughter sets your living room console as her home console, so Xbox Live Gold is shared to the living room console again, so all family members can play online multiplayer on the shared console, while your daughter can play in her own room (or
 at her friend's home or wherever) thanks to the Live membership roaming with her on her own account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you still get your whole family into one single gold membership.</p>

<h3> yee wong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer does not print on HP Laser Jet 1020</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Dell Studio i5 with Windows 7 64-bit. I have a problem in printing using HP Laser Jet 1020. I have no problem with other printers like HP Laser Jet 2600n (wireless network) and HP PSC 1410 All-in-one.</p>
<p>With HP LJ 1020, no respond from the printer when printing (from all programs). I re-installed the latest driver from HP website but does not help. When printing, the printer does not respond with any lights blinking. However, the printer spooler showed
 that it has been printed without any job queueing. Tesp print page also does not work too. Tried troubleshoot printer also does not showed any problem. I tried the printer with a friend's computer and it works perfectly. Please kindly help Thanks.</p>

<p>Originally Purchased laser jet printer 1020 for windows xp laptop.</p>
<p>I just purchased a new pc with windows 7.</p>
<p>I usedthe&nbsp;above&nbsp; site to download the upgrade for windows 7 for my new computer.&nbsp;Note: I did not use the driver disks supplied when I bought the printer.</p>
<p>I downloaded the upgrade, saved it to my computer. I then ran the downloaded software and my printer was installed automatically and I tested with a test print page and all is well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone.</p>

            <p>thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>answering your questions :</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What happens when you try deleting, moving or renaming the files?</p>
<p><em>cannot delete/move/rename</em></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you get any error message?</p>
<p><em>"the file is in use", although all applications are closed</em></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you have any security application installed on the computer?</p>

<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Is the issue specific to files created using Acrobat Writer?</p>
<p><em>I am not sure, think I have seen it also with other applications</em></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any recent software changes on the computer?</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You suggested 2 methods to overcome my problem. </p>
<p>Method 2 I will follow up with Adobe.</p>
<p>Now to method 1:</p>
<p>Unfortunately the FIXIT - page does not work as it should.</p>
<p>At the moment (and for some weeks further on), my computer where I need help&nbsp;(=<strong>Windows7-PC</strong>) will not connect to internet for some weeks. But I have an other PC connected to the internet(XP-PC).
<br />
If I go to the FIXIT page with the XP-PC (to download the FIXIT tool) the system offers 2 ways :&nbsp;</p>
<p>RUN NOW&nbsp;or DOWNLOAD</p>
<p>Since I need this tool on&nbsp;my <strong>Windows7-PC</strong> , I try&nbsp;DOWNLOAD.</p>
<p>But it still does not let my download the tool, it wants to start it only via the internet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now my question is : how do I get this tool to resolve&nbsp;my problem? </p>
<p>Can it be sent to me via E-mail?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would suggest you to disable Norton and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Disable antivirus software</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>NOTE:
</b>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon
 as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can view all programs that are currently running on your computer in

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you use Internet Explorer to download the

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, the try running Internet Explorer in no add-on mode and check if you are able to download the

<p><b><span>To run in No Add-on mode follow the steps below –</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. Click “<b>Start</b>”, and then type “<b>Internet Explorer</b>” in the Start “<b>Search box</b>”.</span></p>

<h3> intermediate pc user  say:</h3>
<h2>            WinNT&#47;Alureon.S Trojan hid my folder properties, start menu programs and hid my desktop even though trojan was removed, this issue remains</h2>
                    <p>My PC was attacked by a trojan name WinNT/Alureon.S and there are mainly two effects: 1. start program menu is blank and desktop is hidden after the virus has been removed.
</p>
<p>So besides hijacking the pc, it made some registry switches and other changes that are not repaired by simply removing the trojan.
</p>
<p>Has this been analyzed to see what it does and how to undo&nbsp; those changes? How can we manually restore?
</p>
<p>I did major work in same session that I was hit with virus, so system restore is not an option (besides never having used and having no clear documentation how it works, if there is enough restore space, and never having done a test run, I would never try
 a restore unless I had already lost everything).</p>
<p>I've gotten the program namesto display again after unhiding numerous folders where properties were set to hidden and read only, but the shortcuts are still missing. I can't seem to unlock certain folders, and maybe if I&nbsp;get the rest unhidden, I'll see shortcuts
 too. </p>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;I can see the files, shortcuts on my desktop if I view the Desktop folder from Windows Explorer. The information is there, but my desktop is just a blank screen. The display properties desktop tab was locked, dithered (greyed out), but I found
 a fix to make it available, and I can display wallpaper, but still nothing else on my desktop. I've tried several fixes and still not working. I ran an executable&nbsp;program that was supposed to make destop viewable, didn't work. I deleted desktop.ini from the
 desktop folder where all my information resides (there are several desktop folders for Administrator (which by the way, when I logged in safe mode as Administrator, that desktop was viewable and okay), All Users, LocalService (certain folders will not unhide.
 Like this one, but finally it did, but some sub folders wont, even though ran to unhide and included subfolders). I was able to unhide the desktop under the folder with my own login (which is also administrator), but still no desktop.
</p>
<p>I've been unhiding and unchecking the read-only box too, and I'm afraid that in some cases not a good thing, but not sure, and just trying to unlock features so I can access and use them, but it's helter skelter and still feel like there is some higher level
 switch that would fix most of the rest if not all of the issues, which would have been better than scouring through manually and mucking things up.
</p>
<p>So, if we've captured this rogue program (which I am sure has multiple versions, why can't someone tell us what the program did and how to undo? I also ran a rootkit fix program for this trojan from antimalware malwarebytes and it did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>Tried to be detailed, hope not too much so, but I have seen alot of this issue lately and I'm sure a good post would help many many users.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and help.</p>

<br />
As long as you can see the shortcuts one of the above solutions should work. Couple of tips, when running
<br />
<strong>unhide.exe </strong>temporarily disable your antimalware/antivirus program(disconnet from internet first) Do not run any temporary file cleaner until your shortcuts have been restored or you may have do it manually one at a time.&nbsp;See post #16 in the

<h2>            USB hard drive is not recognizing on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old USB hard drive that is not recognized after using Windows 10. It says Unknown USB Device (Invalid Configuration Descriptor). I have tried updating the driver automatically but it says that it is already the most updated driver (driver provider
 Microsoft&nbsp;10.0.17763.1). When I click driver details it says "no driver files are required or have been loaded for this device".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using multiple computers (all Windows 10), and still nothing. I have tried uninstalling the device and plugging it in again and still nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device is an Asion USB Hard Disk box. I think it is so old that the company no longer exists. Please help!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Orion,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate your effort in trying to fix the issue. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Since the issue is persisting on all other computers, possibly the cause of the issue could be due to faulty hard drive. However, I would suggest you to follow the methods mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try connecting the hard drive using a different USB cable. And you may also try connecting the hard drive on different USB ports.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Refer and </span>follow the suggestions from the article <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2654149/error-usb-device-not-recognized-when-you-try-to-access-a-usb-external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Error:

    <title>Off color start up background and other pictures. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennycrumpler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Off color start up background and other pictures.</h2>
                    Installed Windows 10 about 3 months ago. &nbsp;The basic background was blue and pictures were crisp and clear. &nbsp;Then overnight, when I log in I get a flickering green background and then videos, pictures,etc have a green tint to them. &nbsp;I have gone to Setting
 &gt; System&gt; Display Color and tried to adjust it, but nothing happened. &nbsp;I changed the brightness and that didn't help. &nbsp;I then tried to change the contrast, but couldn't figure out how to do that. &nbsp;What else can I do to solve this issue?

<h2>            None of my USB ports work, on xp, have recently done full recovery.</h2>
                    please help, none of my USB ports work, on front or back of CPU. &nbsp;They stopped working after a full recovery, I really don't know why. &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling and letting them be found but that doesn't work, it finds the root hub, then a message comes
 up saying it hasn't been tested by windows, then if I press continue anyway another message comes up saying I need seehcri.sys installation disk, so I'm unable to install root hub. &nbsp;I've tried rolling back drivers, can't do that. &nbsp;I have noticed other &nbsp;people
 having probs with Sony ericcson pc suite so I've tried the advice they've given, such as, deleting it all, I did a search on the start menue and no seehcri files were found. &nbsp;Can somebody please help, I'm desperate!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>seehcri.sys is a Sony Ericsson driver.</p>
<p>1. Roll back the drivers on ALL of the USB hubs that showed they were using Sony Ericsson drivers (Device Manager &gt; expand Universal Serial Bus Controllers &gt; right click on USB
 Root Hub &gt; properties)</p>
<p>2. Uninstall the SEEHCRI devices selecting the remove device driver software option (or words to that effect)</p>
<p>3. Then go into your Windows\System32 folder and delete the SEEHCRI.SYS file.</p>
<p>4. Reboot, Windows will detect new hardware and the 2 SEEHCRI devices will revert back to normal USB hubs after you allow Windows to search for new drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cannot roll back the drivers in step 1 or Windows doesn't find the drivers in step 4, you'll need to reinstall them from the original mainboard driver disk for your computer
 or off the manufacturer's website.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t find System Restore for Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 10 on my laptop to replace Windows 7.&nbsp; I have lost the Microsoft suite of games that came with Windows 10, possibly during registry cleaning.&nbsp; I thought I would use System Restore to recover it.&nbsp; However, when I open control

            You are correct that it has to do with update KB3087916. You can uninstall that update and all will be well with IE &amp; Flash... until that update re-installs itself or until MS gets around to patching that update with another update to correct it.

<h2>            Does anyone else&#39;s File Explorer crash when opened after the update to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading my computer to Windows 10 yesterday, I've found I cannot access the File Explorer from it's taskbar icon, now from its Start Menu selection.</p>
<p>Trying to do either of these things just causes the mouse to change to the buffering/loading icon, then the screen flickers and the desktops reboots itself.</p>
<p>I took a screen recording of it happening numerous time, and have uploaded it to YouTube at the following link -&gt;&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoL-2n5Xf-s&amp;feature=youtu.be<br />
</p>
<p>My computer specs and some details are in the description of the video, so if anyone is a similar position and knows of a fix, help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought I should mention that it is still possible for me to access my folders/files, but only through desktop shortcuts to Folders (My Documents, Pictures, etc.) or through using the "Search the web and Windows" feature, then selecting "My Stuff" at the
 bottom, and scrolling to the bottom of <em>that</em> menu to the "File Explorer" selection under "Other Places To Look"</p>

            <p>Alright, so someone has apparently found the cause of this problem and the remedy.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the answer by&nbsp;<a href="http://superuser.com/users/174557/magicandre1981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">magicandre1981</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/950659/file-explorer-crashing-on-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This</a>&nbsp;thread
 on SuperUser.com, the problem is apparently caused simply by having Autodesk Inventor 2014 installed. For some reason, as it is incompatible with Windows 10, it has some effect on the File Explorer, causing the issue shown in my video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple remedy to this is to Uninstall Autodesk Inventor 2014, and the problem is immediately fixed.</p>

            <p>I find File Explorer crashes periodically, locking up the whole start button bar at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have then had to go into the task menu and ended the windows explorer task. Then from the task menu I select to start/run a new task, choose start as an administrator, and I run cmd.exe to open a new command prompt window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the command prompt window I run explorer.exe, and if the file explorer window doesn't open, then I run explorer.exe again and a window opens. Once file explorer is open, I can minimize it and then I can open it up from the bar at the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a workaround to reopen file explorer, if it won't open&nbsp;from the bar at the bottom. However, if I try to run File Explorer from the start button menu, again it crashes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an external harddrive attached from Western Digital to move some files off the drive to try to improve performance with more disk space, and removed the drive, in case it was causing an issue. I found that when file explorer was hanging, it would not
 release the USB harddrive (when trying to eject the drive, windows said that it was still&nbsp;in use, and could not be ejected, so my only option was to unplug the drive anyway, since I couldn't get file explorer to release the usb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am in the file explorer window, I find if I double-click on items in the window it functions fine.&nbsp; If I single click to bring up a menu to select, I find file explorer is locking up, and sometimes crashing. There appears to be a menu choice to use
 single clicks rather than the default double-click and single select, but I would prefer that both work as advertised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first converted to Windows 10 from 7, it seemed to be running quite a bit slower than my win7 setup, but I have found the more I work with Windows 10, the faster it is getting. Perhaps it takes awhile for the screens, etc.&nbsp;to be cached into memory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check if I have Autodesk Inventor on this machine. I don't know how it could be&nbsp;the problem, except that perhaps it has a file lock that is conflicting with File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love a fix for file explorer as it is pretty hard to work on documents if you can't get to them.

            <p>I removed Inventor 2013 and found the issue was fixed too. Autodesk must somehow use the right mouse click differently. Now that I have uninstalled Autodesk Inventor 2013, my right mouse button works on file explorer and it doesn't seem to be crashing anymore.
 Thanks!</p>

    <title>Assigned Access Mode not working properly in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Assigned Access Mode not working properly in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I programmed a Windows 8 Store App a while ago, which has to run in Assigned Access Mode. This works fine in Windows 8.</p>
<p>Now I upgraded to Windows 10 and tested if everything is still working. The App is running okay, but the Assigned Access Mode is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I lock the screen (Ctrl+Alt+Del) and then log in to my Assigned Access user again, most of the time the desktop shows (which should not happen), then the screen goes black for a while and I come back to the lock screen. If I log in again, either the same
 thing happens or it works and the Apps starts right away.</p>
<p>Sometimes the App just freezes and the screen goes black and after a while it changes to the lock screen - but the App does not crash or throw an Exception. When I log in again the App has been restarted (or the phenomenon described above occurs)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reproduce this with Apps that were shipped with Windows 10, and it occured too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a Bug in Windows 10? If yes, when will it be fixed?</p>

            I'm seeing the exact same issue with my Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet. I have setup a local user account in assigned access. When I log as that user, the app loads and runs normally. After about 30 seconds of not interacting with the app,&nbsp;the screen turns off!!!
 This is terrible for assigned access / kiosk mode, it renders the experience useless. I have my&nbsp;display settings configured to never turn the display off but this doesn't seem to apply to assigned access mode.&nbsp;Pressing the power button does bring the app back,
 but it's reset to the apps main screen. This needs to be fixed ASAP!

            I've done some more debugging and this is what I've concluded. The screen turns off after 30 seconds of no interaction in Assigned Access mode. It pretty much makes Assigned Access mode useless. I've tried this on multiple devices with the same result
 (all upgraded from Windows 8.1). The Power &amp; sleep settings can be set to any amount (15 min, 1 hour), the screen always turns off in 30 seconds. The only workaround I found was to set the screen turn off to "Never" but that drains the battery when the device
 is not in use.

<h2>            Skype Icon missing on iPhone 7</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype installed on my iphone 7 plus. The icon is missing. I can receive calls but when I go to the Apple store to reinstall skype it does not allow me and it tells me that the program is installed and the app opens. How do I replace the icon or how
 do I replace the app completely and reinstall a new program and app?</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I was sent an upgrade to the new Skype program which changed the Skype user interface. I find the new interface very difficult to use and not as intuitive to use as the windows 10 version. Can I use the classic Skype interface on my I phone
 7 plus? My i phone has IOS version 10.3.3.</p>

    <title>Twitch and the Constant Bitrate battle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> icurehangovers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Twitch and the Constant Bitrate battle</h2>
                    
<p>Hello guys.</p>
<p>I'm hoping I can get a little insight into what is going on as clearly this is an issue with Twitch and their service.</p>

<p>First, my issue is that my streams were looking very&nbsp;choppy. I decided to have a look around all sorts of settings and being new to streaming, I discovered what is called the dashboard on Twitch. When I stream, I now use the dashboard to help me keep an
 eye on comments. I noticed something strange here. It was giving me a yellow flag that states acceptable. Apparently, when I stream, I don't have a Constant Bitrate (CBR). At first I thought "this can't be. I live in a 30/5 Mbps down/up stream. I stream at
 the recommended 2500 Kbps which translates to about 2.5 Mbps. That's half of my total bandwidth." Clearly I couldn't be doing something wrong. Xbox Live ports are forwarded in my router, my Xbox lives in a DMZ, and I have all of my QoS settings turned off
 because this seems to cause more issues than it solves in my opinion. </p>

<p>Now, in doing some research I discovered that Twitch requires you to stream in a CBR rather than a Variable Bitrate (VBR). When I look at the yellow flag error code I notice two things.</p>
<p>1. My average stream bandwidth is about 2.4-2.5 Mbps. This might sound good at first but that's an average. That means that I'm not getting a bitrate consistently higher than 2.5 Mbps.</p>
<p>2. It also points to a max stream of about 4.5 to 4.8 Mbps. </p>
<p>As far as I understand from my poor lowly internet research (LOL) CBR gives you a preset bitrate that your clients (viewers) need to match. Since not everyone can match a bitrate for a 1080p stream and since there is no downsampling done on Twitch's end
 on our streams, Twitch made the choice to let us stream at 720p at different bitrates. This makes it easier on the end user in the long run but has also created a deeper issue for those of us too cheap/poor to afford elgatos.
</p>

<p>If Twitch allowed a VBR for us on Xbox through their app, those with fluctuating bitrates could still sustain good image quality. The downside here is that there would have to be buffering at the beginning of your stream which would add delays and is the
 main reason Twitch wants CBR instead since that is just parsed directly as is to your viewer.
</p>

<p>I'm sure my ISP (Time Warner Cable) is to blame here. For as great as their service may be (not really) they rely on the short bursts their customers get at times. Try uploading to youtube. You can see where I'll hit the mythical 5 Mbps or higher at times
 in the speed rate but if you have a diagnostics open, you can see file transfer speeds in real time and it's not pretty. You're really uploading&nbsp;chunks of information with a huge disparity in size. 538 bits here, 1458 bits there (figuratively of course).
</p>

<p>As far as solutions, I have tried lowering the bitrate all the way down to 800 Kbps. That is the only bitrate that allows me to keep an excellent rating according to Twitch. Any higher and you get a really choppy picture as you play. Here's a highlight I
 uploaded to <a href="https://youtu.be/PLcsswyhHZ8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
youtube.</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/PLcsswyhHZ8?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/PLcsswyhHZ8?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> Pay attention to how grainy the video gets when there is a lot of motion. This happens because at the time this was happening, my upload speed was not in a burst where I needed at least the 2500 Kbps or more. I may get high rates but not very often
 as it seems. </p>

<p>Now why is this important. I could care less about the choppy video. What I care about is the fact that Twitch limits your audience to just PC users, cutting you off from mobile (where a lot of people watch) and especially from consoles. That's where it
 hurts because for me, my target audience are the people watching from their consoles wondering whether the game they want to buy is fun. If I can't achieve a CBR like Twitch wants, they essentially cut me off from the people who are more likely to watch me.
 People on PC are going to focus on those streaming at 1080p most of the time. I can't compete with that. My market is the other Xbox One users and the 360 users who can't find me.
</p>

<p>I ask you now fellow reader, is there an answer to this dilemma? Am I to just give up? I can't get a better internet service. Time Warner has shut out all of it's competitors in my area other than AT&amp;T. They don't even have U-Verse here yet. So, it's either
 terrible ADSL or the worst broadband in the world. Should I just give up?</p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts on this and if there is any way around the CBR thing that I may have overlooked. Thanks in advance guys.</p>

<p>I'm going to bump this again now that someone else has seen it. Still having an issue. I've learned that it's not my internet. The app is creating a lag between my Xbox and twitch somewhere. Even switching to the lowest quality possible doesn't help. My
 average eventually gets below the low quality threshold. How else is this happening when my average is always way higher than the next step down?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Bad Pool Header crash</h2>
                    <p>Yes, I know there are many other posts on this problem. From what I have gathered, a bad pool header crashed is caused by corruption or faulty hardware. I've already checked my hardware and everything is running perfectly. What I can guess is corruption
 in the OS itself. So my question is this: Is there any way I can find and recover/fix what is corrupted? These crashes only have been happening recently. I've had Windows 10 since it came out and it's been running perfectly fine until a week ago. It crashes
 every day with no warning at all. Everything on my computer runs smoothly. Now what I'm going to post is the specifications of my computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel i5-4670K 3.40GHz Processor 4-core</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
<p>AMD Radeon HD 6900 Series</p>
<p>500GB Toshiba HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also downloaded a program that gives me more detail on a system crash that happened recently that's called BlueScreenView. Amazing program love it. Here's a picture of the info it provided me.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81d99385-a227-4cb4-8183-e30afa350e8d" /></p>

            Hi JoeGore2 ... First of all you need to make sure that all those AD accounts have logged into that PC to create a local cached profile and be aware that by default only 10 profiles are cached.  You can move that to 50 using a registry setting.
<br />See link.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/172931/cached-domain-logon-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/172931...</a>
<br />
<br />Then from the PC logged in as administrator go to search and type gpedit.msc
<br />Go to the following location.
<br />
<br /> Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options
<br />
<br />Interactive Logon: Do not display last username policy (see) is disabled.
<br />
<br />Reboot and see if that works.

            For sure it can.
<br />Domain policies overwrite any local polices because they are processed after the local policy.
<br />There are 4 levels of polices.
<br />Goes local, site, domain and then organizational unit.
<br />And the rule last one in wins if there is a conflict.
<br />Most domain controllers policies have a policy set to not store login users at login for security reasons.

<p>I agree with you 100%! Windows 10 as a whole has to be the biggest let down Microsoft has produced as far as the GUI is concerned. Windows 7 was beautiful and aesthetically pleasing to work on. Windows 10 on the other had is completely ugly and dull. I think
 they need to take a look at why Windows 7 is still largely popular. The main reason is that it looks so much better! Below area a couple looks at the two. Honestly it doesn't take long to tell how much better looking Windows 7 is than Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you have mentioned in your previous post the icons in file explorer, and basically anywhere else in Windows 10 just look cheap and dull. Very disappointing to see. There are several other forums that have the same opinion that we do. I wish Microsoft
 would get the hint and make some cosmetic changes to their new flagship OS!!<br />

    <title>Xbox 360 Hard Drive needs to be formatted after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> random suavis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Hard Drive needs to be formatted after update</h2>
                    
<p>I just finished turning my XBOX 360 Slim on and what I thought a normal update was required. As usual I went ahead and updated but it took a lot longer than it does usually. The update finishes, my XBOX refreshes and suddenly my 250GB hard drive needs to
 be formatted and it won't recognize any of the content already on there. The hard drive came with the XBOX originally, it hasn't been pulled out or moved. Reading up on older posts on the XBOX forums shows a common problem with updates suddenly making the
 hard drive unrecognized. I'm not sure if there has been a fix for this as of yet. My XBOX is not that old... and I've never had a problem with it or the hard drive until this final update. Please help, I really don't want to lose all my saves on my hard drive.</p>

<p>Hello Suavis,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hey sorry to hear about the HDD troubles. Let's see what we can do.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>I hate to say it, but if the HDD is asking to be formatted, and you are unable to view any of the content on it, it does indeed sound like it has already been 'un-formatted'.&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Do you know if you had any saves utilizing the 'Cloud' storage?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        </p>

<p>I figured that might be the case :( My bigger saves I unfortunately only put on my HDD but I did have a few on my cloud. Thanks for the help though!</p>

<p>I have tried the safe boot and the problem is still there, i repeat, i have selected balanced in power options, and the sleep option when i close the lid or when 15 minutes passed.
</p>
<p>I also tried the uninstalling the Antivirus software, with no results. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any other walkaround to this?</p>

<p>It seems the problem is that windows 10 laptops are getting&nbsp;restarted&nbsp;even in sleep mode after installing updates.</p>
<p>This seems to fix the problem </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Search for <strong>Task Scheduler </strong>and run this application.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Browse to the following location path from the left menu.</p>
<p><strong>Task Scheduler Library</strong> –&gt; <strong>Microsoft</strong> –&gt; <strong>
Windows</strong> –&gt; <strong>UpdateOrchestrator</strong></p>
<p>Now, in the middle panel find and Double click on Reboot . </p>
<p>Click on <strong>conditions</strong> tab and then uncheck the option which says
<em>wake the computer to run this task</em>.</p>
<p>Click OK to save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm one of those people that puts the laptop in sleep mode at night and continue working where I left off the next day. Worked fine on my trusty old Vista Machine and just a little annoying that my shiney new Windows 10 laptop was losing all my previous
 work.</p>
