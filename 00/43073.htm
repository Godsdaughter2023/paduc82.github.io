    <title>Xbox Multi-Game Aiming Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gili0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Multi-Game Aiming Bug</h2>
                    
<p>So a few months ago, I began to experience this incredibly annoying bug that caused me to leave gaming. I never attempted to resolve the issue as I thought eventually it would just fix itself. I was playing the game daily for about a month and then after
 waking up one day, to an update I believe, my aiming was just incredibly buggy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stopped playing and now I'm back on, but I'm playing halo 3 now and this bug is still here and it's unbearable. I have no clue what to do. I've cleared the Cache and change my game defaults to Auto Aim Off and Aim Preference to low, I've tried all sensitivities
 from 1 to 10 and it gets more noticeable as you go down.</p>
<p>I called Tech Support and of course I talked to someone who hates their job and offered nothing but an attempt at an argument so he can tell all his friends how cool he is and how he talked to this dumb kid that didn't want to attempt the troubleshoot procedures,
 which were ridiculous.</p>
<p>So I set my sensitivity to 1 just to test this out and when I look up and down, it's as slow as it should be, but left and right will speed up to about 3 times, I'd say, than it really should be.</p>
<p>I know of another person who had this issue and he said he reformatted his hard drive, changed game defaults: Sensitivity Low, Aim Assist Off, and "It fixed itself".</p>
<p>I've tried everything but reformatting my hard drive but was recommended by the kid on Tech Support not to do so.</p>
<p>It's definitely not a controller issue but something deeper. I changed Game Mode on my TV to on and I've changed between HD and regular TV settings.</p>

<p>Anyone have any clue what I could try?</p>

<p>Hey GiLi0,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues with your aiming speed.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure that I understand correctly:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>You have this issue in multiple games. </li><li>It only affects your left right movement speed. </li><li>You have tried different sensitivities and Aim Assist options but the speed issue persists.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
<br />
If that is all correct, there are a couple of further questions to help narrow down where the root may be.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Does this happen with other profiles on your console? </li><li>Does this happen with multiple controllers on your console? </li><li>Are you able to check if this happens with your controller on a different console?
</li><li>Are you using an official Xbox controller? Is your controller wired or wireless?
</li><li>Do you have any third party headsets? </li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />
Please let us know if I've understood correctly and the answer to those questions and we'll go from there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I've tried it on different profiles and it's still no good, the same with multiple controllers and different settings. I'm going to see if maybe its because of my video cables because those are 3rd party cables and not official xbox ones</p>

<p>So I've done further research regarding aiming speed problems and there seems to be a problem called "Slow Turn" which is the opposite of my problem. Basically, my controllers shell is too wide on the area where the joysticks hang out aat and that is causing
 my controller to out put more than 100% speed. I'm calling it "Fast turn". The slow turn issur os due to the shell being too tight around the joystick which limits movemeny.</p>
<p>So ill be investing in another controller and seeing if it will be fixed. Of not, I'm stumped.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I think the best way to fix this issue would be to invest in another controller. I would suggest wired because you don't have to worry about batteries.</p>

<p>Hi there, the issue may be caused by interference from other wireless devices if your controller is wireless, this means that not all of the signal is getting from your controller to the console correctly (scrambled) or at all, causing your actions to be
 shown on screen in fast bursts in order to catch up with itself. A wired controller does not suffer from this, so purchasing new wired controllers or a play-and-charge kit for your current controllers will be your best options</p>

<p>Please read everything before making any suggestions just because I've done everything from playing with my xbox outside to playing it with the controller covered in cheese (exaggeration) Please don't say it was because my controller was covered in cheese
 that im getting this issue. Thank you.</p>
<p>Incredibly late reply, I know, but I just want everyone out there to know that I've tried both a brand new WIRED and WIRELESS controller but still didn't fix my issue but tried both of them on my friends' xbox that weren't experiencing this graphical problem
 and they worked fine.</p>
<p>I brought my xbox into all the rooms in my house to test to see if it was the 'interference' from other things and still no fix. I even borrowed my friend's xbox just to see if there was any problems with his from 'inference' and his was completely fine.
 Of course, he wouldn't let me use it forever.</p>
<p>This is your "Slow/Fast turn issue" that goes beyond your controller. I also invested a few bucks in the slow turn checking application and it showed that the two controllers that I purchased were not showing any signs of slow turn or fast turn.
</p>
<p>It's a problem within the xbox - definitely.</p>

            <p>The reply you got annoyed me somewhat as this is typical of my experience with Microsoft who seem to be unable to give a direct answer to a direct question and always defer to selling us something when they lack the required expertise&nbsp;to solve a problem
 or are unwilling to admit that an aspect of there product has been left in the dust.</p>
<p>Ancient philosophers have often counselled how attention to small things is important and I think Microsoft could learn a better lesson here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I absolutely couldn't agree with you more it is impossible to get a answer out of microsoft for the simplest question without them wanting you to buy something. I always thought the help section was where a person went when they needed "HELP" with a question.
 Not where you go for "SALES" there should be a way to have someone stop them from doing this. For that one reason I will not buy anything from them unless I can't work without it. Maybe if the government was to step in on them as they did once over crap they
 were doing they would straighten up and help a person. &nbsp;

<h2>            I am using a Dell Optiplex 9010 I created a fresh install yet changes Resolution</h2>
                    <p>After I did a fresh install I had the right resolution it wrote (recommended). Now it refuses to return to the right resolution for my computer. The picture is hidden behind the 4 sides of the computer now. I tried the alternative of using Intel's advanced
 option to push it in from the sides yet now I can not get into the BIOS page and when in Safe Mode it hides the picture behind the 4 sides of the screen. Here is a picture when it worked right.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would like to isolate this issue that you're having right now with your screen resolution. How did you perform the fresh install? Have you tried to update/uninstall and reinstall the video graphics card? The photo included on your post? Is that the current
 resolution you got on your device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>

<p>If I go from VGA of Dell Computer to TV with a VGA Port - The picture above on the page this is what I am using now. I only get 4 resolutions 1360 x 768, 1280 x 768, 1024 x 768, and 800 x 600 (The top one 1360 x 768 is the only one that fills the page and
 works with Log-on page and F8 - Safe Mode page and F2 - BIOS Setup page and F!2 ) - this resolution disappeared and came back then disappeared completely on me after finishing install of (Microsoft Windows 7 Pro SP1 CD and added drivers and Windows Updates)
 I was left with 2 resolutions to choose. Therefore I tried going from Computer Digital port to TV HDMI port with a cable adapter it gave me only 3 resolutions - I used the middle one. The middle resolution only worked on Log-on and Desktop Page if I did some
 adjustments yet after adjusting it did not fill the page in F8 - Safe Mode and F12&nbsp; yet F2 - BIOS Setup page would not appear. I then removed Video driver and used Intel's most recent driver - still no improvement. Therefore I returned to using the VGA ports
 and the resolution of 1360 x 768 is the only one that fills the page and is reliable at staying when I turn computer on/off now. This is the Video driver I am using now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I have been trying to sign-up with XBox live for the last 2 days, but all I get is "Sorry, XBox Live Signup isn't available right now. Try again later" and then the error code 80154002.</p>
<p>I have tested my internet connection with my XBox 360 and it works perfectly. I have also cleared the hard drive cache, no help. I have tried using different email addresses without any luck. I have another profile on my XBox that is a Live account and I
 can sign in to Live just fine - I just can sign-up a new profile. Is Microsoft having an issue with Live sign-ups right now?</p>
<p>I checked the error code and there is no listing here for that particular code.</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>1. Try a wired connection (if you're using wireless).</p>
<p>2. Clear your system cache (here's a guide: support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache).
</p>
<p>3. Restart your console.</p>
<p>4. Try downloading your profile again (here's the guide, if you need it: support.xbox.com/.../profile-move-delete).</p>

<p>Thank You, Alariaria for responding.</p>
<p>1. I am on a wired connection</p>
<p>2. I already said that I cleared the cache - that didn't help</p>
<p>3. I have restarted my console at least 25 times</p>
<p>4. How can I download a profile that I am not being allowed to create in the first place?</p>
<p>Is that error code indicative of a problem with my console, or an issue with Live sign-up?

            Hi Iknoor,
<div>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community Forums.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What is the make and model of the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to tell you that in order to switch from AHCI to ATA, you need to access and alter the computer's BIOS set up screens and change the native settings from ACHI to ATA . You might need to add a boot time driver so as to let Windows 7 see your
 drives after this change.</div>
<div>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, I would suggest you to contact the computer manufacturer for further assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Thanks Mahesh. i understand the risk and ready to do some experiment on my nootbook. I have done all above other than loading new drivers. Can you help me to know which all driver I need to install after changing BIOS setting from AHCI to ATA. and what
 is the process of doing so. I want to meake sure of not installing the OS and other stuff again. I have Lattitude E5430. But I think&nbsp;model number or make will be not an&nbsp;important factors.&nbsp;

<p>ATA is NOT a SATA mode. It is an abridged PATA, the old IDE mode, and I would doubt that the Dell laptop has an IDE mode.</p>

            Hi
<div>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Types of SATA modes:</div>
<div><br />
<div>•<b>IDE</b>&nbsp;- Old, slower, it is simply a compatibility mode</div>
<div>•<b>AHCI</b>&nbsp;- AHCI stands for Advanced Host Controller Interface. It makes Native Command Queuing (NCQ) along with hot-plugging or hot swapping through SATA Serial-ATA host controllers possible. NCQ is one of the important features of AHCI for SSDs. SSDs
 can process requests faster than HDDs. It can process so fast that the SSD could end up waiting for work. NCQ allows the OS/controller to request up to 32 simultaneous requests at once. So you basically get more performance from your drive over older IDE mode.</div>
<div><b>•RAID</b>&nbsp;- RAID stands for redundant array of independent disks, originally redundant array of inexpensive disks. It is a means by which your PC uses multiple disks as if they were one, either to increase performance, safeguard against disk failures,
 or both. RAID mode has all the advantages of AHCI mode. There are four main factors of a RAID setup: striping, which spreads data across multiple drives, mirroring, which copies the data to more than one disk, space efficiency, which is how much of the total
 space is available to use, and fault tolerance, which is a measure of how well protected the RAID array is against disk failure.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>The Problem:</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;The issue with changing the SATA modes is they need to be enabled in the BIOS prior to OS installation; doing so after you have installed the OS will disable the PC. The reason why is Windows disables the drivers for the others that are not needed during
 installation. This tutorial will show you how to enable the different SATA modes after you have installed the OS.</div>

<div><b>Notes:</b></div>
<div><b>*</b>You may need to install the IRST driver first in order to do the registry change from AHCI mode to RAID mode for Intel motherboards.</div>
<div><b>*</b>You may have to uninstall then reinstall any SATA drivers such as Intel RST or AMDs equivalent.</div>

            <p>The modes available will very much depend on the BIOS of the device. The Dell SFF PC I have has only one SATA port and offers AHCI, ATA and Legacy. By definition ATA includes both SATA and PATA and uses DMA mode transfer. Legacy is akin to IDE and is the
 PIO mode interface. One SATA interface rules out RAID anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In answer to the OP whereas switching from ATA to AHCI could cause problems with missing boot device BSODs it may not the other way round. Although Vista I have just tested the above PC doing this and it detected a new IDE Controller with no problems although
 a restart was required. When I reverted back it did not even redetect hardware and no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally although my BIOS does not support RAID when I installed a drive robbed from a machine which was in RAID mode the Intel RAID configuration option appeared in the boot sequence. Although the BIOS does not support RAID the chipset does.</p>

<div>This procedure did not work for me - when Windows 7 Pro went to boot up in ATA mode, it tried, but then just bombed and re-booted and&nbsp;got the screen that tells you to repair using the install disc. I did, but repair said it could not fix the problem...</div>

    <title>Windows 10 PC randomly shutting down without warning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a cool frog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PC randomly shutting down without warning</h2>
                    <div>My PC has decided to randomly start completely shutting off, usually while in the middle of something. I game a lot, so I've seen it happen there mostly but also while just watching youtube vids and chatting on fb. The weird part is that it doesn't go
 into shutting down mode or give me any kind of warning. It goes from "everything is normal" to just...off. Then I can't turn it back on until I remove the power cable, wait a few seconds, and then power back on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This started happening last week and I figured no biggie I must have a driver issue so i reset my PC and reinstalled everything since I like to do that every year or so anyways.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Didn't help, unfortunately. Still shutting down without warning.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I opened up the case while it was running and all of my fans are spinning and looking unobstructed. I have always used MSI Afterburner as well as CoreTemp to monitor my temps. While gaming and under heavy load neither got above 65c which is noticably hotter
 than usual, but it's also been warming up for summer so I didn't think much.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Took it apart and cleaned out everything and got some dust out and dropped my temps by about 10-15c but it's still crashing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked event viewer and I will see 3 distributed COM errors</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Launch permission for the COM Server application with CLSID Windows.SecurityCenter.WscBrokerManager"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Something like that but it happens randomly and not always pre-shut down.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked my Mobo for leaking capacitors and saw nothing of the sort, either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Only other thought I had was that my PSU might be going bye bye but I have no idea how I could really tell.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Specs: </p>
<p>Windows 10 - Version 1903 - Build 18362.175 </p>
<p>AMD FX 8350 stock clocked </p>
<p>GTX 970 stock clocked </p>
<p>16gb 2400mhz ram, also stock clocked </p>
<p>2 SSD's </p>
<p>11tb HDD&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corsair GS600</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>

            Hi A.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) See here for fixes for random shutdown:
<br /><a href="https://tecoreviews.com/how-to/computer-randomly-shuts-fix-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tecoreviews.com/how-to/computer-randoml...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000689.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000689.htm</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) Compare the install you did with this gold standard  Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The reason I ask you to do this is because no one of millions who have followed the install in that link have ever come back to report problems that I have seen.   It is also a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and have applied it with your own hands. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>The powersetting can be a wierd reason for random shutdowns. But it happens to quite alot.</p>
<p>Is your computer always connected to a power outlet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, I suggest you change your power profile to "Max performance".</p>
<p>And check additional power settings for anything that can decrease power in any way.<br />
<br />
Changing power settings to High and "never sleep" CAN fix your issue, but isnt the solution for every problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You dont hurt the computer by having max performance settings and never let the PC lower power to anything.</p>
<p>A PC doesnt use much power, even if its on max. Your stove and Fridge consume far more then your pc, for example.<br />
<br />
A few screenshots to guide you: Open Settings, and choose system. Then change your settings to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/336a846f-e804-45a1-8266-913c6503bcb0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/336a846f-e804-45a1-8266-913c6503bcb0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click on "Additional Power Settings", and choose High Performance.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d932a620-d211-4448-be78-611e8ae24beb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d932a620-d211-4448-be78-611e8ae24beb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Click on "Change plan settings" to the right of High Performance and change "Turn off display" and "Put computer to sleep", to NEVER, on both.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05f05d30-168a-4354-9b51-2acb2dbf63a6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05f05d30-168a-4354-9b51-2acb2dbf63a6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Next, click&nbsp; on "Advanced power settings", and change these:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16814867-5247-43b3-b865-dac313ef98f9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16814867-5247-43b3-b865-dac313ef98f9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure "sleep" and "Hibernate" are put to "NEVER".<br />
Scroll down and check these options:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b990cba-6a6d-4d34-99f7-265c95579e9c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b990cba-6a6d-4d34-99f7-265c95579e9c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And last, check this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09cd2318-ff4c-47e6-8704-cc7f08281016?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09cd2318-ff4c-47e6-8704-cc7f08281016?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant tell you this will fix your problem. But this has fixed mine, and many others random shutdown over the years. The settings&nbsp; will also block other apps who wants to shut your system down, without asking you.</p>
<p>Making these changes is 100% harmless and you wount use more power really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save power, is only really needed if you have a laptop without access to a power cable.<br />
<br />
And you can easily restore default power settings, by pressing "Restore Plan Defaults". Then choose a plan.</p>
<p>Let me know if this works?</p>

</p><p>Do you know what to do and NOT in a BIOS? If so, reboot and enter BIOS (press Del or F8).<br />
Then check the different tabs for power options. Dont change anything in BIOS unless you know exactly what it is you are changing.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Store Skype V12 - System Tray Icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave -laptop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Store Skype V12 - System Tray Icon</h2>
                    <p>On the Skype Classic version V7+, you can set up the system tray icon to change status (ie online, away, offline), provide notifications of contacts coming on and off-line, hear incoming calls, and to open the app. Newest version, Microsoft says we have
 to go to, also provides system tray icon, but apparently does not provide for notifications of contacts coming and going on and offline, besides some have poor video problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as an alternative, installed the Microsoft Store version of Skype (V12), and found it does not even provide a system tray icon. Having tested it with a contact, it apparently does provide the green online button to other Skype apps, whether Skype is
 opened or then closed (apparently it is still running in the background). However, cannot determine whether it starts Skype with Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without the system tray icon notification, if Skype is closed, you don't have a clue
</p>
<p>1. What status you are sending to contacts, </p>
<p>2. Whether Skype is still running when you close it, </p>
<p>3. If it starts with Windows, </p>
<p>4. No way to change status unless you open windows, and </p>
<p>5. No notification when contacts go online or offline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to activate the system tray notification icon on the Skype Store app? If not, can Microsoft please add this very functional option, that they for some ungodly reason, removed from the Classic app????</p>

            I believe you are responding to the problems with the new Classic upgrade, version v8.25 from v7+. That is not what I am asking about. I am asking about the Microsoft Store version 12, that does not even provide a system tray notification icon.

<p>Verified that the MS Store Skype version 12+ does NOT start with windows, verifying that with a contact that advised there was no green dot for me, after starting Windows 10. I also, checked the task manager, and found it not running. Again though, when
 I closed Skype v12, even though there is no system tray icon, it becomes a "suspended" process on the task manager, and retains my green dot on my contact's Skype app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I would prefer starting Skype v12 with Windows in minimized format, my work around was to put a shortcut in the Windows startup folder, where it now starts in maximized format, that I can quickly close and retain the process in suspended format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really prefer a system tray icon, for Skype 12, with all of the options of it in the Skype Classic version 7+, but at least the Store version is now far more workable that the disaster version 8.25 their are demanding we update to.</p>

    <title>Can I Use Windows XP x86 on my Prospective Custom PC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael a. grumbein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I Use Windows XP x86 on my Prospective Custom PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, techs and users. Before I even ask any questions, I acknowledge that Windows XP is no
</p>
<p>longer supported, and if that means these questions should remain unanswered, I will understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to build a new PC, and I have some questions about compatibility. First off, I plan to use the
</p>
<p>following new hardware:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboard: Asus H81M-A<br />
CPU: Intel Core i7 4790K<br />
RAM: 16 GB DDR3</p>
<p>
</p><p>(My other hardware doesn't apply to this question.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first question is, Since I plan to dual-boot 32-bit Windows XP Home Edition and 64-bit Windows
</p>
<p>8.1, will XP have any issues due to the fact that I will have 16 GB RAM installed? I know it can access
</p>
<p>less than 4 GB, but will the presence of more RAM than that cause problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other question is, Will that Core i7 CPU run XP with no problems? I do not plan to overclock, but I
</p>
<p>also know that the newer CPU's have new technology of which XP is not designed to take advantage.
</p>
<p>It is similar to my RAM question; basically I'm asking, Will the presence of new CPU technology that I
</p>
<p>can't or won't use in XP cause problems in XP, or will the CPU at worst just function as if it did not
</p>
<p>have that technology while running XP? Or will it not run XP at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware that compatible drivers must be available for hardware to work in any operating system,
</p>
<p>but I have all that under control already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know everything will work in Windows 8.1, and my hardcore computing will take place in that OS
</p>
<p>environment. However, I have hobby activities that work best in Windows XP, and I have a validly
</p>
<p>licensed XP installation disc and therefore do not plan to buy Windows 8.1 Pro to run a virtual
</p>
<p>machine but rather to use XP as I always did on my old, now-dead desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any input on this matter will be appreciated. I have attempted to include all relevant details and say of
</p>
<p>what I am already aware to save time and trouble for all who care to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all in advance for your help.</p>

            The wireless mouse 5000 has no on/off button. The only way I can get it to go off is unplug the transciever from the computer and insert in the back of the mouse. There has to be another way to turn the mouse off.&nbsp;

<h2>            HP Officejet 6500 Wireless All-in-One Printer - E709n OS Win 7 64 bit</h2>
                    A&nbsp;couple of weeks ago this printer ran out of ink. Until then I admit it has been a splendid product. After&nbsp;I installed the new ink cartriges I started getting the message "the HP imaging device was not found" folllowed by a list of suggestions of things
 to do. None of it worked, nor has removing the printer from my computer and reinstalling it with the "latest" software several times now.There is't any useful help from the forum eiher. I do not understand why HP has not come to its customers' rescue as there
 are several threads&nbsp;in their forums&nbsp;on this issue, yet no viable solutions&nbsp;I can find Except the work-around using Windows Paint. a poor second best with very limited function as a scanner. Can anyone here help me?

            Hi again, just checking what you said. I have removed all of the HP software using Windows (control panel, then Programs and removing the HP programs one by one) twice now. It was ineffective in solving the problem but then I didn't do your next steps.
 I looked for an HP program to completely remove the printer and have come up short.

            <p>OK, Here is the latest. I followed all of the instructions, first removing the printer from the computer via the uninstall in the HP/printer folder in the start menu.&nbsp;I then went to the control panel, then programs and removed all the other HP software programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran disk cleanup, and after that I brought up the recommended file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html</a>) to do the system file check. This is a very tricky site, and despite
 being aware of such sites and how they trick you into downloading programs you neither want or need, I wound up with three programs I didn't want. They were also hard to remove and I had to do a diagnostic boot to get rid of them altogether. I cannot recommend
 this site. The SFC utility is already in Win7, and I found and ran it there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good. I then reinstalled the printer using the latest software from the HP site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disappointingly there was no fix. I still get <span>
<span>“the HP imaging device was not found”&nbsp;</span></span><span>Extended error information: 8,[ (1,0,-2147024770)]</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned before, the computer does see the "imaging device" through the USB cable,&nbsp;as I can scan an image using Windows Paint. it just can't see it through the lens of the HP software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then installed the wireless network settings, and used the USB cable successfully to send the codes to the printer. I can print from a document with either the USB cable or the wireless connection, but when I run the HP Solution center I get a face full
 of error messages; not solutions, just problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions are welcome. This was a fairly expensive printer and I don't want to junk it if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, all,</p>
<p>

            <p>I have been asked to&nbsp;write a reply&nbsp;as to where things stand and if I solved this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a word, no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciated the responses from Palcouk , but there wasn't much interest in my problem otherwise. There were other threads in some other forums but no solutions</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched to the HP forums and logically, it being a HP printer, there was considerably more interest. We went through all sorts of procedures, mostly variants of what was done here, all to no avail. It was finally suggested that I wipe&nbsp;my computer clean
 and reinstall everything. Since the computer is running flawlessly in all other regards including running my b&amp;w Brother printer that was not a reasonable option to me.there was one particularly helpful person there who just wouldn't give up until the very
 end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But he is connected with HP, and arranged for one of there tech people to contact me. He called yesterday afternoon and we went through a variety of cures plus a number of sophisticated tests that were advanced and beyond my ken to no avail except that he
 defined the problems. One appears to be an uncorrectable conflict between the Microsoft and HP software. The other is the likelihood of a blocked printer head on the printer. Checksum = dead printer, replace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, THANKS Palcouk</p>

<p><span>Hi AmysConfusion,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem, follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Steps to restore default libraries in Windows 7</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Windows Explorer, right-click on the video library and choose<span>Delete</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 ‘<span>Yes’</span> when asked for confirmation.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><em><span>Deleting a library does not delete the
 contents of the included folders. However, you may need to re-add or include your folders manually, if needed.</span></em></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Then,
 in the navigation pane of Windows Explorer, right-click Libraries and click Restore default libraries.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This recreates the library that was deleted earlier. This option only restores the default libraries.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance</span></p>

<h2>            Fresh Paint - how to reset the sample paintings</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a Surface Pro 3 and experimented with the Fresh Paint app.&nbsp; I would like to reset the sample 'paintings' that came with the software to their original state.&nbsp; Is there a way to do this?&nbsp; I noticed swiping in from the right, selecting
 "settings" there is an option for "Reset First Run Experience."&nbsp; This did not reset the painting to its original state, but resets the welcome screen highlighting some of the features of the software.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to reset the sample paintings to
 their original state?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

            <p>Hi Nicholas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that you cannot reset the sample pictures to the original state once you save the pictures on the computer. The changes will save on the computer and it will not get reset even if you select "Reset First Run Experience". Its by
 design and&nbsp;I am sorry to that we cannot change this setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back if you have any other issues related to Windows and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<h2>            Purchased games not working</h2>
                    <p>So I've recently been having issues because my Xbox will not play games I downloaded it says that the person who bought the game needs to sign in when I am the one who purchased it then if I click "see game&nbsp;in store"&nbsp;from the pop up link it just says play instead of download but when I click play it says "something went wrong" then the cycle repeats itself over and over. How do I fix this?</p>

<h2>            Fix&#58; Windows 8 incorrectly identifies Asus M4A89TD PRO&#47;USB3 USB3 host controller.</h2>
                    When installing Windows 8 on an Asus M4A89TD PRO/USB3, the USB3 host controller is incorrectly identified as a Renesas chip. This can be fixed by manually changing the driver to the Asus supplied NEC driver.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This error (7E)&nbsp;is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though
<br />
it could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software
<br />
issues can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my
<br />
generic methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.
<br />
<br />
The other error (24) add the possibility of disk errors so be sure to 1st run SFC and CheckDisk as<br />
indicated below. Once that is cleared then hopefully all you have to deal with is the 7E problem.<br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows
<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to
<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To
<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the
<em>inc</em> directory of <br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the
</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2
<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system
<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,
<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the
</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be
</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,
</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable
<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup
<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe
<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process
<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer
<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the
<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also
<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.
<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or
<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system
<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk
<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary
<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and
<em>.chk </em>files that <br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more
<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

<p><strong>BCCode: 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0x00000024<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>One possible cause of this bug check is disk corruption. Corruption in the NTFS file system or bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk can induce this error. Corrupted SCSI and IDE drivers can also adversely affect the system's ability to read and write to
 disk, thus causing the error.</p>
<p>Another possible cause is depletion of nonpaged pool memory. If the nonpaged pool memory is completely depleted, this error can stop the system. However, during the indexing process, if the amount of available nonpaged pool memory is very low, another kernel-mode
 driver requiring nonpaged pool memory can also trigger this error.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>To debug this problem:</em> Use the .cxr&nbsp;(Display Context Record) command with Parameter&nbsp;3, and then use the kb&nbsp;(Display Stack Trace) command.</p>
<p><em>To resolve a disk corruption problem:</em> Check Event Viewer for error messages from SCSI and FASTFAT (System Log) or Autochk (Application Log) that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Try disabling any virus scanners,
 backup programs, or disk defragmenter tools that continually monitor the system. You should also run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Run
<strong>Chkdsk&nbsp;/f&nbsp;/r</strong> to detect and resolve any file system structural corruption. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition.</p>
<p><em>To resolve a nonpaged pool memory depletion problem:</em> Either add new physical memory to the computer (thus increasing the quantity of nonpaged pool memory available to the kernel), or reduce the number of files on the Services for Macintosh (SFM)
 volume.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Build 1803....WINHttp Web Proxy can&#39;t be stopped or disabled&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded to Win10 1803 on a new computer.&nbsp; I've only had it a week and I've noticed that the Web Proxy server is running so I tried to stop it in Services but it says I have to be an Administrator to do that? I
<strong>am</strong> the Administrator on this computer.&nbsp; I try to "disable" it and it says I can't do that either? I have always been able to turn this program off in Services on previous versions of Windows. I have no need for a "proxy server" to be running
 in the background.&nbsp; It seems there are a LOT of programs running with this new build and this is not the only one that I used to be able to "disable".&nbsp; Is this going to be fixed?</p>

            if it does not work, try this
<br />
<br />
<br />Start the computer in safe mode, for this you can follow the following link: start the computer in safe mode.
<br />
<br />In safe mode runs a scan to your computer with the antivirus you have installed, to detect any threat. You can use the following Microsoft tool that you can download in the following link:

<br />Another option would be to eliminate temporary files that in some cases interfere with the operation of some devices connected to your computer, for this follow this step by step:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows key + R, a window will be displayed with the name of Run.
<br />
<br />2. In the empty box that appears in the Run window, type the following command:% temp%
<br />
<br />3. A window with the name Temp will open, you must delete all the existing files in this folder.
<br />
<br />4. Restart the computer.

<p>All of the above answers involve all these steps to turn OFF a process that should NOT be "automatically" running in the background to start with.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to FIX this issue in their next update.&nbsp; No matter what I do I can't turn it off in Task Manager OR Services.&nbsp; In Task Manager I get the message "Access Denied" and in Services all options on all tabs are "greyed out" even when I run them
 as the Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will "try" some of the above listed solutions BUT Microsoft still needs to<strong> fix</strong> this issue and quickly.</p>

<h2>            Plantronics .Audio 400 DSP Foldable PC Headset</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the device listed above and have a Altec Lansing computer with Windows 7. Apparently this device is not compatable with Windows 7. Has anyone got a fix for this problem? I've seen some websites that list drivers but I really hesitate to download a
 driver from a random site. This device is supposed to be plug and play but when I plug it in my computer just reconizes it as a generic audio device, not as this device with all of its functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>When i try to launch Dead Rising 2 which i purchased through steam Games For Windows LIVE comes up and says it must verify the release date for my game. When i click next it comes up with saying that Games for Windows LIVE has determined that this game is
 not yet available.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check the DPI (font size scaling), Check whether it is larger than normal.&nbsp; The Windows LIVE dialog here does not take this into account, so the buttons that are supposed to appear don't appear.&nbsp;<br />
So you need to press ENTER to continue on this screen, or set Font scaling back to normal and you will be able to read the entire dialog and see the buttons</p>
