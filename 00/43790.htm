<h2>            Update 1709</h2>
                    <p>I would like to share my solution to the 1709 install problems.</p>
<p>I apologise for the length of this discussion article, but it will be worthwhile reading to the end as this does work.</p>
<p>First here is a copy of my questions and the answers provided by the community gurus.&nbsp;</p>

<span>Q:</span><span>Feature update 1709 win10 Second Question&nbsp;<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fanswers.microsoft.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2frsp-content-status-subscribed.png%3fver%3d18.2.20.4" /></span></span>
<span>Q:</span><span>Feature update 1709 win10 Second Question&nbsp;<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fanswers.microsoft.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2frsp-content-status-subscribed.png%3fver%3d18.2.20.4" /></span></span>
<div>
<p>This was my first question and the answer.</p>
<div>
<div><span>Feature update to Windows 10 version 1709&nbsp;<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fanswers.microsoft.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2frsp-content-status-subscribed.png%3fver%3d18.1.5.3" /></span></span>
<div>I managed to get this update installed on my laptop after the automatic download and install failed 4 times. Must have been a fluke to get it installed because now it will not install on my desktop even repeating my laptop install actions. These
 were. Ran wu troubleshooter several times. Disabled start up apps for a clean boot. Disabled my Norton firewall after download but before restart. Checked BIOS for first boot on hard drive. Now the update on the desktop gets to the stage where it says "Configuring
 update for Windows 10. 100% complete. Do not turn off your computer". And it freezes. The mouse and keypad are unresponsive. This has happened three times. Even after leaving it for 5 hours the last time, Only way to go forward is to turn off the computer
 and then turn it on again. This re-activates the install which them starts working on the updates and goes through to 100%. But then gives a message "reverting to previous version". And WU in settings then indicates that the computer is up to date. But next
 time I turn it on the feature update starts to download again. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. I am chewing up my data allowance on repeat downloads. NOT GOOD. What I want to know is how do I turn off the automatic download of this feature update because I do not
 want it or need it because the desktop does not even have a touch screen for the features. PLEASE MICROSOFT is there a way to deactivate the automatic download of this feature.</div>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell us what is the current version build is your computer running? Errors that cannot be fixed by the Windows Update Troubleshooter sometimes comes from incorrect version build number, or if your computer is in a higher version to what
 is currently being offered. We also have an article on our support site that can help you with this issue. Kindly visit the link provided here, follow the troubleshooting path, and skip the Windows Update Troubleshooter if you already have done it:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix

</p><p>The answer did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<span>I am running Widows 10 Home Version 1703 On build 15063.786 Every update prior to this feature update version 1709 installed successfully.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Thanks for the help Nick, but:.</p>
<p>The stand alone installer from the link that you provided also failed to complete the install.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c85026b7-1002-46ff-a6b8-a238c9e8d16f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c85026b7-1002-46ff-a6b8-a238c9e8d16f" /></a></p>
<p>The error code indicates a software or driver conflict. But I have not installed any new apps for 9 months so there should be no app conflicts. Unless apps updating has caused it. In which case I would have no idea which one. And anyway the clean
 boot should take care of that.</p>
<p>I have checked every driver and some did update, but the problem remains the same.</p>
<p>I have since run chkdsk/f and DSIM.exe/ Online/ Cleanup-image/ Restorehealth. Both gave a clean bill of health with no problems found or fixed. Also ran sfc /scannow which found no integrity violations.</p>
<p>I think that the problem is in the startup/restart files. The installs/computer were freezing (as I mentioned) whenever a restart /reboot was being run by the install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I have test run restart from the start menu several times and the same freeze happens. The re-start is not happening and the only way to reactivate the computer (and any running processes) is to turn it off and then turn it on again manually.</p>
<p>This restart problem has only happened sine the 1709 download came into the computer so it could be that the update is the conflict. Judging by the number of complaints in the community pages this is very likely.</p>
<p>I have the sleep setting on "never" because the updates take so long to process.</p>
<p>I have the power setting for the hard drive on 60 minutes.</p>
<p>I have fast startup off.</p>
<p>I have hibernate off.</p>
<p>Now, I can not even change any setting in the computer, or do a clean boot because the restart has to be used for any changes to take effect and it does not work. So the computer is virtually useless. Lucky that I also have a laptop on which this
 is being typed.</p>
<p>I hope that you have some suggestions because I have run out of ideas and am thinking of a complete reinstall of win10. But reluctant because of all the download data that this will entail ( I only get 25gb per month on my plan). Also I have no
 hard media and only have the product key because my machine was previously running vista.</p>
<p>And. If the restart does not work, then even a complete reinstall will fail.</p>
<p>So questions.</p>
<p>1. What version and build of windows will download from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10 create media download.<br />
2. Because I do not have hard media, can I use my product key to obtain the download.</p>
<p>3. Will an install from hard media require a restart for the media to work.</p>
<p>And for the record my computer is an Acer i5-2310 CPU@ 2.9GHz . 64 bit O/S<br />
6.00 GB ram 1TB HD so should be OK for this update.<br />

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>User profile corruption can affect your system's performance, specially when installing Windows updates. To troubleshoot the issue, we suggest performing the troubleshooting methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>Method 1:&nbsp;Check&nbsp;Windows Firewall</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Press<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Windows</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Key +<span>&nbsp;</span><span>R</span>. Run Dialogue Box will open up.<br />
2. Type<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Firewall.cpl</span><span>&nbsp;</span>and Click<span>&nbsp;</span><span>OK</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Click on “<span>Turn Windows Firewall On or Off</span>”<br />
</span></span></span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e2b0d54-fa01-40c3-bedd-b5e1996963f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e2b0d54-fa01-40c3-bedd-b5e1996963f7" /></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. In Private network Setting, select “<span>Turn off Windows firewall (not recommended)</span>”<br />
5. Do the same for Public Network Setting.<br />

<p><span><span>6. Press<span>&nbsp;</span><span>OK</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
<span>Note:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>After the issue is resolved you must turn the Windows Firewall on.</span></span></p>
<span>Note:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>After the issue is resolved you must turn the Windows Firewall on.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Method 2:&nbsp;Disable any installed Antivirus/Malware/Adware Program Temporarily:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sometimes, an antivirus or malware/adware programs marks Microsoft Windows&nbsp;installer files as spam and blocks them from being installed. Please refer your vendors website&nbsp;for disabling it temporarily. Once installation
 is done you can activate it again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Method<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span>3: Perform a clean boot:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If these<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>methods still doesn’t help, we recommend you to perform a clean boot to eliminate the influence of the 3rd party software and check again. Please refer to the link below&nbsp;</span><span>on</span><span><span>how
 to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you Nick and thank you Jefferson</p>
<p>All of the suggestions have failed including a reset with personal files, apps, and settings retained. All failing because the restart function on the computer is not working. Computer shuts down to restart and stays shut down. Frozen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because the restart has completely stopped working, I can not do any repair work on my desktop computer. So I can not change any start up settings and can not install updates that require a restart, or repair windows which requires
 restarts. I am using my laptop for this message. So I have downloaded windows onto a USB. But the reset requires restarts and so the reset fails. I thought that I could do a complete FRESH install of windows using the USB download but my product key for the
 version that I have in the computer (1703 Build 15063.850) will not activate the install and the program will not override my current installed version. Which is obviously corrupted. So I am forced to a last resort of trying to do a reset with all of my personal
 setting, apps, data deleted. This is a disgrace that microsoft has released an update that is causing so many problems. I will post whether this latest attempt works after the several hours that it wastes every time.</p>

<div>Another update. The USB install worked ,but all of my personal stuff needs to be copied back in. However, the install is not version 1709, which needs to be installed as an update.
 I have run out of data allowance and will run the download and install after 14/01. New data month. I will post back whether this works and whether all of the glitches with the restart function are fixed.</div>

</p><p>NOW THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE TO STOP THE UPDATE FROM CONTINUALLY DOWNLOADING AND ATTEMTING TO INSTALL.</p>
<p>First make your network connection a "metred connection"</p>
<p>Do this in "settings" / "network and internet" / "Status" / "change connection properties" /&nbsp; "set as a metred connection" /"on"</p>
<p>Now microsoft will only download critical updates.</p>
<p>Block the 1709 update from downloading for ever by utilising the "block automatic updates tool"</p>

How to: block automatic updates in Windows 10&nbsp;
<div><span>Technical Level</span>&nbsp;: Basic&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span>Summary</span><br />
<span>Summary</span><br />
<p><span>Windows Update in particular features some major changes.&nbsp;</span><span>Since the introduction of Windows Update as part of Windows, Microsoft has delivered updates as a way to keep Windows updated and secure. This has always
 been the way the company keeps commercial versions of Windows on the market current. With Windows 10, Microsoft is making significant changes to this model by delivering new methods of servicing the operating system. Taking into account we now live in a mobile,
 constantly connected world where threats happen all the time. Part of the solution to this is to keep users current by providing the latest updates&nbsp;as soon&nbsp;as they are&nbsp;available in addition to delivering features as soon as they ready too…automatically.</span></p>
<br />
<span>Details</span><br />
<span>Details</span><br />
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 Home users can pretty much expect to mandatorily install all critical Windows Updates. Windows 10 Pro will let you delay updates for a period of time. Customers running the Enterprise edition will have complete control
 over Windows Update. Why I think this is a good idea is based on my years of coming across PC’s, laptops running Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 from a friend or relative that has not been updated since they first booted it up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This mandatory procedure finally takes care of that. Users on metered connections should not worry though, updates are not downloaded automatically when your Internet connection is set as metered/mobile broadband.</span></p>

<p>Defer upgrades in Windows 10</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Some Windows 10 editions let you defer upgrades to your PC. When you defer upgrades, new Windows features won’t be downloaded or installed for several months. Deferring upgrades doesn’t affect security updates. Note that deferring upgrades will
 prevent you from getting the latest Windows features as soon as they’re available.</li></ul>

</p><p><span>Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?</span></p>
<p>Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/375a44a0-f608-4ad4-9475-a91ae6cb0dac" /></p>

<p>Very good discussion so far. Thanks to everybody. Especially IanBancroft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through everything as well wasting hours and hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I came to the conclusion to set up Windows10 again in summer when I will have more time and in the meantime I am using wushowhide.diagcab windows trouble shooter to block off 1709. But does it really block it off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am checking that windows troubleshooter on a regular base. update 1709 is still always blocked or hidden as they call it. But still my computer tries to update something again and after failing it sets everything back to the old version (1703 or whatever
 because I don´t know which update is trying to update and make problems now - except that it could be that troublesome 1709 update). Also I have to mention that some security updates for my working version 1703 succeeded in the meantime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND most important: I have two exactly identical laptops (Acer VN7 black edition), newest model with enough RAM and everything else. One of the computers CAN update to 1709 and the other one CANNOT. Both have identical setting as far as I know but not hundred
 percent the same software. So some microsoft advisers say it is some third party software that are the trouble makers. It is possible. But trying to uninstall each single one and trying to update to 1709 after each single one is more work than to setup the
 whole thing again. Microsoft does not have a better answer than this. I had this problem with a microsoft Lumia phone. Endless hours wasted. Everytime they don´t know anymore what to do they say: RESET. So you have to get used to reset and have a strategy
 that allows you to reset fast without wasting too much time instead of trying all these tricks and workarounds that do not work most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem right now ist that I do hide/block 1709 with the troubleshooter but what the hell is trying to download and update now again? It looks exactly like 1709 before because it takes forever. I cannot use the computer when it does that only to reset
 to the former state after all does not work. I suspect it is still 1709 trying to do something in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my question or advice to IanBancroft: I don´t understand why you cannot reset your windows10 with a Vista key. Just before you reset (set up windows 10 again) read your current Windows10 key with a free key reader like Jellybean etc. and you can setup forever
 in the future. You don´t need any hardware for that. Your knowledge is so advanced here but Jellybean is basic (and nothing illegal as you just find out what the key of your windows 10 is). It worked fine for me with my 2 old laptops which I upgraded from
 Windows7 to Windows10. Maybe it is different for setting it up completey new with the newest windows 10 ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: are you sure the update 1709 is not included in the newest Windows10 version?</p>

<p>Hi Viele.</p>
<p>The failing install should be shown in your update history as a failed update and would give you an update version number. If it is not 1709, then you could use a stand alone download/install</p>
<p>I re-installed 10 using the download from this Microsoft download page&nbsp; "www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10"&nbsp; The version that downloaded was 1703. That was on 10 January 2018.&nbsp; I did try to install 1709 again after the new 1703 install,
 but it still failed. That is when I decided to block it. I blocked it on 15 Jan, and it has not downloaded since.
</p>
<p>I do not know if the version that would download from that download page now has been upgraded to 1709 and I do not know if the version of win 10 that can be bought at this time is 1709. Maybe Microsoft people could clarify that for you.
</p>
<p>But, I suspect that if the version on that download page has been updated to 1709 since January, it would fail to install on my computer as did the updates.
</p>
<p>Because. (and this is conjecture), even though I had updated every driver in my system prior to trying to install 1709; I suspect that some of the hardware on my computer is too old and therefore has has drivers that are not compatible with version 1709.
 Maybe in a few months when/if newer drivers have been developed and released it will install.</p>
<p>Not much help I suppose, but all that I have.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for the information Ian. I will use that download link. I had downloaded windows ISO several times but I don´t want to update without 1709 being included if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1709 is in my update history more than 10 times. Everytime it failed of course. In the meantime some security updates for 1703 DID install successfully. The microsoft wush troubleshooter never changed: it shows that it has hidden/blocked the 1709 update.
 So it must be another update that also creates trouble but it looks like a huge update like 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the newest laptops on the market (total identical hardware) and ALL the drivers are totally up to date. And even worse: on one laptop 1709 updates without problems - on the other one there is no solution.</p>
<p>The only idea I have is that it could be the software because it is not identical on both computers. Maybe there are some general settings that differ but I do not have any special settings that could stop an update to succeed. I checked some options there
 too. Both computers run the windows firewall and AVast antivirus which I of course both stopped when I tried to do the update. I even uninstalled all the 3rd party antivirus software etc. etc. and some other software that could make trouble after a while to
 make sure. But nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, maybe for your situation, waiting for better drivers might be a solution but it is a small hope I am afraid.</p>

<p>I did try the stand alone 1709 update too BTW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember I once found a hardware component that created a problem in some other situation. Just google some of the hardware you have in your computer. In my case it was the bluetooth antenna that was installed together with a wifi antenna on the same card
 and it was amazingly easy to find the problem in the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way if you have a brand name computer or components is to go to the forums of those companies (even if it is some unkown Taiwan brand). Some people identified hardware problem makers. Some of those problems you cannot even fix with a driver.</p>
<p>In my case I had to disconnect (plug out) the bluetooth antenna (physically).</p>

<p>Hi VieleFarben</p>
<p>Good luck with it. Like you, I have multiple computers. Two have taken the update and one has not. The one that has not is my main work computer and has the most sophisticated hardware. Go figure. Anyway, I am over it and as I have no touch screen on the
 main computer, I am quite happy to not have version 1709.</p>
<p>Anyway, no doubt 1709 will be superseded by another version in the next few months and maybe microsoft will have fixed the problems that stop 1709 from installing with the next version.</p>
<p>Cheers Ian.</p>

<p>Hi VieleFarben. And anyone else reading this.</p>
<p>Microsoft downloaded version 1709 to me despite my block. But. it came in as a package with a stand alone installer instead of in windows update in settings. It installed first time with no problems. So. Obviously nothing wrong with my computer , drivers,
 hardware, software, or anything else at my end. (Like I had not already surmised). SO. The problem was obviously with the operating system software that microsoft were putting out there, and they obviously fixed the problems with the new package that they
 just sent for install. All of the time and effort spent in trying to get 1709 into my computer was a complete waste, and all of the suggestions from the microsoft people were never going to work.&nbsp; Quite disgraceful. Hopefully you (Viele) and everyone else
 will now&nbsp;get the 1709 installed without any more time and effort wasting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for the great news. I hope it will work for me too. Updates for 1703 (oder version) worked yesterday. It seems that 1709 is blocked with the wush software from microsoft but I am not sure. Almost everyday I have to wait for 20 minutes because
 it is updating something. Sometimes it shows a security update for 1703 afterwards under "update history" but something it shows nothing. It has not done a reset to the former version for quite a few days now (what it always did after not being able to install
 1709)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>All of the time and effort spent in trying to get 1709 into my computer was a complete waste, and all of the suggestions from the microsoft people were never going to work.&nbsp; Quite disgraceful. Hopefully you (Viele)

<p>
</p><p><span>Well said.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I had this situation once with Windows Phone 8.1 not synchronizing or synchronizing wrong. After nothing worked of what all those microsoft people suggested I just left it alone. And after half a year or so it suddenly
 worked. So it was not my old hardware and software. It had to do with Microsoft doing something wrong/not having something under control. At that time I wasted a record amount of time because I wanted to know where the mistake was.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So now I suggest to setup windows10 again whenever it takes too much time to figure out a problem. But you have to be fit for that and for 1709 I´d rather wait a bit more. 1703 is still serviced by MS and secure to
 the newest threads as I understand it.</span></p>

    <title>My PC takes minutes to get internet access after booting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fabriziotronchin  say:</h3>
<h2>            My PC takes minutes to get internet access after booting</h2>
                    <p>From several weeks my PC (surface book 2 + windows 10) takes minutes to get internet access after booting, even if it's connected to the wi-fi immediately (the message "no internet access" is shown). After 1 or 2 minutes magically internet appears. It's
 frustrating that windows takes 10 second to start but minutes to connect!!! I also tried to change DNS settings using Google's IP....but still not working...</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Thank you very much!&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Fabrizio.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 Update, if it's too late to roll it back  I can help you shrink C by about 50gb in Disk mgmt to do a test Install to the shrink space, which will configure a Dual Boot you can sign into to set up to see if the problem goes away.  If so I'll then help you move into the new install and eventually delete the old one and recover its space.

 want it. Be sure to click *within* it, not on the edge; clicking on the edge and dragging will resize it, not move it.</span><br />

    <title>Windows 7 Install problem - dual boot with Ubuntu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Install problem - dual boot with Ubuntu</h2>
                    I had dual-boot Vista and Ubuntu on my laptop. <br />
<br />
I tried to upgrade to Windows 7 without touching Ubuntu. I am not sure if Ubuntu was the culprit but my upgrade failed and I could not boot back up with a Vista CD. I could not do a Restore because it says there is no restore saved. I booted it up with Windows
 7 DVD and came to the failure screen. It offers a 'Repair' option, I tried and I got a 'blue screen'.<br />
<br />
Now, I have no way out. It seemed that the only option now for me is to RE-INSTALL Vista anew. However, my Ubuntu is still there and I am supposed to install Windows first before Ubuntu.<br />
<br />
Good recipe for an even worse mess to follow. What should I do? Do I need to erase my whole hard disk to start over?<br />
<br />
Please HELP! I'm quite desperate.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Yes, I would suggest that the easiest way is to reformat and reinstall everything.
<div>Don't forget that you can boot from the Ubuntu Live CD and rescue all your data.</div>
<div>Then re-install Vista, upgrade to Windows 7, then re-install Ubuntu.</div>

<br />
I am encountering the same problem at the same spot as my 1st time Windows 7 upgrade. I don't think that its a dual-boot problem now.
<br />
<br />
The install finished Step 1 and Step 2 and completed 21% of Step 3 (Expanding Windows files...) when it said it needed to reboot the system. It did and once its booted up, a dialog appeared.<br />
<br />
"....the install cannot continue, the install will cancel and your previous version of Window will be restored..." &lt;not verbatim&gt;<br />
<br />
There was no error message/code or any explanation as to why it could not continue and had to cancel.<br />
<br />
It booted up with "Windows Setup" and "Windows Vista (recovered)" as my menu items. There was no more Ubuntu listed. If I picked "Windows Setup", it brought me to the initial Windows 7 setup screen and I could only start all over.<br />
<br />
If I picked Vista, it restored Vista.<br />
<br />
This is where and how it dies since day 1.<br />
<br />
Any ideas, suggestions, instructions or info will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks.

            It is not&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to install windows before ubuntu. The only issue with it is that windows will overwrite grub which can be later restored using the live cd.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before providing any troubleshooting steps, I would like to confirm here that the dxdiag tool is reporting what version of the DirectX you card is supporting.&nbsp;If you have a card and driver that support DirectX 12 it will show up as that in the tool. Let
 us know if you've got any issues with the graphics while playing games or watching HD videos etc., we'll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

<p>Hi Kahungu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before providing any troubleshooting steps, I would like to confirm here that the dxdiag tool is reporting what version of the DirectX you card is supporting.&nbsp;If you have a card and driver that support DirectX 12 it will show up as that in the tool. Let
 us know if you've got any issues with the graphics while playing games or watching HD videos etc., we'll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks. I was just concerned. However, games play much better than on Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Reset to defaults - why such a lengthy process&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anubis2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reset to defaults - why such a lengthy process&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The other day I needed to reset a new Asus Transformer to its "factory default" state. Had I known it would have taken a few hours, I wouldn't have started this in the evening...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's how it went:</p>
<p>- The blue rectangle in the middle of the screen - "Getting some things ready" - took about 1 hour to get to 100%. After that, it stayed at 100% for another 1 hour and a half! I thought it was stuck at first, but decided to give it some more time...</p>
<p>- Finally the machine restarted, with that circle of dots and "resetting your PC" (or something along these lines). I'm not sure how long this stage took, but it was probably somewhere between 5 and 6 hours (it was at 42% when I decided to go to sleep).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And my very simple question: Why in the world does this seemingly trivial procedure take half a day? I guess doing it manually (a.k.a the good old way) would take one hour at most (formatting C: partition, reinstalling Windows, installing drivers, voila).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't the first time I used this (not on the same device, though), but it has always been a very lengthy process. I'm pretty sure it doesn't perform some sort of a DoD-compliant secure erase of personal files and settings (otherwise they would probable
 advertise this in a visible way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Not to mention the upgrade to Creators Edition, which I witnessed two times this year - they were both a day-long projects. But that's not the topic here, though.)</p>

            The factory reset procedure, which returns your computer to the way it was when it left the factory, is created by the computer manufacturer, so that's whom you must contact if you are having trouble.

<p>As you can see, the question was asked in this category: "<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/hu-hu/xbox/forum/xba_console?tab=Threads">Xbox on Consoles</a>". So, he's having this issue on Xbox One, not on PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those error codes have no importance in this case but there is an offline console update solution on the troubleshooter page.</p>
<p>But what are your suggestions?</p>

<p>Agreed, that was the same error code I was getting....My suggestion for immediate fix is to login to the "Insider App" - Download onto a phone, computer and go to settings, manage your device(s), Un enroll from the Beta Program...wait about 3-5 minutes and
 refresh app...You should now be unenrolled...Now you can apply update....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the mistake of resetting my xbox first which it still works after unenrolling...Just I have to wait for my game(s) data to play catch up now....for example...I can not move around in Division 2 at all</p>

            <p>Hello JM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the recent update you made caused your keyboard function to behave like this. In this case, we suggest that you run the hardware troubleshooter first to isolate if the issue is with the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which will check the hardware connected to the computer for any known issues with it and provides the details and on how to fix them. To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> to get the Start menu.</li><li>Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the search box right up corner and hit enter.</li><li>Click on<strong> Troubleshooting tab</strong>.</li><li>Click on<strong> view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.</li><li>Select the <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> options from the list.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to run the <strong>Hardware Troubleshooter.</strong></li></ol>
<p>We recommend trying a different keyboard also and see if the same issue exist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the result, so we can further assist you.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you're experiencing might be really about a conflict between your Chrome browser and Kaspersky since you've mentioned that using a different browser doesn't give you the keyboard issue.<br />
<br />
Have you tried reinstalling the affecting apps?<br />
<br />
Have you also tried reaching their support for further assistance? It may be possible that they already are aware of this and might have the solution for this.<br />
<br />
You may keep us updated here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>since the update of monday, I am unable to log in, constantly getting the "incorrect password" error. I have gone through several repair and re-install actions - all have done nothing to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed the "net user administrator" command, but everytime I turn the computer on, it goes directly to my Windows user for logging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to access my applications, resumes, etc. for way too long now. I really need a solid, viable solution to this problem, please!</p>

            I had to go back to the old boot and enter my password... which is the password to login but not the password to my Microsoft which worked... so i also took the password off my computer so it wont prompt me anymore for it and re installed windows 10 and
 it had worked...&nbsp;

<h2>            can&#39;t activate FSX onto new windows 10 computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got Flightsim x. and always used it on another computer. That computer started giving problems. so my daughter gave me back a windows 10 acer computer I borrowed her a few years ago. i can activate and install FSX but I cannot activate the accelleration
 disk. Why? I already installed and uninstalled it many times on the previous computer untill it became faulty. Why does it not wanna activate acceleration on this windows 10 computer. I am really furstrated as I got the orriginal bought disks of FSX acceleration
 with their activation codes. And this computer was also bought with its software.&nbsp;So why can't I get acceleration activated? When all software I got is legal and bought?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
<p>Reinhardt</p>

<p><span><span><span>Sometimes FSX will activate and the Acceleration pack won't.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only fix that you can try is the following.&nbsp; But be careful when going into the System Registry and amending its values as incorrect or deleted keys will render the program
 inoperable.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>1. Close FSX and run Registry Editor (press Windows key + R and type &nbsp; regedit &nbsp; &nbsp;and</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Ok)</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Expand the following registry key:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e967-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}&nbsp; &nbsp; The letters in this key may be capital letters (e.g. 4D36E967.....) .&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. After you find the folder, double-click Upperfilters on the right side.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>4. Delete any value there and type in&nbsp; &nbsp;PartMgr &nbsp;(note, this is case sensitive;&nbsp; type it as shown here) and click&nbsp;OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;Close Registry Editor and reboot Computer.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>6. Start FSX and check whether the Activation box comes up.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps you Reinhardt.</span></p>

            You cannot format a normal CD (CD-R).
<div>The only CD's that can be formatted is the CD-RW (CD rewritable).&nbsp;<br />

    <title>A corrected hardware error has occurred. Event ID 19 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A corrected hardware error has occurred. Event ID 19</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lenovo laptop has been performing really badly sometimes acting normally and sometimes being so slow I couldn't exit applications, randomly restating, having trouble restarting (I found it restarted after an alt-ctrl-del or two from the Lenovo splash
 screen but I think it rolled back a recent windows 10 update)</p>
<p>
</p><p>During all this I had one BSOD that said </p>
<p>"the gpsvc service failed the sign-in.</p>
<p>The universal unique identifier (UUID) type is not supported"</p>
<p>- this only happened once - and may be a symptom not a cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues had started after a recent win 10 update.</p>
<p>I had trouble installing that update and had to update drivers via Device Manager to resolve compatibility issues. (I updated everything I could find - 4 drivers updated and it allowed win 10 update to install)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the event logs and I have numerous warning errors appearing almost exactly a minute apart.&nbsp;(full details below, after I ask for help)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not fully aware of the hardware history - I bought it as warranty rebuild - but it has been working fine for about a year so I didn't think there was an issue with the machine.&nbsp; I don't know if these messages have always been there as I had no need
 to check logs before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the hardware scans in the Lenovo Service Centre tool and they came out clean.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please help - what can I do to identify the cause of my erratic performance problem. The error is technically just a warning -but handling so many can't be good for performance - so do I need to do something about it - and if so what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be gentle with the help - I am a very technical Business Systems Analyst with pretty wide ranging experience, but I am no hardware engineer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Michelle</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I have already tried updating drivers. Your response seems to be the standard reply for any occurrence of this error and I had already googled and found that suggestion. It was a painful process as I had to work my way through every device
 checking for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is a risk of bricking the PC if I update the BIOS without using exactly the correct version.&nbsp; Do you know how I can identify exactly which chip version I have so I am starting from a known point</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Skype wont open on Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys.</p>
<p>About 2 weeks ago Uninstalled Skype from my MacbookPro because skype was not functioning&nbsp;properly. I could sign into Skype but I could not call or message anyone because of connection issue. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the latest version, and now I
 can't even get the app to open on my Mac. The app just refuses to open at all. I have installed and reinstalled numerous times with no success. I have also tried the suggested tips from the skype website and still nothing. My mac is up to date and I&nbsp;am 99%
 sure that my laptop meets the system requirements to run skype. But here are my mac details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Macbook pro (130inch, Mid 2012)</p>
<p>Processor: 2.9 GHz intel core i7</p>
<p>memory: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3</p>
<p>startup disk 240SSD</p>
<p>Graphics: Intel&nbsp;HD graphics 4000 1536 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            saving multiple desktops</h2>
                    I created multiple desktops for work.<br />
I moved files to each.<br />
Shut down PC for the night.<br />
When I came back on-line, the Desktops 2,3 and 4 were empty. <br />
All the files I had set up were gone.<br />
How do you save the extra desktops???

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to multiple desktop from task view as mentioned in the below article?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If yes, please be informed that, If you open a lot of programs at once, this feature allows you to keep them organized.</p>
<p>I.e., you can move apps between multiple desktops. Once you restart/sign-out, the applications on all these desktops will be closed. The opened files/programs will be closed.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 DLNA to Sony Bluray Player &#40;BDP-S570&#41; - broken</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;I used DLNA streaming all the time with Windows 7, but immediately after I upgraded to 10 (and re-turned on the streaming functions which the upgrade reset), I am able to see the directory structure on the Bluray
 player (under "Folders") but no filenames and when I enter a leaf node I receive a "No Playable Files Found" error. &nbsp;Though the "Folder" structure is in place and working fine and definitely being read directly off my computer by the Bluray, it does not show
 any video files (and I don't mean won't play, I mean the filenames are not listed on the screen as if all folders are empty).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's the other thing, I have a Panasonic player with DLNA and it seems to work fine with the new Windows install. &nbsp;Any ideas about what's going on here? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - Yes, the bluray firmware is up to date.</p>

            There is no server-side software from the manufacturer. &nbsp;In Windows 7 it used the DLNA service that is controlled in the Windows Media Player under "Stream." &nbsp;The hardware BIOS on the bluray player is up to date. &nbsp;This is very frustrating.

            That thread looks to be about "casting." &nbsp;What I'm talking about is DLNA streaming. &nbsp;It worked when streaming from Windows 7, now when trying to stream from Windows 10 the Blu-Ray player still shows the file structure but there are no files are displayed.

            Had trouble with same update failing repeatedly with error code 800B0100. Method 4 was the only one that worked. Though afterward I did have to manually ask it to check for updates or it kept trying to install the same update I just installed manually

<p>JWKL,</p>
<p>A program on your computer interfered with the installation</p>
<p>What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?</p>
<p>What third-party firewall</p>
<p>What antimalware software you may have installed.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity Are you using SpyBot Search and Destroy ? </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>0x8007000D ERROR_INVALID_DATA</p>
<p>Suggestion: 8007000D - Error_invalid_data. Corruption in the SoftwareDistribution folder.
</p>
<p>Please rename %windir%/Softwaredistribution folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI</p>
<p>Always remember to set a System Restore point before doing any work on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Rename the Windows Update Softwaredistribution folder&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem may occur if the Windows Update, Software distribution folder has been corrupted.
</p>
<p>We can refer to the following steps to rename this folder. </p>
<p>Please note that the folder will be re-created the next time we visit the Windows Update site.</p>
<p>• <b><span><font><font>I.- </font></font></span></b>Close all the open windows.
</p>
<p>• <b><span><font><font>II.- </font></font></span></b>Click the "Start" Button, click "All programs", and click "Accessories".
</p>
<p>• <b><span><font><font>III.- </font></font></span></b><u>Right-click</u> "Command Prompt" and click "Run as administrator".</p>
<p>• <b><span><font><font>IV.- </font></font></span></b>In "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type in "
<b><i>net stop WuAuServ </i></b>" (without the quotes) and press Enter.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Please look at the cmd window and make sure it says that it was successfully stopped before we try to rename the folder.</p>
<p>• <b><span><font><font>V.- </font></font></span></b>Click the "Start" Button, in the "Start Search" box, type in "
<b><i>%windir% </i></b>" (without the quotes) and press Enter.</p>
<p>• <b><span><font><font>VI.- </font></font></span></b>In the opened folder, look for the folder named "SoftwareDistribution".</p>
<p>• <b><span><font><font>VII.- </font></font></span></b><u>Right-click</u> on the folder, select "Rename" and type "
<b><i>Sdold </i></b>" (without the quotes) to rename this folder.</p>
<p>• <b><span><font><font>VIII.- </font></font></span></b>Still in "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type the command "
<b><i>net start WuAuServ </i></b>" (without the quotes) in the opened window to restart the Windows Updates service.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Please look at the cmd window and make sure it says that it was successfully started.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If the issue is resolved and you can successfully download and install updates, you can safely delete the SoftwareDistribution.old directory to recover disk space.</p>

            <p><font color="#0072c6">José Antonio Pontón Posada CEO</font>&nbsp;- That was spot on! You, my friend, ROCK! I knew it had to be something easy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for a recap for those that are coming in afterwards. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My issue: Receiving an error "800700D" when trying to install an update KB2807986 on a 64-bit Windows 7 machine. Also note that this solution worked on a failed install for KB2661254 on another machine as well. So, my theory is that the downloaded update
 was corrupt.&nbsp;By renaming the Windows "SoftwareDistribution" folder that the download resided in, allowed for a new download to come in.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are those steps again as noted by <font color="#0072c6">José </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<b><span><font><font>&nbsp;</font></font></span></b>Close all the open windows.
</p>
<p>2. Click the "Start" Button, click "All programs", and click "Accessories". </p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Please look at the cmd window and make sure it says that it was successfully stopped before we try to rename the folder.</p>
<p>5. Click the "Start" Button, in the "Start Search" box, type in " <b><i>%windir%
</i></b>" (without the quotes) and press Enter.</p>
<p><span><font><font>6. </font></font></span>In the opened folder, look for the folder named "SoftwareDistribution".</p>
<p>7. <u>Right-click</u> on the folder, select "Rename" and type " <b><i>Sdold </i>

<p>8. Still in "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type the command " <b><i>net start WuAuServ

                    <p>Are there any log files or any kind of history in Windows Store?&nbsp;For example, when an installation finished with an error, is a log file created about it? Also, I'm running out of disk space. When I try to install an app from Windows Store, it gets stuck

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>We appreciate you approach with the query about the App log files storage and about the disk clean up tool. We need more information to assist you in a better way.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error when you try to install the App?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If yes, what is the exact error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:
</span><span>To open view the logs please follow the steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Type "<b>Event viewer</b>" on the
<b>Start</b> screen. Click "<b>Settings</b>" and hit <b>
Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: 
</span></p>
<p><span>Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user
<br />
logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error. Whenever these types of events occur,
<br />
Windows records the event in an event log that you can read by using Event Viewer. Advanced users might<br />
find the details in event logs helpful when troubleshooting problems with Windows and other programs.<br />
Event Viewer tracks information in several different logs. Windows Logs include:<br />
• Application (program) events. Events are classified as error, warning, or information, depending on<br />
&nbsp;the severity of the event. An error is a significant problem, such as loss of data. A warning is an<br />
&nbsp;event that isn't necessarily significant, but might indicate a possible future problem. An information<br />
&nbsp;event describes the successful operation of a program, driver, or service.<br />
•Security-related events. These events are called audits and are described as successful or failed<br />
&nbsp;depending on the event, such as whether a user trying to log on to Windows was successful.<br />
•Setup events. Computers that are configured as domain controllers will have additional logs displayed<br />
&nbsp;here.<br />
•System events. System events are logged by Windows and Windows system services, and are classified as<br />
&nbsp;error, warning, or information.<br />
•Forwarded events. These events are forwarded to this log by other computers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Disk clean up tool.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press Windows key + W.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<b>Free up space </b>in the search tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the option
<b>Free up disk space using unnecessary files.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the <b>
Disk Cleanup Options</b> dialog box, choose whether you want to clean up your own files only or all of the files on the computer. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the <b>
Disk Cleanup: Drive Selection</b> dialog box appears, select the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<b>Disk Cleanup</b> tab, and then select the check boxes for the files you want to delete.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you finish selecting the files you want to delete, click
<b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Delete files</b> to confirm the operation. Disk Cleanup proceeds to remove all unnecessary files from your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3: Run update troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows + W</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>troubleshooting</b> in the search tab and press
<b>Enter</b>.</p>

</span></span></span>Click <b>Internet Explorer</b>, new window will popup.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
<br />3. If the issue still persist, I would suggest you to follow the procedure below to resolve the Windows Store issue. 
<br />Press Windows Key+ R on your keyboard. 
<br />Then, enter the command line on the run command: 
<br />
<br />powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml 
<br />
<br />Wait until finished and then try to open the store again.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            I have established that it is my account because I could sign in using another one, could it be that my security info is still pending and I have to wait 30 days?&nbsp; Even though I have signed in on this devise before but is it because I signed out?if it
 is not that would I get refunded from stuff on my old account I cant log into?
