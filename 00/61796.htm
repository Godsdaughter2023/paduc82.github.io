<h2>            RAID-3 on the cheap -- is it possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>----- What is RAID-3 on the cheap? -----<br />
<br />
RAID-3 on the cheap is a 2-drive RAID-0, plus a smaller, 3rd drive. The 2-drive RAID-0 is standard, not anything special. The 3rd drive is a dedicated parity drive. It's the 3rd drive that makes it a RAID-3. But it's not an ordinary RAID-3.<br />
<br />
How is it different from ordinary RAID 3? The RAID-0 &amp; the 3rd drive are written only once. The 3rd drive is then unplugged &amp; put away (to be taken out solely to rebuild the RAID-0, if needed -- hopefully never).<br />
<br />
Compression is applied to the 3rd drive to halve its size. For example, if the RAID-0 is 2 x 8 TB, the 3rd drive will be 4 TB.<br />
<br />
In theory, if the RAID-0 data is truly random &amp; block size is very large, the 3rd drive can be nearly half its usual size. In practice, 1- to 2-percent of the RAID-0 data will be structured, and block size will be the entire RAID-0, therefore, the (compressed)
 3rd drive is almost guaranteed to be less than half its usual, uncompressed size.<br />
<br />
<br />
----- Is there an existing software product? -----<br />
<br />
Data Write: The user creates a RAID-0 as usual, no special handling, no special software.<br />
<br />
Parity Write: The software reads the RAID-0 &amp; writes a compressed parity stream to the 3rd drive.<br />
<br />
Rebuild: The software reads the 3rd drive &amp; uses the decompressed parity stream to rebuild the RAID-0.<br />
<br />
Advantage of RAID-3 on the cheap: The 3rd (parity) drive is only half its usual size.<br />
<br />
Disadvantage of RAID-3 on the cheap: The RAID-0 must reasonably be treated as read-only (or write-rarely).<br />
<br />
The application is home theater. Thus, once it's written, the 3rd drive can be unplugged &amp; put away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can Win10 Storage Spaces accomodate the compression needed to realize RAID-3 on the cheap? Or will RAID-3 on the cheap require special software?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, and Warm Regards,</p>
<p>Mark.</p>

<br />Essentially nothing. RAID 3 is 3 drives as well connected in the same manner as you described.
<br />
<br />RAID in practice has been super ceded by RAID 5.

<br />
<br />Today there are 3 "General Types" of RAID
<br />
<br />Software, Hybrid (some hardware with software checks), and Hardware.
<br />
<br />Personally I think the Software and Hybrid are a waste of time and misleading when claims of reliability are usually made. In most cases an effective backup plan is better than these. All too often the RAID software and/or Hybrid model actually cause a failure. Or what is supposed to protect the system in drive crashes and failures ends up being the cause of them. Hardware RAID is by far the best.
<br />
<br />Hardware RAID
<br /><a href="http://www.bestpricecomputers.co.uk/glossary/raid-controller.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bestpricecomputers.co.uk/glossary/ra...</a>
<br />
<br />Hardware RAID is a physical hard drive controller that provides the drive interactions needed to perform a reliable redundant array.
<br />
<br />Intel RAID controllers

<br />Adaptec RAID controllers
<br /><a href="http://www.adaptec.com/en-US/products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adaptec.com/en-US/products/</a>
<br />
<br />Many low cost add-in hardware RAID controllers are really a Hybrid where some of the action is done by the hardware card and the rest (and often most important functions) are performed by the CPU of the system using software RAID.

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />RAID 3 was usually implemented in hardware, and the performance issues were addressed by using large disk caches.
<br />
<br />If you need RAID 3 on the cheap, there are added cost software apps available that can take care of your needs.
<br />
<br />Storage Spaces is essentially a software-configured RAID which resembles RAID-6. 
<br />
<br />Since RAID 3 uses striping and parity, you can choose Parity spaces for you RAID 3. 
<br />
<br />Parity spaces are designed for storage efficiency and protect your files from drive failure by keeping multiple copies. Parity spaces are best for archival data and streaming media, like music and videos. This storage layout requires at least three drives to protect you from a single drive failure and at least seven drives to protect you from two drive failures. 
<br />

 to be half the size of the drives that make up the RAID-0.</p>

</p><blockquote>

<p>
</p><p>Sure RAID-3 exists. It's RAID-0 but with a 3rd (parity) drive. Taking the other perspective, it's RAID-5, but the parity is written to a dedicated drive instead of being striped.</p>

            Yeah, the interface here can be a real pain. <br />
<br />
RAID 4 is still possible however since RAID 5 also can be setup using 3 drives it is more frequently used in my experience. Both RAID 3 and 4 are rarely used today in favor RAID 5.
<br />
<br />
See : RAID 3 here <br />

"<strong>The requirement that all disks spin synchronously (in a lockstep) added design considerations to a level that provided no significant advantages over other RAID levels, so it quickly became useless and is now obsolete.[16] Both RAID 3 and RAID 4 were
 quickly replaced by RAID 5.[19] RAID 3 was usually implemented in hardware, and the performance issues were addressed by using large disk caches.[17</strong>]"

            BTW, I am both a Consumer side MVP and a Windows IT Pro MVP so I am very familiar with all levels of RAID usage. Please join us on the Microsoft TechNet forums where you can discuss your issue with the Windows IT Pros who use RAID in all configurations way more frequently than on the Consumer side.

<p>Windows 7 has the .NET Framework 3.5 and earlier (2.0) redistributables already installed however some application installers are looking for very specific .NET 2.0 files and or registry entires that may not be in the ?Windows 7 versaion of .NET 3.5 (which
 included .NET 2.0) which can cause error messages:</p>
<p>Example:<br />
TurboTax 2009 can fail to install because it thinks the .NET Framework is not installed, even when it is<br />

<h2>            Viewing the programs that are running on the remote pc.</h2>
                    How do I use remote desktop to view the programs running on the remote pc. The remote pc I am logging into is used to monitor a communications system for alarms. The alarm viewer application runs as a service. When I log in localy to the machine, I can
 see the application and view the alarm status of the system. When I connect using remote desktop, I can not. I can only see that the application is running in&nbsp;the services list.

            Hi Hari, you have no need to worry, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Hari,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />1. No, Activation would not be void. With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers. As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.
<br />
<br />2. If you do a clean install of 1809, you would get minor cumulative updates as soon as you log in. Later updates would be available as soon as they release.

            Hi Hari
<br />
<br />Yes, you can use the Windows Reset option, that would basically have the same effect . .. 
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

            <p>Hello Saim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt or missing Windows startup files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>try starting your computer in safe mode </strong>
and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Startup Settings</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. Click "<strong>Restart</strong>" and press either "<strong>4</strong>" or "<strong>F4</strong>" key to select
<strong>safe mode.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If computer starts in safe mode, then perform <strong>clean boot.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If computer does not boot to safe mode, then <strong>try running startup repair from Windows recovery environment
</strong>and check. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do so. If you
 don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>" to start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Startup Repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>download the upgrade files, create an installation media and then upgrade to Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>

</p><p>Basically remove your wifi adapter / replace with non Broadcom adapter and installation won't stuck at Windows logo anymore.</p>

<h2>            Is It Possible To Have Two Display Languages on Windows 7 Home Premium Without Upgrading </h2>
                    
<p>Is It Possible To Have Two Display Languages on Windows 7 Home Premium Without Upgrading To Ultimate???</p>
<p>I was reading thru the help documentation because I could not ascertain how to have the option of changing the display language from English UK to English US.&nbsp; It appears as if I would need to upgrade to the Ultimate package just to do this.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp;
 I'm a broke college student and think that such a trivial feature shouldn't cost me more money, especially given the fact that I can't even run the version of 7 that I want to [x86] because my Sony laptop came loaded with Vista x64 and the upgrade disc for
 7 that I received didn't come with the x86 distro, which makes no sense to me whatsoever.</p>
<p>I can't run a ____ of a lot of the legacy applications that I would like to and my laptop does not support the Virtual Machine.&nbsp; Tried VMWare, but that didn't meet my functionality requirements.</p>
<p>So why do I have to pay to use the x86 version of Windows 7--it makes no sense.&nbsp; The time and aggravation this issue has caused me has me on the verge of abandoning the Windows platform altogether.&nbsp; I've been running some version of UNIX or Linux on one
 of my machines since the mid to late 90s, but never fully abandoned Windows because of compatibility issues at the college where I take classes and work.&nbsp; Now, however, if the policy is going to be along the lines of:</p>
<p>&gt;Need to run your x86 applications that won't run on 7 x64?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;Buy the full distro.</p>
<p>That's not economically feasible for me.&nbsp; What else can I do?</p>
<p>&gt;Buy the full distro.</p>
<p>But why can't you just give the customer the option to choose which version they want?&nbsp; I'm not even asking to have the luxury to run both builds.</p>
<p>&gt;Form letter response.</p>
<p>Windows has come a long way.&nbsp; I remember 2000 being their redemption as a real operating system.&nbsp; Now, I'm beginning to feel as tho I'm just going to have to bend over and take it if I want to do simple things like run programs that won't run under the compatibility
 mode of x64 and not having the required component to run the Virtual Machine is a BS reason to use as a defense as to why I can't have the x86 7 distro.</p>

<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-get-additional-display-languages</p>
<p><strong>I can't even run the version of 7 that I want to [x86] because my Sony laptop came loaded with Vista x64 and the upgrade disc for 7 that I received didn't come with the x86 distro, which makes no sense to me whatsoever.</strong></p>
<p>Try requesting alternate media from the manufacturer of your computer (Sony), they should provide the 32 bit Windows 7 DVD for a small shipping and handling fee. Please understand, there is no in place upgrade path from 64 bit to 32 bit, clean install only.
 I personally would stick with 64 bit.</p>
<p><strong>I can't run a ____ of a lot of the legacy applications that I would like to and my laptop does not support the Virtual Machine.&nbsp; Tried VMWare, but that didn't meet my functionality requirements.</strong></p>
<p>You don't need the Ultimate edition for this, you can also upgrade to Windows 7 Professional and receive access to Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode. If you can't do that, but own a full version Windows XP license, you can download the free Windows
 Virtual PC and install it as a new VM.</p>
<p>Also, you don't need to purchase the full retail version or upgrade version license, you can do an Anytime Upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to a higher edition at a much cheaper cost.</p>
<p>Upgrade to another edition of Windows 7 by using Windows Anytime Upgrade<br />

    <title>Recovering Outlook Express Folders and Address book, from an external - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recovering Outlook Express Folders and Address book, from an external hard drive.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; My old Windows XP SP3 PC finally died, I think it was just from old age, but there is no problem with the information on the hard drive. On that PC I used Outlook Express, I think Version 6, as my email program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now have a PC running Windows Live Mail
 2012 and I would like to import my old address book and email folders from that copy of Outlook Express.&nbsp; Normally when I set up the email account, it would import this information from the local drive. I can't find a way to tell Windows Live Mail 2012 to
 look on an external drive nor do I know where to find the files I'm looking for on that drive. Is there a way to import that information from an external drive? With the old Outlook Express there was a way to save folders and address books to a CD or thumb
 drive, as a backup and then you could import it as needed. The information is still on that hard drive, I just don't know how to find it or get it to my mew Mail Account.</p>

            <p>MS FSX real world weather worked when I used it on Jan 26, 2015 at 9pm est. I loaded the real</p>
<p>world weather and it provided accurate weather, snow, wind direction , and barometric pressure, from Boston Logan to Reagan National with wind aloft data (Bumpy Flight ) every fifteen mins. I was one who had experienced the real world weather not working
 but it did last night. Maybe Jeppesen is now working again with FSX.</p>

            <p>Maybe your right I will check it when I get home. Hope it wasn't an anomaly . but then again that happen to be a significant weather event. I called Jeppesen this morning and they told me Microsoft servers</p>
<p>actually do connect to their servers and thus the weather I got was from Microsoft servers . not directly from them.</p>

<h2>            .jpg in Paint saves as a thumbnail in My Pictures</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>After a lot of searching I know this is not an unusual problem but I cannot find a solution.</div>
<div>Until fairly recently I was able to successfully save graphics in Paint to .jpg. .png, etc. Everything was successfully saved in their original size in My Pictures. Now - with no changes in computer settings, process, etc - anything I save in Paint shows
 up as a Thumbnail only in My Pictures.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The size is correctly set to 100% both vertical and horizontal</div>
<div>The item I am saving is actual-sized (i.e. there is no large white external area to the graphic in the Paint field that needs to be resized)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
Thank you.</div>
                </div>

<p>Quanta resposta imbecil para uma questão simples...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amigo, primeiro responda: quando você se registrou na Live, você usou endereço no Brasil ou nos EUA?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caso tenha sido no Brasil, a Live Br só aceita cartões de crédito internacional das bandeiras Mastercad ou Visa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caso tenha sido nos EUA, não dá pra adicionar cartões brasileiros, mesmo que sejam internacionais. Você terá que usar algum outro método para pagar, por exemplo Paypal.</p>

<h2>            Halo 5&#58; Guardians, Limited Collectors Edition, Swindling Gamers&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Let me first start by saying, I bought the Halo 5: Guardians, Limited Collectors Edition, purely for&nbsp;the beautifully designed Master Chief and Spartan Locke Statue by TriForce, and everything else that came&nbsp;with the game.</p>
<p>However, a couple of days ago, looking at my pre-ordered games through GameStop's App, I seen that this Edition was to be released&nbsp;on 10/20/2015, rather than just the game's release on 10/27/2015. This got me even more excited and gave me further&nbsp;justification
 for spending $250 on a game and a display.</p>
<p>After downloading the game, I realized I wasn't able to play, and instead just have it ready&nbsp;starting midnight on the 27th.</p>
<p>I can see where this will give someone a greater incentive to pay 190$ more, falsely believing they were&nbsp;going to be able to play the game early!</p>
<p>Looking at the comments on GameStop's website, there is confusion as to whether or not we would have early access.</p>
<p>If this was 343 studios way of trying to fill their pockets with even more money from loyal gamers, then this is a problem.&nbsp;Otherwise, what the hell was the point of releasing this Limited Collectors Edition 7 days before the game comes out.</p>
<p>As Youtuber Angry Joe's Corporate Commander says "Oh Goodie my Income Checks are here!"<br />

<p>The Gamestop early release was bad enough...when I found out that I could swap my digital download code for a physical game I thought it would be a win...boy was I wrong. &nbsp;After an hour with Rusty A. whom I'm not even sure spoke English in a chat session,
 it wasn't as easy as their own instructions stated...not only did they want the 25 digit code...the gamertag...email address..and mailing addrss...they wanted your full name...a receipt of the limited edition purchase...and as icing on the cake your console's
 serial number...none of which is detailed in the swap instructions.</p>
<p>Now I waited to get my xbox one specifically for the Halo 5 release and pre-ordered the new xbox one version with the hybrid drive. &nbsp;However, they WILL NOT COMPLETE the disc swap without a console serial number registered to you and it must be an xbox one.
 &nbsp;Fine. &nbsp;But spell it out in the instructions before I waste an hour of my life....Another bait and switch. &nbsp;This digital download mess is ridiculous especially with the size of these games! &nbsp;Who is going to pay if I bust data caps from my ISP...I have been
 with xbox since the beginning but now I feel like they are doing their best to screw folks over.</p>

<p>The point is to allow people to install their digital game in time for launch. Also those who got the console need time to set it up and then install the game.</p>
<p>Also I played $250 for the LCE. This early release saves me a lot of time. I don't have to waste the valuable launch time waiting in line at Gamestop for my $250 statue, when someone who only paid $60 has already been playing his digital copy for 3 hours.

<p>Firstly, I agree with the OP. &nbsp;$250.00 should allow for early access...I am in that same boat. &nbsp;That is a hefty sum. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, we need to stop freaking out about physical copies. &nbsp;As we PC gamers have always put it... "tell me, within the last 5 years, where you can find a decent collection of physical copies for a PC game?" You walk into a Gamestop and BestBuy and you
 have, at best, 5 different things to choose from...more, if you include the lame mystery games/ puzzles games for $5.00-10.00. The PC had all gone digital years ago. Everything is digital. ITunes, for&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>Face it...you want to PC game, you Steam and EA Origin. We live in a digital era. I agree, I miss physical copies being predominantly the thing. It's nice to have stuff in-hand, but then again, you should see the shelves of crap I'll never play again and
 aren't exactly a collectors memento, in the end. &nbsp;The only thing I disagree with, is stringent digital policies. When Xbox Live goes down, I can't play my digital downloaded games. Me and my wife each have an Xbox, and they often times serve as "bedroom Xbox"
 and "living room Xbox" so I can't have a specific Xbox set as Home Xbox, if I want to maintain save syncing abilities. This means, I also cannot play digital downloaded game offline. The error I get, is, "this game requires an internet connection, go to Settings
 &gt; My Home Xbox..." &nbsp;well, you can't go to "settings &gt; My Xbox," without Live being up. &nbsp;It's a Live option and it simply is not there when your network is down and/&nbsp;or Live services are down...so you're ***. Sony does not do this, you can play and share digital
 games amongst family on or offline. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thats what I believed. You preorder these collectible editions and then pay for them so they can just sit here an entire week before you get to even truly touch it. I had mine preordered through bestbuy and picked it up on thursday. I just finished installing
 it. And, came to this error. Now i wish i did wait a week. </p>
<p>This is a very disappointing purchase so far. The physical disc thing is a joke. I wouldve like one, but im not too disappointed with the digital download. But, they didnt think this through thoroughly enough for the dedicated gamers. Ive been a huge halo
 fan since the start and dedicated enough to preorder and purchase these collectible edition games, statues, controllers, consoles, and all the other accesories. But, it would be worth nothing if you couldnt truly enjoy the game right when you purchased it.</p>
<p>So F* 343 for their consideration to the true fans of this epic story and series. We deserve more for our time because we already spent the money.</p>

<p><span><span>I have to agree. Does anyone remember when we had to preorder games from a local store and had to line up outside at midnight and wait to have our copy handed out to us?
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Xbox 360 started out that way. In fact, you couldn't even install games to the 360's HDD when it released... it wasn't all that long ago.

 access</span></p>
<p><span>I have to agree. Does anyone remember when we had to preorder games from a local store and had to line up outside at midnight and wait to have our copy handed out to us?</span></p>
<p><span>The Xbox 360 started out that way. In fact, you couldn't even install games to the 360's HDD when it released... it wasn't all that long ago.</span></p>
<p><span>The extra money you paid was for a LE bundle... not early access.<br />
<br />
<span>It was convenient to have made the trip 7 days prior to prevent waiting in lines at the release, and I agree with that 100%. However, I had not paid attention to anything 343 or MS said about this and didn't have any issue
 until I seen, on Gamestop's App, that I could obtain the LCE 7 days early, creating the idea that I would have early access.<br />
</span><span>One could say "that's your fault," or Gamestop's fault, but this doesn't make up for any false incentive big corporations, like Microsoft and 343, create to lock people in, again, filling their pockets.&nbsp;Clearly
 they didn't care enough to make certain that everyone knew, otherwise I wouldn't have looked at my App and gained a greater amount of giddiness for my LCE.</span><br />
<span>Anyways guys thanks for all your posts,</span><br />
<span>I'm just going to push back my black rimmed ray-bans, take a sip of my Starbucks coffee, pull up my skinny jeans, rub my beard in my mom's basement, and enjoy this game, which btw is Amazing.</span></span></p>

<p>Hello Fellow gamers,</p>
<p>Got a question for you all about where do I find &nbsp;a "live" person to talk to for some resolution.</p>
<p>Here it goes, got the Halo 5 Limited collector edition on Oct 27, at midnight. Very next morning called number given to swap digital code for a physical copy. Advised by Microsoft "person" all good to go, if did not mind waiting for 3-4 days to receive disc,
 told him pre-ordered since April and would not be an issue. Only thing I got from him is an email that all good to go and case closed. No tracking, reference or information given.</p>
<p>9 days go by without any fiscal in the mail or whatever.</p>
<p>Tried replying to original email and bounced back as case closed. </p>
<p>Called Xbox support and told I need to contact Xbox by chatting with support. Spent over an hour explaining my situation, got my information again and would bring matter up to management and get an email within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Assuming it's about sending my disc out or whatever they had in mind. Person apologized as best as possible and would make it right.</p>
<p>2 days later, no email , no anything!!!</p>
<p>Again, went through the motion contacting Xbox support chatting with another person. Again explained the situation and she too stated it would be given an express directive and very sorry about it. Like stated in this forum, this time she got my address,
 s/n of unit, etc...surprised she did not ask for a dons sample.</p>
<p>She too stated all will be worked out and get this information to be reviewed and tsken card of promptly.</p>
<p>However, now I'm approaching 2 days without any resolution (game disc and dlc.</p>
<p>My god, it's been now 2 weeks without being able to play the game waiting for the disc since the digital code is inactive. What the heck do I have to do at Microsoft support to shake some executive's leg for help and solution.</p>
<p>If any of you can help me out or some moderator that had direct access to the power to be, please let them know.</p>
<p>Absolutely worst case situation I ever had to deal with here.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience and understanding reading this issue. Any help appreciated.</p>

<h2>            computer doesn&#39;t accept password unable to get past the signin page</h2>
                    I had the computer off for several days. I turned it on this afternoon and when it came to page for my password, I froze and tried to think what it was since i don't need to sign in with one on my laptop. I finally put in password and it kept saying it
 was the wrong password. I tried it several times and then I tried several other ones I have used.&nbsp; Then I went to my laptop and changed my microsoft password. It still won't accept it. Talked with chat tech and really didn't get any answers. I have unplugged
 computer and restarted it many times. Any suggestions to solving this problem without having to wipe all programs out and reinstall everything?

            I was unable to troubleshoot because it always went to prompt that I needed to&nbsp; put in password and then it said that it was wrong password. I am able to access microsoft on laptop so I know changed password works. I tried the troubleshoot and startup
 but it immediately goes to prompt that needs me to put my password in and the same thing when I tried to go to command prompt. So will I&nbsp; ever be able to get my computer back. How can I get around putting password in if I ever get onto desktop?

<h2>            &#34;Couldn&#39;t connect to the windows all agent service.  This problem prevents standard users from signing in as an administrative user&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>I have been unable to connect to the internet for a few days.&nbsp; I occasionally get the message.&nbsp; "Couldn't connect to the windows all agent service.&nbsp; This problem prevents standard users from signing in as an administrative user you can review the system
 event log for details about why system did not respond."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the fix on this blog and tried to follow the steps starting with running the command line as the administrator. I also noticed that every other person&nbsp;who has this is issue&nbsp;is on 8.0.&nbsp; &nbsp; I immediately get the message "C:\Windos\system32\cmd.exe&nbsp;
 -&nbsp; The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on other ways of correcting this issue. </p>

            To elaborate on this, should you verify an adequte network connection...be sure you’re signing into the same account each time you load up the game. Game saves are tied to the gamertag/microsoft account.

<h3> shadooowww  say:</h3>
<h2>            Infinite Restart Loop</h2>
                    Last night I connected to a Wi-Fi network and my monitor went back and my computer was forced to restart. It starts up goes to Starting Automatic Repair skips Diagnosing and goes to a Windows Defender Offline scan after that it says the PC has ran into
 a problem and is just collecting some info and will restart for me and it just keeps going through the loop. Is there a way to switch the scan to full scan instead of quick scan? Any help would be much appreciated. Also I bought the computer pre-built so it
 came with Windows 10 pre-installed.

<p>Start your System, then just after the Manufacturers logo disappears and Windows 10 tries to boot, press and hold the power button down for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down<br />
<br />
<strong>Do this Twice</strong><br />
<br />
On the third boot attempt, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment, from there you can access Startup Recovery, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of options available from the Recovery Environment, Startup Repair . . . etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - System Restore, see if you have a recent restore point you can revert to<br />
<br />
If you do not have a recent restore point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Startup Settings, click restart.<br />
Upon restart press 4 to boot into Safe Mode, if you can get into Safe Mode, backup your data, reboot and see if your system boots normally<br />
<br />
If all this fails go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC, choose to keep all your files and Apps<br />
This will re-install Windows 10 whilst keeping your data and applications<br />

 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Skype accounts were migrated to basic Microsoft accounts last October 2016. This is to align to Microsoft's campaign to unify log-in credentials across all Microsoft products and services. Although accounts were migrated, users
 still need to fully update their accounts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One possible reason why you might have a second account under your email address is you logged with the email without fully updating your account yet, resulting to a new Skype account. You can proceed with deleting your account,
 however, I just want to set your expectation that when you close your Skype account, the associated Microsoft account will also be closed as well. It is important that you go through the list of things to consider before you proceed with the closure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once an account has been marked for closure, there will be a 60-day waiting period before the account is completely removed from Skype's database. During these period, you can cancel the closure by logging in to the account.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already added couple accounts as child account, so I'm very much sure, I'm doing everything right, but now I just couldn't add any more more account as "Child", neither from computer it self, nor from web based account manager, when I trying to send invitation
 to Child account, I'm getting the message said "<span style="color: rgba(232, 17, 35, 1)">Please try again later.
 We can't do this right now</span>", when I try to it locally I'm getting similar message said "There's temporary problem There's a temporary problem with the service. please try again. if you continue to get this message, try again later." I had tried almost
 hundred times, and waited about one week, still does't work, please advice.</p>

            <p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a limit of 6 accounts per family, and each account can only be in a single family. &nbsp;What I would recommend in your case, is to set up two families, one under your wife's MSA and one under your own. &nbsp;If you do most of the online management, then
 you can also just create a second Microsoft account for yourself and set up a second family that way.</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you are saying is that Microsoft decided that a family is composed of a maximum of 6 accounts, which could be two adults and four children. Why such a limitation? Your proposed workaround of creating two families does not meet my needs because my
 wife and I both want to manage all of our six children accounts without splitting the family in two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absurd. Where can we complain and ask for this limitation to be removed?</p>

            Unless your device has a specific "HDMI In" port, you are not able to use HDMI hardware. Unfortunately, Laptops almost never have HDMI In ports.

<p>Hey Raul!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As previously stated most laptops&nbsp;commonly have HDMI outputs on them in order to display the contents of the laptop on a TV or other displays. The only way to get your Xbox One to show up on a screen would be if you have the option to switch the input to
 HDMI which is rare in laptop or desktop monitors. That being said you may contact the manufacturer of your laptop to see if they have additional options or review the Xbox Display compatibility here:

<p>But like others have said, you can us the streaming options in the xbox app.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's sad just how true it is.&nbsp; The state that some of these games get released in is disgraceful really.&nbsp; The worst had to be TDU2.&nbsp; And they actually did have a closed beta before release, and it still got released with so many bugs and glitches it
 was barely playable in alot of aspects.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then there's T10.&nbsp; If we know anything about what the game will be like in the first few months it's this.&nbsp; There will be atleast one big speed cheating glitch.&nbsp; Probably a repeat of the 400 mph cars we've seen for 3 straight releases.&nbsp; Then there will be
 a AWD glitch or tranny glitch or something.&nbsp; The leaderboards will be jacked and will need a wipe.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that won't happen until the stupid fake money credit glitches get fixed.&nbsp; Which will be another repeat glitch.&nbsp; And of course they will be all
 over their precious fake economy glitches like it matters to anyone except the forza tycoon players while the leaderboards and racing lobbies get dominated by the cheats.&nbsp; That's what we know based on history, which sadly, has and will repeat itself.</p>

<p>QFT.&nbsp; Which is why I'll be staying far, far away from Forza 4.&nbsp; I learned my lesson, how long will it take for Turn 10 to learn theirs?&nbsp; Longer than I have the patience for, that's for sure.</p>

<p>More crying about FM3? &nbsp;I never had any problems with FM3, and I played it for like ten months right from release. &nbsp;The bellyaching must be about online, where I really don't care. &nbsp;Offline played just fine and I put several hundred hours into it. &nbsp;In fact,
 I invested more time it FM3 than I have in GT5 (though I have spent quite a bit of time in GT5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which brings me to a point in Turn 10 and Forza's defense. &nbsp;With all the crying over FM3, GT5 turned out even worse. &nbsp;It had no shortage of bugs, and not just online-related issues but even issues that hurt singleplayer. &nbsp;As an illustration, one of the things
 GT5 boasted over FM3 was night racing, but they managed to break it by messing up how headlights work, resulting in headlights that shine horizontally and only horizontally even if your car is facing up or down a hill, rendering them useless on anything that
 isn't nearly flat. &nbsp;Another inconvenient bug that comes to mind is that if your save file exceeded a certain size it became corrupted and you could no longer play (or something along those lines).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a year and a half I've had to endure the whining about the highest-rated racing game of the generation, and a product that is superior to Gran Turismo 5, which came out a full year afterward. &nbsp;"But, GT5's physics are so much better!" &nbsp;Granted, GT5's
 driving physics are better, but unfortunately for the bellyachers and GT fanboys that one solitary aspect of the game isn't the only thing that matters. &nbsp;A game is a sum of its parts and many of GT5's parts are shoddy or missing altogether. &nbsp;As soon as FM4
 gets here I won't have any need of GT5, and it wouldn't matter how much DLC Polyphony might eventually get around to releasing for the game. &nbsp;Driving physics are nice but not by themselves.</p>
