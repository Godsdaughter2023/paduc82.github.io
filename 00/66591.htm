    <title>Code 43 on USB Controller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Code 43 on USB Controller</h2>
                    So a few days ago I was using my computer like usual and turned off my computer, like I always do, before I went to bed. Well yesterday I went to use the computer and none of the USB ports on the back of my computer were working. Well, fast forward to
 now, I found out that I have a device status of:<br />
"Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"<br />
It never actually told me there was something wrong with it until I went looking into the Device itself. The name of my USB controller is:<br />
Intel(R) 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller - 1C26<br />
<br />
The USB Controller on the front is the same as the back, except the last four digits are "1C2D." They're working fine (thank god, because my computer would be useless if not.) I have a desktop, and I always turn off the Master Breaker for my computer and everything
 because it never turns off the lights for my mouse and it's one of those LCD things so it's super bright. Which is why I am making this post. I read somewhere it works to just unplug everything for 10 or so minutes, but I've already done that and it doesn't
 seem to be working. I would also like to mention it works fine with I go into the BIOS part of the computer at start up, but that probably doesn't mean anything since we basically know that it's mostly a Windows thing rather than an actual problem with the
 entire USB Controller.<br />
Also, between shutting my computer off and turning it back on, I made no hardware changes, nor did the computer update. Which is why I am so puzzled as to why it borked all of the sudden, but oh well.<br />
<br />
What my main question is, is it safe to uninstall the driver? How do I install it back? Is there a better way to fix this?

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">The “<b><i>Error Code: 43 - Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems</i></b>” occurs when the device driver
 of a device notifies the operating system that the device has failed. This can occur either if the device hardware or device driver fails.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>The first and the best method that we can try is to uninstall and reinstall the device drivers for the device. You may uninstall and reinstall the USB
 Enhanced Host Controller drivers from the Intel or the computer manufacturer’s website. You may refer to this article, try the troubleshooting steps given in it and let us know the result.</font></font></font></p>

<p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know this can be confusing sometimes. But don't worry, I'm here to explain this to you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Skype Credit will go inactive after 180 days of no use. Make sure you place a call (outside your subscription, if you have one) or send a text every 180 days. We send two reminder emails, 7 days and 2 days before your Skype Credit
 becomes inactive.&nbsp;If you believe that you've been using your Skype credit, more likely, the email notification you received is for a different Skype account. Please check the email once again and confirm which account is being referred to then follow these
 instructions to reactivate your credit.</p>
<p>

We'll send you an email when it's done.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have questions.

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem?
<br />How long has this been happening?
<br />Have you installed any new software or hardware drivers since you started experience this problem? If so, what are they and are they designed for Windows 10?
<br />Have you checked the manufacturers website or contact support find out about compatibility, updates or support for Windows 10?
<br />Do you have a system restore point created you could go back to? 
<br />Does the problem occur in other user accounts on the computer?
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703, 1709?
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?
<br />
<br />I recommend you perform a repair upgrade:

</p>
<p>download the appropriate java setup file and save it on HD. Physically disconnect your computer from the internet, that's right -&nbsp; pull out Ethernet cable or disconnect wireless connection. Install java from setup file (note: no error message). Reboot (not
 sure if necessary but done anyway).&nbsp; Reconnect internet and your java is working.

            Hi. &nbsp;I believe its looking for an older version of Java. &nbsp;Try installing Java 1.6.x. &nbsp;That's the only thing that would work for the Legacy application I'm supporting when I had the exact same problem. &nbsp;After the install be sure to update your environment
 variables with the correct runtime path.

<p>Hi srisatya9618,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that Mojang team is providing a free copy of Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition for those who owned and played their first edition which is the Minecraft: Java/PC Edition. It's like a free upgrade offer for the game. However, getting the Minecraft: Java
 Edition for free if you purchased Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition is not applicable from their promotion. But, I would suggest that you raise this concern to
<strong><em><a href="https://help.mojang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mojang Support</a></em></strong> so that you can discuss this with them and check if their promotion can be applied in your case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need clarifications. We'd be glad to further assist you.</p>

<h2>            Can&#8217;t start South Park The Stick of Truth </h2>
                    <p>I can’t start the South Park The Stick of&nbsp;Truth that came bundled with The Fractured But&nbsp;Whole. It worked yesterday but now it asks me if I own this game or app. I redeemed the code that came with TFBW to own The Stick of Truth.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Contacted Xbox support and they say there is some problem starting the game and others are having the same issue but I can find no mention of it anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>What is odd is that if I search for the game in the Xbox store I see it but it shows the price as if I don’t own it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Error code is&nbsp;0x803f8001</p>

<h2>            MFC-8480-DN Duplex Printing</h2>
                    I have had my printer for probably over a year and have yet to get the duplex printing to work. A 2-sided page which I attempt to duplicate will never&nbsp;print&nbsp;on 2&nbsp;sides. It only prints the front page on one side and never prints the back page at all. It
 is a home networked printer and is otherwise working well.&nbsp;Please help me.

<h3> intellisatcorp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10-Right Click on Folder or File-RENAME FUNCTION IS GONE&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I had to uninstall my Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 major bugs- </p>
<p>1. Right clicking on Folders and Files , the <strong>Rename </strong>function has disappeared.</p>
<p>2. None of my Microsoft Office files created with Office 10 opened after Windows 10 installation. A generic corrupted file error messages come up for all these Office files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, there was a roll-back option and I uninstalled the Windows 10. I like to report that Role Back works.&nbsp; Very disappointed that the rename function has been removed and Office files cannot be opened.&nbsp;
</p>

<h2>            Run32dll.exe winbrand.dll and other errors</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to change audio devices on my PC (windows 7 64-bit) about 20 minutes ago and was given and error window with the title, "Unsupported 16-Bit Application" the text of the window said, "The program or feature "\??\C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe"
 cannot start or run due to incompatibility with 64-bit versions of Windows. Please contact the software vendor to ask if a 64-bit Windows compatible version is available."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon closing this window I was given another error window with the title, "C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe" the text of the window said, "The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system
 information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then thought of opening command prompt to use the sfc /scannow command. Normally to open command prompt I would press the start button and type cmd and select it. I did this however the search feature didn't work. I manually went to the command prompt
 location and opened it to be returned with another error window with the title, "cmd.exe - Bad image" and the text in the window saying, "C:\Windows\system32\WINBRAND.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the
 program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So naturally my next thoughts were to do a System Restore, I opened it up, waited for it to start up and was faced with yet another issue in the System Restore window saying, "System Restore does not appear to be functioning correctly on this system. A Volume
 Shadow Copy Service component encountered an unexpected errror. Check the Application event log for more information. (0x80042302)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to open the Event Viewer however that just failed to open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done everything that I can think of to fix these problems yet nothing thus far has worked. The only other thing I can think of doing is a complete re-install of windows which I would like to avoid doing if possible.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I however did a full clean reinstall of windows 7 as when I attempted to start in safe mode I was faced with a black screen with just the mouse cursor present. The same thing happened on normal boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I had issues when reinstalling windows. I got error 0xc00000e9 when trying to install from disc. I looked into things and ended up removing all connected hard drives bar one which I have now managed to install windows on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the problem was a virus and I advise all others that have faced the same problems as me to do a full clean reinstall of windows. You may lose a lot of documents however your computer will no longer be infected with the virus that may be present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes you can let Disk CleanUp remove any files it finds. The only exception would be if you were<br />
having issues you would not want minidumps and diagnostic files removed until those issues<br />
were resolved.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may refer to the below link and use the printer troubleshooter. Check if it lists and helps resolve
 issues: <br />
<strong><span>Open the Printer troubleshooter -</span></strong><strong><br />

<p><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Method
 2:</span></strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>You may also follow the below steps and check it helps:<br />
a. Go to Start, Control Panel and Administrative Tools. Double click on Services icon.<br />
b. Scroll down to the Print Spooler service and right click on it and select Stop. In order to do this, you need to be logged in as Administrator. At this point, no one will be able to print anything on any of the printers that are being hosted.<br />
c. Next you need to go to the following directory: C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS. Delete all the files in this folder. This will clear all print queues (it’s a good idea to first make sure there are no other print jobs being processed on any of the other
 printers on the server because doing this step will delete those jobs also).<br />
d. Now you can go back to the Services console and right-click and choose Start for the Print Spooler service!</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 3:<br />
</span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span>If the issue persists then you may refer to the below link and use the ‘Print Diagnostic Utility’ provided
 by HP. Check if it helps resolves issues -<br />

                    <p>Under what circumstances, if any, is it a good idea not to index anything on one's computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I ask this because if there were not a possible negative to indexing, then we would probably not have the option?</p>

            I index everything on my hard drive and everything on my external 1TB drive.
<br />Basically indexing TB of information will use more resources on your machine to keep that index current.
<br />I hear once an hour my external USB being indexed and at that time do notice a tiny lag on my machine.
<br />So the negative is resources being used more like CPU and disk. 
<br />But if your machine can handle it, then I don't see a problem doing it.
<br />That's my 2 cents :)

            Hi  Tampam,
<br />
<br />The most efficient method for indexing is as follows:
<br />
<br />When creating files on your PC use a proper folder structure and/or the pre-built library folders (Documents, Pictures . . . etc)
<br />
<br />Then set the Windows Indexing service to just index those locations
<br />
<br />This will mean, the index will be kept as small as possible and it will index and search faster.
<br />
<br />I have seen systems where the index file ranged from 10GB - 20GB, this is ridiculous and very inefficient!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows update and devices get affected, it could mean that the device drivers are incompatible with the current update. If the computer has a touchpad, then let us run the
<a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">find and fix problems with devices and hardware</a> and hardware troubleshooter to scan and have it corrected. If the issue persists, take note of the current update and perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/12415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system restore</a></strong>. Let us know which update/s installed on your computer and the outcome of the
 solutions you applied.</p>

<p>Resolved? Yes and no. Rolling back the update resolved all the USB and touch screens problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the update is ready to re-install itself. I got "Update and shut down" and "Update and restart" in my menu.</p>
<p>

<p>You need to put the updates on hold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings -&gt; Updates &amp; Security -&gt; Windows Update -&gt; Advanced Options (text link near bottom of screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Advanced Options screen you can "Defer" the updates or "Pause" the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the next update is available (presumably issues will be fixed you can un-pause updates)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Dell inspiron N7010,</p>
<p>Device drivers&gt;Network adapters&gt;</p>
<p>Atheros AR8152 PCI-E Fast Ethernet controller, Broadcom Virtual Wireless Adapter, DW1501 Wireless-N WLan half-mini Card, Microsoft Virtual WiFi MiniPort Adapter. (all drivers up to date and all devices are working properly)</p>
<p>computer connects via ethernet cable to Netgear WNR2000v2 (updated firmware) but will not connect to router wirelessly, Wifi is on for both router and laptop, detects network, "Windows was unable to connect to [networkname]". I have tried unsecured, WEP,
 WPA, WPA2 (both TKIP and AES) configured properties to same settings as my Vista Desktop with Wireless Dynex G card,&nbsp;(which works no matter what security setting), as well as my Android Tablet and My MotoDroid, however i am still unable to connect to internet
 wirelessly, purged ip info, ran netgear setup cd&nbsp;on laptop, nothing seems to work....Normally i would say the wifi card is defective, however it connects to my girlfriends network using same settings as my network. WPA2-personal (AES). Ran ipconfig /all media
 state disconnected for everything unless i plug ethernet cable in. Node type: hybrid, IP Routing enabled: NO, WINS Proxy enabled: NO. DCHP Enabled for all except tunnel adapter's. Its really frustrating!</p>
<p>Mac addresses:</p>
<p>WLAN adapter WN connection 2: C0-CB-38-03-5B-1E (MS Virtual WiFi Miniport adapter)</p>
<p>Ethernet adapter LAC2: 02-50-F2-00-00-01 (Broadcom Virtual Wireless adapter)</p>
<p>Ethernet adapter LAC: F0-4D-A2-4E-2F-70 (Atheros AR8152 PCI-E)</p>
<p>WLAN adapter WN connection: C0-CB-38-03-5B-1E (DW1501 Wirless-N WLAN Half-Mini Card).</p>
<p>called netgear and they were less than helpful although they said it was probably a conflicting IP setting (then&nbsp;wanted to charge me without guarantee)....please help me, I hate running cords!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are you working
 on Domain or Workgroup?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>How many
 computers are connected to the Router?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If there
 are multiple computers connected then how many are wired and how many are wireless?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does this
 issue occurs only with this computer or all the computers connected to the router?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if all the computers which are connected to router have the &nbsp;<strong>same workgroup name</strong>. To check whether your computer is
 on domain or workgroup follow the steps provided below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on start.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 on Computer</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 properties and check in the workgroup and domain settings if your computer is working on domain or workgroup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to check the link provided below which gives more information on setting up a wireless router and check if it helps in resolving the issue:</span></p>

<p><strong>Hi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maybe this can Help.</strong></p>
<p>Go over these steps and tell us where the breaking point is.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
------------------</p>
<p>Many Wireless cards' drivers also install the vendor's Wireless utility.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility thes Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility</strong> (WLAN Service) .</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong></em>If possible configure the Firewall correctly, otherwise totally uninstall it, and get rid of its residual processes
 to allow clean flow of local network traffic.</p>
<p>If the 3rd party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>3rd party Network mangers like Bonjour, and NetMagic can block local traffic too.</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Working TCP/IP stack should look this way.</strong></p>
<p>Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a></p>
<p>Description is the card manufacturing data.</p>
<p>Physical address is the card's MAC number.</p>
<p>The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).</p>
<p>yy should be from 0 to 255</p>
<p>zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.</p>
<p>The lease date should be valid to the current time.</p>
<p>*Note 1. IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</p>
*Note 2. There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>A message in the Wireless little Window that says Connected does not means that your are really have a valid functional connection.</strong></p>
<p>If everything above is OK you have to be able to connect to the Router.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to the Router means that you can enter the Router's core IP into an address bar of a browse, be able to connect, see, and configure the Router's menus.</strong></p>
<p>If it does not connecting to the Router, log from any computer that can connect to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast SSID is On,&nbsp; and try to connect with No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>Enable the Wireless security after you mange to establish a functional connection.</strong></p>

<p>Hi UltiGamer201,</p>
<p>As the others have said, You can use Paypal or Credit card Via the console itself or You can go to any Gaming store and Purchase a specific amount I think it goes $10 $15 $20 and so on (pretty much like the points system), In Australia we Have Ebgames (gamestop),
 Jb-Hifi and even some Grocery Store sell cards. </p>

    <title>Hacking, infected question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> red killmachine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hacking, infected question</h2>
                    
<p>This is my problem, I do not know if you guys have come accross hacked lobbies but the last time I played mw2 I was playing some ffa.&nbsp; The game ended and 4 people left, then the lobbie filled with a bunch of lvl 1 or 70's of various prestiges.&nbsp; I failed
 to pay much attention and let the game start.&nbsp; Just as the game started it ended with one person getting killed and while I was sitting in the lobbie a lvl one magically went to 70 and they reset.&nbsp; I quickly left the lobbie and reported all people who appeared
 to be cheating. </p>
<p>I have looked for an answer everywhere, but nobody can tell me how you get infected, and if I may have been from being in that lobbie.&nbsp; Has anyone been put into a hacked lobbie this way?&nbsp; Since the incident I have not played mw2 since, and worry about people
 hacking my account.&nbsp; Please put an end to hacking it has gotten out of control.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">People can't hack you unless you give out your account info so you don't have to worry about that. Also, when the host has said infections he can pass them along to all players he has come in contact with. It's like a disease
 and a pack of bolo monkeys. One contracts a disease and every other monkey they come into contact with becomes infected almost immediately. Just like high schoolers....</span></p>

<p>There used to be the 10th lobbies but I dont think the Jtags are doing this online anymore. Any infected lobbies (like the speed lobbies etc) are spread from host to host, but your console will lose the infection when you shut down or turn it off and reboot.
 My advise would be-- If you encounter ANY type of mod/hax lobbies, dashboard out, DO NOT just quit game, then maybe even shut down and reboot, but remember "dashboard" out of hax/mod games.</p>

<p>Just an FYI for those thinking about risking infections...</p>
<p>The enforcement team has made it official (there was an official post from Juliet on the suspension forum.) They are PERMANENTLY banning accounts using infections now. No longer are they issuing temporary bans because you have to activate the hacks yourself
 and can't "accidentally" be infected.</p>
<p>P.S. The new forums allowing these signature images really needs to go. The best thing about the old forum was how clean it was. Now it'll be a bunch of crap images taking up extra space and wasting bandwidth like the majority of other forums out there.</p>
<p>They just opened themselves up for a ton more abuse and moderator workload.</p>

<p>Can someone clarify this? &nbsp;I've heard two completely different versions of how one can become "infected":</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1 Simply entering a lobby with a host running an infection can infect YOUR Xbox and game, thus bringing down the wrath of the Xbox Permaban Police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2 The "official" Xbox Moderator statement goes along the lines of "<em>infections are not easily obtained and require the user to partake in several steps that make it quite clear as to what is going on. "</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p>So which is it? &nbsp;Merely entering an infected lobby, or performing "several (yet unspecified) steps"?</p>

<p>sadly the "official" statement they gave us is wrong, you can easily get infected if a host has a j-tag and can do all kinds of things. i have seen plenty of interesting things, which i obviously did not try to make happen.it was more obvious during mw2's
 lifetime. i have never seen anyone been banned because they joined a game in progress because someone had host and had speed lobbies or infinite noob-tubes etc.</p>

<p>I share my account with a few people and they are all decent players with good sportsmanship. Sadly, I had to ban one 'friend' because he talked a little too much trash. Anyways, I used to play a lot of barebones. (better at a lower level since you don't
 get your Stinger until level 30) Once in a FFA, I shot someone, and instead of +50 it said, "+43jjbliujh4bg3ih4" or something like that and I immediately leveled up to 70. I then dash-boarded and when I returned I was (thankfully) back to my original level.
 Unfortunately, a friend was playing a my profile few days later and when it happened to him, he left the room. So I'm pretty bummed because I have always played every game legit.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also a little worried, does my profile have a 'tag' that identifies me as having been infected, modded, whatever? I had just suffered through the first 25 levels of my 2nd prestige (the first 25 levels are the most annoying IMO) and then had to start
 over at level 1 again which stunk. I never wanted this, I never asked for this, All I did is score one kill. I don't want to create a new profile but I wish I could be dropped a level or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record, my k/d is like 9000 kills to 11000 deaths with a w/l or 700 losses to 500 (numbers rounded). I am not great at this game by most standards but &nbsp;enjoy the leveling up process and from time to time do experience a good game without any noticable
 player 'advantages'. </p>

<p>it is possible, and you may or may not get banned. you aren't supposed to share your account though, and you are solely responsible for and it's actions.</p>

<h2>            Mozilla Thunderbird Profile move to a new user log on &#40;same computer&#41; with Win 8.1 x64 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My son and I built a new gaming computer.&nbsp; I created a Mozilla Thunderbird profile (my email) under my son's Windows 8.1 Log on (admin priv). &nbsp; I created my own log on (admin priv) after we determined all was stable with the latest win 8.1 KB updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to move my T-bird email from his log on to my log on on the same computer.&nbsp; I've seen Mozbackup but am not sure what it would do if I have two of the same email addresses (one on each log on) on this computer.&nbsp; It seemed to get lost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there a way to cleanly move my profile (all (inbox) emails and archived emails) over to my new log on and remove all artifacts from my sons log on</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>

<p><span>Click on the Start Orb &gt; right click on Computer &gt; Choose Manage. Then go to Device Manager. Find Display Adapters and right click on it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Select the Driver tab and click on Update Driver. </span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn't make a difference, my suggestion would be to see if you can download codecs.<br />
<br />
Try the following web site for more information regarding this:<br />

<h2>            The alt&#43;tab popup won&#39;t go away&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I executed alt+tab to switch windows, and now that popup won't disappear. I suppose I can restart Windows--but is there any other solution?</p>
