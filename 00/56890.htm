<br />
- I also spoke to a nice Xbox rep via a support IM chat. Told her everything up to that point and we basically concluded to try testing with a wired connection when I could get an ethernet cable. We said I'd contact if I needed to again (which will be my next

<p><br />
So here what happened:</p>

<p>I logged on one day to play some Halo 5 (I hadn't played in ages). It worked fine. The next day it wasn't connecting and when I went to log into the wifi manually I encounted the error listed above:</p>
<p><strong>"Hardware Problem"</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Cannot Connect to your wireless network"</strong></p>
<p>It then presented a list of troubleshoot options, none of which worked (listed above)<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>I also noticed that in the advanced settings my network details were completely wrong. My Primary DNS for example was listed as "fec0:0:0:ffff::1%1" I corrected those details (IP, subnet mask, gateways, Primary/Secondary DNS).</p>
<p>I even made a static IP for my Xbox One specifically. It remembers my network details unless I shut it off my holding down the power button for 5-10 seconds.</p>
<p>After I looked via google searches for similar problems of which nothing worked. Eventually I found someone saying a factory reset worked for them. So I tried that option (though the one that retained my apps data so I didn't have to re-download it all.
 Would've taken forever.</p>
<p>It didn't work and I was stuck because I had to connect to internet to progress in setup/update. Though the next day (after talking to the rep mentioned above) I gave it&nbsp; another shot. For some reason it just randomly worked, no idea why. It connected. I
 set things up and played some Halo 5. I was cautiously optimistic that the issue was solved.</p>
<p>It wasn't. The next time I booted it up, same issue again. Looked through net again and found nothing new. until I found a post on the Xbox forums telling my to do the following:</p>
<p>Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
Here is a troubleshoot that all of you can try for your issues either signing in or not able to do something else on Xbox Live. :) Do this troubleshoot in the EXACT order, thank you.<br />
<br />
Go to Settings&gt;Remove Accounts and then remove the profile that you are currently using that won't let you sign in or do something else on the console.<br />
<br />
Then go to Settings&gt;Blu Ray &amp; DIsk&gt;Blu Ray&gt;Clear Persistant Storage<br />
<br />
After, go to Settings&gt;Network&gt;Network Settings&gt;Advanced Settings&gt;Alternate MAC Address&gt;Clear&gt;Restart<br />
<br />
I hope this works for you and let us know if it works please? Thank you very much :)</p>

<p>It worked again for a bit and I played some more Halo 5. I turned off the Xbox One, the next time I turned it back on, the problem was back.</p>
<p>Then I tried something I probably should've tried earlier, I disconnected the power cable to the Xbox One overnight. I turned it back on and I tried to connect to the wifi again and it came up with the same error. I tried a connection test just cause, and
 it said it failed. However when I backed out to the network settings screen it said it was connected with an open NAT type and&nbsp; was connected to Xbox Live. I played some Halo 5 and switched it off afterwards.</p>

<p>This brings me to today. I turned on the Xbox One and it was connecting again. I tried switching it off and pulling out the power cable for 5 minutes. When I switched it back on it worked again (after a connection test said it failed, then it said I was
 connected on the settings screen).</p>
<p>I played a round of the new Warzone firefight beta (which is awesome btw). After the game I lost connection to Live (and my network) while I was in the menus. (This si the first time it's disconnected while I was playing a game). However I recently saw that
 the Xbox Core services went down at roughly the time it stopped (little over an an hour ago). So it might be related to that? Not sure.</p>

<p>Just now I had my Xbox One's power cable unplugged&nbsp; while typing this, plugged it back in and turned it on. Went to choose wifi network, entered password and it said it the same message "Cannot Connect to your wireless network." I then went to connection
 test, it said "you cannot connect to the internet" or something along those lines. When I backed out to the network settings screen it said it was connected, with Open NAT type and subsequently connected to Live.</p>

<p>So it seems a sort of solution is to make sure I leave it unplugged every time I turn it off and manually do the steps I just said to make it connect. (which may not even work every time).</p>

<p>So with these details can anyone think of a way to make it connect properly automatically when I turn it on. It's a very round about solution that's gonna get annoying if I have to do it every time.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT: I haven't tried it on another router besides my current as I've not access to another, however I'll try to find another for troubleshooting purposes.</p>

<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>I use the 2.4Ghz band. My Xbox doesn't (and never has previously) detect the 5Ghz band. No idea why.</p>
<p>I've updated the firmware already (one of the first things I did). </p>
<p>I'll check the WPS thing after work today, thanks for replying again.</p>

            <p>Do you differentiate the SSID for 2.4 and 5Ghz respectivily?</p>
<p>How far away from your wireless router do you have your console placed?</p>
<p>5Ghz is preferable over 2.4Ghz. If you're surrounding air is suitable for 5Ghz, then keep the 2.4Ghz to cordless phones and microwave ovens.</p>

<p>Yes, we have a 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz as seperate wifi SSIDs to connect to e.g. My PC and mobile phone is on the 5Ghz one and Xbox One/some other stuff is connected to the 2.4Ghz one.</p>
<p>My PC picks up the 5G signal just fine and it's less then a metre from my Xbox One (not cuasing interference though, I checked.)</p>
<p>Xbox One is about 10 metres away directly. Though the wall of my room is in the way. Though it's not really thick or anything and it makes no difference to my phone or PCs connection to it and Xbox Ones wireless card is pretty strong So I doubt it's distance.</p>

            <p>The troublesome with the higher RF signals (e.g 5 GHz/shorter wavelength) in comparison to the lower range RF signals (e.g 2.4 GHz/longer wavelength) is that the signal will attenuate much faster as the signal penetrate through different physical obstacles, for example concret- or brick wall/floor/ceiling. The main cause to this has to do with distance, as the transmitting- and the receiving end antennas are less effective at receiving RF energy with higher frequency. This will cause shorter range and a smaller coverage area for the 5 GHz range in comparison to 2.4 GHz range. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your wireless clients shouldn't cause any conflicts part from being a member in the neighboring, and often crowded air, and where everyone wants to be THE device that talks the most (luckily there're rules that prevent this from happening) . It's those devices, or antennas, that transmits with enough power and operates at the same RF (channel) as your wireless router (which in this particular case is an accesspoint/wireless accesspoint) that will interfere with your wireless clients (PC/Smartphone/Xbox etc.). Such a signal can be generated from a cordless phone/microwave oven/wireless headset (digital RF transmitter).</p>
<p>It's not that easy to compare one wireless client to another due to different wireless NICs/drivers, but do you have the option to move your console any closer to your D6200, to see if it can pick up on the 5 GHz SSID.</p>
<p>Can you also take a closer look at my initial post, as there're a couple of question you never gave an answer to.</p>
<p>In my opinion, I wouldn't try with an additional router, as this would only require more configuration from your end. Two NATs don't play nice to applications that needs to traverse through these devices.</p>
<p>Have you had the chance to connect your console with wired yet?</p>
<p>Keep us posted.</p>

<p><strong><br />
</strong>Questions from your original post:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Since the D6200 wireless performance is dual band (2.4 Ghz, 5 Ghz), what band do you connect your console to?</strong></p>
<p>2.4Ghz</p>
<p><strong>If you have enabled WPS (Wi-Fi Procted Setup) on your wireless router, make sure you disable this feature and go with manually configured settings.</strong></p>
<p>It's disabled and already manually configured.<strong> <br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you connect your console to the 2.4 Ghz radio band, what channel and mode do you have configured?</strong></p>
<p>Channel 11 (I've switched around to almost all different ones at random and none seem to help particularly better then any others).</p>
<p><strong>If the D6200 is not running your ISPs custome firmware, visit Netgear.com and make sure your D6200s version of firmware is up-to-date.</strong></p>
<p>Already updated firmware from them.</p>
<p><strong>I'm not sure if you used a different naming convention for what I'm about to suggest, but make sure your console's power setting is set to Energy-saving.</strong></p>
<p>It's actually not set to that, forgot to try that (though there may be something to that, I'll explain more down below).</p>
<p><strong>It seems as your D6200 has IPv6 enabled. It may be that your ISP is tunneling IPv4 inside of IPv6. Make sure there're no IPv6 DHCP server operating on the D6200.</strong></p>
<p>I have IPv6 disabled in my settings.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Now, for what I mentioned in my answer to the Energy Saving Mode question:</strong></span></p>
<p>I mentioned before that unplugging my Xbox One's power cord and leaving it out until I next play it seems to make it work perfectly. I just switched it to energy saving mode just now (it was previously on Instant On mode.)</p>
<p>Knowing this I'm guessing Instant On mode keeps some sort of cache of system info for the wifi settings to have it boot faster? I assume it was keeping the wrong info somehow which wasn't letting it connect properly.</p>
<p>Would you happen to know exactly what info Instant On holds onto that may be the thing *** it up?</p>

            <p>I'm not sure which sleep mode triggers Instant-On, but a wild guess would be hybrid sleep mode. And you've probably guessed it already, but Instant On is actually an application (what else).</p>
<p>[quote user="Awsomonium"]Knowing this I'm guessing Instant On mode keeps some sort of cache of system info for the wifi settings to have it boot faster?[/quote]Not only are those values cached to resume quicker from its current state, but also to maintain connectivity during this mode.<br /><br />[quote user="Awsomonium"]I assume it was keeping the wrong info somehow which wasn't letting it connect properly.[/quote]"it", as your Xbox One, or your wireless router? One thing is for sure, something went corrupted during this mode.<br /><br />If you've already have the latest version of firmware for your router, try downgrade your router's version of firmware to an older one. The most recent version of firmware may sometimes cause more issues than it's supposed to.<br /><br />Keep us posted.</p>

<p>Hey there, i just found this thread after a long search for answers, and while it doesn't really provide an answer, at least i finally found someone with the exact same problem i have. I too have the seemingly random "can connect/can't connect"-issue when
 i boot up my Xbox One. And i also tried almost all of the above steps, which didn't work for me too. The "solution" so far for me is to power off my router, wifi extender (this doesn't seem to be absolutely necessary though) and Xbox and then plug them all
 back in. If i'm lucky, this works, if not, i have to repeat everything until it does. There doesn't seem to be any predictability on when this occurs and why, though most of the time when it worked one time, it will work for the rest of the day if i don't
 manually reset the router or unplug the Xboxs power. Then the next day (overnight we have the power switched off for all our devices) it may or may not fail to connect to my wifi again... :(</p>
<p>My router (as well as my wifi extender) is from Netgear, too, though it's another model: WNR2000v5 and WN3100RP (extender)</p>
<p>Is it maybe possible that Netgear routers sometimes have problems with the Xbox or the other way round?</p>
<p>Whatever, i just wanted to drop a note that i too have this problem and i strongly hope there will be a solution to it, as it is quite annoying when i just want to play something for half an hour and then because of this i first have to spent 10 minutes
 running around my home, unplugging and reconnecting devices instead... :/</p>

 . I use Autocad and find all the pen colours have changed. Please suggest how to get back to the original colours &nbsp;

            Hi Ken, 
<br />
<br />Let’s try the easiest thing first. 
<br />
<br />Click start and type “Device Manager” - and select it from the list of results.
<br />
<br />Expand Display Adapters, then right-click on your video driver and select Update Driver. 
<br />
<br />Select Search automatically for updated driver software.
<br />
<br />Also, What’s the make and model of your PC? Let me know and we’ll go from there. 
<br />- C

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>1.Which operating system is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>2.Was this printer working on the computer previously?</p>
<p>3.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</p>
<p>4.What is the error you get when trying to install the printer drivers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the windows 7 compatibility center, the printer is compatible with windows 7:

    <title>Missing files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> powerjo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing files</h2>
                    
<p>For the past 2 days I have been trying to solve a mystery, albeit to no avail. I was doing some genealogy research on Ancestry.com. When I found a document of interest, say a census record,&nbsp;I would&nbsp;try to save it to my computer. I browse to the folder I
 want to save it in and execute the save routine. It appears to save the file. Then I open Windows Explorer and browse to the folder&nbsp;but I don't see the file I just saved. I count the files that are visible and then look at the properties of the folder and
 it reports the number of files I counted. I go back to Ancestry.com and repeat the process but when I try to save it again I am told that the file already exists, do I want to replace it? In the view of the folder contents I can see files that I saw in Windows
 Explorer plus the files previously saved from Ancestry.com.&nbsp;Something similar&nbsp;happened today in a completely different context. I was copying some jpegs from a&nbsp;shared network harddrive, music related files .. the album covers that WMP downloads when you play
 music just ripped to&nbsp;the music folder, and again I am told that the file already exists. When I look in the folder I don't see them. In both cases it jpeg files that seemed to be invisible to Windows Explorer. Yes, I did do a search from the root down. Didn't
 find the files I was looking for.<br />
<br />
My operating system is Vista Premium Home (fully updated).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am not computer illiterate. I have years of experience going all the way back to DOS 2.0&nbsp;as well as years of experience as a Senior Systems Engineer and Network Consultant, but only 2 months experience with Vista during which I have developed a "cursing"
 knowledge of it at best. Can someone please enlighten me? At the end of&nbsp;a long&nbsp;day I just want things to work the way I expect them to work. That's not too much to ask, is it?</p>

    <title>My first impressions of Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            My first impressions of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I only been using Windows 10 for a few hours and so far my impressions of this OS is quite poor. I see many thing already in it that I absolutely hate and have to question what were they thinking and how some of the general pop is okay with it. I will try
 going into details into why I say I like or hate something.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Look of Windows 10</strong> - What I mean by this is the icons, theme, and the overall feel is as if it was developed for a child. The icons and theme to me lack&nbsp;the feel of the future and more of reminds me of the past. Almost like it was themed
 around a paint by number. Something I feel are flat and too plain. I felt the same about it when they came out with Windows 8 and they continued with it into 10. I guess this is more of a style opinion and I did love the glass effect on Windows 7, along with
 the ability to have transparency around my folders and my web browsers. The other side of this is the themeing options. I feel they dropped the ball on this and limited to a extreme way on how to personalize this OS to look. The color pallet they give you
 is very pastel in color and the options of the colors is very limited. Me, personally like to have a dark theme with dark borders around my web browsers, but instead, it is a very light border. No blacks or really dark grays. To me, it is almost like they
 went half **** on it and got to a point where they were like, "This is good enough", and left it at that.</li><li><strong>Security</strong> - No offense to people out there that love Cortana, I think its a great thing they are attempting to do and is a nice feature, but I refuse to use it because of the security flaws with it, along with many of the apps that come
 pre-installed and turned on. To me, my first impression is this OS is just a way for Microsoft and other companies, (I am guessing the ones that pay enough), can get their hands on all your information and use it trying to push product down your throats. It
 also gives them a way to monitor you without you actually knowing. They may say they are "Only" gathering this information to better help them and their partners, but honestly, only an idiot would believe that. On top of that, with all this information being
 transferred back and forth, you don't believe this opens doors up for hackers? Me, I would love to use Cortana with the voice controls, but I wont if it is at expense of security and personal information being sent out to god who knows. What I been reading
 is I need all this **** turned on to send information to Microsoft and its partners if I want to use Cortana which from that info they can "improve" Cortana. If that's the case, why not give a option to share the info or not and still be able to use Cortana
 as it has been demonstrated in all the Windows 10's ad's.</li><li><strong>Ease of use</strong> - I honestly have to say that this system is harder to use than Windows 7. Trying to find controls like setting up the mic and adjusting the sound has been greatly diminished. But again, this can be from personal use because
 I always hated that "Category" view they they are so set on using. But other aspects of Windows 10 seems to bloated and filled with **** that is completely unnecessary and should not be loaded by default, but I guess those are those "partners" they have mentioned
 that needed to know what sites you go to and your activities that you do on your PC. But, heck, I can remember as far back as Windows 95 where they had **** on their that I just uninstalled, so this is nothing new.</li><li><strong>Microphone Boost</strong> - This is just an annoyance, but I noticed after talking to a bunch of people that also have Win 10 installed, that there is no longer a "Boost" option to bring up the volume of your Mic. I noticed this when I was configuring
 my mic on the PC, it was really low and kept telling me that my mic was too quiet. So I ended up going into my Recording Device and brought the level up to 100%, and when I went back and watched the graph, it still was quite low. On Win 7, I did not have this
 issue and never actually need to use the boost, but it was their if I needed it. It just feels they stripped out a bunch of functions that may be needed by some. This here is not a big deal, but more of a disappointment more than anything.</li><li><strong>Windows Updates</strong> - This is a pretty big one for me. From what I have been reading,&nbsp;the Home edition and the Pro edition do not allow the user to easily control how updates are delivered and installed. So far, all I can see is in the UI of
 the "Settings" app, the user can only defer / postpone updates, but there is no option to disable them entirely, check for updates manually and selectively install them. To me, this is a huge disappointment and a really BAD move on their part. I really hope
 they fix this in the near future.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>These are just a few of the large gripes I have with Windows 10 thus far. There are things I do like about it, like Cortana, but, my gripes out weigh the positive things I seen in this OS and I hope maybe, some of the things if not all the things I mention
 get addressed in later builds. Until then, I will recommend to all my friends and people in the communities I am on to be cautious and make sure they fully go through and configure their settings in the OS.</p>

</p><p>I have to agree with you on the looks as well, all the icons now seem really cartoony to me and feel like a little bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>of a step back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you I would like to use the Cortana "app" as well but won't due to sharing information with several different people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some things I do like about Windows 10 though, I do like the layout of the start menu and in gaming performance</p>
<p>on my setup it seems to run games a lot smoother than Windows 8.1</p>

            There is a bunch I do like about Windows 10 as well, but I figured there were enough videos and postings of people saying what they liked, and enough promo video's made showing the highlights, so I would just stick to what is, well what I would consider,
 somewhat major issues that I think they need to address.

            <p>i don't know about the last one you said corpse about the windows update being a bad thing i think microsoft is trying to idiot proof their system for everyone so even lazy morons out there who dont want to upgrade will be forced to doing so. That way microsoft
 and other vendors won't be bombarded with asking the typical question to the user if they updated their operating system or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your right about cortana and the information being sent. That to me is a big security hole. i barely use cortana if any. i still think its a nice feature to have though. But your right about the categories on the menu i can't stand it. I personally liked
 windows 7 menu alot better than windows 10. But i am glad they finally got rid of internet explorer after all these years.</p>

</p><p>The ability to download and install automatically has been there for a while, maybe since the beginning. What I am annoyed with is there is no longer a way to turn off that feature. &nbsp;Me personally, I don't want to be playing a game, or in the middle of transferring
 files when Windows decides to download and install files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I like to know exactly what files are being updated, and have the ability to pick and choose which to update and when to download. Windows 7 offered the ability to do that, or you could have it just automatically download and update, like you were
 talking about. So technically, the "idiot proofing" they are doing, has been already there, but for me and others to loose the ability to pick and choose, just irks me.</p>

            <p>good writeup guys, and I think you are on target with most of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for me, I still like it but have turned all the **** off and trying to use it for what works well in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you can disable the windows update service and that should stop your updates in the middle of a game, but that is a hell of a way to run a railroad.&nbsp; gone forever however is the ability to pick and choose updates.&nbsp; I just disabled the service and
 it did seem to break Windows update so you can stop it, but you just can't pick and choose any more.&nbsp; you could also probably break the DNS to it in the hosts file if you really wanted to.&nbsp; Maybe they need a button to disable Windows update for 4 hours or
 something for gamers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this was a real risk for Microsoft to push an entire OS update out via Windows update, and looks like there are lots of borked PCs out there as a result.&nbsp; But I bet the percentages of failures are very small, a few thousand out of many million is still almost
 "five nines".</p>

            <p>I took a look at that. That looks to be more of remove the **** after the fact. Not really what I was looking for. I have found tutorials out there that actually shut down the update services altogether, but, if you want to run the updates, you need to do
 all the steps in reverse which can be a bit of a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link on how to do it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/turn-off-windows-update-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="The Windows Club">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/turn-off-windows-update-in-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8013-windows-update-automatic-updates-enable-disable-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ten Forums (Windows 10)">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8013-windows-update-automatic-updates-enable-disable-windows-10-a.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the replies also to the article is another way to turn it off. But overall, they really need to go back to how it was, giving people the option. I believe this was just a total bone head move on their part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for them pushing the whole OS pushed out as if it was an update, was a bad move on their part. Fortunately I didn't have that issue because I downloaded the Windows 10 tool and upgraded VIA that and installed the OS that way. Once I did that, I made sure
 I went to <strong>Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Activation</strong> and made sure my Windows 10 was verified. But even doing that I still had an issue, so I burned the OS as an .ISO file onto a DVD and re-installed through that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the Windows 10 Tool here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows 10 Tool">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One issue I still have once and a while is some how either my "Search" gets deleted or it gets corrupted, but my cleanup program will tell me that there are left over files and if I want to clean up the rest. If I see that message, I know I need to restore
 to an earlier time and some how that app got damaged. I have a feeling that it is being corrupted or what ever with the use of Advanced System Care, but, on the other hand I don't think it is because its only happened twice and I have used ASC every day since
 I installed Windows 10 last week. So I will keep an eye to see if I can find the true culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I like to see is Microsoft actually have someone reply to this thread, maybe actually give some feed back if any of these things may/will get addressed.</p>

    <title>Strangers on my network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curiousvt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strangers on my network</h2>
                    I connect using a broadband connection. My computer is a desk top using windows 7 premium. This is the second time this has happened where I lose my connection and when I sign back on there are multiple computers and devices using my network. One device
 was identified including an email address, 2 routers, 6 computers and 6 media devices. I did call my Internet provider and they suggested the problem was my computer.
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How are these total strangers appearing on my network? I live in the country and there is a minimum of 1000 to 5000 feet between homes. I thought my system was secure. There was also a message this evening saying another computer in my network and my computer
 were sharing an IP address? I do have a router but it is not hooked up. I would appreciate any insight as what is actually happening and do I need to be concerned.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            All the strange computers showing up on my network are showing their IP addresses which I followed to 2 locations. One is the nearest town which is Bridgewater, the other location is Halifax same street location, the routers Linksys11103<br />
DIR-855L<br />
DIR-615<br />
will not identify their location.

            <p>It seems like they have turned all their clients into peers, but this shouldn't be possible behind your router with NAT traversal. You have a local DHCP assigned IP address that is local to your DIR-615 router.&nbsp; And that router itself has it's own IP address
 on the ISP's network.</p>
<p><br />

<p>It seems like the ISP is sharing all your connections.&nbsp; I don't know how this could be possible.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do about it?&nbsp; One other thing,. There was one stranger computer Pauline/tina that included an email address so I wrote to her. Have not heard anything back. So if I can see her email address which is a Hotmail address does that mean
 my computer and email is visible to others?</p>

</p>
<p>How much information is possibly being shared? Is it possible that someone else has access to my pictures or files? Who should I speak with?</p>

    <title>Windows Firewall&#58; inactive settings are displayed with bold - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tzon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Firewall&#58; inactive settings are displayed with bold letters</h2>
                    <p>When a third party firewall program is installed on Windows, it automatically disables the default firewall or takes control over its settings, without letting the user make any further changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, there is a small bug with that in Control Panel, affecting Windows 7, 8 and 8.1: The settings that are no longer available appear<strong> bold
</strong>instead of grayed out, as they should. See the images bellow for bold inactive settings, and normal grayed out inactive settings.</p>

            <p>Hello Tzon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description and the screen shot which you have provided you are trying to convince us that the options which are bold under Windows Firewall settings should be greyed out and it is a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to inform you that, A firewall isn't the same thing as an antivirus or antimalware app. Firewalls help protect against worms and hackers, antivirus apps help protect against viruses, and antimalware apps help protect against malware. You need
 all three. You can use Windows Defender, the antivirus and antimalware software that's included with
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span>, or you can use another antivirus and antimalware app. As in your case you have Norton on your system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing any third party antivirus software on Windows 8.1 is not recommended by Microsoft. However, its your computer and you know what to install and what not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A firewall is software or hardware that helps prevent hackers and some types of malware from getting to your PC through a network or the Internet. It does this by checking the info that’s coming from the Internet or a network and then either blocking it
 or allowing it to pass through to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For knowing more about Windows firewall, I would suggest you to go through the article mentioned below and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Windows Firewall from start to finish
</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information provided is helpful. Do let us know if you have any more concern related to Windows. We will be more than happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>When I say "bug", in this case, I mean a problem of reason - logic. Since grayed out has always meant 'disabled', bold is not the correct way to show 'disabled' or 'unavailable'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the first time I hear "Installing any third party antivirus software on Windows 8.1 is not recommended by Microsoft". I understand Microsoft supporting its product, but I've never heard such an announcement. Windows Defender has one of the worst results
 in antivirus protection in every review available, either official (AV-Test.org, Virus-Bulletin, online computer magazines) or unofficial from user reviews in YouTube or other sites.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your experience and thought about Microsoft and Windows Defender. If you think third party security software is better than Windows defender then please use it and keep your computer safe from spyware/malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a by design feature of Windows defender that as soon as any third party security software installed on system it will be disabled. As we can't have two Security software running at the same time. So, one need to be disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information provided is helpful. Do let us know if you have any more concern.

<h2>            Low Sound level when viewing movies online</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have an Asus EeePC netbook model 1005P, running Windows7 Starter, SP1, with Internet Explorer 10, and I am using headphones.
</span></p>
<p><span>(The headphones do not have their own volume control.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When movies are accessed online, the sound is too low even though the Volume is set to maximum both in the player and on Windows audio slider.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the Mixer is accessed the Audio level for Internet Explorer is set to maximum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Control Panel Sound, Communication tab, is set to “Do nothing”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What can be done to give a decent level of volume for online movies?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your previous message you linked a&nbsp;Flash Player support document which applies only to getting the Flash Player to function and I am already using the 32-bit version recommended in that document as my System is 32-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this your current response you suggest running Internet Explorer without Add-ons, which disables Flash Player because, I assume it requires the Java add-ons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, using the logic of your advice, I disabled: </p>
<span>
<p>"RealPlayer Download and Record Plugin for Internet Explorer", </p>
<p>which has resolved the problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Open Internet Explorer &gt; Tools &gt; Manage add-ons &gt; "Currently loaded add-ons" button active &gt; Scroll down (right side) and click on:
</p>
<span>
<p>"RealPlayer Download and Record Plugin for Internet Explorer"</p>
<p>If this Add-on is currently Enabled, once selected, this Add-on's&nbsp;"Disable" button is displayed (bottom).</p>
<p>Click its "Disable" button.</p>
<p>Click "Close".)</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>Well done, and sincere thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p>I hope this may assist others with the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Caution:</p>
<p>It would NOT be appropriate to mark as answer your response as it is currently worded, since following its advice disables Flash Player.</p>
<p>Please could you consider posting&nbsp;a further response with the actual solution (to disable the RealPlayer Add-on) and I will mark it as Answer.</p>

                    <p>Hej, har problem som många andra att gummi gropen på min elite kontroll släpper, och eftersom att det inte verkar finnas att köpa nya så tycker jag ni får lösa det här på nått sätt när man har betala dyra pengar för kontrollen, som jag trodde skulle hålla
 längre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If rotation lock is grayed out or missing on your device, sometimes you just need to rotate it to portrait mode. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + I</strong> on your keyboard and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>On the Display pane, find <em>Orientation </em>and choose <strong>Portrait</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Your device should automatically switch to portrait mode. After performing the steps above, we recommend resetting your device to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us if you need further assistance. </p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open Start Menu, Search bar or Action Center on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I can't open the start menu, action centre, search bar or right click on any icons on the taskbar on windows 10, I've been running W10 for just under a year and haven't encountered this problem before. I have classic start menu installed to change the icon
 but I've&nbsp;had it for around 6 months and I haven't had any problems with it. I've tried booting into safe mode but the same thing happens, I also ran the start menu troubleshooter but I keep getting this message "Required Application are not Installed Correctly,
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Not Fixed". The most recent app I installed in Stardock Fences but I don't think that would affect the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current installed OS is Windows 10 Home, Version 1607, Build 14393.351</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with a Lenovo notebook with only a 30GB harddrive for the OS and I've done a Repair reinstall.
</p>
<p>Only there are now only 2.22GB free of the 30GBs and I need to install a copy of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done this on other notebook laptops and was able to get the free space up to 13 GBs using "Disk Cleanup". This is because Disk Cleanup on these computers offered to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">"</span><strong>Clean
 up</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;system&nbsp;</span><strong>files</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">".
 I was then able to delete&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">"Previous&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;installation(s)."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to use Disk Cleanup on this option to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">"</span><strong>Clean up</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;system&nbsp;</span><strong>files</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">"
 is not available.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Is there a way to delete&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">"Previous&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows</strong><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>&nbsp;installation(s)."
 on this Lenovo&nbsp;anyhow. If so how would I do that?</span></span></span></p>

            Hey John.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Just to be sure:  Did you run Disk Cleanup until it gave it's first report, which is only when you have the chance to choose System Files and it runs the scan again to include them?  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/d...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can uninstall c:\windows.old using CCleaner, or also by taking ownership of the folder first before deleting it:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />Also delete any Upgrade staging files in C drive starting with WS, uninstall the Windows Upgrade Advisor in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi John
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a tiny free utility called PatchCleaner
<br />
<br />Run that and hopefully it will clear enough space on your hard drive for you . . .
<br />
<br /><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/patchcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/patchcleaner/</a>
<br />
<br />If not, Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove . . .
<br />

<h2>            Xbox One original no longer repaired by Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>i own a Xbox One, original model, and tried to open a repair request (out of warranty), but was informed that is no longer possible to request a repair to this model because it was discontinued.</p>
<p>I wonder if I buy a Xbox One S or a Xbox One X will I be able to request any repairs if needed after warranty is over.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update with your reply. Sadly, it is correct that the Xbox One Original console is no longer supported for out of warranty repairs for your region (Brazil); however, the newer models, the Xbox One S and the Xbox One X, are still supported
 for out of warranty repairs at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps a bit more.</p>

You may need to perform a back up to make sure that your emails and contact won't wipe out. For information, please refer to this link:<br />

            Hi Dan,<br />
<br />
Yes, based on how Windows Live Mail is designed, if you create a back up of a particular file, it will retain all its properties upon recovery. That would mean that you will be creating a back up of corrupted files or e-mail messages.<br />
<br />
Do you still have the target&nbsp;e-mail messages stored in your online account?<br />
<br />
We highly recommend that you check for other alternatives for creating a back up file befor perfoming procedure.<br />
<br />
Regarding your second question, as far as Windows Live Mail is concern, it stores files within your computer and not through a cloud system.<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks!<br />

            I do not understand what "my online accout" is for stroing email messages.&nbsp; When Windows Live Mail tried to "recover" the messages, it brought back a bunch of folders and emails - but they are corrupted.&nbsp; It appeasr as tho I have lost all this data due
 to some glitch in Windows Live Mail - that is reallly bad if true.<br />
<br />
What should I do, step by step, as specifially as you can be?<br />

            Hi <span>Daniel Silvestri,<br />
<br />
The previous moderator&nbsp;asked you to check if&nbsp;the&nbsp;folders/emails&nbsp;were still at&nbsp;your online account because most of the email provider has the option to leave a copy to the server once the email were downloaded to your Windows Live Mail.
As for now, please confirm if all the corrupted messages from your Windows Live Mail&nbsp;were still at your online account.<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks,&nbsp;<br />
