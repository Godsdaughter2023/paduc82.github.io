    <title>New 8 series skype both MS 7 and 10. A&#47; cannot change phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogerinfrance  say:</h3>
<h2>            New 8 series skype both MS 7 and 10. A&#47; cannot change phone numbers, b&#47; cannot delete phone numbers, c&#47; get a whole load of people when I try to add anything.</h2>
                    <p>I have again tried the new and appalling skype and cannot delete incorrect phone numbers, cannot add phone numbers, and when I do try I get a whole load of those I do not need or want!. If you do insist on changing to version 8 then I will scale down my
 use and as I find alternative numbers and also my mobile is now doing all texts for nothing I shall just reduce until it is uneconomic. You help service just sends you to here and as I pay for a service I expect it. So as soon as you stop allowing use of version
 7 .41.0.101 then you will progressively start losing yet another client. Are you really listening? You patently are not if you decide to run with only version 8. I have exactly the same problem on my 7 computer. I am not worried about the color of the thing
 I just need it to work. If you like I can send a screen shot of the lack or problems as I can email myself and forward to you. Do yo want clients?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS the selection below is rank, where is problems for altering addresses or with two types of windows.</p>

<p>Tell me, why is it communication companies all FU just because they do not listen. At one time I used to be able to contact MS/skype or just Skype and on more than one occasion had found serious gremlins, one meant I was in direct touch with a very senior
 person at microsoft escalations. I have in the past dealt with very high ups in Belkin, TRUSTe, and many other corporations. Now big corporations are getting to big to listen. For example, I cannot contact yahoo over a fraudulent item being advertised through
 them, namely&nbsp; something called CoolAir possibly for $89 This item has been reported to UK fraud and the company selling the item is in I think Estonia. However Yahoo is too big now to be "contacted" and the lower downs do not want to rock the boat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS probably will not do ought and just totally destroy Skype. British Telecom went the same. It is the same with all empires. The British empire is just about set to finish, scratch the union jack and watch Scotland and Eire / NI amalgamate and be on their
 own.&nbsp; Maybe not in my lifetime but just watch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have before tried to get Skype to listen but they got the wrong end of the stick over this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well here we are several days along since i contacted skype / microsoft and no response. One still cannot alter the telephone numbers of clients, one still has problems adding new numbers and one is still offered loads of those I do not know want etc. and
 still no real response from Microsoft land.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a problem with say my VPN supplier they admit it and fix it. MS these days has a ton of sand shipped in and stick all the staff's head in it!!!<br />

<p>when i got banned, i made a new account. so naturally, i had to buy live since my other accounts live cant carry over (i lost 3 months worth). i decided to buy the 20% off 1 year gold membership, which also came with fable 3. i was supposed to wait 6-8 weeks
 for the email confirming that the game was being shipped, but i never got it. i bought it march 6th. every time i call customer support, they always tell me to keep on waiting. what on earth is taking me so long to get this game?</p>

<p>Actually the terms of this promotion were that you would receive the email with the form to fill out for your choice of game within 1-2 weeks of purchase and then it would take 8-10 weeks for the game to be mailed to you. If you got the email with the form,
 then you should be receiving the game soon. If you never got the email, then you should try posting here -

    <title>Problems connecting two consoles on one network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> threase  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems connecting two consoles on one network</h2>
                    
<p>Hardware Specs:</p>
<p>SMCD3GN Gateway Modem (currently bridged, so it's just acting as a modem)</p>
<p>D-Link DIR 615 Wireless Networking Router</p>
<p>2 older generation xbox 360s, hardwired to the router</p>

<p>Okay, so here's the situation. &nbsp;We had originally had the 2 consoles set up on the gateway modem and were having open NAT issues. &nbsp;So I checked this page&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/157383.aspx and discovered that all I needed to
 do was get a new router that could support 2 consoles. &nbsp;At the time, this page referred me to a list of routers that would support 2 consoles. &nbsp;So, when the opportunity to buy a new router came along, I decided to check the compatible list again, except now
 the list is an entire forum section, and there doesn't seem to be any definitive list anymore, but I remember the list saying that the router needed to be Win7 compatible. &nbsp;So I go out and buy the DIR 615 and set it up, making sure that uPnP is enabled. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, we don't have any NAT complaints at &nbsp;this point, but my connectivity to Xbox live has become intermittent. &nbsp;Both consoles will be connected, but whenever both consoles try to join the same party/game, one of the consoles disconnects from XBL and has
 a hard time connecting again. &nbsp;The systems will still register being connected to the internet, but will have to reboot in order to reach XBL again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm getting very frustrated, there doesn't seem to be any walkthroughs that can explain plainly how to set up 2 360s on the DIR615. &nbsp;There are different forums telling me contradictory steps, some saying to put both 360s on a static IP and others saying
 that static IPs only screw everything up. &nbsp;Can anyone help?</p>

<h2>            TurboTax 2015 Error 42016 Updater Error</h2>
                    TurboTax 2014 and TurboTax 2015 were working properly on my machine under Win7.&nbsp; Upon update to Win 10, they are no longer able to download updates (e.g. revised tax forms) or even state forms.&nbsp; Yes to the obvious question - my internet connection is fine.
 &nbsp;I uninstalled / reinstalled TurboTax 2015 from CD multiple times to no avail.&nbsp; To ensure Intuit was not locking me out due to the new Win 10 OS, I contacted Intuit and had them push a download of TurboTax 2015 from the internet.&nbsp; Upon load of the pushed version,
 the problem persists.&nbsp; It appears there may be an incompatibility with Win 10 and TurboTax.&nbsp; Since both versions of TurboTax exhibit similar issues, it seems more like some OS download or configuration issue.&nbsp; I checked Windows Updates and they are&nbsp;"current."&nbsp;Does
 anybody have a recommendation?

<h2>            Failed to connect to a windows service</h2>
                    
<p>This happened all of the sudden and I do not recall installing any new programmes before problems started.</p>
<p>It started with a relatively long time to login to Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I logged in, I realised the desktop theme is in classic mode (taskbar looks like it's in safe mode).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pop-up appeared in the bottom right of my screen:</p>
<p>"<strong>Failed to connect to a windows service</strong></p>
<p>Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service. This problem prevents standard users from logging on to the system. As an administrative user, you can review the System Event Log for details about why the service didn't respond."</p>
<p>My computer seems to function normally other than the abovementioned problems, though the internet seems to have gotten a little slower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked the System Event Notification Service under Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services, and found the status to be 'Started' and startup type 'Automatic'.</p>
<p>I have also tried the 'netsh winsock reset' on cmd.exe in both safe mode and normal mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to perform sort of a 'clean boot' by disabling all non-Microsoft services from my boot but the error still occurs.</p>
<p>I suspect the 3 problems are linked:</p>
<p>1. Slow login, restart and shut down</p>
<p>2. Error: Failed to connect to a windows service</p>
<p>3. Theme set to Classic and unable to set Aero themes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a solution for this? Or do I have to format my computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Some programs are terminated without concent</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span>I think it is Windows 10 that I can blame for terminating legitimate programs and apps while my PC is turned on. For instance, AnVir Task Manager
 is adjusted to run on start up. I dislike it and don’t want to use the "start fresh" option or any other generic solutions. Why does Windows 10 close apps without user consent?</span></p>

            Hello Patrick, my name is Alexander. I'm an Independent Advisor and I'm happy to assist you! 
<br />
<br />The best way to add a program on the startup is through the Task Manager because in-app settings might not be enough. To do this, follow the steps:
<br />
<br />Right-click on the Start menu button, choose Task Manager, press the Startup tab, right-click on a program, then choose Enable/Disable.
<br />If you don’t have a program on the list, I recommend another option:
<br />Press the Start button, then scroll down to find the app you’d like to run at startup.
<br />Right-click this app, choose More, then choose Open file location. You will find the location of the shortcut to the app. If you cannot see an option for Open file location, this particular app can’t run at startup.
<br />
<br />Once you opened the file location, click on the Windows logo key  + R, type shell:startup, then press OK. This opens the Startup folder.
<br />Copy/ paste the shortcut from the file location to the Startup folder.
<br />
<br />Best regards, 
<br />Alexander B.

            Hi,
<br />if Windows closes programs without user consent this means some error and it is registered in system journal (Event Viewer). You may look reasons there. If there is no records than program was closed itself. Please check.

<p>Hello Rhiza_E,</p>
<p>Similar problem with Samsung S4 phone - Skype working well for years then finally agreed to update... crash city.</p>
<p>Error message is UNABLE TO CONNECT TO SKYPE. YOU CANNOT BE SIGNED IN AT THIS TIME. PLEASE CHECK YOUR MOBILE NETWORK SETTINGS AND TRY AGAIN.... which is odd because I only use wifi networks. Have tried to clear data/cache&gt;uninstall&gt;reboot&gt;reinstall
 ... no luck - even with older versions.</p>
<p>No problems with account because I am able to access using other devices.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

ram- corsair vengeance lp 8gb (2x4gb) 1866 ddr3 red<br />
<br />
my windows resource monitor says that 4144mb is hardware reserved which i think is to much. is there a way to reduce this amount?<br />
tried reseating the ram and the processor. i have also done the MSCONFIG, Boot tab, Advanced Options, and made sure the Maximum memory box was Unchecked. my bios doesn't have a memory remapping setting strangely.<br />
i was wondering if there was a way windows could do this without the bios?<br />
<br />
i would really appreciate it if i could get a fix for my problem.<br />

            i appreciate the effort but Ive already used that softwhere and the 4gb that is being used dosent even show up. i have already determined the problem has something to do whith my dimm slots while nothing looks wrong with them they are making one of my
 ram sticks unusable. i have resolved this problem by putting both dimms in a1 and a2 (not suggested in mb manual) and all of my ram is usable. i have had no problems with this configuration so far.<br />

            <p>From what i gather it holds the recycling bins of all the user profiles on the computer.... I would not delete the folder. I would however is check your recycling bin on the desktop. when you delete items they get put in the recycling bin. You then have
 to empty that to completely remove them. Its a bit like a fail safe.So check you dont want the stuff in there and empty to retrieve your space, may need to log on to each user if you have more than 1. You can also change the amount of space reserved for the
 recycling bin by right clicking the icon and going to properties.</p>
<p>hope that helps</p>

<h2>            Scheduling backups with SyncToyCmd doesn&#39;t seem to work</h2>
                    <p>I'm using SyncToy 2.1 on my Windows 10 computer and the app backs up fine in manual mode. When I want to run a scheduled task, SyncToyCmd.exe loads but doesn't seem to be doing anything. Does it work in Win 10 or do I have to use it in compatibility mode?
 What is the best way to set this up?</p>

<h2>            Not receiving messages from contacts</h2>
                    I am not able to receive messages from a few of my contacts. I have followed all of the steps from the posts i have seen and none of that has worked. I have uninstalled and re-installed and followed the commands they said to try. My microsoft and skype
 names have already been merged. None of that has worked. Has anyone found a solution that has worked for them?&nbsp;

    <title>LOCKED - Changing Email address on compromised Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> verbatimboot65  say:</h3>
<h2>            LOCKED - Changing Email address on compromised Account</h2>
                    
<p>This has been one of the more frustrating things for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XBOX gold account, everything's working fine. Since I had created it so long ago, it used an old hotmail address as it's email attached to the account. I never use the thing anymore, and then one day, decided to move it to my current email address that I
 actually use. Long story short, turns our the hotmail address was hacked, and password changed. So I was a little worried. While there hasn't been any activity on my XBL gamertag, or VISA, I figured I would call customer support and have the email address
 switched just in case. I don't know what kind of access someone with the email address would have, but better safe then sorry.</p>
<p>It seems like such an easy thing, just change the email address in my account management to my current one. I cannot do it for myself, since I don't have the password to the compromised account (and since the account has been suspended by microsoft, it looks
 like whomever took the account does not either) So I have called XBL support and told them the situation.</p>
<p>I was told that it would be sent to the investigation team, and it would be up to two weeks, in which time I will get information on getting everything back to normal. that was on the third. It's the 20th now. No one can give me an answer as to why the delay,
 what the status of my account is, and why they aren't able to change one piece of information.</p>
<p>The last guy I called, in between the long awkward silences between when I ask a question, and don't get an answer, he suggests posting into the forum. Now I don't want to put any information in here that could identify the account, they have a service number
 1153779315 from the calls I have repeatedly made to the call centre.</p>
<p>At this point, I regret even trying to make the change, as it has not been worth the hassle at all. So i have had to create a new gamertag and a silver account just to post this, creating additional work for whomever will have to delete this in order to
 move my gold account onto it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is, where is my account, how do I get it back, how do I get a hold of the investigations team, and how much longer is this going to take?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well 2 things you cant do anything about the account till the investigations team is done. This can take weeks for upto 30 days .
</p>
<p>You can only call xbox support if there is any notes from the investigations team they will give it to you. If there isn't unfortunately you need to wait</p>

Windows 7 x64 SP1 (Installed only on Caviar Black 640GB)<br />
Antec Earthwatts 650W PSU</b><br />
<br />
<br />
I've been experiencing the most mind boggling and frustrating comp problem and I really need the community's help so if anyone has any insight please let me know. I've tried everything I can think of, I've contacted tech supports for different hardware vendors
 and have tried all likely solutions I could find on the net unsuccessfully so here I am pleading to you all for help.<br />
<br />
So here it goes. I do have to give a bit of a backstory before I can dive into the heart of the matter (I apologize) since the info might be relevant. My previous build was a Phenom II X2 550 BE with a GeForce GTS 250 and my system was running fine. The only
 relevant upgrades I bought were the 965 and the Radeon HD 5770 (I did buy a keyboard and some speakers, but I know the problem I'm having is not related to peripheral devices) and everything else stayed the same.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Something to note is ever since I've bought my Antec PSU it has always made a loud periodic clicking noise, like a sudden "clunk", maybe every thirty minutes or every two hours (not sure on the intervals since I've never timed it), but despite this my system
 has always worked. I rarely got BSODs, freezes, or crashes and most of the time if I did have an error it was usually something minor such as an app hanging. All in all my system ran fine when I was running the 550.<br />
<br />
When I did install the new 965 cpu and the radeon 5770 I also did a clean of Windows by deleting the partition on the caviar black, creating a new one, and formatting it. I didn't want take the chance of some obscure driver/software error in my previous installation
 creating a conflict with the new hardware.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After installing the upgrades the system ran fine for a week or so, but then I started getting random reboots where the system would unexpectedly restart itself. Looking into event viewer the log lists it as a "Source: Kernel-power Event ID 41 Task Category
 (63)" critical error. I've never heard of this particular issue before I started experiencing it.<br />
<br />
Before I continue here's a look at the code:<br />

&lt;/Event&gt;<br />
<br />
The problem occurs infrequently and it's impossible to say when it might reoccur because sometimes I can run my pc for hours on end for days without issue and then it happens.<br />
<br />
I have scoured the net and this seems to be a widespread issue, but it also has to be one of the worst errors to troubleshoot because the symptoms are as diverse as the root issues which might be causing the error. Some people experience BSODs while others
 have hard hangs or have problems powering their system down properly. Pinpointing the root issue has proven to be damn near impossible for various reasons and it's much like a doctor treating a disease except every patient with the same disease exhibits different
 symptoms and possibly has a different virus (metaphorically speaking) which is making them sick. How do you treat something like that?<br />
<br />
Microsoft has a knowledgebase on this issue, but it isn't helpful at all:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028504</a><br />
<br />
One of the things the MS kb points out as a possible cause is overheating, such as when you install a new cpu, but I've already thought of this. My cpu temps are always under control and I leave the side panel to my pc open so it can operate at the ambient
 room temperature (I run the AC in the house a lot during the summer). I've checked the heatsink to make it is installed properly and it's tightly mounted to the cpu retension bracket on the motherboard.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What happens when I experience one of these kernel-power reboots? I'll be using the computer, usually when the cpu is under light load like surfing the web, and I'll suddenly be staring at a black monitor screen. Before I know it the computer has already started
 to reboot itself. That's one of the weird circumstances surrounding the error is it never happens when the cpu is under heavy load like when I'm gaming for instance. In fact I can game for hours without problem; these kernel-power reboots happen infrequently
 when the cpu is under light load and now that I think about it the past four reboots in the last week and a half have happened when I was surfing the web. I know my cpu shouldn't be overheating when I'm surfng the web so really the overheating cause shouldn't
 apply in my case.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are two big scenarios which make this so frustrating to troubleshoot:<br />
<br />
[1] A minidump is never created when it happens. This limits my ability to analyze the circumstances surrounding the error.<br />
<br />
[2] There isn't a lot of info on the net. Sure, the net is flooded with tons of posts with people having similar event id 41 problems for various reasons, but there are very few genuine solutions and I haven't found one that works yet.<br />
<br />
I've contacted AMD tech support and they are pretty much clueless. The tech at Antec has been a little more helpful and he thinks it might be the psu due to the periodic clicking noise. The psu should only click during power on/off, but never during normal
 operation so he suspects a faulty relay switch in the psu. Of course when I was running the 550 with the GeForce 250 the psu clicked back then and I never had one of these kernel-power reboots so why would the psu be an issue now?<br />
<br />
A lot of people speculate that if the "bugcheckcode" is blank or has a value of 0 then it's due to faulty hardware. This makes sense since in my previous build I never had these event id 41 errors and this started happening only after I installed the upgrades
 so logically it's easy to deduce that one of the new components must be the culprit. The 965 was bought brand new, sealed in the box and while I did get the radeon 5770 used off of ebay I haven't had an issue with it yet. I've ran the cpu and the gpu both
 through diagnostics and haven't turned up anything.<br />
<br />
<u>Steps I have taken to troubleshoot this issue:</u><br />
<br />
<b>Checked the system for malware</b>&nbsp;- some user on a forum suggested that there are viruses which can cause this error so I've done a full system scan with Microsoft Security Essentials and Trend Micro's housecall...nothing, no infections.<br />
<br />
<b>Checked Windows for errors</b>&nbsp;- I've done the usual clean boot as well as safe mode. I've tried the sfc /scannow and windows resource protection didn't find any integrity violations. I've also done chkdsk on both of my hdd's as well as putting both drives
 though WD's Data Lifeguard Tools and HD Tune. Nothing.<br />
<br />
<b>Verfied drivers are up to date</b>&nbsp;- according to someone the most common cause for an event id 41 is bad device drivers. All of my drivers are current*.<br />
<br />
<b>Diagnosed the RAM</b>&nbsp;- Supposedly the most common faulty hardware for this error is bad ram so I did a Memtest86+ for twelve hours. No errors.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>Updated the bios</b>&nbsp;- Someone suggested that an event id 41 is a stepping error in the cpu and recommended upgrading the bios. Flashed the bios yesterday loading optimal defaults and still got a reboot today. Oddly enough the bios version is exactly the
 same after the flashing and I swear the only thing different is the build date.<br />
<br />
<b>Disabled devices in conflict</b>&nbsp;- One user on another forum said he discovered that he had two audio drivers on the same internal high definition audio bus and he resolved his kernel-power issue by disabling one of them. Looking into device manager I found
 out that I also had two audio drivers on the same bus. One is the Realtek high definition audio (the integrated onboard audio chip) and the other is an AMD HDMI high definition audio which is included with the catalyst driver suite. Well, I don't use HDMI
 audio so I disabled the AMD audio driver and this seemed to work for a while, but it wasn't long before the reboots started happening again.<br />
<br />
Finally, someone else stated they resolved their similar issue by bumping up their MCP, NB, and DRAM voltages slightly. I just went into the bios tonight and bumped all the voltages (Vcore, memory over voltage, nb) up a notch.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have gotten another spontaneous reboot since upping the voltages, but this time it took longer to occur. I almost went a whole week without the reboot and then it happened again tonight (5/27/2011). I don't know what to do other than start RMA'ing parts and
 I was thinking it might be good to start off with the psu and the radeon first if I go down that route.<br />
<br />
I strongly encourage and appreciate all feedback cuz I'm about to lose my mind over this problem.</span>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes that is a difficult issue to solve especially in a home environment with limited parts to swap
<br />
in and out.<br />
<br />
Heat related does not always mean over-heating. It can, and often does, mean that some part is
<br />
too sensitive to what might be consider normal/acceptable heat levels. Try adding a good fan to
<br />
increase air flow to see what happens.<br />
<br />
The Power Supply is also very suspect for that error and it does sound like yours has issues anyway.<br />
<br />
Another step would be to use the old video card to see if there is any difference.<br />
<br />
Double, triple check the heatsink and compound.<br />
<br />
The issue could be a component on the motherboard.</p>
<p>Basically its a reduce the system down to as simple as possible and use a process of elimination
<br />
by doing what you can such as adding the fan, swapping cards, and so on.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            So glad to come across your post. I have been struggling with this problem for 2 days now. I'm building a PC for a friend as a favor, nice and easy as I have built many PC's in my time. I have never come across a problem so frustrating as this. Driving
 me insane.<br />
<br />
With myself the computer shuts the screen and mouse off and sometimes resets itself. Problem is I have tried stress testing the computer using Prime95 and it never happens during this, only when the computer is idle and I go to say open a window or some other
 light task.<br />
<br />
I have been through exactly what you went through, looking on forums, trying ideas, nothing works. I am now testing the PC with a spare PSU I have got a hold of. Seems to be working now.... but that's what I thought last night at 3 am after updating the motherboards
 bios and 6 hours of stress testing, come the morning switch her on, off it goes after 5 mins. Dammit!<br />
<br />
Just this minute switching her back on... wait for it...hmmm seems to be working still. Dubiously optimistic, I would advise checking the PSU, like yourself only seems to happen at low load and not when working hard. Perhaps there is a fault with the rail that's
 more susceptible when it drops the volts.<br />
<br />
Hope you sort the problem out (and fingers crossed mine stays stable)<br />
<br />
Update - No further problems, was the PSU to blame<br />

<br />
I've been experiencing the most mind boggling and frustrating comp problem and I really need the community's help so if anyone has any insight please let me know. I've tried everything I can think of, I've contacted tech supports for different hardware vendors
 and have tried all likely solutions I could find on the net unsuccessfully so here I am pleading to you all for help.<br />
<br />
So here it goes. I do have to give a bit of a backstory before I can dive into the heart of the matter (I apologize) since the info might be relevant. My previous build was a Phenom II X2 550 BE with a GeForce GTS 250 and my system was running fine. The only
 relevant upgrades I bought were the 965 and the Radeon HD 5770 (I did buy a keyboard and some speakers, but I know the problem I'm having is not related to peripheral devices) and everything else stayed the same.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Something to note is ever since I've bought my Antec PSU it has always made a loud periodic clicking noise, like a sudden "clunk", maybe every thirty minutes or every two hours (not sure on the intervals since I've never timed it), but despite this my system
 has always worked. I rarely got BSODs, freezes, or crashes and most of the time if I did have an error it was usually something minor such as an app hanging. All in all my system ran fine when I was running the 550.<br />
<br />
When I did install the new 965 cpu and the radeon 5770 I also did a clean of Windows by deleting the partition on the caviar black, creating a new one, and formatting it. I didn't want take the chance of some obscure driver/software error in my previous installation
 creating a conflict with the new hardware.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After installing the upgrades the system ran fine for a week or so, but then I started getting random reboots where the system would unexpectedly restart itself. Looking into event viewer the log lists it as a "Source: Kernel-power Event ID 41 Task Category
 (63)" critical error. I've never heard of this particular issue before I started experiencing it.<br />
<br />
Before I continue here's a look at the code:<br />

            I had this problem in windows 7 as well as with the recent installation of windows 8 pro, in the same machine.... Both times I managed to get rid of it by simply removing the ram sticks from their slots, cleaning the slots and placing the ram back....
 also overall cleaning and dusting if the MOBO and the rest of the case also helped.... Since both time this trick worked for me, I assumed this is something to do with the conductive dust settled somewhere in the MOBO, ram, processor area...

            I would like to ask, is your BIOS a U-EFI? If so, my team finds that is the cause, just as you stated. It is how hard drives and drivers crash, too. It generally happens on pc-wake-ups. Want more information, research EFS. It was edible in Win.XP2 through
 Win.7, just as it made HFS+, NTFS, and U-EFI. It is a huge javascript in a system file(s). My team wants UNIX back, so bad.

<h2>            Windows 10 Stuttering Issue with audio and video.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 Stuttering Issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with games/videos that I play which is this stuttering in audio and video. Everything freezes for just a micro moment and then resumes and sometimes joined with a little audio crackle. I ran a DCP latency checker and I have some pretty spiking
 moments but disabling the drivers one by one and looking for the one causing issues didn't result with any clues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These freezes happen frequently but not consistently.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Elias,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either if your video and audio card drivers are not updated or due to background applications. Therefore, I would suggest you to follow the steps below and see if this helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Update your drivers.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure all the latest Windows updates are installed and your drivers are installed in compatibility mode. Please go to the Manufacturer's site and download the latest drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Perform Clean Boot.</strong></p>
<p><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called <strong>

            <p>I've tried this and didn't help the issue, the stuttering is still an issue but it has decreased a lot but it's still there and very disrupting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything that would conventional and nothing has helped with the issue, running compatibility, admin, disabling drivers, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might revert back to windows 7 at this point for the issue doesn't seem to be going anywhere.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to un-install and re-install both sound card drivers and display card drivers and check.</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to uninstall the sound card driver:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key + X key</strong>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Expand ‘</span><strong><span>Sound Video and Game Controllers</span>’</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Right-click on the Sound driver listed and click on ‘<strong>Uninstall’</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the option to&nbsp;<strong>Delete driver software</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Follow the steps to uninstall the display card driver:</span><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key + X key</strong>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Expand <strong>Display adaptors</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click on the display driver&nbsp; listed and click on ‘<strong>Uninstall’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Select the option to&nbsp;<strong>Delete driver software</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Now visit your computer manufacturer website and check if there are compatible Windows 10 drivers listed for
</span>both sound card drivers and display card drivers. If so, please download them and install them on your computer.</p>
<p><span>If&nbsp; </span>both sound card drivers and display card drivers&nbsp; aren't listed, I suggest you to download the drivers for Windows 8.1 and then try to install them in compatibility mode and check.
</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps provided below to install the drivers in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right-click on the driver setup file and click on&nbsp;<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the&nbsp;<strong>‘compatibility’</strong>&nbsp;tab and check the box&nbsp;<strong>"Run this program in compatibility mode for&nbsp;</strong>“and select Windows 8.1 operating system from the drop down.</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>‘Apply’</strong>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>‘OK’</strong>&nbsp;and run the file to install it.</span></li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            &#34;My Computer&#34; can&#39;t find files</h2>
                    When I click on "My Computer" it comes up but no files or directories - some times takes minutes just to find the top level, and sometimes it freezes and never shows anything, just the open "my computer" window and nothing....&nbsp; SOMETIMES, it will finally
 bring up the initial list, and then when I click on a folder to go deeper, it freezes up again&nbsp;&nbsp; Tremendouly frustrating.&nbsp; Somtimes the computer freezes completely, and I need to to a re-boot and start over again......&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HELP ME PLEASE

<p>Let's start troubleshooting by testing the hard drive.</p>
<p>Test the hard drive with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the drive mftr.'s website or use Seagate's SeaTools For DOS. You will create a bootable CD with the file you download. You will need third-party burning software to do this such as Roxio, Nero,
 or the free ImgBurn. Burn as an image, not as data.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com</a> <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/downloads/seatools/seatooldreg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/downloads/seatools/seatooldreg</a>
<br />

<br />
Boot with the CD you made and do a thorough test of the drive. If it fails any physical tests, replace it.</p>
<p>If you can't do the testing yourself and/or are uncomfortable opening your computer, take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).</p>
