            Hey Chris.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you check Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features?   
<br />
<br />If not I'd install it again so that it is available to properly uninstall there.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise you can leave it, or find the Process running in Task Manager to kill it so you can delete the Program Files, if necessary taking ownership of it first:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-take-ownership-context-menu-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-ta...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>The USB drive shows the space allocated to ReadyBoost.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Because ReadyBoost is a cached resource and not actual physical memory. Probably would be
<br />
a good idea to somehow include it in TaskManager as is Physical Memory and the Pagefile.<br />
<br />
=====================================================<br />
<br />
For those wanting more information on ReadyBoost.<br />
<br />
(A FAST Readyboost drive is the cheapest best bang for buck. The only time you will notice
<br />
it is when those memory hogs are in play.)<br />
<br />
ReadyBoost uses up to 4 gig (Vista) of the drive space for caching which can allow the computer
<br />
to run a little faster particularly when a lot of programs are running (or some that use huge
<br />
<br />
be set for the entire drive size or less than the total leaving as much as desired for storage space<br />
<br />
To use a thumbdrive just put it in the USB port and it should initialize and show up as Drive
<br />
Space in Start - Computer AND/OR Windows Explorer. You can then COPY or SAVE files to
<br />
the drive. To remove the drive use the Safely Remove Hardware Icon near the the Clock in
<br />
Lower Right Corner.<br />

<br />
<strong>DO NOT GO OUT AND JUST BUY A DRIVE THAT CLAIMS IT IS READYBOOST READY - <br />
many lie or at least stretch the truth. Look at the drive ratings below and buy <br />
one that you know is FAST.<br />
</strong><br />
Remember the max readyboost cache is 4 gig. If your device is over that you can use it for<br />
storage. And you need a fast drive.<br />

            Hi nhebert,<br />
<br />
All computer monitors, whether they are LCD or CRT style, have a built-in feature called the on screen display (OSD) lock out that prevents users from viewing any images on the monitor. If your computer screen has accidentally been set to the OSD lock out setting,
 there are several different ways you can remove the lock out, depending on the make and model of your particular computer monitor.<br />
<br />
Here are the steps that you can try to get rid of the little white box “OSD lockout”.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power your computer completely off and then remove the monitor cable from the port on the back side of the computer case. Reattach the cable and make sure the pins are correctly screwed in all of the way. Power the computer back on and check to see if
 the OSD lock out message is still being displayed.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the manual that came with your computer or monitor and locate the troubleshooting section if you are still receiving the OSD lock out message. Find the OSD lock out heading and read the method that your particular model of monitor uses to remove
 the lock out. Follow the instructions to remove the lock out.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attempt generic lock out removal procedures if you no longer have the manual that came with your monitor. Press and hold the "Menu" button located at the bottom end of your monitor for 15 seconds and wait to see if the OSD lock out message disappears.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the "Menu" button again if the lock out message remains on the screen. Use the arrow buttons to navigate through the main menu options. Highlight the "Settings" or "OSD Menu" option and then hit the Menu key again to access the new list of settings.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scroll down to the "OSD Lock" heading. Use the arrow keys to change the setting to "No." Hit the Menu key again to return to the main menu. Scroll over to the "Exit" setting and then hit the Menu key a final time to exit the menu setting and remove the
 OSD lock out.<br />
<br />
After getting rid of the message, check if you’ve sound on the computer. If you still have no sound on the computer, I would suggest you to try the fix it tool from the link below.<br />

            <p>OK, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems this is the ethernet adapter from the surface dock. I don't know where to find drivers for the dock (only the firmware updater). In any case, I uninstalled the driver and rebooted, I guess Windows got it back from the internet when it detected the
 adapter again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll come back to you in case the situation happens again.</p>

<p>Sorry but if you have to have a sensor just to be able to set a location in the program...&nbsp; Thats just plain stupid.&nbsp; I'm not calling you stupid...the software developers are stupid for requiring such a thing.&nbsp; I have the same problem as you.&nbsp; It won't show
 me any location other than redmond.&nbsp; It will find my other choices but won't let me set them.&nbsp; The gadgets worked in Vista but in 7 have been nothing more than a pain in the backside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft...get a clue.&nbsp; Fix your buggy desktop weather gadget!</p>

            <p>Same thing happened to me.&nbsp; Windows update is actually broken in a clean install of Windows 8.1. You need to install a hotfix to get windows update working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you need to turn off automatic updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you need to download and install the kb3112336 hotfix here </p>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3112336/windows-update-client-for-windows-8.1-and-windows-server-2012-r2-december-2015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3112336/windows-update-client-for-windows-8.1-and-windows-server-2012-r2-december-2015</a>
<p>
</p><p>After you have installed this hotfix you need to restart computer then you can turn automatic updates back on</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now just check for updates and it should just work.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.　</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try to boot into <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> and perform the Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p>Press and hold the <strong>shift key </strong>while clicking on R<strong>estart
</strong>at the login Screen (Bottom right corner).</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Select <strong>T</strong></span><strong><span><span>roubleshoot </span>
</span></strong><span><span>and click on </span></span><strong><span><span>Advanced Options</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</p>
<p><span><span>2. Select </span></span><strong><span><span>Startup Settings </span>
</span></strong><span><span>and click on </span></span><strong><span><span>Restart</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</p>
<p><span><span>3. After restarting, choose </span></span><strong><span><span>Enable Safe mode</span></span><span><span>with networking</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>
</span></span></p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Put the computer in Clean Boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>By setting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>

            <p>What you don't understand is I can't get into safe mode, with networking or otherwise. My tablet doesn't respond to f8 or any other command, I have definately tried all of them. It looks like the only solution is to replace the hard drive, I guess I'll have
 to send it back to DELL, or replace the hard drive myself. My venue 11 pro was perfect the way it was, I wish I had never put Windows 10 on it. All I get on it now is a blue screen with a white circle going around and around. I have tried every key combination
 I could, including f5&amp; home after letting the battery in the tablet run down. That just took me to a diagnostics page that was worthless, does anyone know how to format this hard drive, considering I can't get back into it, no matter what I do?</p>

    <title>How to move a GamerTag to another Live Account if you - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to move a GamerTag to another Live Account if you don&#38;&#35;39&#59;t own an Xbox 360&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I have a gamertag tied to a very very old live account/email which is not used anymore.</p>
<p>I have another Live account which is tied to my lifelong email that I will probably always use till I die.</p>
<p>I do NOT own a Xbox 360 so is there no way for me to move my GamerTag?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not even with XBox One, App, Windows 10, xboxlive?</p>
<p>If no joy for those questions, does anyone know if Microsoft has any plans to help gamers better manage their gamertags/accounts in the near future?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>
<p>MojoMonsta</p>

<p>Thanks M3tal Daz3, But as I stated in my original post the email I wish to use was already assigned to a different Microsoft Live account and If I understand this right the GamerTag is associated with a Live Account not merely an email address. So I need
 to switch the GamerTag to another Live account.</p>

<p>M3tal Daz.... By the way Mojo Monsta and CoinChutoy is both me.....</p>
<p>So I don't want you to think I don't appreciate your help, I am very grateful....</p>
<p>However I went and read all of what I could tell might help me from the link you provided.</p>
<p>I think the part you may be missing is the fact that the email address I would want to change to "ALREADY" is assigned to a Microsoft account which I also use to tie to my MSDN account, etc....</p>
<p>So if I go to my old account and try to follow those steps (which says to first add the other email address then make it primary then remove the old) I can't get past the first step because it gives me an error "email address is already being used". &nbsp;So
 to try to clarify what I need is...</p>
<p>I have an old Microsoft account with an old email address of which I no longer use the old email address and the only thing I use the old Microsoft account for is it just has my xbox gamertag with my Gold subscription tied to it (otherwise it would be useless).
 So the account/email I wish to move my gamertag to is used daily and I have other stuff tied to that account, like my MSDN subscription, OneDrive and other things.</p>
<p>So as I was simply asking how can I move a GamerTag to another existing microsoft account/email without access to an xbox 360?</p>

<p>Microsoft PnP Utility</p>
<p>Enumeration of driver packages failed :The request is not supported.<br />
No published driver packages were found on the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This message seems to manifest itself in the actual install dialogs for hardware I'm trying to install but I'm not sure what has gone wrong.</p>
<p>My system is clearly broken in some way, as when I perform the same action on other Windows 8 PCs, I get the expected driver list displayed...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone got any advice or clues as to what I should do next?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PnPUtil (PnPUtil.exe) is a command line tool that lets an administrator perform the following actions on driver packages:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Adds a driver package to the driver store.</p>
<p>b) Deletes a driver package from the driver store. </p>
<p>c) Enumerates the driver packages that are currently in the driver store. Only driver packages that are not in-box packages are listed. An in-box driver package is one which is included in the default installation of Windows or its service packs.<br />
</p>
<p>Refer to the articles given below, which includes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) PnPUtil Command Syntax </p>
<p>b) PnPUtil Examples </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply... but what you've supplied is the standard use of the pnputil tool, which I've obviously already explored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question was:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I enter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pnputil -e</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does it&nbsp;consistently return:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft PnP Utility</p>
<p>Enumeration of driver packages failed :The request is not supported.<br />
No published driver packages were found on the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error response is not documented and I would like to know the cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Passwords greater than 16 characters&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to change my passphrase today, and I got an interesting error: "Password must be 16 characters or less.". I've done my research and this leads me to believe that my password may be stored in plain-text on the servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't I have a password greater than 16 characters on any Microsoft service?</p>
<p>Is there a way I can increase the password length limit?<br />

<p><span><span>Hi
<span>HalfLife729,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> If you have any
</span><strong><span>CD/DVD burning applications</span></strong><span>, you may try
<strong>uninstalling that</strong> and then <strong>follow KB </strong><strong>982116</strong> and see if that helps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the
<strong>fix it doesn’t work</strong>, then <strong>try the steps manually .</strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the following KB article to run the Fixit:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982116</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also refer the following to get more information on uninstalling a Program:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step doesn’t work, then you may try the following steps to resolve the issue:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2: Remove and reinstall drivers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to uninstall the DVD ROM drivers from device manager, restart the computer and let the drivers get installed on its
 own and check if the issue gets fixed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the drive is not listed, remove and reinstall the existing drivers. To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong>Start,</strong> and then click <strong>Control Panel.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click
<strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, click <strong>System,</strong> and then click
<strong>Device Manager.</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note
</span></strong><span>If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. In Device Manager,
<strong>expand DVD/CD-ROM drives</strong>, <strong>right-click the CD and DVD devices</strong>, and then click
<strong>Uninstall.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you are prompted to confirm that you want to remove the device, click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After the computer restarts, the drivers will be automatically installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try to install the latest version of the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is useful.</span></p>

<div>You can try uninstalling Kaspersky Antivirus and check if the issue still persists.</div>

<div><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.

<p>Hi guys, I have recently bought a hdmi to vga cable to hook my xbox 360 up to my monitor. &nbsp;I have tried multiple monitors but the monitor won't detect my xbox. &nbsp;It says VGa : No Signal. &nbsp;Any help?</p>

<p>There is a number of possibilities.</p>
<p>First, a simple cable will not have the necessary components to convert the digital signal from HDMI to the analog signal for VGA. It would need a converter. It might be possible to build it into an oversized plug, but I'm not so sure that has been done,
 especially as the converter needs power that it cannot source from either connection.</p>
<p>Yet, there are plain cables out there terminated with an HDMI plug on one end and a VGA (D-SUB) plug on the other end, supposedly designed for devices that can output digital signals over a VGA output, but that is a non-standard and I haven't been able to
 find out anything solid about which devices actually support that. Most devices, the Xbox 360 included, do not support them.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the cable has a converter, make sure you haven't received the wrong kind that it is intended to convert VGA to HDMI.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if the cable has a converter and is the right type, there may be handshaking problems between it and the Xbox 360 keeping the conveter from getting a signal, or the Xbox 360 might not get correct information on what the converter supports and output
 a signal that the converter cannot process.</p>
<p>Older model Xbox 360s (before the Xbox 360 E) natively support VGA output over their A/V output though. Microsoft no longer makes those cables, but there are of course used and third party cables Xbox 360 VGA cables available. Unless you have an Xbox 360
 E, that would be a much simpler solution than using a converter.</p>

<h2>            12 month XBox Live card says it&#39;s not activated&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I bought my son a 12 month XBox live gold subscription at Walmart for his bday which landed on Easter this year. When I purchased the card I went through one of those scan yourself isles, but before I scanned the card I asked one of the employees standing close by if I would have any problems with this card, since I was unsure if&nbsp;they had to do anything other than ring the card up at the register. He told me that it was ok&nbsp;to do it this way &amp; once its scanned it activates. So&nbsp;my son got the card in his basket from the "Easter Bunny"!! We didn't try the card at first because my son still had a month or 2 left of Xbox live gold. When we finally tried the card it would give us the message that This code is not yet active &amp; to contact the&nbsp;merchant.&nbsp;The next day&nbsp;I brought it back to Walmart with the receipt, thinking somehow going through the do it yourself lane must have been the&nbsp;problem. Customer Service told me they don't take that type of produc

            <p>Hey there,</p><p><br /></p><p>What's the specific error code you receive when you try to redeem it?&nbsp;That may lead us to a more specific issue, but if the card was simply not activated, unfortunately the best route to take will be to reach out to the retailer to have it properly activated - which I see you have tried so far. I definitely understand the frustration this may have caused, but the retailer will be the best route to take in these scenarios.</p><p><br /></p><p>Keep us posted if you received a specific error code just in case we might be able to find a different cause!&nbsp;Error codes generally look similar to XBOS-0000 or 0x0000000.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Home Xbox gold sharing problems</h2>
                    <p>so my little brother plays online games through my xbox live by the gold sharing feature involved in setting home xbox. Recently he went away for a few weeks so i moved my home xbox to be used elsewhere;&nbsp;then when he returned he got on to play some Fortnite as kids in this generation do&nbsp;and i moved home xbox back and he tried to get on. The problem is it told him he needs to get gold even though he should be sharing mine. So seeking answers i came here and checked to see if the terms of home xbox had changed but sure enough it still says he should get my benefits. Does anyone know why this isn't the case?</p><p><br /></p>

Are you able to play online?</p><p>If your brother still gets an error message, also check if he "can see and upload community creations" in his account's online and privacy settings (if he is on a child account, a parent has to set that on <a href="https://account.xbox.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.xbox.com/settings</a> ).</p><p>Also, if he is under the age of 13, you might also try to contact Epic Games support, as they restrict Epic Accounts that are under the age of 13 for Fortnite.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>When&nbsp;Delete&nbsp;is selected,&nbsp;the file&nbsp;is&nbsp;placed in the Recycle&nbsp;bin, unless the Recycle bin is already full.. If the Recycle bin is full, the deleted file is lost as the Recycle bin is bypassed. If you do not want the file to go in the Recycle bin, place the
 cursor on any file in Windows Explorer and select the keyboard shortcut <strong>
Shift Delete.&nbsp; </strong>If&nbsp;<strong>Shift+Delete </strong>is used the file&nbsp;will not be placed in&nbsp;the Recycle bin and iis permanently removed. Do not use
<strong>Shift Delete</strong> unless you are 100% certain you will never need the file again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting files does not result in part deletions. It is all or nothing. Part files (fragments) result from disk corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files for most users deleted files not in the Recycle bin, are lost but until the disk is formatted or the part of the disk written over with fresh data, recovery software can recover deleted files. Data recovery software is very expensive and as a consequence
 is not available to the typical home computer user.</p>

            <p>Thank You Gerry, It was really a very kind reply to my query. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Gerry if you know I was talking about a folder say of like more than 3GB, carrying multiple files&nbsp;with the different file format. What will happen in this case, If you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me go more clear, Say If I&nbsp;hit&nbsp;just a&nbsp;delete key to a folder having 3GB of data &amp; in the mid of folder being deleted&nbsp;I cancel that delete operation without it is fully completed. Will the same folder contain the same amount of data or more or less. Will
 some files in that data folder will get deleted&nbsp;&amp; goes into Recycle Bin or just&nbsp;cancelling the operation will undo the delete operation &amp; folder does contain the same amount of data as before deletion started. What actually happens I need to know that.</p>

            If you delete a folder all the sub-folders and files in those folders are deleted. If you remove the folder at the top of the tree the file paths to all files below the folder are destroyed. This means you have no means of accessing the files so they are
 lost.

            <p>I appreciate your reply but I guess you are not getting my question to the&nbsp;correct extent, You know what is happening when I am deleting a folder with around 3GB data &amp; cancelling the operation before getting completed, the folder is seen partially deleted
 which means folder is not getting deleted on cancelling the delete operation in mid. I am sorry this contradicts your answer.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Still Thank you very much for your effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love if anybody can enlighten me with the backend technicality which happens on deleting &amp; cancelling the deleting operation in mid.</p>

            Hi jBetsy
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Skype for Business is included with Office 2016/2019/365 Pro Plus, so, removing it is not possible without customizing the installer.
<br />
<br />If you still want to uninstall it separately, I will provide the steps below:
<br />
<br />1. Download Office Deployment Tool via this link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>. Run it and extract the files.  
<br />
<br />2. Rename the configuration-Office365-x64 file as “configuration.xml”. Paste the configuration.xml and setup.exe file to C:\Users\Administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Open the configuration.xml file and replace the content with:
<br />
<br />&lt;Configuration&gt;
<br />
<br />  &lt;Add OfficeClientEdition="32" Channel="Monthly"&gt;
<br />
<br />    &lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;
<br />
<br />      &lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;
<br />
<br />    &lt;/Product&gt;
<br />
<br />    &lt;Product ID="VisioProRetail"&gt;
<br />
<br />      &lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;
<br />
<br />    &lt;/Product&gt;
<br />
<br />  &lt;/Add&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;/Configuration&gt;
<br />
<br />Note: regarding to the OfficeClientEdition and Channel, “32” and “Monthly” is an example. Please click File-&gt;Office account-&gt;About Outlook, you will see your Office client edition there. For example 32-bit or 64 bit, Monthly Channel or Semi-Annual Channel.
<br />
<br />4. Press Wind+R, type cmd, OK. Then type setup.exe /configure configuration.xml, press Enter.
<br />
<br />5. Follow the prompts to finish the configuration.
<br />
<br />If this is too much to do, then you should be able to disable it other ways:<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6c73d77-c414-49ff-830c-d3a9d58e2ca9?upload=true" />

            IDK what platform you're using, but I took it off the wife's W7 machine through "add or remove programs".&nbsp; It hasn't returned.&nbsp; I have NO experience with 8, 8.1 or 10, so IDK how that works.&nbsp; I run Skype through a Linux Mint 19 machine and our Android

<p>It never was on my task bar for the several years that I have used this computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't like skype and did not place it there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you guys want to include some software, fine. You should not stuff a sales pitch on everyone as a cost of using microsoft though. All it does is make me dislike your product and skype. You have no right to make a paying customer have to click out
 windows throwing more sales pitches.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            chkdsk &#47;f won&#39;t run on reboot in winxp</h2>
                    Hi, I have read copious answers to this issue but unfortunately none helps my situation. All I wanted to do was to do a disk check so ran chkdsk /f , then y and rebooted. Windows just starts normally. I have no idea where to go from here.&nbsp;I have tried
 running it from the repair console with the winxp cd in place and that's fine. It just will not run from the start run box. Any other ideas please. Tks Geoff.

            <p>Try pressing the F8 key at start up, when the safe mode choices come up go to Command prompt and enter the chkdsk /f command at the prompt.</p>
<p>Timing with the F8 key is everything, continually press it and you should get there, some machines will throw up a boot sequence menu in that case you have to wait for the first black screen/white writing to pass but tap before XP screen comes up.</p>

            Thanks, but no go. In fact the pc won't boot into safe mode with prompt, it stops at win\ystem32\JOGO.sys and eventually reboots normally,&nbsp;but it will boot in plain safe mode, so I ran chkdsk /f from the start run box and rebooted still no go.

            You need to UNmark the reply that didn't work as the answer.&nbsp; A reply is not an Answer unless it solves your problem.&nbsp; Marking something as the Answer removes it from the view of other folks that might help you and only look for questions with no Answer.<br />
<br />
If you have been trying things to get this to work, maybe you need to set XP back to the default for chkdsk things.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
<br />
Clisk Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>chkntfs&nbsp; /d</b><br />
<br />
Click OK and the screen will blink and that will set the section of the registry where the chkdsk on startup things are back to the default value (in case it is messed up).<br />
<br />
Then let's take a look at the "dirty" bit on the volume of interest.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the command prompt window.<br />
<br />
To query the dirty bit on drive C, type:<br />
<br />
fsutil dirty query C:<br />
<br />
Sample output: <br />
Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C: is not dirty<br />
<br />
Type 'exit' to close the command prompt window<br />
<br />
Is the volume dirty or is it not dirty?<br />
<br />
Schedule another chkdsk to run on the next reboot, then reboot.<br />
<br />
If it works, great.&nbsp; If it doesn't you need to look in the Event Viewer log to see what happened.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Look in the Application log for a very recent event sourced by Winlogon, something like:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winlogon<br />

Post your most recent&nbsp; Winlogon Event so we can see what it looks like.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event
 details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button under the up and down arrows to copy the details to the Windows clipboard and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste or CTRL-V) the detail text
 back here for analysis.&nbsp; Remove any personal information from your information after pasting if you are compelled to do so.<br />
<br />

            Looks like it ran, huh?<br />
<br />
Why do you think it did not run?<br />
<br />
If with the tinkering around trying to get it to work (depending on what you did), you may have issued the command to tell XP to never check the volume so that might be why you don't see any more logs of the chkdsk before this one.&nbsp; At least now you know where
 to look to see what happened.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is also good to clear the Event Viewer logs to get a fresh start on them so you don't get mixed up.<br />
<br />
Do you now or have you ever had any third party defragmenters installed - like defraggler, auslogics, diskeeper, etc.?<br />
<br />
Let's see if anybody else has an idea.<br />
<br />
If not, you can force the dirty bit on the volume and then XP should check it automatically and display a message stating the volume is dirty on the next reboot.<br />
<br />
If you can't wait, do it yourself by entering this command from the Command Prompt window:<br />
<br />
<b>fsutil&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; set&nbsp; C:</b><br />
<br />
Then query the dirty bit again like you did before and it should be <b>dirty </b>
now.<br />
<br />
The only thing that can clear the dirty bit is a successful run of chkdsk with error correction, so if you reboot and check the dirty bit again and it is still dirty, you can try the chkdsk again or you are going to have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; from the XP Recovery
 Console like you did before to clear it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you can't query the dirty bit from the Recovrey Console so you will have to boot normally to check it.<br />
<br />

            <p>No it didn't run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears to have done so, but not. I know this for two reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly I always used to get the light blue screen and you could see chkdsk doing it's stuff. That doesn't happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly I tried setting the dirty bit and that was ok. I then ran chkdsk and rebooted and the bit is still dirty so no chkdsk has run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do use defraggler but can't see why that should upset chkdsk.</p>

            Let's look at one thing in the registry since it is bugging me...<br />
<br />
If you are not comfortable with that, say so now.<br />
<br />
Before doing so, you need to back it up first and consider making a manual Restore Point.<br />
<br />
There is no undo or quit without saving in the registry editor so before making any changes to your registry, back it up with this popular free tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html<br />
</a><br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
regedit<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
Navigate to this key:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager<br />
<br />
On the right hand side, find the value of 'BootEexcute".<br />
<br />
Tell us the what you see for the Type and the Data columns for BootExecute<br />
<br />
This is where XP looks to see if there is a chkdsk scheduled to run on the next reboot or not.<br />
<br />
The default value (and after running chkntfs&nbsp; /d) should be:<br />
<br />
autocheck&nbsp; autochk&nbsp; *<br />
<br />
That means that XP will check the dirty bit on all volumes and if the dirty bit is set on a volume, a chkdsk with error correction will run automatically on the next reboot.<br />
<br />
If you have a chkdsk with error correction pending, it will look something like this:<br />
<br />
autocheck autochk /r \??\C: autocheck autochk *<br />
<br />
What does yours say (be careful of the spacing).<br />
<br />
When you run chkntfs&nbsp; /d, that is supposed to set the value back to the default and remove any pending chkdsks that might be scheduled.<br />
<br />
Close the Registry Editor when you are done.<br />
<br />
Note that manually adjusting it will not clear the dirty bit on a volume - only a successful run of chkdsk with error correction either automatically or from the Recovery Console can clear the dirty bit.<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>Ah, we're getting somewhere!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran /d and the registry entry is as you note. Scheduled chkdsk and reg entry changed to as you state but /p not r. So changed it to r and rebooted. Chkdsk tried to run (light blue screen) but came up with disk check has been scheduled etc and volume locked
 etc so no chkdsk ran and then carried on to load windows. I couldn't read it all as it didn't stay on screen long enough. However we seem to near a goal!</p>

    <title>Win&#43;K Shortcut not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leslie.waller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win&#43;K Shortcut not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have looked long and hard for an answer to this and have yet to even be able to find the correct question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am one of the computer technicians for a small school district using mostly Lenovo E550 Windows 10 laptops.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the past few months, out of the 200 or so laptops that we have in circulation, a hand full have started having issues connecting to a wireless display device(ScreenBeams) connected to a short throw projector located at the front of the room.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptops are running Windows 10 and for some reason the win+k shortcut key stops working to allow them to connect to the device. When you press win+k, nothing happens. It does not bring up the Connect feature along the right side of the screen. Also,
 when you go into the Action Center and try to click on Connect, the same thing happens, which is nothing. You can also go into display setting and click on "Connect to a wireless display" and nothing will happen.&nbsp; You can switch to a different profile on the
 same computer and are still unable to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, we have 200 or so laptops in the district and they are all running the same version of Windows 10, but right now we have about a half dozen that are having this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried running sfc /scannow as suggested in some forums that I have looked at. We have also tried a roll back on the system, run "Get-AppxPackage | % { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppxManifest.xml" -verbose
 }" through powershell and replaced the DisplaySwitch.exe file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that seems to resolve it for a short amount of time rebooting the machine, then usually within a couple of days, it is not working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a more permanent solution for this issue. Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong><em>can also go into display setting and click on "Connect to a wireless display" and nothing will happen.&nbsp;
</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Win+P to try that?&nbsp; Also, I suggest starting Narrator (Win+Ctrl+Enter) to see what it "sees".&nbsp; One puzzling thing about your symptom description so far is that you appear able to do a Win+A or was that being done in some other way?&nbsp; Swipe from
 the right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what is the state of the Wireless display adapter in&nbsp; Settings&nbsp; Bluetooth &amp; Other devices?&nbsp; Try removing all traces of it if it is seen there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly in Network connections (e.g. Network adapters) is the associated Local Area Connection... seen?&nbsp;
 Try using the Network troubleshooter on that if it is.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Does Narrator allow you to explore that dialog even though you can't see it?&nbsp; For example, I just saw its content by pressing
<strong>(Caps Lock) Shift+Enter</strong>&nbsp; (Narrator's Search command).&nbsp; Unfortunately it doesn't look as if it will let me do anything that way, just see them.&nbsp; However, as long as it allowed you to explore the various links in the actual dialog it looks as
 if you would be allowed to try to use them.&nbsp; My usual explanation of this phenomenon would be that the dialog was being rendered on a different monitor but since you can see the other dialogs I'm mystified.</p>

<p>Everything seems to resolve after I perform a reboot on their computers, but then, after a couple of days it goes back to win+k not working.&nbsp; I was wondering if there was some sort of Windows Update that may have caused this on these particular machines,
 but they have the same updates as other machines that are not having the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the Narrator on a different machine that isn't having the issue, it says connect and then search after I hit win+k. On the machines I am having an issue with the Narrator acknowledges that I press the windows key and K, but it acts as though nothing
 actually opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then that would suggest you have two cases which could be usefully traced by ProcMon.&nbsp; E.g. without access to source or support documentation we could infer at least what would or would not be happening by comparing the two traces.&nbsp; Let's try filtering with&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>OMG.&nbsp; Using this stuff is like trying to walk through a mine field--one deviation from the marked path and Boom!&nbsp; In this case, it looks like I may have reproduced your symptom:&nbsp; I lost the Project dialog somehow.&nbsp; Narrator can see it and allow me to use
 it but I don't know what happened.&nbsp; Unfortunately I stopped my trace before that happened.&nbsp; I had tried getting another monitor (via an MWDA) working using Win-K.&nbsp; It started, then switched display configuration to Extend from Second Screen Only unexpectedly.&nbsp;
 (Is it supposed to do that?&nbsp; Who knows?)&nbsp; Then the MWDA connection failed (that was my Boom!) and that has transported me to this alternate universe.&nbsp; Win-K is also not working...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh.&nbsp; I just remembered something that may be related.&nbsp; Someone was claiming that there is a deadlock condition associated with HDMI Audio.&nbsp; Is there Audio involved in your case?&nbsp; FWIW I see an Audio component for my MWDA in Bluetooth and Other devices. Perhaps
 as a test you could try removing and disabling that to see if your symptom would change.&nbsp; Also, I just realized I haven't heard Narrator in a while; so it's probably lost on my HDMI Audio default.&nbsp; (And in fact, I don't know if adding the MWDA would change
 which one would be default.&nbsp; TBD.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah.&nbsp; I got&nbsp;everything back by using the magic bullet (Win+Ctrl+Shift+B).&nbsp; I wish they would document this thing's full functionality&nbsp;so it doesn't seem like I am standing in front of a mirror and uttering an incantation waiting for transport...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll see if I can figure out more about what just happened.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I saw something like that too.&nbsp; I was on the MWDA with Narrator running and heard only "Win-K".&nbsp; Apparently it was misinterpreted so that the Search bar was shown (on the primary monitor) and K may have been typed.&nbsp; Narrator could not clarify.&nbsp; When I did
 it again, it was clear that I did have the Connect dialog open and Narrator was helping me use it.&nbsp; I even used it to disconnect the screen I was looking at.&nbsp; (I am using multiple ports on the same monitor as a method of simulating your symptom.)&nbsp; As suspected
 I had to have a headset plugged in to hear Narrator because the monitor only allows one HDMI port to be active at a time and the one that was default (the primary screen where the keyboard output was going) was not the one I was looking at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I think I found a useful diagnostic to capture the state of the "networks" in PowerShell.&nbsp; It is more complete than either&nbsp; ipconfig /all or Control Panel's Network connections</p>
<p>PS&gt;<strong>Get-NetAdapter -IncludeHidden | ft -AutoSize -Wrap</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the -IncludeHidden switch that provides the extra detail for the&nbsp; Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter #... "networks".&nbsp; Depending on how wide your PowerShell window is it will capture the Status and the MAC Address which seems useful for correlating
 what is supposed to be happening versus what is actually happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I am listing everything because I'm not sure what role they all play in this scenario.&nbsp; Otherwise I would just limit the list with this pipeline</p>
<p>PS&gt;<strong>Get-NetAdapter -IncludeHidden | where InterfaceDescription -match "Direct" | ft -AutoSize -Wrap</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like that one lets the MAC Address fit better too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is my latest news on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop that a teacher having the issue on in the office and I am trying to replicate the issue real world, but have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another teacher have the same issue so I went to do some more trouble shooting on theirs.&nbsp; They shut down the computer the night before, like they always do, and this morning, win+k and win+p did not work.&nbsp; I tried plugging in an HDMI cable to connect
 directly to the projector, but I was also unable to get that to work.&nbsp; I logged the teacher off of the laptop, without rebooting, and logged in with an administrator user, and win+k and win+p still did not work.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the teacher needed the laptop
 pretty quickly to continue on with their lessons, so I rebooted it and it started working for her after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a permon /report on the computer to see if there was anything out of the ordinary, but it did not come up with any errors other that a couple of USB issues that are unrelated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the device manager to see if there were any devices that might have had an issue, but nothing was wrong in there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try Narrator?&nbsp; FWIW I am finding those dialogs can pop up on any monitor whether it is enabled or not.&nbsp; Both the Project setting and the designated primary monitor seem to be somewhat random, especially after using the Win+Ctrl+Shift+B reset.&nbsp; Win+P, Home,
 Enter (from somewhere other than PC Screen Only) is most reliable for establishing a base state.&nbsp; This happens for me mostly with an attached HDMI monitor.&nbsp; I can try switching from that configuration to an Extended one using an MWDA.&nbsp; The problem there is
 that it is an even&nbsp;less usable configuration than the problem HDMI one.&nbsp; E.g. the MWDA goes down more&nbsp;often than the HDMI one.&nbsp; In any case, I suspect both probably cause a problem with&nbsp;audio; HDMI audio is a known problem area; then a potential workaround
 may be disabling the MWDA audio (provided its video is all that is wanted.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I found a related quirk today involving screen projecting.&nbsp; I had been projecting an app from my W8.1. RT onto W10 and then subsequently found that I had no Internet connectivity on the RT.&nbsp; All I had to do to get it back was Disconnect the second screen?&nbsp;
 The clue I had for doing that was&nbsp; PowerShell&nbsp; Get-NetAdapter&nbsp; -IncludeHidden&nbsp;-- &nbsp;the MAC Address was the same as the Wi-Fi?&nbsp; Previously I had used a heavier sledge hammer:&nbsp;
<strong>ipconfig /release &amp; ipconfig /renew</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; which apparently is overkill but still better than a reboot.&nbsp; YMMV.</p>

<h2>            Transferring points between family members</h2>
                    Is there a way to transfer Xbox Live points between family members? I understand this was possible under the old Family Membership, but I believe this membership type is no longer available. Is that correct? My son has been accruing points under my membership
 and he is looking to have his points merged with his player's profile. Please advise if this is possible and how. Many thanks,
                </div>

<p><span>Do you mean gamerscore, the number that increases when you unlock achievements? Those cannot be transferred between accounts, and they couldn't be under the Family Plan, either; there has never been moving/merging
 of gamerscore.<br />
<br />
It's a little confusing because people often call gamerscore "points", which could then be confused with Microsoft Points. The latter Points have now been replaced by local currency, but achievements and gamerscore remain.</span></p>
