<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here is the answer:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Do your email messages contain large attachments that are over 25MB?</li></ol>
<p>-- It's a few lines text file not more than few kbs</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Have you made any changes on your Outlook.com account?</li></ol>
<p>-- No, I have observed this problem from 31 July 2017 AEST</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Have you tried to send an email through Outlook.com using another web browser?</li></ol>
<p>-- Yes, still the same issue. All of my email are in draft folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Please help immediately. I have some business critical email needs to be sent from this one and only authenticated email address (As my vendor only trust this email address)</p>

<h2>            &#34;Quick Access Toolbar&#34; has replaced Full-Width Ribbon without my asking</h2>
                    <p>After installing and using Avery Label Toolbar into Word, it appeared at as just another tab in my full Ribbon for a day or two last week. Then two days later I find that the full Ribbon with all editing tabs is now gone, replaced by a "Quick Access Toolbar",
 and the "Avery" tab is also gone. I'm suspecting that adding the Avery program is incidental to the change in the ribbon I'm now seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that I could perhaps regain the original default Ribbon with all tabs &amp; commands, however that choice is greyed out/non functional when I click on "Customize Quick Access Toolbar", and I don't know if this Quick Access Toolbar's default resembles
 the original full Ribbon. I have a licensed version of Office so I don't understand why the full Ribbon has been replaced without my permission with a "Quick Access Toolbar" that has a small fraction of the formatting options on it.

            <p>Most likely the Ribbon is just hidden. If you can see any Ribbon tabs, double-click on one to restore the Ribbon, but if, as seems more likely, you don't see the Ribbon at all, look in the top right corner of the window for this array:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09f2687f-944b-419a-b624-f3a5248de66e" /></p>
<p>Click the middle button and select <strong>Show Tabs</strong> or <strong>Show Tabs and Commands</strong>. Even with the Ribbon hidden, you can made it appear if you click the blue border at the top of the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible this is not your issue since the QAT is not displayed when the Ribbon is hidden. Right-click on the QAT and choose
<strong>Customize the Ribbon</strong>. In the <strong>Customize the Ribbon and keyboard shortcuts</strong> dialog, make sure that all the
<strong>Main Tabs</strong> are checked. If they are, and you're still not seeing the Ribbon, then the likelihood is that the Avery add-in (which is quite unnecessary since Word is quite capable of printing Avery labels) is the problem.</p>

            Thanks very much for your reply! For some reason this problem spontaneously went away a week later on its own. When it was occurring the options you were referring to were mostly greyed out so I couldn't access them.

            Thanks very much for your reply! For some reason this problem spontaneously went away a week later on its own. I will delete the Avery Wizard for good measure if I notice any other issues. I did look for Avery 5160 labels in the Word Mail function, and
 tried inputting two addresses on an open sheet, however even if I hit "return" to jump to another label on the page there was nothing to show how to move between label spaces, or to view the document as it's being written, just the dialogue box to type in
 single addresses. It may be a&nbsp;catch 22, that until I delete the Avery program, or reload Office 2013, that this option in Word may not work? Thanks again.

    <title>Word Table &#40;Keep rows together&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg maxey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Table &#40;Keep rows together&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a procedure that:</p>
<p>1. Gets a list of images from a folder.<br />
2. Counts the number of images in the list<br />
3. Creates a Word table with a heading row and then&nbsp;two rows (one for the caption and one for the image) for&nbsp;the number of images in the list.<br />
4.&nbsp; Inserts heading text,&nbsp;the&nbsp;captions, and the images in the appropriate rows.</p>
<p>The problem is keeping the caption and image rows from being split between two pages.&nbsp; Sometimes depending on the picture size the caption row (for a caption/image row pair) is at the bottom of one page and its image is at the top of the next page.</p>
<p>AFAIK there is no "keep two or more rows together" feature available with Word tables.&nbsp; Right?</p>
<p>I have worked out a separate procedure that I can run after the table of images and captions is complete:</p>
<p>Sub ScratchMacro()<br />
Dim oTbl As Word.Table<br />

<p>How about as you insert each caption, have the code format that paragraph so that it is kept with the next paragraph</p>

<p>
</p><p>Whats the way to set the language in all ppt slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine is configured in spanish, but quite frequently I construct presentations in other languages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every word or sentence is introduced in spanish. I need to change the language in all of the manually</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to do it all at once?</p>

    <title>windows 10 preview feedback&#58; bring back small icons for start menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> an-engineer  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 preview feedback&#58; bring back small icons for start menu stuff, wish list, bug fixes</h2>
                    <p>Please bring back ability to choose small icons (like 16x16 or 32x32) for <br />
</p>
<p>I need a high-density start menu, and the taskbar needs to work across my 3 disparate monitors.
<br />
</p>
<p>as things are now in windows 10, the start menu is way too coursly-grained for me to be productve3 in my development environment. I need a lot of applications available in the taskbar and in the start menu right offhand, at least 30. windows 7 had that correct,
 but the taskbar icons could be smaller maybe or I would like to choose the size - too much wasted blank space around the icons that wastes screen real estate.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>could the time on the taskbar include seconds as an option?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>windows 10 UI uses large tiles and icons, too big for me, I need them much smaller, I would even like to reduce the font size to increase desktop density (I am myopic). I need to get a LOT more stuff on the screen real estate.<br />
</p>
<p>besides, screen space is at a premium, there isn't much of it, and it's expensive, and desk space is expensive. don't waste it with big quarter-screen-sized touch icons when I am using a desktop with a mouse.<br />
</p>
<p>I also discovered that those touch desktops are proximity sensitive when a client brought one over. annoying, and messes me up when I am trying to do a task. I need to be able to enable/disable the touch screen on a touch screen desktop easily and just use
 the mouse and keyboard, and do it easily (shouldn't be hard to find).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ALL the settings need to be in the control panel in one place. with windows 8 they were scattered about all over the GUI and OS under various hotkeys and gestures. this makes it very unproductive trying to configure the computer trying to find all the cubbyholes.
 put it all in the control panel where people expect to find it. I also find it a bit unnerving that when I go to the control panel and choose small icons view, it doesn't stay that way (and that's with windows 7).&nbsp; people discovered a way to fix this problem,
 it's by making a folder that's named with a certain GUID. <a href="http://www.tothepc.com/archives/open-god-mode-on-windows-7-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to Open god Mode on Windows 8, 7 &amp; Vista</a> <br />
</p>
<p>this should not be necessary.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would also like the cmd shell shift command to eliminate me having to do<br />
</p>
<p>shift<br />
</p>
<p>shift<br />
</p>
<p>shift<br />
</p>
<p>shift<br />
</p>
<p>and instead me specify<br />
</p>
<p>shift 4 (I would keep the /n switch too), the above would save a fair number of lines of code in my scripts.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the for /d and /f command needs a way to handle the () peren argument with files that have spaces in them. currently, it doesn't handle them well, breaking 1 filepath with spaces up as separate "files".<br />
</p>
<p>for example, for /f %x in ('dir/s/b *.txt')<br />
</p>
<p>and how do I pipe that dir command into a *nix text utility?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the cmd shell's ^ needs to escape every character, especially spaces and special characters. if I start my editor with<br />
</p>
<p>editor abc^ def^ ghi.txt<br />
</p>
<p>right now it's going to edit the files abc, def, and ghi.txt, and this is a bug. it should edit "abc def ghi.txt" and ^ should escape the spaces. this is necessary in certain batch files where you are specifying a filespec as an argument (so it would be
 %1) and I am specifying drive letters in a for %%x loop, so the full resulting filespec would be %%x:\%1<br />
</p>
<p>currently, I must feed the argument to the batch file with double quotes.&nbsp; "abc def ghi.txt"<br />
</p>
<p>this would result in the expansion (no workaround):<br />
</p>
<p>d:\"abc def ghi.txt"<br />
</p>
<p>which is an invalid filespec. which brings me around to the point that it's not just spaces, but other characters need to be escaped. in the cmd shell, people don't really think about it, but the space, ', ", ^, % and some others has a special meaning in
 the shell, so it's really a special character. so these need to be escapable. the engineers would know what those are.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>^ could also escape control codes if a color ANSI terminal driver were included (hint hint) in the cmd shell, similar to NNANSI.sys the kind where we can address and query rows and columns on the screen and set foreground and background colors, and change
 attributes and characters, and this driver could enable interesting and easier-to-read colored prompts and make for menus and such without having to leave the cmd shell. the ANSI driver should be easily enable-able, such as by setting an environment variable,
 or by executing a built-in command. it would be even nicer if this could be made available for older versions of windows. I think developers, IT/IS, system admins, and cmd-shell-script users would really like this. somehow this driver got lost between DOS
 and Windows, and many nice things were built with it. The minus to it is that if you TYPE somefile.exe you will get your screen messed up, so there needs to be an ANSI terminal reset command like, say, ANSIRESET.exe - a person may be flying blind for a second
 (well, they could close the shell as a workaround, but you lose your environment), but they could get things back to normal without doing a cls (which only clears the screen and has nothing to do with ANSI, although there is a screen clear command in ANSI
 if I am not mistaken). the ANSI driver would have to accommodate the cmd shell visible-window-console-layout (size in characters).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also need a way to specify a character by character codes in the cmd shell using some escape character mechanism. I would suggest since you have already chosen ^ for an escape character something like ^xFFFFFFFF (case insensitive) and ^o37777777777 and
 ^d4294967295 ^b11111111111111111111111111111111 for 2^32-1, and for 2^16-1 ^xFFFF (case insensitive) and ^o177777 and ^d65535 ^b1111111111111111 (normal windows unicode16) it's using a fixed number of digits which could possibly be a fixed amount of digits
 (I don't have anything for decimal, but it would probably have to be a fixed number of digits also if embedded within a string like it ought to be.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I need a decent cmd shell that works (especially the ^ escape character to escape ALL the special characters, you can work it out) and ability to put " within double-quoted strings on the command-line, and I would like to have command.com (for DOS compilers
 to make my disk utilities) and NTVDM in 64-bit windows. despite the intel proc manual, I have been assured by the FreeDOS folk that it can be done despite a multicore processor environment. and there needs to be some sort of way to specify an escaped character
 code in the cmd shell.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the cmd shell's if statement needs nested if statements to work. in fact, the cmd shell commands should be nestable to be usable for complex stuff.<br />
</p>
<p>and I need the ability to set an environment variable from the contents of a file (that may be a suite of *nix-like text utilities?).<br />
</p>
<p>and the ability for a program to set an environment variable at least in the shell it's running in. right now it's one-way, env vars are only passed down within the running program from the shell, not vice-versa. this could be hugely useful. it could also
 modify the local PATH.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the Locate button needs to come back to windows explorer. same button you find in chm help.<br />
</p>
<p>chm help should be automatically set up with windows I should think, you should not have to right click in the viewer pane and approve it and give it rights for a normal user, even for an account with admin rights. help should not be that hard to use for
 any application, folks. it should run out of the box. it's been this way since - what - XP? 2000? help should just work.<br />
</p>
<p>needs to be fixed. please. thanks.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am also hoping for a at least a 128-bit OS, 128-bit processor, and a C++ compiler that generates 128-bit code. or 256-bit. the integer math stuff can be done using bigint calculations. I could definitely use bigint in C++ and in other Visual Studio languages.
 I need at least that many bits for just average time calculations. to give you an idea, for the year 2,056, assuming 365.24224 days in a tropical year (apparently it varies with time), 24 hours per day, 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute, 1000 milliseconds
 per second:<br />
</p>
<p>(2,056*365.24224*24*60*60*1000)^2/2^90=3.400,447,632,825,848,339,127,930,430,869,639,621,960,232,034,325,599,670,410,156,25 (a time multiply with millisecond resolution requires 90 bits).<br />
</p>
<p>(calculation done with ttcalc, but I do mine usually with integers). I sometimes do time multiplies in this format. someone else may choose to do ns instead, so a larger number of bits would be needed for such a high resolution clock: (2,056*365.24224*24*60*60*1000^3)^2/2^132=0.773,172,276,427,851,179,307,238,096,696,355,483,336,499,681,701,206,934,669,734,494,036,674,732,342,362,403,869,628,906,25
 so about 132 bits is needed for a nanosecond-resolution clock, which is what you find in PC's I think, so you are looking at a 256-bit PC to handle this type of stuff. the problem with making such things is you could run into problems with encryption technologies
 at that number of bits - it could require an increase in the encryption bit size or a push for better encryption methods. the workaround being if you need bigint, make it available in the language. it not necessarily super-fast since it's implemented in software,
 but that could be a deterrent against increasing the number of encryption bits.</p>
<p>the plus side to having the CPU implement the wide number of bits is that languages like javascript, C++, C, VB, etc could soon start to have that number of bits as native types, and maybe even something 2x, such as what you find in VC++'s __int128 data
 type (only works in x64 proc targets) with current 64-bit architecture.</p>

            i for one am saying that 10 is looking good there off to a dam good start here sure maybe some minor changes, this should make a wider variety of people quite happy i think its going to do real good, something they definitely should have considered with
 8, you can sure see they are learning from there mistake in 8 keep up the good work ms -i believe this one will make everyone a whole lot happier for sure.

    <title>E71 and Symbian or S60 operating systems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E71 and Symbian or S60 operating systems</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have loved my Nokia E71 smartphone so far. The only thing that really tweeks me is not being able to try or use the ton of new things that come out daily for other operating systems like Android, Blackberry, and Windows Mobile. Is there a site or Symbian
 program that would show Symbian alternatives to programs from other operating systems?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It almost seems like a punishment to see what the other operating systems get to play around with when Symbian is treated like a re-headed step child. It seems like we are left out in the cold often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the fix would be to buy a phone with one of the more popular mobile operating systems or use a cell carrier that uses one of the above mentioned operating systems. The company I use gives me unlimited text, internet, and voice services for $45 a month
 which is tons better than the $75-$110 I would be paying for limited usage. The sad trade-off is less choices of upper-end cell phones. Where I'm at, Straight Talk only offers 3-4 smart phones and all of them are Symbian or S60 operating systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If similiar apps were offered for our opearting system, I'd be tickled beyond beleif! Any thoughts or advice? I really don't see myself going with a more expensive cell plan or utilizing anything besides Nokia phones. Nokia is what I have to choose from
 and, quite honestly, I'm very pleased with Nokia phones aside of the operating system sadness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any input! I hope y'all have a great week and weekend!</p>

<p>I don't think you'll find such a web site, but if you post a list of the programs you're looking for (here or in the Phone Applications forum), there may be software out there that you haven't found yet.&nbsp; I am mostly interested in phone and network utilities,
 so perhaps my needs are meager, but I've generally found everything I want...even if it's taken a few months.</p>

<p>You could always get a newer, unlocked, Nokia while keeping your "cheap" plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess that Symbian^3 phones (the 701 (coming soon) looks really good) have currently a bigger choice of "modern" apps than the E71.</p>

<p>I have wondered about something like that. I am not familiar with unlocked phones or how to unlock a phone for use with cell carriers. I've seen it mentioned quite often but have not had the opportunity to fiddle with the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd love to do that but have kind of been afraid I'd get a terrific phone and the unlocking procedure wouldn't be succesful for one reason or another. I just need to do some research on unlocking. Should be easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I was afraid of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking for functional apps mainly. I don't game or do anything but use the phone for texting, calls, and very light surfing. The main app I want is a very good paid or free app for blocking SMS and unwanted calls. I use Kaspersky 8 currently, but it
 doesn't quite do everything I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want the SMS and calls blocked or refused completely. Kaspersky puts calls in a Black List for me, but the callers can still leave voicemail. I have not found a setting to stop that. I have seen several blocking apps listed in the app store but hate having
 to pay for something and then discover it's not what it's cracked up to be. My budget doesn't allow for that kind of experimenting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also looking for a better antivirus and internet security program for my phone. I have not been real happy with Kaspersky 8 or 9 and have even gotten rid of it on my computers. I now use Vipre Antivirus and I'm happy with them for my computers. They
 do have a smartphone program, but not for S60 and Symbian operating systems. Sadness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your input! Have a great weekend!</p>

<p>Well the good thing about unlocked/unbranded phones is that you don't have to unlock them do you? ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You just buy it and use it with whatever SIM card/network you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the antivirus, I don't quite get why you need an antivirus. I think they are mostly harmful for normal smartphones (perhaps Android needs one though). There are basically no viruses for (current) Symbian phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never had or used a call blocking application, but you might try "Advanced Call Manager" or "Best Blacklist" (look in OVI store).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>I highly recommend BlackBaller Pro from Killer Mobile @ <a href="http://www.killermobile.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.killermobile.com</a>﻿ .&nbsp; I was in your same situation last year, and tested every call blocker I could find.&nbsp; The problem, I think, is these programs all work by simulating a press of the red "hang up" button...which sends the call to voice mail,
 just as a manual key press would.&nbsp; But BlackBaller Pro is the only program I've found with the ability to play back a random sound clip and then hang up.&nbsp; You could record 2 seconds of dead air, for example.&nbsp; This simulates actually answering the call, and
 so no voice mail.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1681324-Call-blocking-software-suggestions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1681324-Call-blocking-software-suggestions</a>﻿ for some of my other findings.</p>

<p>Thanks for the information! I actually had never heard of viruses or other malware for Symbian either, but that paranoia had been at the back of my mind. I'd rather not have it on my phone because it seems to be more of a pain in the booty than anything
 else. I just don't surf enough to make antivirus worthwhile and I never deal with email on my phone either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have my curiosity peaked with the unlocked phones. I'm not much on demanding the newest technology as soon as it comes out...which is VERY often.... but having tech toys several months to a couple of years behind everything else is aggravating. It'll
 be nice to see what's out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is outstanding and very much appreciated. Thanks tons for the information and suggestion! I'm going to look the 2 links over and more than likely snag that program. I wasn't aware of how the "call blockers" actually worked. I didn't know most of them
 operated the way you described and I'm actually a bit aggravated they don't work the way I had hoped. That "trial by error" process is a pain!</p>

            This is really sad. It is a VERY important question / comment and there is only one other half heart-ed reply. There should be thousands. I like my Windows 8.1 phone so much better than iphones or the android phones I have had. The interface seems cleaner,
 I like the look and feel of it. Somehow it seems more sophisticated or something. Unfortunately I am going to have to give it up when it is time to upgrade. I need an email client for POP3 ir IMAP, not the viewer that comes with the phone. American Airlines
 doesn't have a WinPhone app, neither does my bank. Weight Watchers and my **** have apps for android &amp; iOS but I lost those when I got my Windows Phone. I really liked my Swift Key android keyboard app but no WinPhone version.&nbsp; I don't really understand
 why MS doesn't encourage those apps or write some themselves and give them to these companies. Something is really wrong and it seems like MS is trying to kill its phones instead of competing. It just baffles me; this is a superior

            <p>You are correct, it is very sad, it is as if Microsoft is so happy with their leadership with Windows on the PC that they really do not care!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been loyal to MS for years, in fact as early as DOS 1.0!&nbsp; We went thru the **** with the first Windows seeing the future!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we are still loyal, and have just upgraded to the Nokia 1320 on Cricket, has 8.1, want 10, but it will not be available for this phone, only the 1520, if you spend almost $500 for the phone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great phone great price, but still not 10!&nbsp; Have 10 on everything else I own, what is up?</p>

    <title>How do I stop chat from automatically UPLOADING a file&#63; Skype chat - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crenshaw-axelrod  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop chat from automatically UPLOADING a file&#63;  Skype chat 8.40.x</h2>
                    <p>Moving a file into a chat window AUTOMATICALLY uploads the file.&nbsp; NO USER INTERACTION, NO SEND BUTTON.... just GO.<br />
<br />
It used to just <strong>load the file into the <em>message compose area </em>and it did not upload to the receiver until you hit SEND,</strong>
<em><strong>explicitly</strong></em>.&nbsp; NO AUTOMATIC upload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scoured the settings - no luck.&nbsp; AND, I tried turning off auto-DOWNLOAD, nope.
<br />
<br />
Is this another step that Skype decided needed to be done FOR users who cannot do anything for themselves, or who they think are in too much of a hurry to hit a Send button? &nbsp;
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>Or can we toggle this?&nbsp; </strong></span><br />
<br />
The way it works now, actually makes extra steps and slows the process down, often.&nbsp; Happy to explain why.<br />
<br />
<strong>WHAT WOULD BE GREAT:&nbsp;</strong> is the ability to INSERT a file into the MIDDLE of a single chat message, then hit send.... and it all goes at once, file in the middle of the message.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Skype Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The feature&nbsp;of uploading files that have been dragged to the Skype window was added to make it easier for Skype users to send files, instead of attaching them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have accidentally or unintentionally sent a file or dragged it to the window in error, you can just easily delete or remove it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the feedback and suggestion. We just would like to ask you to post them directly in this link:

    <title>How do I turn off automatic punctuation in Word 2016 for Mac&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scidoc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off automatic punctuation in Word 2016 for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I type in Word, it inserts a period at the end of EVERY sentence even if I have already punctuated that sentence. &nbsp;I cannot, after hours of searching databases, find a solution to this very annoying problem. &nbsp;If I type: Do you want to go to the zoo?
 the program will put a period after the question mark. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use two spaces at the end of a sentence and that has to stay that way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this? &nbsp;Right now, I have to manually go back &amp; delete the period.</p>

            Hi Marcos,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Individual delete is possible only for alerts sent by you where you can right click &gt; Remove
<br />
<br />2. If you want to delete the received alerts - It will not be possible to delete received alerts individually through Skype application. But you can delete the entire conversation by right clicking on left pane &gt; Delete conversation.
<br />
<br />If you delete from your device doesn't mean that the history will be deleted on the side of the person who you chatted with. They will remain intact on their side.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.       
        </p>

            Hallo Marcos, <br />
I am Azzurra, an Independent Advisor. <br />
Log in to your skype account, choose the conversation you want to delete, right click on it, select Delete conversation and confirm the operation .
<br />
<del>To delete the conversation history open Windows File Explorer, usually the history is located under this path C: \ Users \ UserName \ AppData \ Roaming \ Skype and delete the folder with your name that you use on Skype,
</del><br />
Nice to help you

<p>Hi GrahamARC,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest you check if the issue happens in different browsers. (Internet Explorer/Chrome/Firefox)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, we suggest you confirm with the global administrators in your tenant, see if they have configured the Idle-sessions timeout.</p>
<p><span>To view the idle browser sign-in settings,
</span><span>use the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Get-SPOBrowserIdleSignOut</span><span> cmdlet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the detailed information in
<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/Introducing-Idle-Session-Timeout-in-SharePoint-and-OneDrive/ba-p/119208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>@Donald, </p>
<p>If the issue persists after you refer to the suggestions, since the issue on your side is a little different from that on GrahamARC's side, to ensure you get the best support, please post a new thread in the forum, we will focus on it and provide corresponding
 troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Frances,</p>
<p>You can use this account on your phone and it proves that your Office 365 account is fine. let’s troubleshoot the issue from these way:</p>
<p>Could you please provide your login address to us,&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.office.com/OWA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://outlook.office.com/OWA</span></a> or

<p>Which browsers you have used to login to Office 365? Please clear the browser cache and try using
<strong>InPrivate</strong> mode to sign in with this account.</p>
<p>Please let us know the result after these steps.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            &#34;add&#47;modify ftp locations&#34; not available in office 2010</h2>
                    <p>Our users run reports which are saved to a server.</p>
<p>There is a userid setup that allows users to ftp to the server to pull up the reports in word or excel.</p>
<p>In all previous versions of Office, there was a "add/modify ftp locations" option in the Open menu. I am unable to find this option in office 2010.</p>
<p>This option is critical to many of our users' day to day operations. I'd hate to have to uninstall Office 2010 and go back to an older version of Office where this is available.</p>

            <p>I tried it yesterday, but could not get past the location portion. </p>
<p>Today I looked at the examples and after trial and error I just used the following:</p>
<p>ftp://bannerdb&nbsp; (bannerdb is the server the reports write to).</p>
<p>Don't use the full path to the directory the files are in. I tried 
ftp://bannerdb/banner/jobsub/ftpuser and ftpuser as the user name. This caused&nbsp; explorer to try to find the directory /bannerdb/banner/jobsub/ftpuser/banner/jobsub/ftpuser and gave an error. By just using the server name, the login id was able to find the
 correct folder.</p>
<p>From MSWord, you do an open and look for the name you gave the location (it doesn't give a drive letter). When you click on it, it will prompt for a password. I was able to find the report that I ran and opened it in Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to print OneNote pages (either to PDF or to an actual printer), and include the header on each page? That is, can the title of the "page" be included on every page/paper?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using OneNote for our progress notes for rehab in a school setting, and have named each page the client's name. When we print them out, we need to have the client's name on each page. Is this possible?</p>

<p>Hi Brandis,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OneNote</strong> is a digital notebook, you can print the pages but you need to edit each page to get the result you would like to have. As you've mentioned, you would like to have the same Header on every page. To achieve this, we recommend that
 you will export the page as a Word document so you can design the layout in Word. To do this you can go to
<strong>File &gt; Export</strong> and layout the necessary Header on each page from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, just don't hesitate to let us know. </p>

                    <p>I keep having my Neat scanner program crash and have to reset. I opened a trouble request and they said&nbsp; my virus program is causing the Neat program to crash and I have to disable the virus program or create an exception to allow the Virus program to not
 shut down the Neat software. The following is from Neat:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"an error caused the program to shut down" </p>
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the response.<br />
<br />
I do understand that you are <br />
having this difficulty but we rally need to disable the antivirus from your <br />
computer, if you know someone who knows to disable norton please do contact that <br />
person.<br />
<br />
The reason why we have to turn off the antivirus it is because it <br />
is trying to access your database that is why your unable to access neat. You <br />
can actually ask the it guy if he can put exemption to neat.<br />
<br />
Let me know <br />
how this works.<br />
<br />

</p><p>Please note the program starts scanning the receipts and sometime will work and most times shuts the program down and I have to restart. Usually the second or third try the receipts get scanned.</p>

            <p>I am also of the opinion that your antivirus program is not responsible for the crashing of the Neat scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your installed antivirus program? You selected Microsoft Security Essentials, yet your pasted response from Neat's "technical support" indicates Norton as the antivirus.</p>

            <p>One of the problems I was having with Neat's solution was I did not know how to temporary disable the virus program. After playing with the program I saw a way to exempt certain programs and entered the Neat software. I then did a small scan of about 5 or
 6 receipts and the program did not crash. With that being said when I did large quantities of receipts 15 - 20 (in the past not since I did the exemption) the program shut down. Until I have a larger quantity of receipts to scan I won't really know. I am thinking
 about putting in 20+ of already scanned receipts and if it works or not I can delete them afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought their answer was far fetched but they had me send the log from the program to them (on 2 different occasions) To make a long story longer I will try the scan again and let you know.</p>

<p>Did you (a) uninstall the Norton application AND THEN (b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed Microsoft Security Essentials or any other anti-virus application?</p>
<ul>
<li>Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The Norton "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.; cf.

            <p>Sorry for the long delay. I forgot my MS password and got busy. I am 99% sure that when I removed Norton I did contact Norton and they had me download the removal tool and take care of the program. I found a way to exclude neat from the virus protection
 and the program still crashes.</p>
<p>The Neat company sent me a request to have their live tech call me when I have a 2 hour window, which I have not had. I tried to use the program again today and scanned about 16 receipts and after ripping one that got caught and all went through the program
 crashed again. After restarting the neat program only 5 of the receipts developed. It is not a time saver at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
