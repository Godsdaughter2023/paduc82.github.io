<h2>            Start Menu Gone</h2>
                    <p>Hallelujah! I found a registry hack that allowed me to totally get rid of the start menu in build 9926.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really hope that we have that option when 10 goes RTM.</p>

            What do you mean "totally get rid of"?&nbsp; How do you start your things without a start menu?&nbsp; Open File Explorer and dig through the program files to find the executable?

<div>I disabled McAfee and installed <span>Microsoft Security Essentials on a 64bit Windows 7 PC. Then when I uninstalled McAfee I got a blue screen. I recovered the system to before the uninstall and noticed that McAfee Firewall

            Your phone asks for formatting when you insert the memory card?<br />
If yes, then copy all your memory card data to your pc, insert your memory card into your phone and format the memory card.<br />
After formatting using your phone, you can copy back the data to your memory card.<br />
Now the phone won't ask for formatting again.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            To add to srikanthsd's post, after copying the data to pc first format it in the pc. Now insert card in the phone &amp; format again. See if the card is working without data. If yes "copy-paste" &amp; not move the data to your card. See if it is ok. If yes then
 fine. If no, switchoff the phone &amp; remove card. Now with the data in card, open its properties in Windows. There you will various options. In it select tools- scan &amp; fix the drive for errors. It will open a new window. Select both options in it &amp; proceed.
 If it finds errors, they will be fixed. Sometimes it will corrupt the images. So do remember to have a copy of all your data on the pc.

<p>Connect your phone to a computer &amp; select Nokia Suite mode. If you do not have Nokia Suite on your PC you can download it from
<a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here.</a> Now back up all the data of the phone except settings. Disconnect the phone from PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the main screen press *#7780#. Use the security code when prompted. This will reset the phone settings. Now try the card again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If problem persists, on main screen press *#7370#. This will delete all the personal data along with settings. Now try the card again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If problem persists connect your phone to a computer &amp; select Nokia Suite mode. Open the Nokia Suite &amp; click on the “green icon of arrow pointing downwards”.</p>
<p>If any updates are available they will be shown in ‘green’. If not you may reinstall the current version. Reinstall option is shown in ‘blue’. If no option to reinstall is shown, please wait for sometime it will become visible. &nbsp;Then the Nokia Suite will
 download the new software version of the phone. After it you will be prompted to take a complete back up of the device content. Please
<strong><u>do not skip</u></strong> this step as reinstallation will erase all the personal data from the phone like contacts, messages, calendar entries etc.</p>
<p>Please note that if you have set a memory card password &amp; you have forgotten its code then take a backup of the card data also as the card will be locked after update and can only be unlocked if you enter the correct code or by ways mentioned in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/8585FFB1-9990-4929-B9ED-0FAFE0367E6D">
this thread.</a></p>
<p>Also note that while updating the device ensure the following things-</p>
<ol>
<li>The device is full charged.</li><li>The internet connection Is of good speed &amp; has a backup in case of power loss.</li><li>The PC should also be connected to back up power source as if the process is interrupted the phone may go dead. More on update failure &amp; its remedies
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/CBAC00CC-7651-4DCF-8B11-8A6E5DC30D4E">
here.</a></li><li>Please do not run any resource intensive programs in the background while updating as it may freeze the PC which in turn will lead to a dead device.</li><li>Ignore all the windows pop-up notifications about device being disconnected.</li></ol>
<p><strong><u>DO NOT DISCONNECT THE PHONE UNTIL UPDATE IS COMPLETED.</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It will be better if you disable security keyguard &amp; PIN code request before proceeding with Update/Reinstallation.</li><li>Sometimes the device may show Test Mode. Do not panic &amp; <strong>DO NOT</strong> remove the cable. Let the process complete.</li></ol>

<p>The availability depends on Product code / Country ..and also whether the device is locked to any Network..hence even if Nokia releses an update, that need not be for your particular device. So, its YOU who need to keep on checking every now and then. Though
 regular visits to this Forum may (or should) provide you that information ..</p>

Out of curiosity, what is the nature of your need for the current row number?&nbsp; I ask because, as you may be aware, row numbers are mutable -- a function of the user interface and its current sort sequence.&nbsp; Most operations in a relational database are, well,

<h2>            Problems after cancelled installation</h2>
                    I had to cancel a running installation of Office 365 (Windows) because of an internet connection which was much too slow. I aborted the installation as it was done about 50 percent approximately. Now I wanted to install Office 365 again but got an error:
 not possible cause the programm is busy with something else (I think that's a hint of the incomplete installation). What can I do now to complete the installation or to do it again from the beginning? Thank you very much for your answer(s).

    <title>Open Post To Microsoft, Visa Sync Center &#38; WMDC Does Not Work. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open Post To Microsoft, Visa Sync Center &#38; WMDC Does Not Work. Post Here If You Agree</h2>
                    
<p><span>Microsoft,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sync Center and Windows Device Center do not work. It's as simple as that, like it or not. Forums everywhere are filling up with posts on how your new sync software does not work. In my case,
 I have had to resort to manually comparing the files between my mobile device and my Vista desktop. They are seldom in sync, especially when the files were&nbsp;created on the mobile device. The same is true, to a lesser extent, for calendar, task and contacts.
 Pathetic!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am also unable to sync with two devices as Sync Center renames my device ID to WINDOWSMOBILEnn where the number at the end changes every time. I like many others have a work XP laptop. Of course
 WMDC will not work with Activesync on the 2nd platform when this happens. You have known about the problem for months yet no action. Shame!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems like accurate sync is not a priority for you. This will prove more costly than you think. I don't have a WM device because I like having to solve problems&nbsp;or help debug your code. I
 have it for one reason only - to make my mobile, hectic lifestyle more organized. Without accurate sync there is no reason to consider a WM device or your related software titles or the entire portfolio of titles from the ISVs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To the rest of the forum, if you agree, then post here. They don’t need to see the light, just feel the heat. Let them know how the device and their software on it is worthless to you if it won't
 sync. Let your favorite add on vendor know that you can't see yourself spending any more money on their software till this gets fixed. Let the manufacturer of your device know. Let the cellular companies know. Jump all over the puff reviewers who obviously
 don't try to use this stuff for real. I bet a number of you were induced to buy after reading one of those puff pieces. Now you are here, looking at 7000 threads just on this problem alone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Device and software quality in this space is at an all time low. It's time to turn up the heat!! Don't keep spending your money on things that don't work. You would not tolerate that in any other
 product category. Get loud and let's force some changes. It's all a matter of priority and willingness to spend money on quality developers and testers. It can be done, if there is the will and the felt need to get it done.</span></p>

<p>I would agree.&nbsp; I've had my 700WX for 5 months now.&nbsp; It's a great device in most areas..EXCEPT for the fact I have yet to be able to sync it w/ my Vista based&nbsp;laptop.&nbsp; I've spent countless hours on forums, installing/unstalling WMDC, all with zero positive
 results.&nbsp; Synching would be nice, but is not a huge issue, as I've found ways around that.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's more the point that MS has a track record of releasing software well before it's really ready.&nbsp; I believe they do this because the public is feeding off the hype
 that MS has created for whatever particular program, in this case, Vista.&nbsp; Vista&nbsp;was known to have issues not playing well w/others and was&nbsp;released before&nbsp;it was&nbsp;ready.&nbsp; Combine this with WMDC, a new sync program&nbsp;that was very different than ActiveSync and
 you have a recipe for disaster.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree most heartly with a quote from Road_Trip's original post in this forum, "Without accurate sync there is no reason to consider a WM device."&nbsp; Had I know this, I would have stayed a BlackBerry user and never even considered a PPC.</p>

<p>I am experiencing similar sync issues with WMDC and Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; I can sync fine with my office PC which is XP using Active Sync 4.5&nbsp; I have been able to sync with my VISTA PC WMDC in the past (with my Sprint PPC6700)&nbsp; Now for some reason it no longer
 syncs. I tried reinstalling WMDC and it synced once then stopped again. I checked my firewall settings and even turned off my firewall software (zonealarm), still no success.&nbsp; The suggestion of upgrading to WMDC 6.1 is a non-starter since it seems my unit
 is not connected to the PC, even though I do hear it connect.&nbsp;The installation program requires my device to be connected to the PC.&nbsp; Seems that must be my issue, but why would it connect after I reinstalled WMDC 6?&nbsp;When I reinstalled WMDC 6.0 it synced once
 and then stopped. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked Device Manager and can't seem to locate the unit anywhere. I have tried different USB ports and no difference still cannot connect.&nbsp;Shoudl I delte my device drivers and reinstall them&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very frustrating so much so that if I have to reinstall my OS I will go back to XP and throw out my VISTA CD.</p>

            I have used activesync and windows mobiles since Hp620 days and I have never had as many issues as I have had with WMDC and Vista. It will recognize my device fine one day and then not at all the next unless I reboot or unplug my device a dozen times or
 perhaps it is if I am crossing my fingers and toes while plugging it in. Very frustrating.

<p>I know what everyone is talking about.&nbsp; VISTA and WMDC has caused me issues as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At work I sync with a Win XP Pro machine (ActiveSync), at home I sync with my VISTA Home premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was experiencing sync issues both at work and at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At home my PPC 6700 Sprint phone would not sync with my VISTA PC unless I booted the PC with the phone in the cradle and the unit turned on. That worked, but was a pain with such long boot times on VISTA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At work it would not longer sync all the changes I would make at home or not sync at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reinstalling both ActiveSync and WNDC and not finding any resolution, I&nbsp;did a hard reset on the phone which cleared up the issues I was having at work with ActiveSync.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At home once VISTA SP1 came out I updated my system and it fixed the sync issues I had at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still the performance (lack thereof) with VISTA on my home PC is making me seriously consider upgrade to Windows XP.&nbsp; I have turned off pretty much all the fancy graphics on VISTA in order to improve performance as much as possible. That has
 helped, but the boot times when I do turn off my PC are still incredibly long.</p>

 I, too, am very frustrated with SC and WDC.&nbsp; I have experienced the problems you have quoted, but there is another "feature" that I find even more frustrating.&nbsp; Why, oh why, does MS always have to remove the useful bits when they 'update' to new software.&nbsp;
 I've been using a handheld device of one sort or another for a long time now.&nbsp; One of the most useful features was being able to sync based on category - in this way I could keep work stuff on the work pc and pda, and home stuff just on my pda.&nbsp; This was absolutely
 invaluable, especially when you work for a company that doesn't like personal stuff on the networked pcs.&nbsp; But what do you know, as soon as WDC came out this fantastic feature was removed.&nbsp; Now I have no choice as to what is sync'd - oh, except of course I
 can have up to 6 months of the calendar (what if I want a year, which is also something I could do before).<br />
<br />
I completely agree with para 3 of the original post - I'm tired of trying to find workarounds.&nbsp; Perhaps it's time for that Apple unit after all.<br />

<p>UNBELIEVIBLE!!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically all new PDA's are NOT COMPATIBLE with Vista!&nbsp;&nbsp; Plain and simple, VISTA SUCKS!&nbsp; I am 100% going to swich to Apple.&nbsp; I cant stand the lack of comunication from Microsoft.&nbsp; They just DONT CARE if their product doesnt work because it is
 pre loaded on all new PC's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to the point, I too am haveing problems.&nbsp; I just bought a $400 phone so could snync outlook AND use the phone as a tethered modem when I do business meetings where there is not Wifi available.&nbsp; It worked as advertised, with WMDC and Verizon
 tech making sure I got it right.&nbsp; Well, here is the proble, -- it doesnt work anymore.&nbsp; So this is an intermitant problem with Vista and the system checks, maybe with the USB management protocal and registry entry's???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think, because Vista states this as a feature, we should get a lawyer who wants to threaten with a class action suit.&nbsp; Seriously, this thread will start to collect others with the same problem.&nbsp; We use our PDA's for work, therefore when Microsoft
 fails to provide the product as advertised, they do indeed cause unfair hardships.&nbsp; They WOULD listne if we started a pettion and got a laywer willing to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish ultimate failure of the Microsoft company, from a business standpoint.&nbsp; They desearve NO success as the monopoly/stranglehold they have on PC vendors is the only reason for success the last 15+ years....NOT by providing quality products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I may come back and post a petition website link, what do you all think?</p>

    <title>Copying and pasting in Excel - having issues doing a broad paste - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roccoball  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying and pasting in Excel - having issues doing a broad paste</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to copy a value from one cell (using the Ctrl + C function key), and then paste that value (using Ctrl + V function keys) into many other cells in that same column.&nbsp; This used to work pon my old pc, but now I am getting an error message that
 "The data I am pasting isn't the same size as my selection.&nbsp; Do you want to paste any way?"&nbsp; Can someone tell me now to turn on this functionality?&nbsp; Previously when i tried this, Excel didn't care about the size of the cell I was copying nor the size of the
 cell I was trying to paste into.&nbsp; It just pasted the copied value in the cell without issue.&nbsp; Also, I notice that the flashing dotted line that typicall highlights the cell being copied doesn't remain flashing -- it only flashes for moment when I am making
 the copying keystroke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any guidance would be appreciated.</p>

            Does it contain code?<br />
<p>There are 2 methods you can use.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: (PastSpecial) Separate lines of code required for Copy and PastSpecial plus suppress the message re large amount of data on the clipboard.</strong></p>
<p>rngToCopy.Copy</p>
<p>rngDestin.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues, Operation:=xlNone, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SkipBlanks:=False, Transpose:=False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
'Following line is to suppress message re large amount of dat on clipboard<br />
Application.CutCopyMode = False</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: &nbsp;Single line of code. It simply resizes the destination to the same size as the source and makes the destination equal to source values.</strong></p>
<p>rngDestin.Resize(rngToCopy.Rows.Count, rngToCopy.Columns.Count) = rngToCopy.Value</p>
<p>I prefer Method 2 because it does not change workbooks and sheets to the destination and it does not leave the destination&nbsp;data selected (highlighted).</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ramu,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to receive any emails from your mom’s Rediffmail.com account on your live email address. There is no Non-Delivery Report or the email does not bounce back to her account.
 You have already checked if you have set any rules or if it is blocked by any junk filters. You have also mentioned that you can see these emails once you connect directly to Outlook.com using a browser.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) Which Windows Operating System are you using on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2) If you have multiple email accounts configured with Windows Live Mail, then does this issue occurs on all the accounts?</span></p>
<p><span>3) Are you able to receive the emails from all your other contacts except from your mom’s Rediffmail.com account?</span></p>
<p><span>4) What happens when you click on the “<strong><em>Sync</em></strong>” button to receive the emails? Does it show any error message?</span></p>
<p><span>5) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer or your live account prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please get back to us with these information. For the time being, I suggest you to recheck if your email account settings are properly configured with Windows Live Mail program. Please refer to the
 article given below to check this:</span></p>

            <p>Hi Rajesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Which Windows Operating System are you using on the computer?</span></p>
<p>Any to be frank. I access my emails via browser, so use it at Office and home. Windows 7 and 8.1 mostly</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2) If you have multiple email accounts configured with Windows Live Mail, then does this issue occurs on all the accounts?</span></p>
<p>Windows Live mail application is not used.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3) Are you able to receive the emails from all your other contacts except from your mom’s Rediffmail.com account?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I haven't tried, don't know many who have accounts in Rediffmail to be frank. The last I got emails was on&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">23-10-2013</span></p>
<p><span>4) What happens when you click on the “<strong><em>Sync</em></strong>” button to receive the emails? Does it show any error message?</span></p>
<p>Nothing !</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer or your live account prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>Can't think its computer related as I explained above, its accessed via browser. I don't remember making any changes to my email rules either, which is why I am confused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned Outlook.com as in, I have an alias for my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, and if I email directly to Outlook.com, I can receive the same email !</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see my blocked senders, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** doesn't list there&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff1d84f1-f9b9-41cd-9129-b6d143d35c50" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And manually going through my rules don't show any either, unless its something I can't see. And moreover, if it were a rule, it would have showed up in one of the folders, because none of my rules directly delete emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more suggestions welcome in troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks,</p>
<p>Ramu</p>

<p><span>Thank you so much for getting back to us with all the relevant information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let me know – </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you able to receive any other emails (other than Rediffmail.com) on your Outlook.com account?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this issue happens only with the emails sent by your mom, then I would suggest you to try adding your mom’s email address to the “<strong><em>Safe senders</em></strong>” list of your Outlook.com
 account and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Rajesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already done that, her email is in my safe senders list and I had been through the steps in that post before posting the question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to put things in perspective, I was hoping to get some message trace kind of help with Live mail from somewhere because I have been through the normal diagnostic path !&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test, I created a test account under Rediffmail.com and sent an email to both *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** went into my junk mail directly but I received it&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            please help me reformat my n95</h2>
                    after doing a *#7780#, *#7370# and reinstalling firmware, the phone still is not back to original state. the reason i know this is because i installed x-plore back on the phone after and the application is still registered. so i believe that *#7370# and
 reinstalling firmware just deletes a few items it knows it should delete and then copies files over what was already there rather than reformating the entire thing first.<br />
<br />
can someone tell me how to reformat the phone memory completely? the reason is i installed psiloc connect and ever since then, wifi no longer works. it just keeps connecting forever. please help.

            I have seen a few times where you'd have to go through the steps more than once for it to format properly using *#7370#. Did it ask you to input location, date and time? If not, try the code again until it does.

            The full format is using the 3 finger salute-&gt; turn phone off, press and hold the green (talk) key on the left + number 3 on the keypad + the * key and then turn the phone back on.

<h2>            Numbering in Word 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going nuts.&nbsp; I have done this before and I can't understand why I can't restart the numbering with the same formatting.&nbsp; I try and do it manually, but when I let go of the margin tab it immediately jumps back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm doing a Policy Book.&nbsp; I different sections in each policy to number continuously, but when I start a new policy I want to restart at 1.&nbsp; I'd like to do that for each policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done page break, section break, next page and nothing works.&nbsp; I right click on the first number and try to change it a) to restart and b) pick a value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my headings are wonky too.&nbsp; "link to previous" is selected, but the next page header doesn't show it.&nbsp; Again, I tried all the page break types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I have screwed something up in the styles.&nbsp; I'm creating new ones for this manual.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Is there ANY solution to Slow IE-11 &#40;not Edge&#41; after upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianszafranski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there ANY solution to Slow IE-11 &#40;not Edge&#41; after upgrade to Win-10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've seen other threads for this issue.&nbsp; Those threads have multiple pages with all sorts of obtuse follow-up posts, but I've searched through those many posts, and none seem to put forth an absolute cure for a slow and freezing IE in Win 10 aside from "use
 another browser" or "jump through all these hoops and abide by&nbsp;all these legal what-ifs in case it doesn't work and your PC crashes."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me regain my sanity... please... has anyone found a for-sure solution for an incredibly slow IE (not Edge) in Win 10?&nbsp; I've been trying to access my Time Warner Roadrunner e-mail pages, and eBay.com, and all freeze for a minute or more.&nbsp; On eBay.com
 it seems like the ads are the delay.&nbsp; I keep getting "TWC is not responding" or "eBay is not responding."&nbsp; Also, I'm asked if I wish to end long-running scripts, which does no good, my I keep hoping it will and so I keep clicking on "end script."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd use Edge if it was more user-friendly, but I can't even get the drop-down menu to show up.&nbsp; Without a drop-down menu, how does someone even perform simple tasks like Print, and so many others?&nbsp; It seem very un-user-friendly, to say the least, and so
 trying to use it is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also am disappointed with Windows 10 for not allowing ready access to the Control Panel.&nbsp; How would I even uninstall Windows 10?&nbsp; The upgrade to Win 10&nbsp;was a major mistake On my part, I fully admit that, and one which I now wish to undo before I have a
 coronary and before the one-month time limit is up.&nbsp; Without Control Panel's access to Programs &amp; Features I can't uninstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, for the record, from proverbial Day One I've been a major Microsoft Booster.&nbsp; I've always sided with MS when all my pro-Apple and pro-NeXT friends and co-workers thought me nuts.&nbsp; Even when I wasted countless hours trying to get my PC to run properly&nbsp;I've
 never bashed MS.&nbsp; Windows 10 and Edge has me totally rethinking&nbsp;my pro-MS philosophy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to rant here, but I am truly at my limit of patience.&nbsp; I'd buy a new PC just to end these non-stop Win 10 headaches, but&nbsp;a new PC would only have Win 10.&nbsp; I don't want to jump from the pan into the fire, as it were.&nbsp; I can still go back to Win
 7 with my current PC (right?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help provided.</p>

            <p>KPV... <strong>THANK YOU </strong>for your reply above, and for&nbsp;your offer to help.&nbsp; I'm looking for a simple solution that the average user can perform.&nbsp; At risk of being negative, I do not believe your proposal meets that criteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I believe a proper solution is one which would be performed by MS via updates, not by the user, especially when this user cannot even perform a simple task such as finding
<em>Control Panel</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about just tell us all how to uninstall Windows 10 so we can all get on with our lives, end our frustrations, and thus enjoy a return to normalcy?&nbsp; That would probably be more beneficial than trying to&nbsp;coach non-IT-types like myself to effect a complex
 solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I've been Pro-MS for&nbsp;over 30 years, and I was often&nbsp;in the minority in that regard.&nbsp; I proud of being fairy open minded, instead of being quick to criticize.&nbsp; I'm sorry to rant, but Win 10 finally has me frustrated to the point of openly griping
 about MS and Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one, especially average users, should have to put up with all the things that are just plain wrong with Win 10.&nbsp; We don't need artsy-fartsy operating systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;We just need ones that plain-out work, and by that I mean operating systems that work right
 out of the starting gate, not ones that still have serious issues a month after release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for trying to help me with the issues I'm having with my Win 10 upgrade.&nbsp; Let's just hope we see some quick updates to effect corrections to Windows 10.</p>
<p>

            <p>We're still waiting, Microsoft, for those automatic updates to fix the serious IE-11/Win-10 compatibility problems.&nbsp; My IE-11 is still so slow I'm starting to use Edge, which is just a plain-out awful browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, now that I think of it, it's almost as if you want us to start using
<strong>Edge, your new artsy-fartsy browser.</strong>&nbsp; You know, the one where Bing, MSNBC, Xbox, et al are all shoved down our throats every time we open the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Shakespeare sort of said: <strong><em>First we&nbsp;[get rid of] all the artists...</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, MS, for fixing this issue quickly and automatically so we're not all forced to use Edge, the world's worst browser... you know, the one without a menu bar such that many users will not know how to perform simple tasks.</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem.&nbsp; My laptop, which came with Windows 8.1, I upgraded and have had no problems what so ever.&nbsp; I know that "control panel" is now called "settings".&nbsp; With a little investigation, you can find what you are looking for, and as long
 as you are not over 30 days into using version 10, you can revert to 7.&nbsp; If you are having that much trouble with 10, I suggest going back to 7.&nbsp; Back up all your programs and do a clean install of 7.&nbsp;It sounds to me like you are unhappy with 10 and really
 didn't want to upgrade to it in the first place.</p>
<p>I normally don't respond to blogs, but like you, I am an avid MS user.&nbsp; I have been putting systems together and installing window's OS since 1997.&nbsp; I have built many computers, and have never had any training what so ever.&nbsp; I tend to "do" and if what I
 "do" doesn't work, I start over.&nbsp; I have been lucky.</p>
<p>I am working on finding out why Edge and IE11 worked well in the beginning (on the desktop that started with vista, then upgraded with a clean install to Windows 7) of the Windows 10 upgrade, and then just got slower and slower.&nbsp; The first thing I had trouble
 with was Kaspersky, which has been messing with my IE11.&nbsp; slow to load and run searches and open sites.&nbsp; When this would happen, I turned Kaspersky off and then IE11 worked normally.&nbsp; I upgraded to 10 and installed the Kaspersky "upgrade for 10" and things
 seemed fine.&nbsp; At first.</p>
<p>At this time, I am running the 10 "reset" and will not install Kaspersky and will chalk up the money spent on it a "lesson learned".&nbsp; (their support department and "team" couldn't find a way through a well lit room, let alone help me figure out what is wrong
 with their program)&nbsp; Never recommend Kaspersky again.</p>
<p>Anyway, to make a long story longer, I would suggest you go back to Window's 7 (or whatever program you had previously) and do a clean install.&nbsp; You'll be happier than waiting for MS to solve your issue, and possibly wait for Windows 10 to have some of the
 bugs fixed before you install it again.</p>
<p>I will keep working with it, and accepting what happens. I like the challenge.</p>

            <p>I have IE 11 running on several fresh installs (not upgrades) of Windows 10, including a factory image of Windows 10 on a brand new Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; IE 11 runs very slow in this environment compared to how it ran in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Simply opening the Google
 home page has a 5 to 10 second delay on all machines running Windows 10 and IE 11.&nbsp; No, I don't have a bunch of add-ons.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>And I have had to enable the idiotic Flash Player add-on for certain websites.&nbsp; Why MS insisted on making Flash Player integral in Win-10 is beyond me (OK, we do know...&nbsp;it was obviously
 a money thing).</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Brian,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are right. The feature is limited in OneNote Online. As a workaround as Berd mentioned, you can protect notes with a password on OneNote client (See the bottom 4 articles for OneNote for Windows 10, OneNote 2016, OneNote for Mac, OneNote for iPad
 or iPhone in<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlock-password-protected-sections-in-onenote-online-2945266e-8f33-43b7-8b09-ac68e1ed4093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;Unlock password-protected sections in OneNote Online</a>). From the article,
 we can see then we can also use the password-protected sections in OneNote Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation, I'd like to invite you to submit your idea or vote for this similar idea via&nbsp;<a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327183-onenote-online/suggestions/15452856-share-password-protect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote Online

<h2>            Outllook Subfolders Missing</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I store all my files in sub-folders within In-Folder.&nbsp; I had about 7 sub-folders for each matter I was dealing with, For the past few days I notice that the sub-folders are slowly missing... and this morning ALL the sub-folders are gone!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Why does Microsoft try to fix something that is working???&nbsp; Outlook 2007 was working perfectly, then they decided to give it a new look but lost 50% of their common sense while creating something that they think looks nice in terms of design in Outlook
 2013.&nbsp; ) Now Microsoft is soo proud of their current design in MS office 365 that I can see that 100% of their common sense is lost somewhere between their big intestine and small intestine.)&nbsp; It is as good as designing a chair that looks absolutely wonderful
 but no one can sit on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the staff in Microsoft are looking at the "Emperor's New Clothes" and saying what a fantastic piece of work it is.&nbsp; Sadly there isnt any little kid to point out the truth to Microsoft.......&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate if someone can help me answer the questions on how to retrieve my missing folders.&nbsp; (And if anyone can help locate the Little Kid to point out to the Emperor aka Microsoft please do that too).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does the "In Folder" mean Inbox?</p>
<p>Is the 365 installation a replacement to 2007 that was installed on this PC? If it was and you simply installed 365 nothing would have changed with&nbsp; your Outlook data/contents all would have been as before.</p>
<p>You fail to mention what type of mail account, pop, IMAP or and whether you have a filtered View set</p>

<p>I used to use 2007 (way back in 2007).&nbsp; Then I reluctantly switched to higher upgrades in the respective years ie to Office 2013;&nbsp; &nbsp;Office 2016 (stand alone)&nbsp; and only NOW&nbsp; (2018) I am using 365.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was merely lamenting how backwards Microsoft was getting
 in terms of logic and commonsense when developing programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to your question&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have been using outlook 365 IMAP mail account since Jan 2018 (annual subscription)</p>
<p>2. When I installed Outlook, the mail account I chose was IMAP (it automatically synchronised the folders)</p>
<p>3. I created more folders (within my "In box") according to my business clients (ie placing cursor on folder, clicking right button, selecting "Folder" etc).&nbsp; This was working fine</p>
<p>4. Only a few days ago my folders (within the In-box) - both old folder and new folders started disappearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. I was corresponding with a new client and then decided to put all her email into a specific folder that I had created and now all her emails have disappeared...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I NEVER encountered any problems with outlook 2007. In terms of user functionality it has been the best.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nope... Out of the 7 Folders I had before.&nbsp; Only 1 is there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also all the remaining of the mails from the Inbox (ie those that I did not file or move to folders) have disappeared too)</p>

<p>Last thing to check;</p>
<p>Control Panel (View by large icons) &gt;Mail Applet (mail32bit) &gt;Profiles............. does it show only the single Profile?</p>
<p>If it does your folders have been lost, how, not possible to say, either through inadvertent user action, or a problem with the mail server/supplier. Outlook itself does not delete mail or folders, on its own.</p>
<p>You cannot backup an *.ost data file so any backup you may have had would not help</p>

<p>Sorry I am not too clear about your question or where to find it.&nbsp; I tried and did the following :&nbsp; and clicked on Mail&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;When&nbsp; I click on Outlook 2016, it shows me this</p>

<p>You can only see/check the Outlook Profile via the Control Panel, it cannot be checked within MS Outlook, all you can see in MS Outlook is your mail account settings or Type (Via MS Outlook&gt;File&gt;Account Settings)</p>
