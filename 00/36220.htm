            Hi Ron, please try this:
<br />
<br />lick your Start Button, type Services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />When the Services app opens, scroll down to find the following services, then double click each one in turn, set their startup type to Automatic and start the service if necessary
<br />
<br />1. Function Discovery Provider Host
<br />
<br />2. Function Discovery Resource Publication
<br />
<br />3. SSDP Discovery
<br />
<br />4. UPnP Device Host
<br />
<br />Save that and close the Services app
<br />
<br />That's It!

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and <br />
drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

            Hi aMillion,<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft community! <br />
I am sorry to hear that you are not able to find your photos on sky drive.<br />
How did you upload the photos?<br />
Did you use any browser to upload the photos or through skydrive App?<br />
Did you try to check if the photos are available through internet browser?<br />
Please reply us back to help you better.<br />

            <p>First right click on the Skydrive icon in the Notification Area [Bottom right]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choose....Open your Skydrive Folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are the 4GB of files actually IN your local SkyDrive &nbsp;"Pictures" folder?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they are, then hover over that same Skydrive icon and you should see a</p>
<p>small pop-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mines says "Skydrive&nbsp;- Up to Date."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all that is as I stated,&nbsp;then I cannot solve your problem.</p>
<p>For you SHOULD see all the files in the Photo App.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes AGES to upload photos, and I have a 3GIG connection!</p>
<p>So maybe they are still uploading? Dunno?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they are in the "Document" folder or the "Public" folder</p>
<p>they will not display in the Photo App.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What puzzles me is just WHY the "Public" folder is not viewable in the Photo App.</p>
<p>That's just nuts, the Public can view the pictures but the owner can't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ridiculous!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that matter ALL Skydrive Folders should be accessible to the logged-in computer user</p>
<p>from within the Photo App.</p>

            Well hellllllooo
<div><br />
<div>OK so I moved images into the SkyDrive folder locally. &nbsp;I confirmed that they were in a folder called "My Pictures" in the actual SkyDrive using Internet Explorer before I obliterated the originals (!). &nbsp;I have a second PC on which I have the SkyDrive
 client running, and I confirmed that the images were successfully synced onto that PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From a browser, the images appear with thumbnail previews. &nbsp;They are in JPEG or GIF formats (some are in 3D, but we'll ignore those).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ie, they definitely exist in SkyDrive.</div>

            Hey thanks for reply
<div><br />
<div>OK so the images were in a folder called "My Pictures" on Sky Drive, at the root.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Given your comment about the folder names being an issue, I renamed the folder to Pictures just now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Given that the images now appear in a folder called Pictures, and that this folder is at the root, and that I have confirmed the images do appear in SkyDrive, and that the new folder does appear with this name on the Windows 8 and Windows 7 boxes, I expect
 that the images should appear in Photos.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The images do not appear in Photos.</div>
<div><br />
<div>BOOHOO.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could you let me know your exact folder structure up to the Photos? &nbsp;Maybe I need to replicate that...?</div>

<p>Look carefully at the screen-shot above! Look in the uppermost left hand corner and</p>
<p>you will see the dark blue "SkyDrive" icon. If it is NOT there, it's probably not a properly</p>
<p>configured "SkyDrive".&nbsp; In that case, copy the files somewhere else and then delete that</p>
<p>folder. Go to Control Panel - Remove Programs and uninstall</p>
<p>Microsoft SkyDrive and restart. Then go online/download and re-install it and</p>
<p>choose wisely and REMEMBER the location where you chose to&nbsp;place the SkyDrive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you have a "Microsoft Account/User" issue.</p>
<p><br />
I have 5 MS E-mail Accounts and I also am using Office 365.</p>
<p>So all my accounts are linked.</p>
<p>When I am at Skydrive.com I can log-in as anyone of the five.<br />
When I click my name [is this case] Win Eight, in the upper right<br />
hand corner,</p>
<p><a href="https://69c41a.blu.livefilestore.com/y1pUCUYGIIhKW98H4QfqB9Pm8ZxNS11eqzgS7Tu7X9t4IQ-S147AeKuFPtc5RmsIR-qwXENZTIjDBc/Upper%20Right%20Corner%20-%20User%20Logged%20In.png?psid=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://69c41a.blu.livefilestore.com/y1pUCUYGIIhKW98H4QfqB9Pm8ZxNS11eqzgS7Tu7X9t4IQ-S147AeKuFPtc5RmsIR-qwXENZTIjDBc/Upper%20Right%20Corner%20-%20User%20Logged%20In.png?psid=1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a box drops down that list the other 4 users. I can then click on <br />
any one of them and log-in to a different SkyDrive folder.</p>
<p>The older "Online Drives" [Set up in Win7] do not have a Recycle Bin, <br />
while the ones I set up with Win 8 do.</p>
<p>But I can go/log-in to any one of them at anytime when I am at<br />
SkyDrive.com.</p>
<p>I suppose I could "point?" each MS-Live account to its own local<br />
Sky Drive folder, but I have chosen to use one folder for all accounts.</p>
<p>When setting up SkyDrive for a User, I use the {Change Folder} option and I<br />
always use "D:\SkyDrive."</p>
<p>So you can jump through a bunch of hoops trying to make it work with your<br />
existing accounts, OR create a new Outlook Mail address and then add a new<br />
User in Control Panel and login to in Win 8 as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
as the New Users MS-Account.</p>
<p>Set up a 'New' SkyDrive for that user and then place a single small&nbsp;picture in
<br />
the Pictures Folder of that 'New" SkyDrive and watch the Notification icon<br />
as it "looks for changes and then uploads and updates."</p>
<p>After the Icon says 'Up to date', then go to the Photo App and see if the picture is there.</p>
<p><br />
Good Luck!</p>

            Hey there thanks for taking the time to reply and snip :)
<div><br />
<div>As per previous replies, I can confirm that SkyDrive is fully synchronised, the latest release, and that the SkyDrive associated with the local account is the same as the SkyDrive account online that holds the pictures.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am still not able to see any pictures.</div>

            I checked that SkyDrive App shows the correct account, that the SkyDrive website for that storage area for that account shows the pictures, that the SkyDrive App shows the pictures, and that the SkyDrive folder locally also shows the pictures.
<div><br />
Ie, it is definitely an issue with the configuration or functionality of the Photos app.</div>

<p>You now have to move all your files from the 'old' YOU to the 'new' YOU.<br />

<h2>            Why does Microsoft feel they have to &#34;bully&#34; people into upgrading to Window 8</h2>
                    <br />
<div>First I hear news of Microsoft making the decision not to release Windows 7 Service Pack 2. And today I attempt to download a desktop gadget for my Windows 7 desktop from the following link:</div>
<div>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/personalize/gadgets</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And I see this message:</div>
<div>"<span>Because we want to focus on the exciting possibilities of the newest version of&nbsp;</span><span>Windows</span><span>, the&nbsp;</span><span>Windows</span><span>&nbsp;website no longer hosts the gadget gallery."</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I am pretty good at interpreting what people say and what they actually mean. I am thinking that what Microsoft was really trying to say is, "We no longer care about anyone using one of our operating systems that isn't Window 8. So we are going to
 do everything in our power to make your life as hard and miserable as possible. We will not release a Service Pack 2 for Windows 7 because this would, unarguably, be the final nail in the coffin that destroys any possibility of Windows 8 being adopted by any
 significant group of people other than a fringe of nerds who can't resist the lure of new technology and people who couldn't care less about what operating system they are using. So in order for us to sway normal desktop users we will do everything in our
 power to make using Windows 7 in the long term as unattractive as possible. To add icing to the cake, we have taken down the desktop gadgets gallery for no other logical reason than to try and coerce people who have absolutely zero interest in upgrading to
 Windows 8, to reconsider their position."</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have a question for you Microsoft. How would leaving Windows 7 gadgets up on your website for people to download take ANYTHING from your focus on your new dr. jekyll/mr. hide Window 8 operating system? I know what it is. You needed the extra space
 on the server hard drive. That's what it is.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Guess what Microsoft? I still have 0% interest in your schizophrenic Window 8 desktop/tablet operating system. If you push me anywhere it will be to a linux distribution where the user of the operating system is in charge of what he/she does and
 NOT YOU.</span></div>
<div><span><br />

            <p>The problem with gadgets is that they were not all benign and some affected performance badly, especially the gadgets that monitored performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vast majority probably never used gadgets, especially as many run programs full screen and couldn't see anything underneath anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re Windows 7 Service Pack 2, Microsoft will issue it when the need arises, if only to package the updates made available after Service Pack 1. Unlike XP and Vista which desperately needed more than one service pack, Windows 7 is good enough not to require
 a mass of re-coding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck with Linux.. :-)</p>

<p>Re Windows 7 Service Pack 2, Microsoft will issue it when the need arises, if only to package the updates made available after Service Pack 1. Unlike XP and Vista which desperately needed more than one service pack, Windows 7 is good enough not to require

            You seriously need to STOP reading rumors. The same folks who produced that rumor claimed Windows 8 sales have been disappointing based on insider sources, yet Windows 8 is outselling Windows 7. Microsoft has not released any official statement on future
 updates to Windows 7. Windows 7 will be supported until 2020.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div><b>You might want to stop spreading rumors also. How many Window 8 licenses have actually been purchased by end-users versus oem resellers? I think it's close to a ratio of about 1 to 10 in favor of OEMs.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Based on usage, the Gadget Gallery has been deprecated, also, persons are moving away from Gadgets, the platform has been pretty much stagnant since the release of Windows Vista. Also, Gadgets were known memory hog.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Sounds more like an issue with the developers more so than the gadget functionality itself. And if it was a problem with gadget functionality in general Microsoft could have released a patch to fix that. But I guess they can only ever look to the future
 and never to the past anymore it seems.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Its a website, it must be maintained, it requires resources and man labour to do that and enable compatibility with older versions of Windows, Vista included and older versions of IE, including as far back as IE 7 which came with Vista.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>So you are confirming what I said in a previous post. Since the current generation of gadgets would not be compatible with "Window" 8, forget about everybody else? So if a gadget is not compatible with EVERY SINGLE previous generation of Windows operating
 systems, we shall offer it to NONE. Is that the mentality going forward? Everybody is a sheep and no one is unique anymore. God, I love it. Kinda grows on you when you think about it. The same way cloning humans does.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Then you won't have Gadgets and compatibility all. </div>
<div><br />
<div><b>They could have left the website up "AS IS", posted a disclaimer about using at your own risk and offering no customer support. The same type of situation that many people find themselves in with older software. There was NO REASON to remove it. What
 will Microsoft do next? Make it illegal to use Windows XP? Hunt people down who are using it and forbid them because Windows XP isn't compatible with their new Window 8 app-store? Ah, now were getting somewhere arent we?</b></div>

    <title>Camera App on Windows 8 Laptop not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> onyxcalibur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera App on Windows 8 Laptop not Working</h2>
                    I've searched for hours on trying to fix it and no one seems to have the same problem as me, so please carefully read my problem before responding with a link on a camera app fix.<br />
<br />
So I have a Windows 8 Acer Laptop that I've had for about 1 and a half years and about 6 months this problem occurred. I kind of shrugged it of that time ago, but now I'm a little bit concerned as it still has been the same problem since that time.<br />
<br />
So basically, every time I try to open the camera app the full screen that pops up when opening the app (the full purple screen with a camera in the middle) flashes for like 0.0000001 seconds (over exaggeration, but it does appear for so little) and then goes
 back to whatever I was viewing before opening the camera app.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It then appears in the task bar below and every time if click it again it flashes and goes back, just like before. I exit the app through the task bar and open it again, and the same thing happens every single time.<br />
<br />
I need help on this, so please any effort to give a solution is greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.

            <p>Hi Onyx,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the Camera app. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is the issue specific to camera app?</p>
<p>2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the app is corrupted on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below methods to troubleshoot on the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Please follow the below article to troubleshoot an issue with the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a></span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span>I suggest you to place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;place the computer in Clean Boot I suggest you to follow the below link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Reset the computer back to Normal Mode once you are done with the troubleshooting by following the section "<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span></span>"
 from the same article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please reply with the results. I will be glad to help you further.</p>

            <p>Replying to your questions:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Yes, it is specific to the Camera App on an Acer Windows 8 Laptop.<br />
2. I'm not 100% sure if I did or did not make any changes prior to the issue, but I don't remember making any changes either so I'm not sure if that is the making any changes were the cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, both methods did not work. I'll go through a run down as to what I did exactly so you can tell me if I did anything wrong.<br />
<br />
Method 1: Following the article <br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app<br />
<br />
First heading: Make sure your PC is up to date. <br />
My PC is up to date, the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
Second heading: Make sure the app isn't blocked by firewall. <br />
I checked if the Camera app was blocked by firewall but the app wasn't even showing up in the list of things I can block and unblock in firewall.<br />
<br />
Third heading: Check with your system admin.<br />
My PC isn't part of an organization.<br />
<br />
Fourth heading: Make sure your apps are up to date.<br />
I did what the article said to do and the Camera app didn't even show up in installed apps. (I'm thinking this is how it is since this Camera app came with the computer.)<br />
<br />
Fifth heading: Sync app licenses.<br />
You only need app licenses for third party apps, and this Camera app came with the computer so I'm sure this ins't the case.<br />
<br />
Sixth heading: Re-install the app.<br />
I tried right clicking the camera app in the home screen but it only had 3 options pop up:<br />
<br />
Unpin from start.<br />
Pin to task-bar.<br />
Resize.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that the un-install option doesn't show up because like I said this Camera app came with the computer.<br />
<br />
Seventh heading: Contact the app publisher.<br />
I'm pretty sure the app publisher is Windows, which is an app publisher I don't really think I can contact.<br />
<br />
Eighth heading: Post a question to the Windows forum.<br />
Exactly what I did already.<br />
<br />
Method 2: Do a clean boot.<br />
I did exactly what the article told me to do in order to initiate a clean boot and did exactly like you said to do following the section "How to reset the computer to start normally after the clean boot troubleshooting." and the problem still occurs.&nbsp;<br />
I honestly wish these methods worked and I was excited to see the Camera App work again however that isn't the case, I'm sorry if I seem a burden to you and if you can't find any other solutions I completely understand.<br />
<br />
Thank you for trying and I appreciate further help.<br />

            First of all, thank you very much for taking the time to write another response. I apologize for my negative attitude and I understand that there are many people that need support from you, so please take that as fault from me. It was just getting a little
 bit ridiculous on how long it was taking to get someone, anyone, to respond.<br />
<br />
Now, answering your questions.<br />
<br />
1. Is it a laptop or a desktop? It is a laptop.<br />
<br />
2. How is the camera connected to the computer? It is built in at the top of the of the screen, placed in the middle of the top border.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3. Are you able to work with the camera using other applications like Skype? I tried it out and something interesting showed up.<br />
<br />
http://gyazo.com/ec1ebdad3b855f6c5a425f940fa038e1<br />
<br />
I have no clue as to why this is showing up.<br />
<br />
Now, I tried creating a new user account like you said on the laptop but when I clicked "Add, delete, and manage other user accounts." as shown in the tutorial, an error showed up.<br />
<br />
http://gyazo.com/6b797cb64fd8771f7ac74d9f96c05138<br />
<br />
I realized the app used in the tutorial video was "PC Settings" and tried getting on that from there. (Searching "PC Settings" in the charms menu.")<br />
<br />
But then I found something extremely interesting.<br />
<br />
When I tried to open the "PC Settings" app that EXACT SAME THING HAPPENS WHEN I TRY TO OPEN THE CAMERA APP.
<br />
<br />
<span>So basically, every time I try to open the camera app the full screen that pops up when opening the app (the full purple screen with a camera in the middle) flashes for like 0.0000001 seconds (over exaggeration, but it
 does appear for so little) and then goes back to whatever I was viewing before opening the camera app.&nbsp;<br />

Just replace "camera app" with "PC Settings app" &nbsp;and "the full purple screen with a camera in the middle", with "the full light purple screen with a gear in the middle)".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What do these two apps, the Camera App and the PC Settings app have in common?<br />
Well obviously the glitch, but they are both FULL SCREEN APPS. That is why it is so interesting. So not only is this problem happening to the Camera App, it is also happening to the PC Settings app, which both just so happen to be full screen apps.<br />
<br />
Please reply with further help, it is greatly appreciated!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since camera doesn't work with Skype, the issue could be with the in built camera on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>What is the exact make and model of your laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below troubleshooting Methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></p>

<p><span>d. In the list of options, click on <strong>Hardware and devices</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not followed the troubleshooting steps, you may refer to the section “<strong>Why doesn't my webcam work with the Camera app or other apps?</strong>” in the following article and try to install the updates and the drivers:</span></p>

            <p>First of all,&nbsp;<strong>answering your questions.<br />
<br />
</strong>1. You've already asked this question in the first post you tried to help me with. Just so you don't have to waste any time going up to see, this is exactly what I said before.
<br />
<br />
" <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I'm not 100% sure if I did or did not make any changes prior to the issue, but I don't remember making any changes either so I'm not sure if the making of changes were the cause of the problem."<br />
<br />
2. Not sure what you mean by "make and model", but I'm guessing that the information you need is that my Laptop is an "Acer Aspire V3-551-8823".<br />
<br />
Now,&nbsp; <strong>providing the results of the methods you have told me.<br />
<br />
Method 1:<br />
<br />
</strong>I did exactly as said and one of the fixes mentioned "Enabling HD Webcam." I was excited to close the troubleshooter and see the Camera App working again, but it did the same thing as said in the first post.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
<br />
</strong>I could not find the section <strong>"Why doesn't my webcam work with the Camera App or or other Apps?"
</strong>in the article mentioned so I couldn't find help from this method.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
<br />
</strong>I have no clue where to find the "setup file" you mentioned in step a of Method 3, so I couldn't really get far from that.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now,&nbsp;</span><strong>THINGS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND MY OWN DISCOVERY TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.<br />
</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Please take into account that I have discovered the <strong>exact same problem occurs with the PC Settings App.<br />
<br />
</strong>Why this is important is because <strong>both the Camera App and PC Settings app are both apps that take up the entire screen.
</strong><br />
<br />
I will re-iterate the problem itself.</span><span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Every time I try to open the Camera App or the PC Settings app, the full screen that pops up when opening the app, the full purple screen or full light purple screen with a camera or a gear in the middle, flashes for a really
 short time and then goes back to&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;I was viewing before opening&nbsp;the Camera App or the PC Settings app.</span><br />
<br />
 get somewhere with the fact that they are both full screen apps.<br />
<br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for reading, I hope we can get somewhere with this.</span></span></p>

<p>Hello Stuart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An outdated driver is one of the possible reasons why that device is no longer working after the recent update. Given that, we highly recommend updating your computer's drivers by performing the steps in this article:

<p>Hello Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately using the update driver as suggested did not fix the problem, I am unsure of the manufacturer of the device as it was purchased from GearBest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i unplug and re-plug the device I get the little tune of windows acknowledging its attachment, it comes in as a USB Composite device, I am unsure as to what it came in as before the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Hardware troubleshooter and it said that it did make some changes and that a restart was required but it did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed the PIN and then reapplied it hoping it would take me through the original set up but finger print does not come up as an option in "Sign in options" in Windows Hello, in fact it is still saying that windows hello is not available on this
 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the COBO C2 on my laptop but unfortunately I am so organised i has updated it to the new windows at the same time as the desktop causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love any other advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warmest Regards</p>
<p>

<p>We appreciate your update. We suggest trying the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Download ELAN fingerprint driver 1.1.0.2111 for Windows 10 and extract it to a folder of choice.</p>
<p>2.Go to "Device Manager" (right click on Start -&gt; Device Manager)</p>
<p>3.Find under "Other devices" ELAN fingerprint (or Biometric devices)</p>
<p>4.Right click on it -&gt; update driver software.</p>
<p>5.Lead prompt to the folder where you extracted a driver from step 1.</p>
<p>6.Your COBO C2 should be recognized now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to update us with the results.</p>

<p>I downloaded the cab file that had this driver in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After initially trying to download a version that contained a virus, i got a clean copy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did not have any location to update in the device manager, so ran the setup.exe and the driver was installed and was visible when "show hidden drivers" was ticked on the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not make any difference in the sign on options and the system still says that Windows Hello is not available on my system.</p>
<p>

    <title>How to disable hypervisor after uninstalling Sandbox feature&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to disable hypervisor after uninstalling Sandbox feature&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, maybe someone can suggest something beside installing and uninstalling hyper-v feature. I didn't have time to try it yet, don't currently have access to PC in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I installed win10 1903 and enabled that new Sandbox feature to see how it works. After the end of test I removed it, but hypervisor it installed is still enabled on system.</p>
<p>Task manager shows 'Virtualization: enabled', systeminfo says 'A hypervisor has been detected' and vmware player won't start.</p>
<p>So now I need to somehow manually uninstall this hypervisor, any ideas? Going through anything remotely connected to windows features (dism, powershell) is no go since Hyper-V feature isn't installed so there's nothing to uninstall</p>

<p>At last I got to this PC and the solution was to run 'bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off'</p>
<p>This disabled the hypervisor and now everything works as I wanted.</p>
<p>Seems like whoever wrote the uninstallation process of Sandbox forgot this little bit</p>

<p><span>Hi TCWanda77,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s first check if the external hard disk has any error message/code listed under it in&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Device
 Manager</span> </a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the<strong>&nbsp; device</strong> (external hard disk) in Device Manager and select&nbsp;<strong>Properties.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under<strong>
 General</strong> &nbsp; tab, check for the status of the<strong>&nbsp; device</strong>under<strong>Device status.</strong>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Does it show any error message/code associated with the<strong>&nbsp; device</strong>?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the mean time you may follow the methods listed below and check if the issue gets fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span><strong><span>Disable and re-enable the
 USB controller</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use Device Manager to disable and re-enable all the USB controllers. This lets the controllers recover the USB port from its unresponsive condition.
 The USB controllers represent the USB ports in Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<strong>&nbsp;
 Start</strong>, type<strong>&nbsp; device manager</strong> in the Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand<strong>
 Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.<br />
<strong><br />
Note</strong> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the first USB controller under<strong>&nbsp; Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>, and then click<strong>&nbsp; Uninstall</strong> to remove it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Repeat
 the above step for each USB controller that is listed under&nbsp;<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 the USB device to see whether it is working.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have any data on the external hard disk, you might consider formatting the drive in NTFS file system and check if that fixes the
 issue. For Windows 7, the best choice for hard disks is NTFS. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer these articles for further information on formatting disks and drives:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-and-format-a-hard-disk-partition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Create and format a hard
 disk partition</span> </a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Formatting-disks-and-drives-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Formatting
 disks and drives: frequently asked questions</span> </a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Warning</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Formatting erases any existing files on a (external) hard disk. If you format a (external) hard disk that has files on it, the files will be deleted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

    <title>Can I Make A Backup For Windows 10&#63; VERY CONFUSED - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> courtenaysutton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I Make A Backup For Windows 10&#63; VERY CONFUSED</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my computer from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and I love it. I have a back up done of 8.1 but want to make a back up for Windows 10. I went to our local Best Buy to find out what size thumb drive I would need and the guy from the Geek Squad
 desk told me I could not create a back up because it would just create a back up of 8.1 that was previously on my computer, also if I needed to reinstall Windows for any reason after a year I would need to buy Windows 10 because I can't create a back up. This
 doesn't seem right to me where I have a new Windows Key and wouldn't 10 be my new operating system now not 8.1?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is screen shot of what my computer says but I'm confused because this computer NEVER came with Windows 7... If someone could please answer if I can create a back in case my computer crashes and I need to reinstall Windows and why it says restore to
 Windows 7?</p>

            <p>Hi Courtenay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not have to purchase Windows 10. The Windows 10 is best of both Windows 7 and 8.1, that is the reason it is showing Windows 7 in the screen shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only hardware changes that can negatively impact activation status once you upgrade to free version are the changes to the:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">CPU </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">TPM </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Motherboard replacement</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>The following changes are examples of hardware changes that will NOT impact the activation status:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">HDD/SSD </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Video card </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Adding extra memory</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If you replace the CPU, TPM, or Motherboard you may have to re-activate but this will not require a purchase of Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            &#34;Modem Removed - Unavailable device &#40;COM1&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    Modem (telephone) doesn't work.&nbsp; (It used to ...)<br />
<br />
XP with SP3.<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall turned off, running McAfee.<br />
<br />
I tried running New Connection Wizard, to define a dial-up connection. &nbsp; Call it "junk". &nbsp; When I double-click junk in Network Connections, the "General tab" under "junk properties"&nbsp; shows "Connect Using: Modem Removed - Unavailable device (COM 1)"<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp; Is it possible that the problem is the actual hardware card? <br />
<br />
Here are more details:<br />
<br />
The modem is a card in a PC slot.&nbsp; Many labels in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among others: <br />
PCI-SV92PP Soft Modem. Agere Systems Inc Pinball Modem<br />
US: AGMDOIBPINBALL<br />
E252809 (which means it was made by “Manhatten Electronics” in Hong Kong)<br />
It’s an old card, like the rest of the computer, and dusty, but I see no damage.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When I pull up “Phone and Modem Options” from the control panel, and look at the Modems tab, I see<br />

&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When I pull up ControlPanel/System/Hardware/Device Manager there are _no_ modems listed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I downloaded a driver from somewhere (sorry … I’d have to reconstruct where.)&nbsp; When I double-click setup.exe, it seems to run fine, but the modem still doesn’t work.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When I go to control Panel/Add Hardware, it does not find the modem.&nbsp; When I tell it to add new hardware, it does not find the modem.&nbsp; When I tell it to detect the modem, it does not find any new plug-and-play modems.&nbsp; When I tell it to add an agree modem,
 it asks me what port I want to install it on.&nbsp; It will not let me click “All ports”, and the list of choose-able ports under “Selected ports” is empty.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suspected that the large number of entries in the modem tab above might be a problem, so I deleted all except one Agere (the unnumbered one) and the Motorola.&nbsp; No, everything above is unchanged.<br />

<p>Go to Phone and Modem Options in Control Panel.</p>
<p>Remove every listing listed.</p>
<p>Remove your Modem and restart your computer.</p>
<p>Reinsert your modem.</p>
<p>Check Device Manager, if modem is not listed do this:</p>
<p>Go to: System, Advanced tab, Environment Variables, under System variables click New.</p>
<p>For Variable name: type:&nbsp;&nbsp; devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices</p>
<p>For Variable value: type: 1&nbsp; Click OK, OK, OK</p>
<p>Go back to Device Manager, on the menu tab click View, click Show hidden devices.</p>
<p>You should now see your modem, try to update the driver from there.</p>
<p>No luck, change your modem!</p>

            When you open the drive's Properties in Device Manager, you may find a setting to not use 'write caching' (Policies tab). This may enable your hotswap.

            Hello  SHANKARANGURUMOORTHI,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br /> Before the repair I had a genuine Windows 10Homeversion installed in my PC with licence key, 
<br />Was it preinstalled ?
<br />Was you digital licence linked to your Microsoft account ?
<br />
<br />To go back to Windows 10 Home, you have to perform a clean install of W10 Home.
<br />Hello,
<br />
<br />If your digital licence wThanks to the link between you digital licence and your Microsoft account, you can use the licence of your old PC to active Windows 10 on a new PC. 
<br />It is called path exception, described in this article
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10738/...</a>
<br />Additionally, Microsoft provides an exception path for transferring a Windows License after a hardware change. You’ll need to be signed in to the same Microsoft account before making the hardware change and to use the exception path. 
<br />
<br />For that, you need 
<br />- to perform a clean install on the new PC 
<br />- to install exactly the same edition of Windows as on the old PC 
<br />- to connect on the new PC with your Microsoft account and Windows 10 will be automatically activated via the digital licence linked to your Microsoft account. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 10 is still not activated, 
<br />Select the Start  button &gt; Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Activation
<br />Then select Troubleshoot.
<br />If the troubleshooter can’t resolve the issue, you’ll see a link to reactivate after a hardware change. Select it to follow this path. 
<br />For more info, see the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530</a>

            I'll explain more clearly.
<br />To go back to Windows 10 Home, you have to perform a clean install of W10 Home. 
<br />Hello, 
<br />
<br />If your digital licence was linked to your Microsoft account on W10 Home, you can usepath exception, described in this article

            Hi SHANKARANGURUMOORTHI, the only way to go back to Windows 10 Home is to backup your data and clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            How to retrieve previous Windows 10 Home Digital License&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought my laptop with Windows 10 Home preinstalled. It says that Windows is activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now. I tried upgrading with a new product key but after restart, I found out that it's fake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I recover my previous Windows 10 Home license?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Additional info: the fake product key upgraded me to Windows 10 Enterprise</p>

            Hi HamuelTheBest
<br />
<br />The only way to resolve this is to backup your data and clean install the original Edition (Home), which will self-activate once installed . . .
<br />
<br />You will however, need to re-install all 3rd party software, including Office (if applicable)
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was finally able to resolve my issue with the help from Vikash at Office365 Support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the following registry entry is missing. You will need to <strong>run regedit as Administrator</strong> to add the entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get here, click on Parameters - do not expand list - look for the parameter,
<strong>MaxUserPort</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: This is not plural - make sure spelling is accurate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is not defined, please add the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>New DWORD</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enter the name: MaxUserPort</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hit Enter to Accept the name.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Right click on the new entry and select Modify</strong></p>
<p><strong>Select Decimal and enter&nbsp;</strong><strong>5000 as the value.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hit OK to accept new value and exit the dialog.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(15000 was recommend to test with. Then I reduced to the default in my final implementation. The reference to default value I took from here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/196271/when-you-try-to-connect-from-tcp-ports-greater-than-5000-you-receive-t)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Then Reboot</strong> your machine and give it a whirl!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOV 7 2018 1132p ET: Edited to remove idea that it's only on 1809 per Oliver's observation below.</p>
