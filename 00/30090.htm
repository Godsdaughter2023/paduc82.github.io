            Hello,
<br />
<br />I would attempt to use a different USB cable, to see if that solves the charging problem.  If it doesn't, I believe the USB outlet on the charger isn't functioning and the charger would need to be replaced.

    <title>Saving free space on SSD &#40;Regarding multiple obligatory partitions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hll_544  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving free space on SSD &#40;Regarding multiple obligatory partitions on main drive&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fairly tech-savvy person with some OS &amp; IT knowledge.</p>
<p>I Have just purchased a new laptop with an OEM Licence of windows 10. This Machine have a 128-GB SSD Drive and a 1TB HDD.</p>
<p>I Received my computer preinstalled with some OEM bloatware (in os partition), uefi system partition and a recovery partition.</p>
<p>In total all of this "non-pure-os" space partitions can go up to a Gigabyte or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Goal is to SAVE as much as I can on the SSD Drive, Since I want it to be free to install some heavy programs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, As I tried that, windows 10 installation CANNOT BE INITIATED without pre-allocating:</p>
<p>A. ~450 mb of recovery partition</p>
<p>B. ~100-350 mb eufi partition.</p>
<p>C. 16Mb of microsoft reserved</p>
<p>And eventually</p>
<p>D. The rest of space where the actual OS would be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Understand that all of these partitions are required for different purposes, but as I understand, continues execution of OS only depends on the latter (D above) and this is the only partition I'd wish to have on the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Would like to delete/not use/remove whatever is technically possible, and offload to the hdd that is actually required.</p>
<p>Here are some assumptions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I Do not "intend" to ruin my OS or booting process to some virus/bootkit etc.</p>
<p>2. I Do not intend to use Bitlocker to encrypt my OS partition.</p>
<p>3. Maybe, I'd choose to have a recovery on an external storage-I know that such process exists (by all means I do not want it in my preciues SSD).</p>
<p>4. Eufi booting requirements is just a few hundred MB, but it is not used in continues operation of the computer, so IMO it also (logically) can be offloaded onto the hdd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And some guideline questions:</p>
<p>1. How can I fresh-install windows 10 with no recovery partition?</p>
<p>* Deleting is possible but it not so good options, since Recovery partition is made the FIRST partition and thus, joining it with the OS partition (last) is an issue.</p>
<p>2. Can windows 10 support DOS partition booting under my computer, How can I find that out? AFAIK, EUFI Firmwares do support backwards compatibility with DOS partitions and are able to boot from them.</p>
<p>3. What is the Microsoft reserved partition (16MB) Can it be removed or offloaded to another drive, and how?</p>
<p>4. Can the EUFI partition be offloaded to secondary drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Ideas such as: install Windows TWICE on the same machine and them remove the first(somehow?) is a viable option, one of my ideas, but I'd thought to consult the community as the ms support person suggested.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Gerry Here just copy-paste some irrelevant response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, **I've figured it out**. Here my solution (I Take no responsibility from any damage that might arise from this process, and I do not guarantee it to work for u.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll assume u have 2 disks; SSD and HDD.</p>
<p>Also NOTE: I Work in a GPT-Disk partitioning scheme, I don't know if it's applicable on dos-style MBR partitioning.</p>
<p>General-methodology wich we are going to work with (or TL;DR).</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Delete all partitions on all drive</li><li>Install Windows on the HDD Drive</li><li>Install Windows on the SSD Drive (yes, twice!)</li><li>Repartition the HDD to free up and reallocate as we wish (The only parition that HAVE to be there is the EUFI System (Fat) )</li><li>After freeing up HDD space, move user folder to the HDD</li><li>PROFIT</li></ol>
<p>And in more detail:</p>
<p>THIS GUIDE ASSUME THIS IS A FRESH PC - THAT U DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING U NEED ON EITHER DISKS.</p>
<p>* - <span>Asterisk</span>, not a real step, just additional information</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot into windows 10 installation</li><li>Clear ALL partitions on BOTH drives</li><li>Let windows install itself onto the HDD, We'll call this installation win-hdd
<ol>
<li>There is no need to actually boot into this OS.</li></ol>
</li><li>Boot into windows 10 installation</li><li>Let windows install itself onto the SSD. We'll call this installation win-ssd
<ol>
<li>*What would happen now, Is that windows detects the recovery and eufi partitions and does not need to create such additional partitions on your ssd. It would only create a 16MB windows reserved partition.</li><li>*Your boot partition would be hdd/eufi; But since windows detect it's own bootloader it would allow you to duel-boot between win-hdd and win-ssd(default)</li></ol>
</li><li>Optional: During windows-ssd first run wizard switch to audit mode (CTRL+SHIFT+F3)
<ol>
<li>*We would use audit mode to:
<ol>
<li>* Optional1: Repartition hdd</li><li>* Optional2: Change "Users" folder to the hdd.</li><li>* If u do not want to move Users folder, u can do 6.2 After win-ssd fully boots instead</li></ol>
</li><li>Repartition hdd &amp; move Users folder:
<ol>
<li>Using a 3rd party tool such as "<a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MiniTool Partition Wizard</a>" you can do the fallowing *as you wish*:
<ol>
<li>Delete win-hdd partition</li><li>Delete recovery-hdd partition</li><li>Delete windows reserved (16 mb) partition.</li><li>You can also later move the EUFI to the start of the hdd disk, if needed</li><li>Create new partition (free to use) on hdd.</li><li>Make sure to properly assign drive letters to all drive as u wish</li><li>Fallow <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-users-folder-move-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this guide</a> to relocate the User folder (Starting from Step 2)</li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li><li>Boot into windows-ssd; If u do not know which one (int the OS selection screen) It's safe to assume that the automatically-selected one is the win-ssd.</li><li>If u have not performed 6.2 Yet, this is the time to do that now.</li></ol>

    <title>Windows 10 screen flickering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyborgman92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 screen flickering</h2>
                    <p>So a couple days ago my windows 10 pc main display started to flicker. I did some test and noitice only the hdmi port was causing the issue. I don't know if that means anything so that why i'm including it here. The flicker started after I instarted a wireless
 card since I move into a house with no ethernet cables. I tried disable windows error and solution and the other program which I forget but that didn't help. I tried installing new drivers, which didn't help either. I been working on this thing for three days
 and having no results. I did try taking the wireless card out but that didn't help either. I did the Ctrl+Shift+ESC and it does flicker so that mean maybe a app is causing the problem. I don't have the programs installed on my computer which usally cause the
 problem. Please and help is needed, sorry if I make spelling mistakes I am making this in a hurry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are quite lost with your concern. Help us understand your issue. Verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are we right to assume that you were using multiple monitors?</li><li>If so, does the screen flickers on other monitors?</li><li>When you said that the HDMI port is causing the issue, can you elaborate on this? It sounds like you were able to use your display via the VGA port.</li><li>If so, this could be a hardware issue. Update or reinstall your display adapter and check if it will make a difference.</li><li>What do you mean when you disabled <em>windows error and solution</em><em>?</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            Yes, I do use multiple monitors and I run the main one off my GTX 960 and my other two off another graphics card. The screen only flickers on the main one that just runs on my GTX 960. I used my other port next to my hdmi port which is the DVI port and
 it worked just fine. I think it's not a techincal issue because I went into safe mode, the hdmi port worked fine then I reinstalled my drivers and it stilled didn't fix the issue. Sometimes disableing the service Windows error report service and Problems report
 and solution will fix the screen flicker.

            Got it. Thank you for clarifying it. Since the issue doesn't happen in safe mode, it means that your default settings and basic drivers aren't causing the issue.

<p>I disabled everything and let no programs startup with boot and it still flickers. I wipe my computer clean and it still doesn't work. I took a video if it helps at all. I did notice sometimes blue lines will pop up on the screen.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            USB Keyboard Doesn&#39;t Work When Laptop Is Closed</h2>
                    My wife's Dell running Window's 7 Home Premium is about six months old. We decided that we wanted to hook up an external monitor so when she is at home, she doesn't have to look at that little screen. I was able to get the power settings set to allow the
 monitor to show up when the laptop is closed, the mouse works, etc. The only problem is that the keyboard doesn't respond. I tried connecting a different keyboard, and that worked just fine.
<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            Hi, <br />
<br />
<div>I appreciate your efforts you have put in to try connecting a different keyboard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>As a different keyboard is working properly on the computer it might be an issue with the keyboard. However let's perform some steps to check if it is an issue with keyboard.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.</strong></div>
<div>1. What is the make and model number of the keyboard?<br />
2. Are you referring to Laptop keyboard or an external USB Keyboard?<br />
3. What is the make and model number of the laptop?<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>I would suggest you to check the keyboard status in device manager.<br />
<br />
<div>a) Click on <strong>Start </strong>and type device manager in the Start search box.</div>
<div>b) Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</div>
<div>c) <strong>Expand </strong>Keyboards and <strong>right click </strong>on it.</div>
<div>d) Click on <strong>Properties </strong>and click on<strong> General Tab</strong>.</div>
<div>e) Under <strong>device status</strong>, <strong>check </strong>if the <strong>
keyboard is working properly or not</strong>.<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue persists you may try updating the keyboard drivers and check if it helps.<br />
<div><br />
<strong>Refer to the link: Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly
</strong><br />

    <title>Win7&#47;10 USB serial driver for FTDI chips - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vbken99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7&#47;10 USB serial driver for FTDI chips</h2>
                    <p>Hardware: Any FTDI FT230X series USB-serial device (custom FT230X board, UMFT230XB-NC module,
<strong>UMFT230XA</strong> module etc.).<br />
Software: Visual Basic - Serial Port.<br />
OpSys: Win7 (64-bit) and Win10</p>
<p>
</p><p>[PC] ----- USB cable -------- [FTDI FT230X USB-UART device][TX, RX, RTS signals]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue1: Whenever an FT230X device is connected or powered up and Windows scans for USB devices, the RTS line is toggled<br />
<br />
Issue2: Whenever the FT230X RTS line is toggled using RTSenable, the TX line (if low using BreakState) toggles high.<br />
</p>
<p>Code Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SerialPort1.BreakState = True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Rx low&nbsp;&nbsp; (sets Rx line low)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
SerialPort1.RtsEnable = True&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' RTS low&nbsp; (<strong>sets RTS line low AND Rx high</strong>) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
SerialPort1.RtsEnable = False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' RTS high (setsRTS line high)<br />
SerialPort1.BreakState = False&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Rx high&nbsp; (this has no effect since Rx is already high)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Toggling RTS <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">should have no effect</span> on the TX line.&nbsp; The issue only occurs with the FT230X chip.&nbsp; The same VB code running a PICkit Serial module works properly i.e. toggling RTS has no effect on TX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else seen this issue before, can duplicate it or shed some light on the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Ken</p>

            <p>Due to the same issue, when my Win7 64-bit computer cans for plugged/unplugged USB devices, the ping of the FT230X device toggles the RTS line i.e. if another USB device is plugged in, the FT230X device with reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw Win7 had an update for the driver when I plugged in a new FT230X device, but it did not fix the issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 build 1703 to 1803</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have around 300 Windows 10 build 1703 machines laptops / desktops and looking to upgrade to build 1803.&nbsp; I have not tested anything just yet but looking to get a heads up here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When moving to a new build does windows remove the users favourites from IE?</p>
<p>Do Windows install applications such as Solitaire?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my current build is customised, i think MS will installs applications by default, which is my only worry.&nbsp; I could trash windows on all machines, create a gold image of build 1803&nbsp; with my customised allowed apps.&nbsp; The only issue i have is having to advise
 users to backup their personal files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think upgrading to 1803 this way would be best, rather than trashing the current build.</p>

<p>WARNING!! Make full system backup before you play with 1803 fire :O</p>
<p>
Extreme system slow-down after windows 10 feature update 1803 - Critically low system performance.<br />
<br />
Hello All Affect by By Spectre &amp; Meltdown Patchware,<br />
<br />
I Sadly have the same issues as mentioned in other windows 10 build 1803 issues threads, after my windows 10 Pro got upgraded to build 1803.<br />
<br />
Im Running:<br />
Lenovo ThinkPad T440P<br />
CPU: I7-4710MQ, 2,49 GHz<br />
RAM : 16GB<br />
HD: 500GB SSD (And plenty of space left for OS)<br />
<br />
<br />
Before all the buggy patching by hardware and software vendors, I was running multiple windows applications parallel with WM Ware Virtual Machines without breaking a sweat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First Issue: Now my Laptop Fan runs full throttle even though there is hardly any CPU load.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Other issues are the extremely slow OS Performance: Resizing windows lags like h*** and I have to wait like 5 sec before I see popup window when I right click desktop, and creating folders or renaming stuff in explorer also show similar behavior, that is windows
 loading cursor for 5 sec or more, Copying and moving files, keeps the progress box on the screen for 5 sec or more and just shows 99%. Its the same deal with launching an application, Extremely slow performance and even worse when I start a Virtual Machine
 The Virtual OS takes ages to boot and hardly respond to any commands and when It finally responds I have waited several minutes just to move the f****** cursor around :/.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Even a simple task like showing a help popup text, when you hover over icons, ex. in windows start bar, takes ages to appear on the screen. To Sum it up my Laptop OS has been totally fked up by these buggy patches Microsoft, Lenovo and Intel have pushed out
 without showing some kind of warning that I might be a good idea to make a full system backup before applying "critical system updates" :(

    <title>new scientist app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helenv1  say:</h3>
<h2>            new scientist app</h2>
                    <p>On January 8th I purchased a months description of new scientist on the Microsoft app store for au$18. The app seemed to download fine. I click to download an issue and again it appears to download fine. However when I click to read the issue the screen
 goes blank with an icon that say's downloading cover stories, that disappears leaving the screen totally blank. I can swipe up to get the contents list but the same thing happens whichever story I choose. There is no error message. I have emailed the new scientist
 app support twice with no answer and left a review on the app store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this happened to anyone else? Hoping someone here may be able to help as I can't find the answer online anywhere!</p>

    <title>Unable to log in to my account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ceratedabyss12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to log in to my account</h2>
                    
<p>While trying to log into my hotmail account I discovered it was locked. After multiple failures, i was not able to unlock it. Seeing as how I use this account to log into my xbox live profile, it is a little irritating that I can't get into it. I have tried
 going through Microsoft's process to get my account unlocked, but the information they ask for is not readily available for me and I do not have the same phone number anymore. I have spent a decent chunk of time and money on the account that is locked, so
 I was wondering if anyone could provide me with an answer to the problem. If I can get the account back, or at least transfer all the items I have purchased/downloaded to a new account. Any and all help is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>SunkNath has offered some good advice. I'd also like to add that when you are able to access the account again, you should take a few minutes to update your personal information, contact information, and password recovery information so that this is less
 likely to happen in the future. I hate to be "that guy" but situations like this are exactly why we all need to keep the information in our accounts up to date.</p>

    <title>Create System Documents Folder or Turn Regular Folder into System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenclose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create System Documents Folder or Turn Regular Folder into System Documents Folder</h2>
                    <p>Background: Used Move command to relocate System Document folder to external&nbsp; drive. There was no Users nor Username folder on external drive, so I created them. Then made BIG mistake and dragged moved Documents folder to the Username folder on external
 drive. I have been trying to recover from this mistake for days. Needless to say, I have no Documents folder showing under Users\Username in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all of my original document subfolders copied to another external drive. The Documents folder in which they reside is a regular folder NOT the system documents folder.&nbsp; Obviously it does not have a LOCATION tab in properties and no way to restore
 original default location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I either create a SYSTEM DOCUMENT folder back on the C:\Users\Username location. Or, how can I turn a regular Documents folder into the SYSTEM DOCUMENTS folder in the default location. I could then copy and paste the contents of all of my documents
 into that System folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice or help is most welcome. Thanks very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reference this article about Relocating folders in windows 10 (&nbsp;https://bit.ly/2G1Of5V ). Stuck as described above in having made mistake and needing to recover. Article does not (as far as I can tell) talk about recovery from a mistake.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Downloads</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Documents(2) contains just 3 folders, only 1 of which is in Documents(1).</p>
<p>I have a copy of my original Documents folder before I made the Move and subsequent (incorrect) drag and drop. It is on an external M.2 drive. AppData is not in the original Documents folder. It does not accurately have all of the documents (in folders and
 subfolders) as were in the original location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, the original drive had C:/Users/OWNER/Documents. OWNER was the User Name. In the various directories I have OWNER does not appear in any path, but do I have an OWNER icon on my desktop (not sure how it got there). OWNER contains all of the folders
 in Documents(1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last bit of data: Using PowerShell, OWNER does appear in dir of C:\users.&nbsp; Dir of C:\users\OWNER produces list of folders which

</strong>directory in Explorer, you don't see <strong>Owner</strong>? Perhaps you see Documents? Any difference between manes seen in Explorer and Names seen in Command Prompt or PowerShell are due to the presence of desktop.ini files within the folder. To

<p>To untangle the Shell Folders, you'll need to edit registry entries under this key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</strong></p>
<p>Mine looks like this, which is pretty much the default:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88456305-a83a-4c25-b5e4-488cd0876ac3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88456305-a83a-4c25-b5e4-488cd0876ac3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll want to start by editing Personal to reflect the location of your redirected Documents folder (an absolute path, i.e. D:\Users\Owner\Documents) is fine.&nbsp; On a newly created profile, only Downloads has a GUID style name ({374DE290-123F-4565-9164-39C4925E467B}),
 the rest are self-explanatory.&nbsp; You may have additional GUID-style entries if you've redirected folders such as Screenshots or Favorites. Others may be created when default save locations are redirected to OneDrive rather than the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you're smart enough to use PowerShell, you may figure it out form here. The only thing left would be to reactive desktop.ini files so your redirected folders have their custom icons.</p>

<p>Keith:</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the advice so far. I was able to rename desktop.ini as directed, and OWNER now appears under Users as you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is a capture of my User Shell Folders. Before I do anything, I need you to comment and provide additional direction as my list is shorter and different than your standard setup.&nbsp; Obviously a result of my incorrect moving folders around.&nbsp; &nbsp;
 This may be more than you can take time for but I hope you can offer some additional recovery steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously I have no %UserProfile% indicator (?) anywhere, so perhaps that is a place to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Keith or others:&nbsp; I created a New User Account, logged in, went to the Registry and all of the standard folders are listed in the User Shell Folders window. (Different Screen Name - SirKenSC a result of using new user account.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question seems like it is: how do I get the folders and files from the messed up original user into the proper user folders under the new profile.&nbsp; I assume I can use the LOCATE &gt; MOVE command under properties for the standard system folders, but
 can I?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have investigated the folders/files in Explorer under the new name and the Documents F/F are just right and where I want them to be.&nbsp; Others are not what they need to be, but must be "updated". For example, my Outlook 2010 program has to be set up from
 scratch.&nbsp; Other aspects (like the Start Menu) has to be "reconstructed", unless there is a trick to using the Registry in some way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, this looks like a more simple way to get me back to my original setup, then I can proceed to achieve my original objective of C: holding OS and Program Files and D: holding Data, music, pictures, and other standard folders which can be moved correctly
 using LOCATION&gt;MOVE commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and I would like it if you have any parting advice on my proposed course of action.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I would still try to fix your original account. I see you got to the wrong Registry hive, I probably shouldn't have abbreviated the hive names. Once you get to the right key, my earlier post will make much more sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what sort of ownership (in regards to files and folders) with a new account. If I were to go that route, I would have created a local account, and then disassociated my current MS account from the old login and associated it with the new one.</p>

<p>Keith:&nbsp; SUCCESS!! I uploaded the message below but then discovered a site which described redirection and saw, in their example, that leaving %USERPROFILE% in the Data key is the incorrect syntax.&nbsp; I deleted the %USERPROFILE% key word from the Personal Key
 (not sure I am using "Key" correctly) and lo and behold, Documents in the C drive Explorer listing has a system Icon and the contents are what I want.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; Looking back at your original message, you did say "An absolute path..." but I guess my brain
 skipped knowing exactly what that meant.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Now off to redirect some of the other system folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ignore what follows, but it is there for the record.</p>
<p>Ken</p>
<p>
</p><p>I elected to keep trying to fix my original account, as you suggested.&nbsp; I have all of my "current" Documents saved in D:\Users\OWNER\Documents.&nbsp; All of my files are there and display in File Explorer.&nbsp; I changed the Data for "Personal" in the Registry, as
 according to the picture below. I restarted, but am not sure what to expect to see. What I do see is the Documents folder is a "regular" folder (no system icon showing next to it). Plus, when I click on it, I get a folder named Documents with incorrect contents.&nbsp;
 I should say that I am looking at Documents within the C drive.&nbsp; What should I expect to see and why is the edited folder name in the registry not pointing to the supposed correct location of the documents on the D drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1cbe96da-f6c4-4922-9f94-a850a5708f02?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1cbe96da-f6c4-4922-9f94-a850a5708f02?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After posting this, I tried to save a doc file to the C:\Users\OWNER\Documents file and received an error message saying it is inaccessible because the syntax is wrong. And yet, I just repeated the save test and it accessed the Documents folder but
 it is the incorrect Documents folder. Sheesh, what is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for hanging there with me. It feels like I am almost there and with a little further instruction from you, I should have everything working like I want.&nbsp; I should point out that the overall objective is to have the C drive (SSD - 250GB) hold the OS
 and the Program Files with all other data on the D drive, including, I assume, the AppData folder (which has a ton of stuff in it), as well as all documents, photos, music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hey Bill.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It sounds like you may have installed a trial app, when one isn't really needed to print a PDF from Edge (the default viewer) or Adobe Reader if you install and set it as default.  
<br />
<br />I'd first try opening the .pdf with Edge and test printing it from the Settings (three dots...at top right).  If it is satisfactory then set it as default at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.  
<br />
<br />Then go into Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features to find the .pdf app in the list and uninstall it.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Microsoft Edge is the new browser in Windows 10 which also opens .pdf files.  
<br />
<br />Type Edge in Start Search, right click to Pin to Taskbar.  But it should already be there with a blue E icon.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise go to Apps list in Start Menu to look for it.  
<br />
<br />You can use it only for .pdf's or install your own choice of pdf viewer to print from.

    <title>How to adjust the shade and&#47;or color of an inactive highlighted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stott  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to adjust the shade and&#47;or color of an inactive highlighted selection in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I am looking for how to adjust the color and/or shade of an inactive selection in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Try the following to understand what I am after:<br />
<br />
Open File Explorer in a window not maximized so you can still see part of your desktop.<br />
Left click on any file within File Explorer.<br />
Now click on your desktop.<br />
Notice how the highlight color changes on the selected file to a dim grey.&nbsp; This is the shade/color I want to change.<br />
<br />
The reason I need this is when using one program for a reference and another for a task that you rely on seeing the highlighted information in the other program.&nbsp; It gets very difficult to see&nbsp;at times depending on your eye level compared to the highlighted
 item.&nbsp; (Using an LCD screen).&nbsp; Also within the same program like SolidWorks for example if you highlight an item in the graphics view it highlights it in the PDM tree but since the tree does not have focus it is a very light grey and is difficult to see.<br />
<br />
I found a supposed fix for Windows XP but don't know where to look in Windows 7 to adjust this if possible.&nbsp; The following is the supposed fix for XP I don't know for sure that it works though I haven't tried it.<br />
<br />
Control Panel, Screen, Appearance, Advanced Options<br />
Select "3d Elements"<br />
change to a darker gray<br />
accept - apply<br />
voila!<br />
<br />
So I don't know if there is a 3d Elements adjustment I can make somewhere?&nbsp; Perhaps in the registry?<br />
<br />
And please don't suggest the High Contrast Themes or the like.&nbsp; I have been there.&nbsp; I am looking for something more elegant that keeps the default appearance of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Please Help.&nbsp; It would make my day to day work less irritating.<br />
Thanks

Although this is by design within Windows, there may be third party&nbsp;software that can take care of this the way you are wanting. I would perform some searches on your favorite search engine.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft
 cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.<br />

Hope this helps</span></p>

<h2>            Error when i try to factory reset. Help pls</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday i tried to do a factory reset on my pc and i get the following message "There was a problem resetting your pc" "no changes were made" I never had a problem doing a factory reset before, untill now. When resetting it gets to around 33% and then
 stays there for 2 to 3 hours and then fails. Sometimes it fails at 5%, in safe mode i was able to get to 90% before it failed but 33% seems to be the point where it stucks the most. My pc is an Acer predator g3-710 and came with Windows 10 pre installed. I've
 used sfc /scannow but nothing wrong was found. I'm not that good with hardware and would greatly appreciate any help that will help solve my problem.</p>

            Try the Reset again, this time make sure your PC is not connected to the Internet, and that all USB devices are unplugged (especially a receiver for a wireless mouse or keyboard) - you can unplug the wireless receiver as soon as you have started the Reset,
 if you have one!

    <title>Large Page Memory Usage and Restrictions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aksjain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Large Page Memory Usage and Restrictions</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on a memory intensive Windows Application where it performs the memory intensive operations and requires huge amount of memory at its runtime.</p>
<p>Since we want to be more and more performant, we are exploring the option of using "Large Pages" memory allocation, so as to ignore frequent paging of memory frames.</p>
<p>I have two questions associated with using Large Pages,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is there any limit on the memory which can be allocated as Large Pages:
</strong>Let's say i have a system with 32Gb of RAM, how much memory can be used as Large Pages. I suspect such limit as there may be an application which can allocate all the available memory as Large Pages and since that memory is non-pageable, it may result
 in starvation of other processes running on the same machine. please share, if there is any such restriction or if it is configurable via some settings.</li><li><strong>I learnt that Large Page Memory should always be contigous,</strong> so allocation of Large Page should be done carefully to ensure their availability. I want to confirm if the Memory allocation fails 100%, if OS can not find a contigous memory
 of required size OR is there any fallback to it?</li></ol>
<p>I could not find anything concrete regarding this questions. Please point me to the reference doc, if any.</p>
<p>Though this question is not specific to any Windows Version, still i am posting it for Windows 8.1.</p>
<p />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            8015d002 error</h2>
                    
<p>So my question is what do you do when you have this error and have tried all the corrections to fix it? &nbsp;I have a family account with 3 gamertags. &nbsp;Only having a problem with one tag and its not the main one. &nbsp;Constantly asks for the email and password and
 then give the 8015d002 error. &nbsp;I have added account security info, I have deleted and redownloaded the profile, I have cleared the cache and I have tried completely changing my account log in password. &nbsp;Nothing helps. &nbsp;It will allow me to log in for about
 a min or so then kicks me out and asks for the email and password. &nbsp;What do I try now?&nbsp; And why is it only on this one profile?</p>

<p>Hello commander fox2,</p>
<p>If you have tried everything for error code 8015D002, and its still not working.&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup</a></p>
<p>I think it might be a setting you have for that account. You said it under a family account, so try and look at your settings for that account. Parent controls.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work then I would recommend calling Xbox Live. 1800-4MY-XBOX.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<div>
Overview
<div>
<p>The Xbox 360 console lets you customize and manage your family's access to games, movies and television content. The Xbox 360 parental controls can be used to control the console itself and access to Xbox LIVE. Parental controls allow you control things
 such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which games can be played. </li><li>Which movies and TV shows can be watched. </li><li>How long each family member can use the console on a daily or weekly basis. </li><li>Whether or not someone can access Xbox LIVE. </li></ul>

<p>Well after trying all this and then spending 2 hours on the phone with Xbox live I learned several things. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;The people at xbox live know nothing more than what you can find on this website. &nbsp;All they can do is repeat what I can plainly read here. &nbsp;2.
 &nbsp;Apparently, Mircosoft has some severe big brother issues and needs to better educate their employees what is happening. &nbsp;So, I decided to post this to help others and hopefully save them the agony I experianced. &nbsp;The error says their is something wrong with
 your account and that they need more security information. &nbsp;That part is true, well somewhat. &nbsp;What it means is xbox live or Microsoft wants more information about you. &nbsp;Here is the big catch that even they didn't know. &nbsp;Microsoft wants "security info" for
 EVERY gamer tag. &nbsp;Meaning if you have a family account and multiple gamer tags you will need to put security proofs for EVERY gamer tag. &nbsp;Here in was the problem. &nbsp;I followed their intructions and added "proofs" but it only applied to my gamer tag not the
 tags for my two sons. &nbsp;If xbox live knew this valuable piece of information it could have saved everyone time and fustration. &nbsp;Once I added specific information for the specific gamer tag that wouldn't log in everything worked fine. &nbsp;To do that you need to
 research the email address associated with that specific gamer tag. &nbsp;I thought they all were connected to the main account email address and they were not. &nbsp;By using the specific email attached to that specific gamer tag I was able to log in and add "proofs".
 &nbsp;Again, this was all information I had to learn on my own. &nbsp;Xbox live support had no idea how to fix this.</p>
<p>Now this is the second part that bugs me. &nbsp;These "proofs" are labeled as a security feature. &nbsp;A way to prove this is my account if there is ever a problem. &nbsp;Several thoughts here. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;Why can't I just have a family account be linked to one email address?
 &nbsp;These are my kids. &nbsp;They don't need or have an email address. &nbsp;Nor does Microsoft need their names or other information. &nbsp;2. &nbsp;I can understand having a secondary email or an additional phone number to text or verify. &nbsp;Maybe even a specific address but all
 of this should already be on the account when you charged my creditcard each year for renewal. &nbsp;Why would you need this much info for EACH gamer tag? &nbsp;Its a fishing tool for additional marketing or research plain and simiple. &nbsp;When you are directed to the
 account info website you will notice it nor longer says anything about xbox live rather it is a Microsoft profile. &nbsp;It even boldly labels it as such. 3. Having multiple gamer tags obviously I have multiple xboxs at multiple locations. &nbsp;When I tried to log
 in with my profile or gamer tag at the xbox giving the error it would no longer allow me. &nbsp;How would Microsoft now exactly which xbox to lock out? &nbsp;All profiles or gamer tags on my account would load on my other xboxes but not that specific one. &nbsp;Hmmm....
 &nbsp;seems to me they must be capturing IP addresses as well. &nbsp;So what are they doing with all this information? &nbsp;Hopefully, this can help others if and when the 8015d002 error shows up on one of their systems.</p>

<p>Hello Commander! &nbsp;First off I wanted to say thanks for posting this here. &nbsp;One of these good things about these Forums is that seeing what solved it for other users can definitely help future users out- especially in situations like yours where it's a little
 bit off the regular troubleshooting flow. So having you post back what did eventually fix is it very, very appreciate.<br />
<br />
That said, I am definitely sorry to hear that there's been a bad experience with support. &nbsp;I'm glad it's resolved now, at least. &nbsp;I also hope I can shed at least a little light on what's up.<br />
<br />
Now, everyone who uses LIVE has to have their own unique account- that's a part of our ToU. &nbsp;On a family pack like yours, they are all sharing a subscription and therefor billing info. &nbsp;That's kind of how we set it up for you to be able to use family controls,
 not have to worry about individual LIVE subscriptions, all that good stuff. However, since having a hacker get control of any one of those accounts would definitely be a pain- even best case scenario, your kids could be locked out of their accounts for a while
 as it got sorted back out. Two-tiered security (like the proofs we now require on account) are among the best new methods of making sure accounts can't be accessed without permission and if something does go wrong they help us get accounts back to the proper
 owners ASAP. As it says when you add the proofs- they're never used for marketing or anything other than security. As for everything saying Microsoft rather than Xbox, an Xbox LIVE account with its GT is always tied to a Microsoft Account. &nbsp;If you only use
 the Xbox LIVE functionality of that account, that's totally fine, but it will be tied to the larger account.<br />
<br />
As for why you get an error specifically on one console &nbsp;and not another I'll be honest: I couldn't say exactly why that happened. &nbsp;That it was proofs on a related account messing with yours is kind of a uncommon error. I doubt it was anything at all to do
 with IP/Home Network and more to do with how the account was stored on the console- something on the console disagreeing with something in the service.<br />
<br />
Got a little long-winded there, but I could tell that you had a lot of questions and I hope this helps. &nbsp;In addition, we do always want to hear about our customers' experiences, especially when something could have gone better for them. &nbsp;You can hit up our
 feedback forums here if you like: http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/general_discussion/f/133.aspx<br />
<br />
Again, thanks so much for your post and I hope you all have some good Xbox time now!&nbsp;</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I too have been using Skype for many years, and, since 2014, I have had a VOIP number replacing my landline. Until this month, besides occasional audio/connection problems, there have been no issues, the UI was simple and effective, and updates were handled
 easily. Then came the latest update, with which I have several problems:</p>
<p>- The UI is much fancier but no more effective.</p>
<p>- My history has been lost (which was important to me as it provided a log of interaction with my clients)</p>
<p>- The concept of a 'favorites' list (and alphabetic listing of contacts) seem to have disappeared.</p>
<p>- The update changed my settings without warning (so initially Skype was not operational)</p>
<p>MOST IMPORTANTLY</p>
<p>- Yesterday, when I tried to use Skype, I was told that the shortcut on my Task Bar was not linked (nor was the Skype logo in my program list). So I tried to re-install, and was told that Skype could not connect! I suspect Kaspersky is blocking it, but have
 yet to find a way to bypass the restriction. Anyone else experiencing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had thought Microsoft had matured, and the days were long gone when V1 was really an alpha test quality, V2 was beta test quality, and you had to wait for V3 before being assured of an operational version.</p>

<p>These canned responses to users' problems only tend to drive users away from Skype, and ultimately Microsoft. The latest update should never have been released with gross problems as have been reported. I would never have upgraded to it, except that Skype/Microsoft
 now seems to force the upgrade after a period of time of rejecting the upgrade. For me, running Windows 7 64-bit (because of work software), the "Classic" version of Skype will eventually lock up completely if I continually reject the latest upgrade. A part
 of that lock-up process is to start some sub-process that takes up a full CPU and grabs in excess of 2Gb of RAM...until I kill the process and upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the recommended solution to handle the upgrade problems is to reinstall the "Classic" version. Once installed, the process repeats, only with a more frequent lock-up cycle. It is readily apparent that Skype developers, support and managers are completely
 disconnected from day-to-day users who rely on the functionality of versions from past years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you don't support Firefox, a browser far superior to Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Due to the patch release of Firefox, Skype will not work, but you can use other browsers to work with Skype.</p>

            This is not the reply I would expect to see from a professional company - nevermind from a world leader (which has the added responsibility of being a role model for smaller and younger companies). I can understand a reply that a warning was issued that
 "temporarily, due to some complexities in a recent version of Firefox ..." with an indication of the incompatibility being resolved. Whenever any new version of a major browser is issued, I would expect your developers (or AI) to check for any incompatibilities.
 What we got instead was NO WARNING. an action which would have saved me hours of time, and no indication in your above message that the incompatibility would be resolved.<br />
