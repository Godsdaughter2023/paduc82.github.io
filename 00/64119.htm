    <title>How to change language of OS on new laptop without reinstalling - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change language of OS on new laptop without reinstalling windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just received a new company laptop with the Windows 10 OS language in Italian. I have just been told by our IT that it is impossible to change the language to English without going through the whole process of reinstalling Windows.
</p>
<p>I have tried to search for solutions online (such as:&nbsp;https://www.windowscentral.com/how-properly-change-system-default-language-windows-10) but apparently (IT told me that with the latest Windows 10) it did not work even with administrative access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it a bit absurb that in this day and age that the language can only be changed with reinstallation...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone help me with this? Is it possible to change the OS language without reinstallation? Thank you very much!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Ping</p>

            Hi hhuiping 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />You can add another language for keyboard etc.  But to actually change the whole language you will need to reinstall.
<br />You have to understand that you are wanting to change the whole operating system language.  So it being a quick switch is not possible.
<br />The registry needs to get rebuilt with the new language and that requires a reinstall.
<br />To just add English keyboard go to start - settings - time and language - region and language.  
<br />So basically what the article you posted is doing.  It will work to the point that your keyboard will be English but not all system settings will be English.  They will still be in Italian.

<br />Unfortunately, Reinstall is the only option to change the language properly.

</p><p>Dear Sarah and Sumit,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for both your quick responses! Especially Sarah for explaining why the reinstallation is required. I understand now...
</p>
<p>I guess I will have to just learn to work with the OS in Italian. :)&nbsp;</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Please see the below Apple Support article:

<br />
<br />You can try the troubleshooting steps under the Windows PC section. It suggests reinstalling your drivers in a few different ways, but at the bottom of the page it suggests trying a different USB cable or contacting Apple Support if the problem persists.

            Try this:
<br />Right-click the Apple Mobile Device entry in Device Manager&gt;Universal Serial Bus controllers and choose&nbsp;Update Driver Software.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />• Select "Browse my computer for driver software."
<br />• Select "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer."
<br />• Click the&nbsp;Have Disk&nbsp;button.&nbsp;Note:&nbsp;If the Have Disk option is not present, choose a device category such as Mobile Phone or Storage Device if listed, and then click next. The Have Disk button should then appear.
<br />• Click the&nbsp;Browse&nbsp;button and navigate to C:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\Drivers.
<br />• Double-click the "usbaapl" file. (This file will be called "usbaapl64" if you have a 64-bit version of Windows. If you don't see "usbaapl64" here, or if there is no Drivers folder, look in C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\Drivers. instead).
<br />• Click&nbsp;Open&nbsp;in the Have Disk window. Then, click&nbsp;Next&nbsp;and then Click&nbsp;Finish. Windows will install the driver.

<h2>            How do I get a second Xbox One attached to my Xbox Live account&#63;</h2>
                    I just purchased an Xbox One for my younger son.&nbsp; My older son already has an Xbox One with Xbox Live.&nbsp; How do I have my younger son's Xbox connect to my older son's Xbox Live account?&nbsp; I have looked up ways to do it on the internet, but it is either unclear
 or I just am not understanding it.&nbsp; Also, is it even possible?&nbsp; If there is a step by step document that would be great.

<p>Hey there TD1TD!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the confusion. </p>
<p>1. Yes</p>
<p>2. Yes</p>
<p>3. Not necessarily. If you have your younger son make the old console his home, anyone would be able to download and play his digital games one that Xbox too.
</p>
<p>4. No gamertag can be signed in on 2 Xbox Ones simultaneously.</p>
<p>5. Yes, that is the idea. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You would want to have your older son sign into the new Xbox with his gamertag and make that his home console. Once you do, he can totally sign into any other console and still play the games and use the Gold he has, but anyone who wants to play with him
 and use those features would have to use the newer console. He bought the rights to the subscription and when you make this change, it will basically share the rights with anyone who uses the console he selects. He doesn't need to be signed in at all after
 the change for this to hold either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, we&nbsp;have a support article that you may want to read up on about our game sharing feature here at
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you want to change the default viewer for Microsoft Fax and Scan, then you need to change the default file association for the type of file which you are trying to view.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For example for .<b>jpg</b> file you can set Microsoft Office Document Imaging by following these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<span>c)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>In “<b>Open</b> <b>with</b>” window select “<b>Microsoft</b>
<b>Office Document imaging</b>” </span></p>
<p>
<span>d)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click <b>Ok</b> and <b>Apply</b>
</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Access denied to Start Menu. How to access&#63; Update&#33;</h2>
                    I was unable to respond to the original post, but wanted to let others who may be experiencing this issue in WIndows 10. I have had shortcuts to "My Pictures", "My Documents", "My etc..." for some time. Everytime I attempted to use them I got "Access Denied",
 yet I could go straight to the folders with no problem. After reading the original post, I started looking at the permissions on these shortcuts. I noticed that besides the expects permission for myself and for Admins, there was also one for "Everyone" with
 "Special Permissions" only. This did not look right for "My" stuff, so I simply removed the "Everyone" and now they work without any "Access Denied". The more I think about it, these may have been carried over when I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7.
 Now I wonder if having upgraded, rather than a clean install, might be a commonality of those who have had this issue.

            Do you get an error message when you try to make a call?
<br />
<br />If so, what does it say when you try to make the call?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows are you running?
<br />
<br />Have you tried uninstall then reinstall Skype to see if you can make call?
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />Still not working? Try uninstall then reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X 
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />  Open start menu
<br />    Type in "powershell" 
<br />    Right click on "Windows PowerShell"
<br />    Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Then paste the following command
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -AllUsers Microsoft.SkypeApp | foreach { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" }
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Uninstall Skype 12:
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />install the 8.30 version which Microsoft is replacing Skype 12 with on Windows 10:

<br />
<br />NOTE: We’re letting you know that support for Skype version 7 will end on Nov?emb?er 1, 2?01?8 on desktop devices and Nov?emb?er 15 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, we’ll begin requiring updates to version 8. Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while longer.
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h3> blackhorsepaddy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t extend Windows 7 dual boot partition.</h2>
                    
<p>Several months ago I installed Windows 7 to a dual boot configuration on my Windows VISTA laptop. I'm very happy with Windows 7 and am using it more and more. However, I was a bit conservative with disk space when I partitioned for dual booting and would
 now like to expand the disk size for Windows 7. I have successfully used shrink on the Windows VISTA partition but can't get the Windows 7 partition to extend into the unallocated area.</p>

Hi</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will require some additional information to assist you better.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have only one partition, follow the instructions below to resolve your issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click

                    After updating from Vista to Windows 7 on my HP laptop, the notebook will not go into sleep mode when the Iogear mini optical mouse is plugged into the USB port. If I unplug it, Sleep mode works fine. Iogear says the GME222A mouse does not need an updated
 driver and the Windows 7 program should upgrade all drivers for it. They say they have no problems running it on the Windows 7. What can I do?

<h2>            Recover windows from dead hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Huawei Matebook x whose hard drive is dead and won't boot. Nor am I able to get into the recovery for reset. I know I will have to replace the ssd and do a fresh windows install. I don't have a recovery disc or usb either. I was wondering if</p>
<p>1) there is a way to get a copy of windows for install</p>
<p>2) recover and reuse my existing oem license on the same laptop after the ssd chnage</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is under warranty but was bought is China (And I won't be going there again) and&nbsp; so, Huawei US refuses to help with anything Windows, directing me to Microsoft. So that route is closed. So that route is a no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will appreciate any help I can get. Thank you!!</p>

            Hi PS_420, you have nothing to worry about, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a Product Key, activation will be automatic and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Suggest a Windows RT for x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evaluatingrt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suggest a Windows RT for x64</h2>
                    <p>Windows RT is one excellent platform for mobile computing incorporating ARM-based computers. How much I love Microsoft Windows&nbsp;on platforms other than x86/x64, such as early days PowerPC, MIPS, Alpha and even Itanium, unifying different platforms presenting
 one common interface for end users and developers. I love Surface RT for it is not&nbsp;an embedded system like a functional phone or a traditional computer such as&nbsp;setting on desk or lap, for its limited but specific applications meeting every day's&nbsp;usage. I don't
 need it to do something without its&nbsp;reach. Such a clever and adorable thing always brings me the easy feeling with it. But as we know Windows RT is different from Windows 8 for many respects, and tablets based on&nbsp;Intel ATOM&nbsp;cores are not strong enough for
 most desktop applications. Comparing with ARM cores, ATOM is another economic and widely acceptable cores for mobile computing. Will Microsoft provide one ATOM optimized Windows RT for tablets incorporating it? Desktop applications for them seem not that important
 for its limited computing execution resources, and Windows 8/8 Pro is just that one not that suitable for that platform.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If two Windows RT platforms are available, they both would satisfy different users, and most important, keep a balanced competitions across cores for mobile. End users would never care about its underlying support hardware, but the upper Windows
 RT, same apps on different architectures for tablets could accelerate metro platform evolution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Eliminate Wow64 layer, without supporting traditional x86 at all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Use some ATOM exclusive instructions to avoid other x64 based processors to use it.</p>

            <p>One year later I get back to my post here, and today, the ATOM based tablets&nbsp;have already on sale shelves&nbsp;and much cheaper than Surface too, but of course, this post is definitively igrnored. Microsoft satisfies these tablets with Windows 8.1 with Bing,
 just a licence changed version&nbsp;of Windows 8.1 U1. After evaluating serveral tablets like that, I feel a bit diappointed. Take a 1GiB Memory, 16G SD one for example, after install Windows 8.1 with Bing,&nbsp;it is almost not able to updates the system, for its 16G
 space has almost eaten up for nothing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, I have to commit that these tablets are too cheap, but when one finds there is almost no room to update or to install Apps, so I hardly think microsoft would benefit from this thing well. Cheap price is the best chance for everyone to purchase,
 and the best chance for microsoft to introduce Windows to everyone's hand. But for the situation right now, this Windows with Bing just persudes most users to use Android instead. Anyhow in any country, for everyone, the purchaser might just want to get a
 tablet to use, rather than always consider my tablet is&nbsp;out of reach of its defaut OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wish, or suggest Microsoft would make something right in right time, not let their users lose faith in it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, the thought process you have is good.&nbsp; 64-bit ARM processors are on the scene and Qualcomm is in Microsoft's envelope now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ATOM is also going 64-bit and the current 32-bit "Bay Trail" is an impressive CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should happen for tablets and should have been done since day one was put the operating system on chips (flash memory).&nbsp; Leave the storage wide open and chips would act as a shadow "Drive C:".&nbsp; Tandy used to do that with the old Tandy computers where
 they not only had MS-DOS on chips but also Deskmates (framework) on the chips as well.&nbsp; The real Drive C: had full capacity and nothing was used for the system until you started installing your software and the rest of Deskmates to make it functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flash memory would allow updates to the operating system and even make the computer more secure.&nbsp; No recovery system would be needed (it could be on a flash chip as well).&nbsp; That would use a little space on the motherboard but would leave the SSD card wide
 open for storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think a SSD card is fast booting up?&nbsp; Booting from flash is instant!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, keep thinking the way you are, because that may already be in the works.&nbsp; There is nothing really wrong with the ARM processor as long as you don't really need much in software other than what is already on the tablet.&nbsp; The included Microsoft Office
 + Outlook: you can do anything with those.&nbsp; Just a few apps from the Store and you can do anything you want.</p>

            <p>Even though I could not understand what you mean here exactly, but I do have to say thank you. "Bay Trail" is the code name for a series of Intel Atom processors, which is 64-bit processors, with legacy support for IA-32. Most Tablets based on this kinda
 processors in China mainland provide only IA-32 ECL for UEFI, which means only 32bit OS could be loaded by the UEFI. For&nbsp;the current situation of Microsoft Windows, the only way to utilize its 64-bit capability is using virtual machine software. But for the
 only 1GiB memory configuration, that does really look ridiculous. So even though most tablets labeled as 64-bit intel core inside, there is almost impossible to expose its 64-bit computing power at all. When I was enjoying Windows XP Professional x64 in 2005,
 I found PC even equipped with 1GiB memory sometimes could make HDD light turning on and on for lot of times, which means, 1GiB is not adequate for 64-bit OS. I've no ideas about the Windows XP 64-bit Edition for Itanium 2002, but its requirement in 2001, need
 at least 1GiB system memory. So I could not imagine even though the manufacturers could provide x64 ECL for UEFI, what the tablet could feel like when running under x64 edtions of Windows 8/8.1. But I am so sure that these "Bay Trail" processors are much stronger
 than the processors in Microsoft Surface 1st under 32bit mode. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've no ideas about ARM64 whether it also provides the legacy support for the 32bit mode. If, I think and believe the situation is much&nbsp;similar with those ATOM processors mentioned above. Other posts of mine in other topics stated that the only way
 to fully utilize the potential power of ATOM and ARM64 is just sitting the Windows core onto the 32bit mode but provides support for 64-bit APPs. That might be the initial purpose of Intel for several of their 64-bit processors with support of maximum 1GiB
 memory. But comparing against Playstation 3 and Xbox360, both are 64-bit game consoles, only equipped only 256MiB or 512MiB system memory but giving out a splendid performance for the games. I could not expect APPs would get close to games for game console,
 but tending the tablet OS towards to the game consle might be the key to conquer the tablets market.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I might mentioned firmware size, but I don't mean that OS need to be programmed onto EPROM, leaving the updates to the external storage. I just expect tablet OS could have an acceptable size to be welcome by most tablets including entry-level tablets,
 and the processor's the power should as possible as it can&nbsp;be sacrificed onto the actual apps rather than the smart algorithms on platform/architecture emulation. Surface might need a Office to make imaginations to pictures. But for pure tablets app-based
 Office might be the first choice...Sorry for all my ideas here...</p>

            <p>Well the costs of SSD cards are coming down and there should be no excuse to not have at least a 250GB model at the minimum for the price charged for the tablets.&nbsp; I bought one for $130 and use it for external backup storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Game consoles are fixed and will surprise you when you see the CPU that is in them.&nbsp; They don't have the overhead of a regular computer even though they are computers themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The example I made about Tandy computers where the core set of MS-DOS and part of the Deskmates (you can look it up in Wikipedia if you want to learn more about it) and occupied no space on the storage.&nbsp; The EEPROM chips in those days where small in storage
 but flash memory used in their place are not read only.&nbsp; They can be updated/upgraded.&nbsp; GRID laptops also used that same concept and had a bay just above the keyboard where the user could insert EEPROM chips preloaded with software and required no disk space
 for except for data storage.&nbsp; That is one of the key problems with the Surface tablets is that a bulk of the storage is used up for not only the operating system and software but also the recovery and using a small capacity storage device to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI is going to be here to stay and the ARM and ATOM processors will remain at the low end of the spectrum but they do their jobs pretty well.&nbsp; By the way, UEFI is going to replace BIOS and is being phased in gradually.&nbsp; Some computer motherboards are already
 shipping with no BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the RT line is going to remain and there is still a future for it.&nbsp; The 64-bit variants are In production but the systems that are the focus is actually Linux and Android.&nbsp; The single board computers are what's driving that and are becoming a big hit
 in robotics (not just regular computers).&nbsp; Also, your 3D printers on the market use them as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think in the future, Windows will have to be totally rewritten from the ground up and not carry code over from one version to the next.&nbsp; You saw part of the reason with Windows XP 64-bit which really didn't work well.&nbsp; Lack of software was a hamper also.</p>

            <p>No, it is just a broader subject when you start thinking of the CPU and the storage also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think to "stay tuned" on what is coming out in the near future and also long term.&nbsp; I do know that ARM is sticking around and 64-bit is in the picture as well.&nbsp; But Microsoft never gives details and only few hints here and there.&nbsp; Microsoft is still in
 the learning and development phase and these tablets are a new chapter for them.&nbsp; They will eventually 'get it together'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the Windows 10 beta right now and do know it will be available for the ARM tablets early next year.</p>

            <p>OK, I might get you wrong, or you might get me wrong, but for your reply, I have to say thank you. I mentioned not only the processor and storage, but the things above it. The cheaper or entry-level atom based tablets are just like
<em>fish and chips </em>you can get it from anywhere, but for Peking Duck or beef stack, you&nbsp;need go to the proper restaurant for each of them, and&nbsp;Surface or iPad might just take those places. Those foods are different, and those devices are different too.
 It&nbsp;does&nbsp;not say that if&nbsp;one has&nbsp;eaten fish and&nbsp;chips without purpose to eat beef stack with his/her lover, and that&nbsp;does&nbsp;not say&nbsp;that if you already got ATOM-based tablet without the purpose to get the Surface 3 or iPad Air 2 too. But the reason to make people
 want to also get Surface 3 is not the&nbsp;detail&nbsp;specification of&nbsp;underlying hardware, but the PROPER. The good PROPER make you fall in love with Windows based entry-level tablet, and the same PROPER make you find worth spending on Surface 3. If&nbsp;you think the
 Windows based entry-level tablet is not that great, and I have no ideas people would love to obtain Surface 3 for the future.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ATOM-based entry-level tablets are not the competitors of Surface, but the supplement to Surface. It does not need&nbsp;must-be stronger or weaker than Surface, but it does need to be useful what people wish it to be reasonably useful. I found Windows with
 Bing is a heavy cart to cart for&nbsp;it, so I mentioned Storage and Processor. That's it, that's it. Sorry, but thank you for your reply again.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Hardware issue is one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. It's possible that your computer is only able to detect one of the memory cards. We suggest trying other memory card slot on the motherboard and see if it helps. Also, we suggest testing
 both the memory card one by one to be able to detect if there is an issue on one of them. If you need assistance for troubleshooting hardware issue, you may contact your computer manufacturer for additional assistance.<br />
<br />
If anything comes up, don't hesitate to get back to us anytime.

            Is there a bios update for your motherboard. Are the 2 memory modules a matched pair.

<h2>            Wifi issues in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>My mother recently received a new modem from TWC. We installed the new modem and connected the Linksys to it. &nbsp;Before the new modem we would connect to the modem I believe but we still used the Linksys for wifi. Now we have to connect to "Linksys" and disconnect
 from the old arrangement but when we connect it shows full bars for signal strength and a little shield shaped symbol in the upper left corner with an exclamation point in it. Can you please explain what this means. We have rebooted the Linksys. At first the
 laptop wouldn't connect at all to the Linksys. We called Linksys and they said that we needed a new router.</p>

<p>Hi Thomson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding "FOR THE PAST 6 months or so, I don't get notifications for new messages or calls in Skype for business", may I confirm whether your colleagues also encounter the same issue with Skype for Business for iOS APP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, the possible reason of this issue is the feature of push notification has been turned off by your administrator in the Office 365 admin center, if you need to receive notifications from Skype for Business for iOS APP, you may need to contact your
 administrator for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is an article about how to turn on push notifications for Apple devices for your reference:</p>

<p><span>Hello Thomson,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for coming back to us. I am monitoring this thread by now. Since you mentioned that all your colleagues cannot receive the notifications either, may I know what type of your Skype for Business server
 is? Is it purely online, on-premises or hybrid?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please kindly contact your admin to check it and let us know the outcome. Because if you are using Skype for Business server 2015, then the notification is not working for Skype for Business for IOS.</span></p>

<p>Hi Sylvie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you mean to say that Skype notifications on my iPhone doesn't work unless I sign out off Skype on all other devices? Skype should be kept logged off on all other devices all the time? I can't log in to Skype on multiple devices at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my organization enables Skype notifications on mobile app and still if I don't get Skype notifications on my iPhone, is there a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes all of them use iOS devices.</p>

<p>Hello Thomson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. There are some factors that can affect the notifications on your phone, such as the notifications was turned off, you have read the message on other devices, your organization’s policy, etc. To identity what the root cause is, we need
 your testing and cooperation to help us narrow down this problem. The suggestion that log off your other devices is just a troubleshooting step to check it. Sorry for the unclear explanation before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since all the users in your organization cannot receive notifications, this is more likely to your organization policy. Please contact your admin to turn on notifications in Skype for Business admin center as @ Jennifer suggested. If you still have this
 problem, we will figure out other troubleshooting steps to find the root cause. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We truly appreciate your understanding and cooperation on it.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your confirmation from your admin. I did a test on my side and found that if you log into multiple devices at the same time, you won’t receive the new message notifications on your IOS phone. I
 did a double research and found that this information is also listed in the official document:</span>

<strong>Additional scenarios and alert options</strong> part in that article. Sorry for the mistake before. I truly appreciate your understanding.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thus, since the notification is already enabled for your organization, I suggest you log out from other devices except mobile and check whether you can receive new message notifications.</span></p>

<h2>            Computer has become slower suddenly</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate in my Intel Pentium Dual Core(E2180), 3 G.B RAM and 39.2 G.B C: Drive which has 12.7 G.B free space. The problem is that my computer has become suddenly slower yesterday when using windows live messenger. I've used windows live
 messenger previously but I didn't face such consequences. I've checked hard disk for errors but none was found. I've even done windows memory diagnostic but no problems was found. Also I've done defragmentation and checked for viruses and other malwares but
 no problems were found. I don't have any idea what to do now please help.<br />
<br />
P.S- I've recently encrypted my external hard drive with bitlocker. <br />

            <p>&nbsp;You could've picked up a virus or some form of malware.&nbsp; Here're some things to check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into <u>Safe Mode</u>. Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in
<u>Safe Mode</u>. To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode. Then run a full system scan.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Microsoft has suggestions and offerings at </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/how-do-I-remove-a-computer-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/how-do-I-remove-a-computer-virus</u></a></p>
<p>- </p>
<p>Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3"><u>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</u></a></p>
<p>- </p>
<p>If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem. To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore. Click the box that says
<i>Show more restore points</i>. </p>
<p>- </p>
<p>You can check for corrupted system files. Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type
<u>CMD </u>in the search box, right-click CMD.EXE and click <i>Run as administrator</i>. Then from the command prompt type
<u>sfc /scannow</u><i>.</i></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log. To do that click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer. Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.</p>
<p>`</p>
<p>When you get your system back in good working order, <b>I urge you to back your system up to an external hard drive and make regular periodic updates to it.</b></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

            Hi,<br />
I've done the boot-time scan but with no results. I mean no threats were found. I've already backup-ed my system with a system image before this problem arise.

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time when update completed 71%, the computer would reboot and show the blue screen. The stop code is Page Fault in Nonpaged area. I thought there might be some driver conflicts that caused this error. Actually some of my friends also encountered this

<p><strong>Aug 5th UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found where the problem is. I installed a third-party software, called “Drive The Life", to update my drivers&nbsp;. Some *.sys files of this software would result in this PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA error and you can check the information in "rollbackinfo.ini".
 You just need to uninstall this "Drive The Life" and delete corresponding *.sys files mentioned in "rollbackinfo.ini" and you might be able to update your PC.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Kaihang,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like inform you that PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED can occur after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Another possible cause is the installation of a faulty system service or faulty driver code.</span></p>
<p><span>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to&nbsp;disable&nbsp;third party security software (if any installed), and check.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
<strong><span>Disable Antivirus:</span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also, I suggest you refer the below article and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559023(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559023(v=vs.85).aspx</span></a></span></strong></p>

<p>Following advice below, did you manage to solve the issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran memory diagnostic and found no issues. I also tweaked page file to be managed by system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am now disabling antivirus. This is my third attempt and will shortly be my fourth.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Sunni,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to the system prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>You might have set the theme to <strong>high contrast #1 </strong>on your Computer that is the reason you are getting black screen with white fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below steps, change your theme settings and check if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Now click on <strong>Personalization</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Themes </strong>from the left list and click on <strong>Theme settings</strong>.</li><li>Now select any of the <strong>Windows default themes</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Write to us, if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />* Go to search, type regedit, and open Registry Editor
<br />
<br />* Navigate to the following path:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareClassesLocal SettingsSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionAppModelRepositoryFamiliesMicrosoft.Windows.Photos_8wekyb3d8bbwe
<br />
<br />* Here, you should see a couple of entries, each of which contains a version number (Microsoft.Windows.Photos_2017.35071.13510.0). If there are more than three entries, that means the outdated keys remained after the update.
<br />
<br />So, remove the outdated entries, and leave only the most recent three entries. But you cannot just delete it, as you need to get permissions to do so. And here’s what you should do.
<br />
<br />*Select one old entry, right-click it, and choose Properties
<br />
<br />* Go to Security &gt; Permission tab
<br />
<br />*Choose Advanced from the Select User or Group window
<br />
<br />* Select Find Now, enter your username, and click OK
<br />
<br />* Now, you can select the old entry, and delete it
<br />
<br />* Repeat the process for each one of the old entries
<br />
<br />* Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let me know, if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards:
<br />Yasir
