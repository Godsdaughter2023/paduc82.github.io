<h2>            Scrolling feature on touchpad is not working....help&#33;</h2>
                    I have an Inspirion 1525, just the other day the scrolling feature of the touchpad has stopped working.&nbsp; I have tried to search through the control panel to find an option to turn "scrolling" back on, I have not found anything.&nbsp; I am running Windows Vista.
 Any suggestions on how to turn "scrolling" back ON??

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try System Restore back to before you did that :<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span><br />
</a><br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Mouse - look for TouchPad Settings - mine is under Device Settings tab and yours<br />
maybe different (it is NOT the Scrollings tab which is for the mouse). On some you can enable<br />
and disable the scroll and/or set the size of the area and the sensitivity of the touchpad.<br />
<br />
Some will&nbsp;have a&nbsp;TouchPad control progam/icon in the Notification&nbsp;Area near the clock&nbsp;- lower<br />
right.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check with System maker's support, on-line documentation,&nbsp;and/or forums as there probably
<br />
are Hotkeys that enable and disable&nbsp;the touchpad functions. <br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
If needed : (make sure you have rebooted at least once if the above did not work)<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on Touch Pad - Driver's Tab -<br />
Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers), now RIGHT CLICK<br />
on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself (all in it). REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack. <br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />

<br />
Then go to System maker's site&nbsp;and get the latest touchpad drivers.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.</p>

<p>Hey TheKaw</p>
<p>
</p><p>I once again want to take the opportunity to thank you for bring this to the Xbox Forums.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to what Jurgen1488&nbsp;stated, the six characters included in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/mortal-kombat-11-kombat-pack/btjpc1c99fs4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mortal Kombat 11 Kombat Pack</a>&nbsp;will be "released over time" so you will have to wait for an update. You will however get a few additional things with this pack:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>• 1 week early access to DLC characters, exclusive to Kombat Pack owners </p>
<p>• 7 exclusive Character Skins </p>
<p>• 7 exclusive sets of gear</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you don't have access to the skins or the gear included in this, I would then recommend that you try some of the steps that XBF Steven R and see if that works out for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still are not able to get access to included items in the dlc, I would the recommend that you reach of the developers of Mortal Kombat,
<a href="http://www.netherrealm.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NetherRealm Studios</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and let us know about your results!</p>

<h2>            New Star Trek game</h2>
                    
<p>Where are the trekkies????<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-2.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[quote]Set in the new movie universe of characters, the recently announced Star Trek game looks like nothing else the franchise has ever seen.
<br />
<br />
There have been lots of Star Trek games over the years, but few that have managed to garner attention beyond the dedicated Trek fan community. Digital Extremes is looking to change that with its new Star Trek game, which pairs Kirk and Spock together in a cooperative
 action game set in the universe established in 2009's Abrams' directed film. <br />
<br />
The game will release to PS3, 360 and PC sometime in 2012, but Sony has a number of exclusives connected to the title, including a PlayStation Move Phaser peripheral, and stand-alone pre-release downloadable content, presumably a DLG in the vein of games like
 Dead Rising 2: Case Zero. <br />
<br />
“Most teaser trailers feature zero gameplay, but we’re proud to introduce Star Trek to the world with a first look made up entirely of pre-Alpha gameplay to show how great the game looks even though it is more than a year off,” said Tom Lesinski, president
 of Paramount Digital Entertainment in a press release. “The level of quality and authenticity to the new Star Trek (2009) universe is a testament to talent of the team and the strong collaboration between Digital Extremes and the filmmakers.”<br />
<br />
The new trailer certainly looks pretty action-packed. Here's hoping this new Trek can find an audience beyond its familiar niche.[/quote]</p>

<p>I have been a Star Trek fan all my life (I'm 37) only ever bought the DVD's, videos and games and never been to a convention. I hope this game is good the only other brilliant Star Trek game is Bridge Commander III on the PC. Now if they made another one
 of those and put it on the Xbox it would be amazing.</p>
<p>This game looks good but this is a Star Trek game so the budget will not be massive so you will not be able to compare it to Gears Of War (which i don't like) &nbsp;as long as it looks ok and plays well and has a good save system then i will be happy. The last
 Star Trek game failed for me because of the save system each auto save was sometimes miles apart.</p>
<p>This is the first game at this year's E3 that made me sit up and say that's on my radar. I will be following the making of this game and i hope fingers crossed it is good.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps saying it&#39;s not genuine.</h2>
                    I had windows 7 home originally I participated in the "beta" before windows was originally released. I just upgrade to the I5-4690k and a MSI z97 gaming 5 motherboard and a XFX R9 390 8g, A day goes by and now it says activate windows. Earlier I did the
 activation thing online it just randomly said that it was activated and was just fine now it is back to saying it's not genuine. What is going on and how do I fix this. I do not know where my original windows 7 disk is I don't want to have to install windows
 7 and upgrade again.

            If you were testing the previous previews of windows 10 and were upgraded to the latest preview which was 10240, thats the latest RTM as well, when you upgraded again you have lost your preview tester ability and the version now requests activation and
 payment for which version you want. The alternative is to re-install windows 7 update it fully, then use the "get windows 10" icon bottom right task bar, to upgrade to windows 10 10240, this would then be activated, just make sure you choose the correct version
 of windows 10 to suit the windows 7 version you have. After the upgrade you can the use the recovery in windows 10 to do a full refresh giving you a fully fledged activated system. Hope this helps you.<br />

So in any words you are recommending me to install windows 7 again and then upgrade once more. Seems like Microsoft wont understand that I&nbsp;upgraded my computer?

<h2>            Windows 10 Photo app auto add ONEDRIVE</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing a problem since the initial Build of Windows 10. Updated and Resinstalled Windows 10 to the latest Build 1607 but still the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Builtin <strong>Photos App </strong>in Windows 10 is having <strong>ONEDRIVE
</strong>by default as i dont want the <strong>ONEDRIVE </strong>pictures to be in
<strong>PHOTOS </strong>app thus i disable <strong>Cloud </strong>and Removed the folder from
<strong>SOURCE list.</strong> This fix the issue for time being. (Shown in First Picture )</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b235e025-2c46-43dc-8c15-ab435b86df4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b235e025-2c46-43dc-8c15-ab435b86df4e" height="165" width="305" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After two restarts of the system the <strong>ONEDRIVE </strong>folder is again added to the
<strong>SOURCE </strong>list whereas the <strong>CLOUD </strong>is still disable. (Screenshot as second picture)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc12516e-1fd8-4343-a5ed-a0e67fb9ef71" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc12516e-1fd8-4343-a5ed-a0e67fb9ef71" height="226" width="425" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>All i want is that the photos app should show only the <strong>Pictures</strong> folder and not Pictures from
<strong>ONEDRIVE</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p />

    <title>Cursor disappeared on windows 8 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hazyandfaded  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor disappeared on windows 8 laptop</h2>
                    Hey,
<div>I have a relatively new acer laptop with windows 8, which up until now I had no problems with. Yesterday night my laptop froze, and so I restarted it, but now when I turn it on no cursor appears.</div>
<div>I've tried toggling the fn-f7 which turns the touchpad off but it doesn't change anything, and I've turned off the option to hide the cursor while typing, and turned on the cursor trail thing, but still nothing. When I press ctrl to find the cursor it
 always tells me it's in the middle of the screen, no matter what I do with the touchpad...</div>
<div>I didn't change any settings or install any updates before this happened and it (unfortunately) isn't a touchscreen, so I'm at a loss!</div>
<div>Any suggestions would be massively appreciated - please help!</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />

<p>Sounds like you've tried just about everything except switch to a real mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In fact, you don't need a real mouse to try to see the effect of one, just activate Mousekeys and start moving the pointer with your Numeric keypad's keys.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, for example, you could press Alt+Shift+NumLock to configure it (if you don't already have it
 configured to be active according to a state for NumLock) and then press Ctrl+NumPad6 (for fast cursor movement but also, so you can see both effects at the same time--Mouse sonar from the Ctrl- key and your mouse pointer from using Ctrl+NumPad6.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note that even if you don't have a physical Numeric keypad you probably have a mode in which some of your normal keyboard keys will act as one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, it wouldn't have to be NumPad6, it could be any of the Numeric keypad digits which are used to simulate
 cursor movement. &nbsp;E.g. imagine the ring of keys around the Numpad5 for all of the possibilities that you would have.&nbsp;&nbsp; You would just need to tap any of those to have your pointer become visible again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I press ctrl to find the cursor it always tells me it's in the middle of the screen
<div><br />
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds like a Touch screen emulation option of your Touch pad.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not normal Touch Screen behavior or normal Mouse emulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Mine happened with an update. I had been using a mouse for a couple week. Last week windows 10 had a major update. After I downloaded the update I disconnected the mouse and installed the update. Works fine now.. I did try pushing fn-F7 did not work for
 me!&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck. BTW after the update I had a lot of left over programs so I ran&nbsp; Advanced System Care- Free, Cleaned it right up! Working fine!

<h2>            Built in CD&#47;DVD player&#47;burner not completing process. It stops, open disc tray, after about 98 percent completion and show an error mesage on my screen.</h2>
                    I have a H/P desktop PC, model# 510-a010 that came equipped with what I CD/DVD player/burner. I tried burning a DVD and the process runs its course until it reaches about 96 percent complete, and then it stops processing and the disc tray opens up and
 then it shows and error message in a small screen in the screen. Believing my factory Windows Media Player was not designed to burn CD or DVD's, I downloaded &amp; installed Nero Platinum , 2019 which comes with comes with a CD &amp; DVD burning program and I get
 the same results. The burner stops after reaching about 98 percent and opens the&nbsp; disc tray &amp; shows some kind of error on my screen. Is my factory installed CD/DVD only a player and not a burner. The model # for the CD/DVD installed unit is hp-HLDS-DVDRW-GUD1N
 located in my E: drive. Does this mean I have to replace my current player and install one that is also a burner. My PC is only about two years old. Can anyone offer some advice on my model number PC.&nbsp;

            Usually if a drive does that it’s due to the disc itself rather than the burner. 
<br />Have you tried a different brand of disc?
<br />Is the total size of the files smaller than the disc size? To me it sounds like there’s too many music files &amp; it’s running out of space.
<br />What is the error message?
<br />The drive is certainly a DVD rewriter.

<p>there are two different messages at different times:</p>
<p>1.) The write speed for the recordable disc is either too fast or too slow for your CD or DVD burner. Insert a recordable disc that has a different write speed, and try again. This was when I tried using windows disc image burner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.)&nbsp; An error occurred during burning. Publishing process was aborted.</p>
<p>This occurred using Nero Media Home burning process.</p>

<p>1.) Yes! I tried three different discs: A: Maxwell, CD-R, 80 min,/700mb. B: Maxwell, CD-RW, 80 min,/700mb. C: Ativa, DVD+R, 16x/4.7GB, /120min.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.)&nbsp; Yes, total files only consist of five jpeg photos with low m/b's each, no music. Plenty of space left on disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.)&nbsp; Using Nero Media Home burning suite, It gave me an error occurred during burning. Publishing process was aborted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.)&nbsp; Yes, I've confirmed that it is a factory installed player/Burner (writer).</p>

<p>Hi Vijay!&nbsp; Yes, I followed your instructions like explained, uninstalled and rebooted my computer and problem still remained. If you can, clarify if I uninstall and reboot or uninstall/ reinstall and then reboot. I followed the cues, shown on the Device&nbsp;
 Manager. The following are just two of the error messages I received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A.)&nbsp; Using Nero Media Home: an error occurred during burning. Publishing process was aborted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B.)&nbsp; Using Windows disc image burner: The write speed for the recordable disc is ether too fast or too slow for your CD or DVD burner. Insert a recordable disc that has a different write speed, and then try again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for helping test Windows 7!</span></p>
<p><span>You will need to go to the Windows 7 Support forums at the following link for help troubleshooting your issue:

</a></p>
<p><span>I am happy to offer you some suggestions though. If you aren’t already, ensure you are using the RC 7100 build obtained from Microsoft.&nbsp; I would suggest also check for a Windows
 7 driver from Nvidia.&nbsp; <br />

                    <span>My HP laptop does not hibernate at low battery instead, it turns off (not shutting&nbsp;down). I'm getting the low battery warning when the battery is at 18%. the
 critical battery level is set at 10% and critical battery action is Hibernate. Problem is device fails to hibernate even after the battery level reaches below 10. &nbsp;it goes till 7-6 % and turns off. I also tried with different critical battery levels. I've
 even tried battery calibration multiple times but no use. &nbsp;And when I charge my laptop it reaches 100% &nbsp;but when I hover the mouse over the battery sign it says 100% available (plugged in, charging) and the battery indicator never turns to white from red.
 Please Help</span>

            Best place to ask about this is HP Support online. Most battery saving utilities will not Sleep or hibernate when the power is too low and the battery is older. Hibernation still relies on battery power although less than Sleep. Shutdown is the only safe
 option for very low battery. If your battery is over 2 yrs old it will run down faster than when it was new. That could be why Hibernation doesn't work any longer. Batteries can fail after 2-3 years or so depending on use and care. Some newer laptops do not
 have user replaceable batteries. Ask HP about your model.

<h2>            Windows 10 version 1703 problems with slow restart &#40;over 20 min&#41;</h2>
                    I updated to 2017-05 cumulative update. This is on a MSI GS63vr-6RF-001 high end laptop with an upgraded 1 TB SSD and 128GB SSD from which it boots from. The type of drive is a Toshiba 128GB PCIex4 M.2SSD NVME 2280 and the other 1 TB SSD is a Samsung PRO
 6 series. The RAM is a dual channel 2 x 16GB 2133Mhz GSkill brand memory. The CPU is an i7-7600HQ 2.7GHz processor. I have the 1703 installed from Windows update assistant because it would not update normally. Shuts down in under 20 secs but restart is around
 20 min as defined in the registry as maximum time to restart and then all tasks are killed. I don't know what's hanging up all of my startup programs are disabled and I don't have many things running when I restart it. I usually restart it only when I have
 an update that needs a restart otherwise I shut it down when I am done with it. I have tried everything I am out of options, fast startup is disabled and power settings are set to high performance plugged in and balanced when on

            Zine eddine B, I have yet to try this but I thought I'd give my $0.02 on options I've tried. I used sfc/scan and it said integrity was fine. I ran dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth and ran a chkdsk with it hanging at 100% complete with no light
 indicating ssd is thinking. It has been going on for several hours now and it's only a 128GB drive! Before all of this, I did a full virus scan and cleaned up all temp files, I did some registry tweaks I found on the internet, I made sure all drivers were
 up to date, Windows update is up to date as well, ran an ec firmware update, installed up to date killer network drivers and a newer version of audio software that came with the pc. I tried to look at event viewer for any clues and didn't really find much.
 It said that server response timed out at time of restart and restart times are all 20 minutes. Shutdown is also 20 minutes. It boots just fine and haven't had to run chkdsk before. Now I'm thinking it may have been a good idea but idk if Win

            Found the culprit, hiberfil.sys was taking up over 45GB of space on my drive. Deleted it, and set paging file to 4GB restart and shutdown are now only a couple seconds. Thanks for all the help I had to figure it out on my own.

<p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>

 For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>For us to effectively assist you with your concern, we would like to know which applications did you uninstall?</span></li><li><span>Was the issue you encountered only specific to the third party antivirus software that you uninstalled?</span></li><li><span>How did your uninstall the applications, was through the applications uninstaller or through control panel in Windows 10?</span></li><li><span>Were there any error messages that you encountered during the uninstall process?</span></li><li><span>Which build and version of Windows 10 do you have?</span></li></ul>
<p>

<p>When I first bought it it was coming with win 7. When the Windows 8 update came, at first Lenovo didn't supported. But then they started sharing drivers. I hope this would be the same. Thank you and sorry for my bad English.</p>

            <p>I also have this problem and it's kind of infuriating. I've never had this problem in Windows 8, 8.1, or the last update of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running on an Acer Aspire V5-571 with Realtek High Definition Audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted both Dolby and my Realtek drivers, reinstalled newer ones and ran their installations in compatibility mode numerous times but I still have no improved audio, just the basic audio that I get with Dolby turned off. Since I use my laptop to listen
 to music, this is unacceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put it into perspective with Dolby Advanced Audio V2 I could have my speakers at 18% and it would be at a perfect volume. Now I need 54% and higher just to hear my friends online.</p>

            Well, I was expecting same from Lenovo but more then a year has passed on&nbsp;still there's no news&nbsp;or even rumor&nbsp;about driver support for win 10 by Lenovo. In my case it's Ideapad Z500 Notebook where i'm not able to adjust screen brightness and dolby home
 theatre&nbsp;has stooped&nbsp;functioning.

<h2>            Intermittent Internet connectivity</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 two days ago, I started to have intermittent network connectivity loss.</p>
<p>Right side corner icon indicates "No network access"</p>
<p>Windows diagnostics indicates "The default gateway is not available" but is not able to fix the issue.</p>
<p>Problem goes away after a reboot, only to appear again later, at random times.</p>
<p>I use Google Chrome and I assumed it is Chrome related, but it did happened using MS Edge, so it has nothing to do with Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My router/modem/network are all working fine, just this one PC (Dell XPS 8300) has this problem AFTER I installed W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions to this problem?</p>
<p>

            <p>Need to add more details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this happens, BEFORE I reboot, going to Device Manager/Network adapters/ Broadcom NetLink (TM) Gigabit Ethernet, under the General tab, I see: " No drivers are installed for this device"</p>
<p>After I reboot, the network connection icon shows no connection to the internet.</p>
<p>Going back to Device manager, the Ethernet adapter appears DISABLED,</p>
<p>After I enable it, everything works fine until next occurrence, which is totally random.</p>
<p>And now under general tab I see "Device is working properly"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is definitely a Windows 10 issue, everything was fine for previous 2 years in Windows 8.1</p>
<p>In other words, Windows 10 randomly disables the Ethernet adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody here can help fix this problem?<br />

            <p>I'm having exactly the same issue and attempts to disable the LAN and troubleshoot / enable results in the endless spinning disk of hope... Only a full reboot works and my productivity has gone to **** by doing this every 20 minutes. &nbsp;I'm thinking of trying
 a clean install as much as I dread it to see if that resolves the issue. &nbsp; Was your upgrade from W8.1 or was it a clean install?
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>August 2 - Mid-Morning Update</strong></p>
<p>I bit the bullet and performed a clean install of W10. &nbsp;Booted from DVD, formatted OS SSD and when prompted for Install Key, skipped. &nbsp;After the install it prompted me for my MS account and upon logging in, auto activated W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of 9:31 MST, no network failures after 90 minutes and apps are being downloaded/reinstalled as they should. &nbsp;I was averaging 10 minutes or so between network failures before, so hopefully the clean install has solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>August 3 - Morning Update</strong></p>
<p>After my previous post, I had one incident yesterday morning where the internet lost connection. I rebooted, downloaded the most recent drivers (2011) for my pair of Broadcom Netlink Gigabit NIC's and manually installed the driver from the INF file. &nbsp;W10
 did not like this and resulted in the spinning disk noted above. &nbsp;I gave it a couple of minutes, did a hard reset, and the PC has performed beautifully since. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. &nbsp;It wasn't my ideal course of action, but the clean install resulted in a zippy OS and nice refresh on a six-year-old PC. &nbsp;So far I'm liking W10 and haven't seen any noticeable compatibility issues other than the Broadcom drivers. &nbsp;Fingers
 crossed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference my machine specs are as follows: Dell XPS 730X, i7 965 3.2 GHz, 12GB DIMM, 512GB Crucial SSD OS Drive, (1) 600 GB Raptor App Drive, (3) 300 GB Raptor Data Drives (RAID 0), (1) 128 GB SSD Scratch, AMD 6990 4GB Video.</p>

            <p>I experienced the exact same problem with my Dell Studio XPS 8100. I had upgraded from Windows 7 Premium to Windows 10 Home. Everything seemed to be fine for a while. That evening (Wednesday), I was in a virtual class/college meeting via Adobe Connect. I
 had to upload my presentation, and the moment I tried, my internet connection was lost. It showed the yellow arrow, indicating limited connectivity. I checked my wired Ethernet connection (Broadcomm), trying to disable and enable it. Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I went to do a restart and it took forever. I got a blue screen saying something about a DEVICE DRIVER POWER FAILURE. I rebooted, and the internet was fine (for a little bit), and later tried to stream a show online. Same problem happened again. I did
 some research online and the some suggested steps were far too involved for me to be interested in.&nbsp; I tried a clean install of Windows 10, but I experienced the same problems.&nbsp;So, I went back to Windows 7 and no problems since. As I wanted to still play around
 with, in hopes of it eventually being fixed, I partitioned my hard drive and installed Windows 10 on the second partition. In fact, I am using it at this moment.&nbsp;I would like to get rid of Windows 7, but I cannot afford to have these problems, as I am sure
 no one else can. I use my computer for work and school. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From my research, I do believe the issue may be driver related, however,&nbsp;it is unclear as to which driver could be incompatible. On one site, it was recommended to reinstall drivers using compatibility mode. Well, that's nice, if you know what driver to
 reinstall, and it there is an executable file for the driver that you can right click on and select compatibility mode with. In my opinion, this "upgrade" should have been set to install all drivers automatically in compatibility mode with the version that
 it was being upgraded from. Would that be to obvious? </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's good that the upgrade is/was free, as I would be filing some major complaints and demanding a refund! With all the time I spent/wasted, I am still inclined to send Microsoft a bill for my time!

            <p>I am having this exact problem on 2 Dell Studio XPS 8100 systems. Every half hour or so my internet drops and I have to use the troubleshooter to fix it. &nbsp;Sometimes it happens via specific websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't able to find which Broadcom Enternet driver I needed so I could try and reinstall. If I can't fix this I'll have to go back to Win 7 as this never happened with that OS.</p>

            <p>Okay, so as mentioned. I now have Windows 10 on a separate hard drive partition, so I could play around with it, while maintaining Windows 7 on my other partition (as I know it'll work).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In using Win 10 yesterday for a few hours, I was waiting for the dropped internet connection. It finally happened, again. From what I could tell from my research, it seemed to be a conflict with the Broadcomm Ethernet driver (in my Dell Studio XPS 8100.
 Again, it caused no problems in Windows 7, but Windows 10 didn't seem to like it. I checked the version in Device Manager and it seemed old, but no previous attempts to update were displayed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that my specific Broadcomm Ethernet Adapter is model BCM57780 (from dell documentation). I went to Broadcomms website, found a newer driver and downloaded it (not an executable). http://www.broadcom.com/support/?gid=12</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, while my internet in Win 10 was again working (temporarily), I disabled the connection, and went to device manager and uninstalled the old driver. Then, I installed the new one from the downloaded file location. Since then, I've had no further disconnections
 of the internet, but still need to give it some time and see if it occurs again. This measure is only taken until Microsoft comes out with a patch.

<h2>            Gamertag changed automatically</h2>
                    Last week I was checking the availability of other gamer tags and for some reason it did not ask to charge my card as it usually does and it changed my gamer tag automatically from Sinuate to PhiLLeY and I am upset because I was not intending in changing
 this tag.

            The people in the forums are gamers just like you not engineers.&nbsp; Sounds like someone may have changed it for you.&nbsp; Does anyone have access to your account information?&nbsp; If so you may want to see if they may have changed it.

            No no one changed it for me. I was on my Xbox checking for availability of gamer tags and as I clicked yes the gamertag changed without charge and i was not intending of changing just checking for names since i was bored. I called Xbox support and they
 can see on their screen as well that my gamertag has changed but i was not charged for this.
