<h2>            Cannot Update to the latest build</h2>
                    <p>My system keeps re-starting and cannot seem to get the latest build. Win update is not listing anything. Frankly I'd like to just have a clean copy of Windows 10 without the Evaluation copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My build shows (lower right corer)</p>
<p><strong>Windows 10 Preview Evaluation Copy Build 14295.rs1_release 16318-1628</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What Up Doc?</p>

MSE is not supported on Windows Embedded, if that's the operating system for your POS system.</p>
<p>MSE can only be installed on XP (32 bit) or Vista/Windows 7 32 or 64 bit.</p>

            I talked with my Tech Support on Monday a.m. and found that MSE erased some files that RO Writer (my pos system) needed. He had me going in about 15 mins. Seems that anytime I have an issue it involves antivirus software...makes me wonder trying about
 other operating systems. Thanks for y'alls help.

<p>I have done the quick repair, the online repair and even uninstalled then reinstalled Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also did system recovery back a few weeks to when it was working and that did not fix the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw that some other people have created new profiles, but i don't know how to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I am using the outlook Web interface, which is good for the short term, but I need to get the Outlook 2016 app working again.</p>
<p>Please let me know what I should do next. Thanks.</p>

<p>hi jason,</p>
<p>firstly, you can refer to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>&nbsp;to create a new outlook profile. as a side note, when creating it, you can set the new profile as the default one in the drop-down window so that outlook will automatically open the new profile at next start.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0c5b853f-ae27-4037-ad68-34c495a3ca75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0c5b853f-ae27-4037-ad68-34c495a3ca75" /></a><br />
<br />
if this doesn’t help resolve the issue either, i’d like to further investigate the issue with the following information:<br />
1. if the account configured in the outlook client is an office 365 email account, please run an
<a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/#&amp;&amp;schasa6xeov6bdf0ynzcwljpy1t8meaca5nw3ow5uedd4598ey3sn4izj7impty8ps6vexlyrrcqkmfcosaanolsxzaqkt38q3a3slqskoi29gujn7xushuufusozof/huisg365k551oviyid9acycsb9f+vqi9b5e/trhil9b10sm/dv0v1l8omtkowsmospyera==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
outlook connectivity test</a>&nbsp;in remote connectivity analyzer and send us the test result. i have sent you a private message to request it.
<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations<br />
2. does the issue persist if you start outlook in safe mode? to do that, press the ‘windows + r’ key on the keyboard and type in ‘<strong>outlook /safe</strong>’, and hit ok in the run open box. note: there is a space between outlook and /.<br />
3. please run the /resetnavpane command to check if the issue can be resolved. press the ‘windows + r’ key on the keyboard and type in
<strong>outlook.exe /resetnavpane</strong>, and hit ok. note: there is also a space between “outlook.exe” and “/resetnavpane”.<br />
4. using the office 365 support and recovery assistant (sara) tool that can diagnose and fix many common outlook problems. please download the tool and run the support and recovery assistant on the affected computer to troubleshoot the issue.<br />
for your reference download link:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3073672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http:/support.microsoft.com/kb/3073672</a><br />
after running the tool, it may find some errors with the account or outlook client settings and give some suggestions. if it just gives some error messages without suggestions, please send the error message to us for further research.</p>
<p>any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
sam</p>

<h3> mandadisrikanth  say:</h3>
<h2>            confusion with enable&#47;disable Limited-access user permission lock down mode Feature is</h2>
                    
<p>on one of our sharepoint site (office365/sharepoint online), <b>limited-access user permission lockdown mode
</b>feature is enabled.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b80ea4f0-baaf-4028-add0-46fd9e691d4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b80ea4f0-baaf-4028-add0-46fd9e691d4a" /></a></p>
<p>because of this feature enabled, users are unable to share the folder with others, getting below error message.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68f26983-5b32-4ab3-b7ca-b211c35f49f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68f26983-5b32-4ab3-b7ca-b211c35f49f7" /></a></p>
<p>so, if we can disable/deactivate that feature they can share the folder.</p>
<p>from below post from <b>official office site</b> its saying even though you disable/deactivate that feature it won’t affect any other feature.</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/enable-or-disable-site-collection-features-a2f2a5c2-093d-4897-8b7f-37f86d83df04</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e175c2d6-1a7a-4319-8699-084d45563d31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e175c2d6-1a7a-4319-8699-084d45563d31" /></a></p>
<p>but again from the official microsoft site its saying when you deactivate this site collection feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;other features such as publishing <b>may require this feature to work correctly.</b></p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/kb/3039997</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a16bbe9d-ab56-47dd-8d64-c0f8db8e836e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a16bbe9d-ab56-47dd-8d64-c0f8db8e836e" /></a></p>
<p>which is giving confusion.</p>

<p>Hi Shree28,</p>
<p>The article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-or-disable-site-collection-features-a2f2a5c2-093d-4897-8b7f-37f86d83df04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-or-disable-site-collection-features-a2f2a5c2-093d-4897-8b7f-37f86d83df04</a> just mainly talk about how to activate/deactivate site collection features, it is not contradictory with the article
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/kb/3039997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/kb/3039997</a>.</p>
<p>As I said above, if you want to use the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature, you will lose the feature of sharing a folder.&nbsp; In other words, you can’t get the feature of sharing a folder and the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure
 feature at the same time because the Limited-access user permission lockdown mode feature is required for the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature. It is the default settings in SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>To the dilemma you encountered, I suggest you submit a feedback on our
<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273492-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UserVoice</a>. The engineers there will collect users’ feedbacks and consider if there can be some improvements in Microsoft products. It is generally the most direct and best way
 to achieve users’ requirements.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Cliff</p>

<h2>            How do I hyperlink specific text within the same document in publisher 2007&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to build a website using Publisher 2007 however I am having trouble using the hyperlinks to get to a specific paragraph within my documentation. I can link to other pages no problem but this site will contain an incredible amount of information
 and I need to set it up where people viewing can click on a specific word and go right to the relevant information. I have performed a little research and found many references to using "HTML code" but since I am unfamiliar with this process I am not sure
 how to use that.

            <p>This is fairly easy with Pub 2007. Just Insert &gt; bookmark and drag that icon to where you want the link to go. Then select the text &gt;insert hyperlink &gt; place in this document and choose the bookmark that you just created. The only time I have had problems
 is if the page is not long enough below the bookmark...and there are workarounds.</p>

<h2>            In Internet Explorer, red x&#39;s appear in box instead of image</h2>
                    This suddenly occurred several days ago - the red X appearing in box instead of the image on MANY websites.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have gone through all the suggestion on the Microsoft page including checking under internet options, advanced settings, to see if the "show
 pictures" box is checked, which it is - still no images.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know it's an Internet Explorer problem as Google Chrome works fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much.

<p>Was a software change made just before the problem began such as a new security program, updates to a security program, updates from Microsoft, etc?</p>
<p>- - - - -</p>
<p>First try clearing the cache (Temporary Internet Files)<br />
From Internet Options&gt; General &gt; Browsing History&gt; Delete (next screen) uncheck Preserve Favorites website data then check and delete Temporary Internet Files.</p>
<p>Next try resetting IE settings.<br />
With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as passwords and you will have to reinstall or re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset IE Settings button in Internet Options&gt; Advanced.<br />

            The problem is that if the workbooks are opened in separate instances of Excel then the workbook running the macro doesn't recognize the workbook you are trying to activate.
<div>If you run one instance of Excel and the open each of the workbooks from the File Open option then you can Activate the workbook but you do not need the file path</div>

Yes, the applications that you have purchased are associated to your account, not your device.&nbsp; Therefore you can reinstall applications from your account to your device after a hard reset.<br />

<h2>            Automatic replies to redirect emails</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi there,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have an issue with automatic replies on redirected emails. Details are following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- we are running on Office 2013, using Microsoft exchange OWA</span></p>
<p><span>- we use shared email address (say ABC) &nbsp;within 2 teams, with rule to redirect all received emails to all members of those 2 teams (note: we use redirect
 because we need to have original sender in "FROM" box to be able reply to original sender via VBA codes and also to make it comfortable even for manual answers by Reply button instead of looking for email adrress of sender),</span></p>
<p><span>- our external customer (XYZ) has informed us, that she obtained Out of office message from one of the team member -&gt; I personally didn't realized
 that OOO is send to original sender when the msg is redirect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are struggeling how to solve this problem, so far we tried:</span></p>
<p><span>- set Manage Rules &amp; Alerts instead of &nbsp;Automatic Replies &gt; this Rule only work when Outlook is turn-on, so it can not substitute the OOO. This kind
 of Rule is not possible to be set up in OWA.</span></p>
<p><span>- use Automatic Replies &gt; we have deactived sending automatic replies for external parties, and we have added the rule (when email is send to ABC
 do not process subsequent rules &gt; works for external parties perfectly, but this rule caused sending 2 emails for internal parties as sending OOO to internal parties is default).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need to set up Automatic Reply Rule which would do perform no action (not sending template reponse) for email from our domain (thousands of emails),
 however I&nbsp;did not find any solution on web...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Optimal solution means:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
<span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>automatic reply OOO inside my organization</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
<span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>automatic reply or template reply Outside my organization</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
<span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>no reply for emails obtain by redirect from ABC</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have any recommendation?

    <title>Pdf file gets file attribute AT in stead of A after printing to pdf - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ernst79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pdf file gets file attribute AT in stead of A after printing to pdf from Office</h2>
                    <p>After selecting "microsoft print to pdf" Excel creates a pdf file of my Excel workbook (or Word), as it should. For some strange reason, the pdf file gets the file attribute "AT", in stead of "A". Because it sets the file attribute to T, the file is assumed
 to be "temporary" and Cloud Station (synology) and other backup software won't sync the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it setting the file attribute to AT in stead of T and how can I change this behavior?</p>

            <p>Hi nasserenzy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's hard to tell what the problem might be as it could be a hundred things. The simplest solution is to follow this procedure which is ordered to address the easy or most likely problems first and then move on to the more time-consuming or less likely alternatives
 until a resolution is found (and by the end, that is virtually guaranteed one way or the other).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, make sure it isn't just a matter of not waiting long enough. Startup on some computers can take several minutes or even more, depending on what and how much is programmed to start and the power of the computer. I've noticed that mine can take a few
 minutes to finish and that MSE isn't among the first to begin. More than once, I've gotten a Security Center notice that I have no AV protection and within a few seconds it disappears and the MSE icons shows up. It has also happened that MSE has started red
 and in a few moments turned to green as different programs and files and services are activated (and there's really no way to control the order in which this occurs - it seems to vary every time I start the computer in a somewhat random way with a degree of
 predictability concerning while are likely to be among the first and which are likely to be among the last). If you immediately react and open MSE and start it manually, it will seem like what you did was needed and fixed the "problem" with automatic start
 when a bit of patience may have been all that was required. I hope it's this (since it means there is no problem), but if not, then continue reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.<span>
</span></span><span>This means not only current ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. If you think it possible but can't remember, try Belarc Advisor:<a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</a>
 and/or Secunia PSI<a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/</a> to find them (and BTW, both of these are good tools to have on yours system anyway as they can often come
 in handy or help with maintenance and security). Or run the removal tools for every one that even vaguely rings a bell as it can't hurt and may help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that Windows Defender is uninstalled (if XP), or Disabled (if Vista/W7).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are using version 2.0.657.0 or 2.1.1116.0 of MSE.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>. If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to
 reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a> - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the
 desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you
 shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Avian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no special PowerShell cmdlet for sharing option of OneDrive.</p>
<p>However, you can try the following cmdlet to manage the sharing option of SharePoint<span>，</span>and the cmdlet is related to share with external users.</p>
<p>1. Connect to Office 365 by PowerShell.</p>
<p>2. Enable External Sharing: <strong>Set-SPOTenant -ExternalServicesEnabled $true</strong></p>

    <title>Password not accepted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wendyc1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password not accepted</h2>
                    <p>My husband has a Microsoft Lumia phone. Whenever he tried to use his WhatsApp, it popped up a message stating that his WhatsApp has expired and to please visit the Play Store to update. (Note: this was not a text message, but showed up as he tried to use
 the WhatsApp.)<br />
<br />
I tried SEVERAL times to update the app. I followed the directions to type in the password and hit the save button, only for the next screen to be the SAME "Enter your password" page.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried to soft reboot the phone by pressing the power and volume down button. Still cannot get past the password page when updating WhatsApp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to change his password. He received messages stating that the password was successfully updated. I tried to log in using the new password, and it keeps going back to the same "Enter Password" page!! GGRR!! &nbsp; I've reset the password TWICE thinking
 that maybe I just mistyped it the first time. But NOTHING IS WORKING!!<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP US AS HE REALLY NEEDS THIS FEATURE FOR WORK!!&nbsp; THANK YOU!!</p>

<br />
...and tried to do some of the steps. The date and time were already correct, as well as the wifi connection, but I decided to update them anyway.&nbsp;<br />

I went back to install the WhatsApp update and this time, IT ACCEPTED OUR PASSWORD!! Yeah! &nbsp;<br />

I really wish I knew what it was that held things up, as I'd love for it to help others.<br />

    <title>E51&#58; cannot install Profimail after FW update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> feklee  say:</h3>
<h2>            E51&#58; cannot install Profimail after FW update</h2>
                    Yesterday, I installed the new firmware on my E51, and lost many settings and my calendar when the backup was restored - that may sometimes happen, according to Nokia. OK, I swallowed that. Now, I started reinstalling the software that I need every day,
 most importantly ProfiMail, but installing doesn't work anymore. I always get:<br />
<br />
"Certificate may not be valid, is expired or phone's date setting may be incorrect."<br />
<br />
What could be the reason for the error message? How do I get rid of it? How do I install ProfiMail?<br />
<br />
Of course, I already followed the instructions on the ProfilMail web site, but to no avail:<br />
<br />

<br />
Then, I also called Nokia support, but they didn't have a clue what to do.

    <title>MS Security Essentials&#58; VPN compatibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim.low  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Security Essentials&#58; VPN compatibility</h2>
                    <p>I have found the following situation arises after the most recent update from MS Security Essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Use VPN service.</li><li>Attempt to launch VPN client.</li><li>VPN Client hangs up, or required &gt; 5m30s to actually launch or fails altogether.</li><li>No other issue found.</li><li>VPN Client and MS Security Essentials co-habitated w/o issue prior to most recent software update.</li><li>No other applications appeared to be affected.</li></ol>
<p>During several hours of testing various things, it was found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off MS Security Essentials and VPN client works w/o issue.</li><li>Apply Exclusionary processes/applications to MS Security Essentials. Those items added are specific to the VPN client.</li><li>Restart system.</li><li>MS Security Essentials and VPN client works w/o issue as of this time.</li></ul>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Security remains a viable and robust product to protest system.</li><li>Specific components within MS Security Essentials that were tweaked/updated in the last release have affected execution of the needed interrupts that are applied to intercept TCP/IP (IPv4 or IPv6) communications on the Desktop/Laptop side of the connection.</li></ul>
<p>Expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft shall identify the offending updates, apply a correction, and deploy when available.</li></ul>
<p>I hope this helps others. I still think of MS Security Essentials as viable because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It keeps up with on-going maintenance to Windows 7 OS (e.g. KBs.)</li><li>It integrates well with the OS due to the relationship with the OS author.</li><li>It is a clean interface, with a robust virus pattern update cycle.</li><li>It integrates the MS firewall product, malware and anti-virus products into a clean and easy to use product.</li></ul>

            <p>I wouldn't hold my breath, unless both Microsoft and the developer of the VPN client are made aware of the potential conflict and cooperate in order to resolve the issue, it's likely to remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When new major&nbsp;versions of the MSE Client were released in the past, often during beta, they might sometimes break the operation of various older VPN client releases.&nbsp; In some cases these VPN clients were themselves quite old, since in cases like Cisco the
 customer may only receive updates if they pay maintenance for the VPN device, which many customers don't due to cost or simply apathy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd recommend first looking into whether there is a newer version of the VPN client available and try that if so.&nbsp; If not, or if you choose not to pay for the new VPN software if available, then I wouldn't expect a solution from Microsoft for an older client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the newest VPN client still doesn't work, then reporting that to the VPN vendor is the best path, since they should have a more direct path to Microsoft to find a resolution.&nbsp; Attempting to get this fixed as an individual customer of Microsoft is problematic,
 since there's no longer a direct support channel for MSE other than these forums and escalations here, though theoretically possible, are far less dependable than they used to be a few years back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just the suggestion of another long time customer and occasional helper who's been observing here since the original MSE&nbsp; and OneCare beta releases.&nbsp; I also dealt with this same type of issue with a Cisco client several years ago and resolved it
 myself by acquiring a newer Cisco VPN client.&nbsp; Several others had reported similar issues at the time with older VPN client versions from various vendors, though that was again a major new MSE version release.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Rob, you are right on point with your observations!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your recommendation is a consideration of which I'd moved forward with. In fact, in my less than expert knowledge and troubleshooting skills, I never even thought of MSE as being the root cause. After contacting the VPN Service Provider, they were the ones
 which suggested that I pull the plug on MSE by having their client software/processes ignored by MSE. Once that was done, all was right...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, with me choosing to maintain my system through auto-updates, or at least auto-notifications of update availability, my OS and all of my software are at current levels. The down side of course, was the date of which the MSE update was pushed. I could
 not effectively correlate the MSE update with the point in time the failures began - well, except by inference. It actually appeared to be a cumulative effect, rather than a install-update-crash-client. The date of the client noticeable impact was post-install,
 and the closest I could narrow it down was sometime from 8/1 to present (thought this is not certain.) I just don't know the precise dates of the release updates for MSE (not the virus pattern database(s).)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, at this point, with the client processes/programs excluded from MSE examination, things appear to be working now; though only time is the true test. Had I known there were issues in the past with MSE and VPN clients, I would have made more diligent
 troubleshooting decisions prior to contacting the VPN Service Provider. That was my bad; for not doing sufficient research... :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again, Sir! I must also share your observation "<em>...forums and escalations here, though theoretically possible, are far less dependable than they used to be a few years back.</em>" I've also been a long time Customer/Consumer of MS products
 (&gt;20 years) and [sadly] find that the deterioration within many different channels of assistance from MS appears to be endemic and on-going.</p>

    <title>Windows Defender uninstalled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alaineos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender uninstalled</h2>
                    <p>My story.</p>
<p>Soon after the Anniversary Update of Windows 10, I began to suspect intrusion on my system. I noticed extreme interruptions and odd jumps of my cursor while I was on Wordpress, editing my blog. Then the system began freezing, forcing hard shutdowns. Next
 I began to receive constant demands by a pop-up box, for my administrator password. I couldn't close this box. It kept popping up. More freezes. More hard shut downs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I scanned with Webroot. Webroot detected 7 files, all Currentcontrolset files, part of Windows 10, all identified as threats. At first one scan solved the problem, and I attempted to continue working with other websites. But then it began to require
 3 scans to stop the interruptions, freezes and demands for an administrator password. This happened over several days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I became convinced that there was a rootkit that my Webroot security could detect and block, but couldn't eliminate. I made an appointment for an online session with Microsoft. That took several hours, and the tech said everything was fine. Then
 I went to Webroot, to ask them to uninstall Webroot and reinstall it with all updates and eliminate extraneous files. They did this. That was another online session lasting several hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all that, I ran a Webroot scan. Guess what? Same seven Windows 10 files identified as a rootkit threat. And they show up in scan after scan after scan. So I did a full system scan with Windows Defender. That took 6 hours, and turned up two threats:</p>
<p>
</p><p>exploit java: Anogre.E</p>
<p>exploit java: Obfuscator.w</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if these are the javascripts used by hackers on Wordpress or not. But Windows defender found them and removed them. Then I ran another Webroot scan. Yep. Same seven Windows 10 files identified as a threats came up again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was this morning at 9am.&nbsp; When I turned on my computer, I got the same seven files identified as a rootkit threat. All Currentcontrolset files. So I tried to run another Windows Defender scan. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Windows Defender
 can't be turned on now, because it doesn't exist!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I came to this forum. I looked up this helpful message:</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So I did all of&nbsp; that. Windows Defender, the system tells me, is uninstalled. Now, how did that happen? I used it yesterday to find two javascript beasties! Now it doesn't exist.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am going back to my original assessment: Windows 10 has a vulnerability to hacking that is similar to a rootkit strategy that was used against Windows 7 last year, just before Windows 10 was rolled out. After the rollout, this
 particular rootkit attack began to die out. Apparently Windows 10 fixed that vulnerability. Apparently, during the Anniversary Update, the vulnerability has returned.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft has ignored this problem, pretending it doesn't exist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Does anyone know what I'm talking about? If there is a vulnerability in the operating system that can be exploited with a javascript, that is a more serious problem than a mere rootkit attack. It means the security problem is
 hardwired into the operating system. I hope someone sees this who understands the importance of this threat.</span></p>
<p>This could potentially cripple infrastructure. Can someone reply?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not answered until now because the PC I was using, Sony VAIO, is no longer running. I have an interest in fixing it, but first I had to get a new computer and reboot my whole life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I say the Sony is no longer running, that is only because I am not running it. The machine still works just fine, but it won't unless I fix this problem. I fully intend to fix my PC and return it to service. But I need your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not purchase my Sony VAIO at a Best Buy, but I did buy a service contract there, and I still have it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to your question is : YES. I was able to run a full Windows Defender Scan with Webroot installed. There is a setting you can switch for that purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your other questions: Yes it is the same machine as the one referenced in previous questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern is really this: My machine was really excellent at fending off attacks until the Anniversary Update, and the type of attack that I faced is similar to attacks that exploited a vulnerability in Windows 7. In 2015, according to my research, that
 vulnerability was fixed with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Anniversary Update of Windows 10 seems to have somehow re-opened that vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my concern is two-fold, really. I want my machine back and I want Microsoft to fix this vulnerability. If it has already been addressed since August 2016, when I was wrestling with it, then I'd like to know that someone at Microsoft has noticed the
 problem, since my session with a Microsoft tech DID NOT fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the reply.</p>

<h2>            Calendar issue&#58; My Phone only backs up some but not all of my daily appointments</h2>
                    
<p>My brand new LG Fathom phone died and a replacement is on the way. The Verizon store said I should back up all my information using "My Phone" which can then be easily transfered to my new phone. So I did did a My Phone backup as they suggested.</p>
<p>After using My phone to backup calendar and contacts I reviewed the backup on line and noticed only a few of my very many non-recurring appointments appeared. Also, I couldn't find many of my very many recurring appointments. What am I doing wrong or, is
 this the best that My phone can do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also have the ability to use Microsoft's Windows Mobile Device Center to do backups. What's the difference between My phone and Microsoft's Windows Mobile Device Center and which backup offering should I have complete confidence in?</p>
<p>Thank you for your promt attention into this issue because my replacement phone will be here tomorrow and I I need to transfer ALL my information to the new phone. If the infomationwasn't important to me it wouldn't be on my phone.</p>

<p>My Phone "backs up" your data to the web; WMDC "backs up" your data to your computer.&nbsp; If you use WMDC, you must have Outlook installed on your computer if you want to syncronize your Contacts, Appointments, and Tasks to your computer.</p>
You've already found some issues with the "back-up" you made with My Phone.&nbsp; If it were me, I would use WMDC to sync this data to my computer.
<p>My Phone should have backed up all your contacts, appointments, tasks (assuming you selected those items) to your My Phone web page.&nbsp; Recurring appointments would only show up once on the web page (even though when you sync them back to your phone, they
 should show up multiple times).</p>

                    I cannot open Excel getting the following message. Not enough memory to run Microsoft Office Excel. Please close other applications and try again. This also occurs if I try and open an excel document that is sent as an&nbsp;attachment&nbsp;via outlook. &nbsp;However
 if the excel file is saved to my desktop I can open this. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So far I have tried:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cleared outlook temp&nbsp;folder, &nbsp;Outlook security could be blocking this, put an exception in for xls files. (Still didnt work)</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I adjusted the registry to include a key to exclude '.xls' files from security to allow the file to be opened. After restarting the system I found that this did not work. Run a repair on Office 2010 which also did not fix issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tried to create a new user profile but still did not work and also tried a different user.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Tried&nbsp;re installing&nbsp;office but still no success.</div>
