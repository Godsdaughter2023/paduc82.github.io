</p><p>If that didn't resolve the issue, try downloading and installing the latest driver software from your

            <p><strong>Will I have the option of choosing a different drive or partition where I want the upgrade installed?</strong></p>
<p>No, it will require that you are running a previous qualifying version and start the upgrade from within the qualifying version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading to Windows 10 affect other drives or partitions or files in those partitions&nbsp;in my computer?</strong></p>
<p>No, only the drive where the upgrade is initiated from will be affected. You can always disconnect non-system drives as a precaution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I want to dual boot instead of replace my current version of Windows.</strong></p>
<p>If you need to install Windows 10 on a separate hard disk or partition, you will need to purchase a full license.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To make a bootable disk from an ISO or other bootable file, right click to Burn Disk Image using Windows Image Burner.  
<br />
<br />If you're creating Windows bootable media, use Media Creation Tool installed from this link which will prompt to burn the disk if you save the ISO:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<p><span>Hi Mr Bobb 2u,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Run SFC (</strong></span><strong><span>system file checker)</span></strong><strong><span>
 scan</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The system file checker (SFC) utility allows administrators to perform a scan of all protected resources to verify that they are the correct version.
 If SFC should find any incorrect versions in any of these protected resources, SFC will replace them with the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>You can always run a SFC scan on the windows vista computer. To run a SFC scan follow the steps below:
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on start and in the start search bar type cmd, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area and then click on run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press enter. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><strong><span>Disable the security software and then try to install the update manually, follow the steps mentioned below</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Enable
 the security software back once everything is done.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you may post your query on office forums that &nbsp;focuses on Office related issues.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 activation key not found</h2>
                    <p>Hi, thanks for reading this!</p>
<p>I'm running Win 7 on a desktop I purchased from Dell in 2009.</p>
<p>My system crashed. It's been running smoothly since.</p>
<p>However, Win says it cannot find my registration key, and claims I'm running a counterfeit copy.</p>
<p>Which is not the case.</p>
<p>However, I cannot find the original installation cd with the registration key,</p>
<p>and Dell can't help me.</p>
<p>I registered my system back in 2009.</p>
<p>Is there any way Microsoft can provide me with the key?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p />

<h2>            XBOX Live Not Connecting I have Tried EVERYTHING&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I am having some serious issues with my xbox live account. I have been researching and messing around with settings for the past day and I still cannot connect when I am directly connected from my router to my xbox! However, if I bridge my connection via
 my laptop I can connect just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>I cannot connect to xbox live wired from the router to the xbox 360.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the factory settings on default I get an IP address error. &nbsp;Here is the code:</p>
<p>W: 0000 - 000B</p>
<p>X: 4000 - 1001</p>
<p>Y: 0000 - 0000<span> </span></p>
<p><span>Z</span>:&nbsp;0000 - 0000</p>
<p>ID: 0001 -0007</p>
<p>L: 8015 -1004</p>
<p>Q: 8015 -1004</p>
<p>T: Wired</p>
<p>A: 169.254.13.186/255.255.0.0</p>
<p>G and D are all 0s</p>
<p>I researched setting up a static IP and tried it. About half the time I would get passed the network test and then it would fail on the internet with DNS error. Then the next time I ran it with NO CHANGES done it would go back to giving me an IP error. It
 was just totally random if it decided to pass or not. I setup a static ip of 129.168.1.12 and my DNS server was 192.168.1.1. Still no luck. I even tried google DNS servers and nothing. Here is the error code I was receiving with the static IP</p>
<p>W: 0000 - 000B</p>
<p>X: 8000 - 100D</p>
<p>Y: 0000 - 0000</p>
<p><span>Z</span>:&nbsp;0000 - 0000</p>
<p>ID: 0001 -0007</p>
<p>L: 8015 -1004</p>
<p>Q: 8015 -1004</p>
<p>T: Wired</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;192.168.1.103/255.255.0.0</p>
<p>G: 192.168.1.1</p>
<p>D: 192.168.1.1/0.0.0.0</p>

<p>I then tried to set all the settings exactly like my laptop settings through ipconfig /all with no luck. I have tried using my laptop MAC address with no luck at all.</p>

<p>Here is the craziest thing though. If I connect my laptop to the wireless connection of the router and then Bridge from my laptop to my xbox wired it WORKS on factory default settings!!!!! The reason I want it directly wired from router to xbox however is
 I am getting extremely slow speeds bridged through my wireless connection. So can anyone help me out here I have been trying FOREVER to get this thing to work! Thanks!!</p>

<p>Okay here is an update on another thing I tried. I disconnected the router and went straight to the modem. The modem is a modem/router (dont ask me why I use another router still, I just do) and I tried testing it doing everything exactly the same as above.
 Still nothing. Here is my error code with having a static ip the same DNS and MAC address as my computer when i did ipconfig /all</p>

<p>Alright one last update. I managed to finally get past the network connection. I did this by using my router. I have the DDWRT firmware on it and I enabled DMZ under the &nbsp;NAT/QoS settings to the static IP i manually set on the xbox! However, I am getting
 a DNS error now with my xbox here is the error code</p>

<p>I am not expecting anyone to answer right away, but I have been brainstorming. Could this be Comcast or my modem/router? I just replaced the modem a few days ago and this is what started all the problems. I was able to connect fine with the old modem. The
 new modem is a Zoom 5352 and I tried googing to see if anyone else is having problems with this and came up empty.</p>
<p>I also read some places that this could be comcasts fault? Maybe they did not activate the modem correctly or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Any ideas are appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update keeps popping up and system slow.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 &amp; issues/questions</p>
<p>1) What can I do to close the windows update window that keeps popping up in the middle of programs asking me to schedule my windows 10 update (NO it seems impervious to "end task " in task manager and certainly won't close when you "x" off the pop up</p>
<p>2) More importantly what ram should I have installed (same problem on 2 machines 1 machine is 32 bit older core duo 1.5 {the one I had posted about earlier where the techs were having such a difficult time helping me turn on windows defender and the other
 machine is an i3 2.3 64 bit) to get windows 10 to operate at any speed faster than "tortoise"...Is there a way to shut the windows in the start/app &nbsp;menu that show what files are on my machine. Seriously the speed on my machines seems to have dropped off precipitously
 from when I was running windows 7&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANY advice would be appreciated. It seems silly to go back to windows 7 but the machines I have changed over already are unsatisfactory since the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and consideration </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to revert to Windows 10 Home from refunded Windows 10 Pro upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Good day everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a laptop, came with Windows 10 Home, upgraded to Windows 10 Pro Digital Entitlement (for RM519.99 Malaysian Ringgit), but had the purchase refunded because the sales email got my billing address wrong. But after the refund, my laptop ended up with
 Windows 10 Pro, and I can't buy Windows 10 Pro digital entitlement anymore. Buying Windows 10 Pro product key solves the problem, but it will cost double (RM1099) and I will have trouble justifying it to my company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) how can I downgrade to the original Windows 10 Home? I tried factory reset using Settings &gt; Update and Security &gt; Recovery &gt; Reset PC, but it still ended up having Windows 10 Pro, and I can't activate it (which is understandable)<br />
</p>
<p>2) Microsoft had this media creation tool, can I use it to clean install a copy of Windows 10 Home? But if I do so, will the Windows 10 Home be able to be activated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.<br />
</p>
<p>(//back story starts here... skip if you do not wish to read my torment)</p>
<p>Recently I had a few new Acer laptops that come with Windows 10 Home preloaded. So I purchased&nbsp;a Windows 10 Pro Digital Entitlement, only to discover that in the email, my billing address was&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the laptop is company property and I had to have the bills correctly printing our company's billing address, I asked Microsoft support how to go about it. Turns out they said they'll just refund me the $$ I paid and asked me to buy again.<br />
<br />
Since I haven't initiate the upgrade,&nbsp;I think it's fair enough. So after changing the billing address in my Microsoft account billing address field. Unfortunately, this time, the billing address is still wrong (same as the old one), and what was worse, was
 that I initiated and completed the upgrade before I check the email (my fault, thinking the address issue is surely fixed).<br />
<br />
I chatted with Microsoft again, and they proposed a same solution: Refund + repurchase. This time, things got complicated and I can't buy the Win 10 Pro anymore as the laptop is already upgraded with Win 10 Pro!<br />
<br />
Again, my carelessness led me to try out the other two laptops (which also needed to upgrade to Win 10 Pro). I edited the billing address in my Microsoft&nbsp;payment option (which surprisingly is not the same as my Microsoft account billing address), and I thought
 it solves the problem, so I went on to purchase the Pro update Digital Entitlement, upgraded the laptop, but was shocked as the email still showed the old address!<br />
<br />
And again Microsoft advised a refund-and-repurchase solution, so this is the 3rd time my purchase got refunded, and my second laptop ended up in limbo--Win 10 Pro upgraded, with Digital Entitlement refunded.<br />
<br />
Foolishly, I tried the third laptop, now editing the billing address during the purchase, where I was asked to choose a payment option. Again I changed the address (which is already the new one), and did the upgrade (foolish move!), so this third laptop ended
 up, too, in the limbo.<br />
</p>
<p>Furious, I asked in chat and finally someone said that my account has 2 addresses (huh?) and the primary one was the old one. I was confused as I can't see a "second" address in my Microsoft Account, anyway they said the "changed" it for me so next time
 there won't be problem with the billing addresses. I was glad, but it was too late to continue working for the day.<br />
<br />
So at the end of the first day (yes, it did not resolve, not until this question is posted), I ended up with 4 Win 10 Pro Digital Entitlement purchases, 4 refunds, and three laptops in Win 10 Pro limbo...<br />
<br />
The second day, after much deliberation with Microsoft support, one of them eventually proposed that I buy three product keys, which is actually fine, but not until I discovered that the product keys cost DOUBLE the price! The only good news was that the billing
 email finally showed a correct company address, but I can't justify a 100% increment in cost for the Win 10 Pro upgrades so I had these three keys refunded (again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So finally a Microsoft Malaysian support girl suggested that I do a factory reset to my laptop so it can be reverted to Windows 10 Home. I tried, and to my horror, the ghostly Windows 10 Pro still existed after two factory resets (one with quick format and
 another with thorough wipe), and of course, the Windows activation can't get through. I tried to buy a Pro licence and now in Windows Store it shows RM1099 (instead of RM519.99 for a Digital Entitlement), so that is not an option.<br />
<br />
So here I am, the 3rd day, 3 laptops with ghostly Windows 10 Pro... and imagine it all started with a meager request to change a billing address...</p>

    <title>Folder Permission problems after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Folder Permission problems after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Ever since I Upgraded to Windows 10 pro, my file folders (documents Music etc) are all write protected as well as the folders content. I am the administrator on the system and logged in as such. I have tried to select the folder properties and uncheck the
 read only box but the files remain read only! I have several important excel workbooks that I access daily and the only way I can edit them right now is to move them out of the document folder and leave them on the desktop!
</p>
<p>How can I restore write permissions within these folders and the contents?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Edited 8/22 to clarify a few things.&nbsp; Also, after following these steps the problem has not resurfaced for me since 8/8&nbsp;(knock on wood).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had this problem as well after "upgrading."&nbsp; Appears to be related to OneDrive as mentioned by figment above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution that appears to be working (at the moment);</p>
<ol>
<li>Exit the OneDrive App completely (this means make sure it is not still running in the tray...if you have your tray icons hidden, you may not know it is still running.&nbsp; If OneDrive is running, it will keep changing the permissions back.&nbsp; You can also directly
 kill the process from Task Manager)</li><li>Delete the OneDrive folder created by the app in your home folder</li><li>Go into Task Manager (as admin) and disable OneDrive at startup</li><li>Take ownership of your home folder (\Users\<em>myhomefolder) </em>using method #1 described above.&nbsp; You have to babysit this process as there will be some denial of access issues.&nbsp; Just click the option that lets the ownership operation continue running.</li><li>Reboot</li><li><em>DO NOT</em> restart the OneDrive app because it will cause this issue to resurface and you will have to go through all of these steps again in order to fix it.&nbsp; If you must use OneDrive, use the browser interface to manipulate the files there.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>This is a problem that reasonably should have been foreseen.&nbsp; There is no excuse for this issue to exist.&nbsp; To paraphrase an old beer commercial - "Old Micro$#!+ tastes as great as its name".....</p>

            Method 2 has helped somewhat.&nbsp; I can now save to the Documents folder, but not to its subfolders.&nbsp; I have to save first to the Documents folder, then move the file to the subfolder.&nbsp; I would like to be able to save directly to the subfolder, as I have
 done in every previous version of Windows.<br />

I thought I'd solved the problem yesterday, but when I rebooted today the permissions had reset to read only.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that Microsoft need to admit there is a problem and fix it.&nbsp; A patch please!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Are you able to boot into the Desktop of the XP operating system?</p>
<p>If yes, then you must unregister and then reregister the Browseui.dll file. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Run</b>, type cmd, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the command prompt, switch to the following folder:</p>
<p><b>%Windir%\System32</b></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>regsvr32 browseui.dll /u</b>, and then press
<b>ENTER key</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>regsvr32 browseui.dll</b> and then press
<b>ENTER key</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type<b> exit</b> and then press
<b>ENTER key</b> to close the Command Prompt window.</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer.</p>
<p>If you’re unable to boot the XP Computer to Desktop, you need XP operating system disc to fix this issue.
</p>
<p>Refer to the following article regarding this issue:</p>

            It depends on what the rest of the message is so we will know what component is missing.<br />
<br />
Here is a popular example:<br />
<br />
Explorer.EXE - Unable To Locate Component : This application has failed to start because BROWSEUI.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
We need to know exactly what the message says.<br />
<br />
You do not necessarily have to have "an XP operating system disk" to resolve this problem.<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />

<h3> jwasms  say:</h3>
<h2>            After upgrade dark &#40;not black&#41; screen on start up when &#34;plugged in&#34; only, on battery no issue</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This is about a&nbsp;HP 15-r011dx Notebook PC (ENERGY STAR), product # G9D66UA#ABA. Not sure if this is a software,&nbsp;display,&nbsp;or power issue but the display is the most obvious issue. The
 machine originally had Win 8.1 OS (without this issue)&nbsp;and I recently upgraded to Win 10. The upgrade seemed to go fine (no problems at the time) and I shut down the machine when finished. However, the next day with the unit "plugged in" I pressed the power
 button for start up - saw the usual blank blue-gray start up page...then the HP logo with progress wheel but after four or five seconds the screen went very dark (not black). I could still barely make out the clock display (like it was&nbsp;covered by a very dark
 screen filter)&nbsp;from the opened (start?)&nbsp;page (the one before the sign-in page). After trying "things" as a solution, I discovered that if I unplugged the power and went to battery the screen reverted to a&nbsp;normal display. I finished logging in and plugged the
 power cord back in and the screen immediately went dark again...unplugged the power adapter again and everything went back to normal on battery. I eventually figured out&nbsp;that if I started up on battery and then put the machine in sleep mode I could plug in
 the power cord, wake it back up, and everything is fine/normal and stays that way&nbsp;(including recharging the battery). I called HP Support techs&nbsp;(HP Carepack plan) and relayed all this to them. The techs worked on the machine remotely - did things like reset
 BIOS - changed settings etc - but with no solution. Eventually, they said they had done all they knew how&nbsp;to do - had never come across a situation like this. I put this issue on the HP&nbsp;Support&nbsp;Forum but no luck so I thought I'd try Microsoft. I have also
 discovered that I can do a "restart" while the unit is plugged in without any issues.&nbsp;This
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span> happens on "start up" using the power button after&nbsp;having used&nbsp;the "shut down" command. I have also already updated the Intel chip-set, graphics driver (both for win10), and verified that the power option
 is set for "balanced."&nbsp;Additionally, I was contacted by someone else on the HP forum who had the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">exact</span> same issue on almost the exact same model notebook. If anybody from the Microsoft Community has any suggestions I'd love to hear them. If anybody from Microsoft Inc. happens to see this please note that this
 is an issue and should be looked into.</span>

            <p>Kalpana:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did reply once to let you know that the BIOS had already been reset by HP Tech Support, but I also ran through your other suggestions on general principles. These are the results: I ran the Power Troubleshooter and the results came back with "no issues:"
 I ran the Safe Mode and there were no problems - however, the process called for a "restart"&nbsp;(but remember that in my original post I mentioned that&nbsp;I don't have any problems with the machine using&nbsp;either restart or the sleep mode). My issue only happens when
 the "shut down" command is used and then restarted with the power button. So in safe mode with restart no problems - then with shutdown and power button restart the issue still persisted. When I&nbsp;ran the Run Check Disk procedure all of the prompts and windows
 were exactly as you described in your instructions -- but, since I'm unfamiliar with this style of procedure I wasn't sure what response to look for. So, when I did the "<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Y</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> to schedule
 a task and restart the computer to perform chkdsk" and restarted the notebook I didn't see anything like any notices that; "computer is performing a chkdsk, please wait"...is that normal, or does the computer just do it in the background and keeps it&nbsp;hidden&nbsp;on
 startup?&nbsp;Bottom line is, as far as I can tell I ran all of your suggestions (successfully?), there weren't any issues identified,
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">but,</span></strong> nothing "issue wise" has changed. Again, this&nbsp;issue
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span> happens when the "shut down" command is used and then restarted with the power button. Other than this one thing, the machine works just fine...the only thing that really makes this an issue is: "what
 happens if I ever lose the ability to start up on battery before I can switch back to "Plugged in."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also mentioned that this may be an issue related to other installed software. This is a fairly new machine to me so I don't have much in the way of additional software installed (mostly AOL and Firefox). The only other software was preinstalled on the
 machine and I don't use any of the junk, (social media, games, or cloud programs anyway) - I don't even think that most of them are active. One other point, is that I received a post on the HP forum&nbsp;site that&nbsp;someone else&nbsp;had the
<p>
</p><p>I know this response was a little long, but since you were nice enough to give me your suggestions, I wanted to make sure that my feedback was as thorough as possible. One last question though; you mentioned in your post "If the issue persists, do get back
 to us. We will be happy to assist you." My question is, who did you mean by "us" and "we" - did you mean the forum people or did you mean Microsoft support engineers - and if so, how do I contact them/you? Thank you for all your time and effort on this, but
 if you have any additional ideas/suggestions, please let me know.&nbsp;With sincere appreciation - jwasms&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Printing in colour from Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span>I am using a ZOOSTORM PC with Windows 10 and a HP Envy 5640 printer. Everything has been working fine until a couple of days ago.
</span></p>
<p><span>I selected a colour photo in Explorer and noticed the print preview was in Black and white and the print was the same. As a test I copied the photo into a PDF which is in colour, but printing the PDF gives
 a Black and White output. </span></p>
<p><span>The printer in Ok, full cartridges, printer alignment and self- test produce colour output.
</span></p>
<p><span>I have checked out Excel, Word, Visio and Powerpoint all show a coloured screen Preview and print in Black and White.
</span></p>
<p>As far as I am aware there have been no updates impacting my system, nor have I changed any settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the printer works fine when printing, it seems that we might be missing some settings that are related to Windows or the printer's software. Are you using Microsoft Print to PDF? If so, I suggest that you run the troubleshooter and check if it helps.
 Go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Devices </strong>&gt; <strong>Printer &amp; scanners</strong> &gt;
<strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong>, and then click on <strong>Manage </strong>
&gt; <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, check the printer's software for some settings that needs to modified. For further assistance, kindly contact the printer's manufacturer to have the issue checked out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated.</p>

            Hi Patricia, Thanks for your response. As I stated I can not get any coloured output. The only differences I can spot is that some software gives me a Black and White pre preview, whilst other give a coloured print preview. However they ALL print in Black
 and White.&nbsp;

<p>I found a helpful <strong><a href="https://support.hp.com/lt-en/document/bud09113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> from HP's support website on how to address the issue when your printer only prints in black and white. For further assistance,
 I think it is best to contact the printer manufacturer's to have the issue sorted out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Patricia, I have already been through checking my driver updates from HP, running their diagnostics routines etc. This HP script is primarily about the physical printer set-up and only offers
 the suggestion of downloading the drivers again. They were already up to date. My printing issue came to light late last week, and going systematically checking what may have caused the issue I have noted that on the 5</span><sup><span>th</span></sup></span><span>
 Jan my PC had a Windows update installed. <span>&nbsp;</span>I am beginning to suspect that the problem stems from this.

<p>I understand, Brian. Last January 3, <strong>KB4056892 </strong>(OS Build 16299.192) was released for download. For us to further isolate the issue and identify if the update really did cause the issue, I suggest that you restore your PC back to before the
 update was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel</strong>.</li><li>Search for <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Open System Restore</strong> &gt; <strong>
Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the updated, and then select <strong>Next
</strong>&gt; <strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please do update us on the outcome.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi, Looking at the update history I had successful updates on the 14</span><sup><span>th

<p>Whenever Windows installs updates, especially critical updates, it automatically creates a restore point for you to go back to. If no restore points were created then, it is most likely that system protection was turned off or disabled. If that is the case,
 we cannot restore your computer state back to before the January 5 update was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround for this, I suggest that you try each restore point available and observe if there will be any changes with the printing issue.</p>

<p><span>Following your suggestion I tried to uninstall the latest update. As part of this process the system tried to restart and failed with a ‘21a’ error and would not boot-up.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>So it was off to a computer repair shop to sort. They accessed the PC and removed a number of updates, checked everything and re-installed the updates. They
 also removed a couple of Malware items that managed to get passed my security system (EST). As they only had the pc all they could check was that all the print previews were in colour.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Back home I connected up the system and tried printing, but it produced coloured print previews and Black and White prints.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>After further discussions with the repairer he wanted remote access to look at the pc/printer combination the next day. In preparation I had to switch off my Broadband supplier security system
 as it was preventing download of the remote access software. <span>
&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Following the installation of the remote access software and in preparation for the next dayI decided to double check printed outputs from Word, Excel, Explorer (share option), PDF etc. They were ALL IN COLOUR.
 I’ve rebooted the system and everything is working fine. </span></p>
<p><span>I re-instigated the Broadband security, double checked everything, and it all appears to be working ok.
</span></p>
<p><span>Since I did not alter any settings/parameters or download anything but the remote access software I can only assume that there was a ‘hang up’ somewhere possibly caused by the broadband providers security
 software.</span></p>

            <p>Where did you purchase your Windows 7 Ultimate license?</p>
<p>Have you tried reactivating by telephone?</p>
<p>Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4</p>
<p>2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard</p>
<p>3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person. </p>
<p>Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy </p>
<p>If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.</p>
<p>To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.</p>
<p>065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220, 221 area for Pro and the 230, 231, 221, 232 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted</p>
<p>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>
<p>Validate Now:</p>
<p>You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy.</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/ValidateNow.aspx?displaylang=en</p>
<p>Click the 'Validate Windows' button, if the validation check fails, then click on the 'Get Genuine' button to get a WGA Kit.

            This messages seems to indicate that you have a "brand-locked" OEM version.&nbsp; The Windows 7 Ultimate requires a specific make / model of computer before the automatic activation can work.<br />

            <p>Thank you for responding. &nbsp;Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I also tried a Logitech wireless mouse and the result was the same.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;There is no error message. &nbsp; Neither the Microsoft wireless keyboard/mouse combo nor the Logitech mouse would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Intel NUC is new. &nbsp;I'm just setting it up. &nbsp;These are what I have installed: &nbsp;Microsoft Office 2016, Word Perfect Office 7, Adobe Acrobat Professional (I think version 11), and Norton Security Suite. &nbsp;Also attached are a 3.0 USB hub, a Fitbit USB connector,
 and a 8 GB flash drive. &nbsp; I have had no other problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try METHOD 1, but cannot try METHOD 2 because it would require an input device (keyboard/mouse) and neither of mine are operational when the Seagate drive is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again.</p>

            Hello Guy, <br />
<br />
We'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround. Any changes made to the system that might have caused the issue, like edited the Registry or something?<br />
<br />
Also, confirm the current build your Windows 10 is running, as this information is vital for us to proceed with the investigation.
<em>(Type <strong>winver</strong> into the Cortana search box, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.)</em><br />
<br />
If you've tried to troubleshoot the issues prior to posting your concern here in the Community, please provide the exact steps performed so we can further advise workaround.<br />
<br />
Based on the error message you've posted, the issue normally occurs when the NT file system (NTFS) fragmentation reaches the maximum size limit. A heavily fragmented file in an NTFS file system volume may not grow beyond a certain size caused by an implementation
 limit in structures that are used to describe the allocations. Check this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2498066/-insufficient-system-resources-exist-to-complete-the-requested-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for known resolution to said issue.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you require further assistance.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            User accounts get added to local administrators group</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In our domain (win server 2008 / r2) the logged on user object on some clients (windows 7) gets added to the local administrator group.</div>
<div>I can't find the reason for this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have configured restricted groups in the group policy and after gpupdate /force the user is removed from the group again (but the administrator rights remain until next logon).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Affected is always only the user, who is logged on to the client.</div>
<div>Certainly I checked the logon scripts, nothing there that could trigger such behavior.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does somebody have any idea how this could happen?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>
<div>Ingo</div>

    <title>External subwoofer still not working&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin benefield  say:</h3>
<h2>            External subwoofer still not working&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently performed a clean installation of Windows 10 (10.0.14393.0) on my Asus Q552 and ran all the updates. After completing the process, I noticed my external subwoofer no longer works (it did before on this same system, same OS, up to date). I figured
 I just needed to update the driver, so I downloaded the Realtek driver from the Asus support website, uninstalled the old driver, rebooted the system, installed the new driver, and rebooted the system again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So began a Google search for "Asus external subwoofer not working" and various other similar searches that showed I am not alone! I have since tried every other driver under the sun, but no success... So before anyone says "Have you tried installing this
 driver....", let me say, I'm sure I have the correct driver, that's not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find the device in the Device Manager. Is there's a setting somewhere in the BIOS that would disable the "Subwoofer Jack"? What other "non-driver" ideas might you have?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also checked to ensure that the subwoofer is plugged in all the way to the yellow ring by pressing VERY firmly and that the volume level is 100% by going to 'Playback Devices', right-clicking on 'Speakers' and selecting 'Properties' and then navigating
 to the 'Levels' tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives? I'm out of ideas!</p>

            <p>The surround designation, 5.1 means the system uses 5 speakers plus 1 subwoofer.&nbsp; It sound like you have a 2.1 system with is not normal but the you may have an option for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might seem the special connector would need some type of special control to access that port.&nbsp; If your system is older and ASUS does not have Win 10 drivers for it then Win 10 may not either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open the Realtek mixer panel what speaker configurations do you have available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know what the ICEsound utility is?&nbsp; It is on the drivers page so maybe it is involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user manual refers to ASUS SonicMaster technology if you know what that is.</p>

<h2>            Unable to play Skyforge</h2>
                    .Ok, so we have 2 Xbox Ones in my house. We buy Xbox Live in 3 month packs. We still have 2 months left. I have one Xbox set as home, and the other xbox I use mainly for watching movies. I have 3 people in my house all of which have accounts. I have my
 account added on the home xbox as family. I can play all games using the Home Xbox Live subscription. Havent had any issues with that until I tried to play Skyforge. When I launch the game it plays through the cut scene, then I get the option to choose Skyforge
 or Battle Royale.... no matter which I pick it brings me to the Xbox Live purchase screen. I select continue then cancel as I already have Live on the Home Xbox. Why will it not let me play Skyforge when I can play all other games just fine?

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting on the forums!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just to confirm, Skyforge is the only game not letting you play online?</p>
<p>On the home Xbox is it all of the accounts that can't play online?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the account that owns the game and the subscription is on the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Home Xbox </a>and has it set as it's home Xbox, then all of the other accounts on the same Xbox will be able to play Skyforge online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start with some troubleshooting I would recommend to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle </a>the home Xbox. Make sure to follow all of the steps to perform a complete power cycle.</p>

            Yes that is correct, Skyforge is the only one not letting me play online. I have it installed on the second Xbox, but it is not installed on the Hp,e Xbox. Does it need to be also on the Home Xbox as well? Also I have not tried to play it on the Home Xbox.
 Just on the second Xbox.

<p>Hey Panda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes you would need to play it on the Home Xbox. Your subscription and game will not share over to the second Xbox. It's not really a matter of it being installed into the second Xbox but rather who owns the game or subscription and since the second Xbox
 is not the home Xbox of the account that owns the subscription or game then you will not be able to play online on the second Xbox. Only the account that owns the game and subscription will be able to play online on both Xbox's since that account owns the
 items and the Home Console set up is not required for that account, because ownership stands with that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would need to make the second Xbox the Home console in order to play online on that Xbox, but accounts can only have one Home Console, so it would remove your first Xbox as the Home Console and would affect the accounts on that Xbox from being able to
 play online or play games. I suggest looking over our article on setting up the Home Xbox that I linked before as it has more explanations on how the game and subscription sharing works.</p>
