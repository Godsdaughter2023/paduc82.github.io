<h2>            Display not even close to WYSIWYG</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know if there is some setting I can find that will make Excel at least get close to actually rendering cells as WYSIWYG? I need to be very careful with cell lengths for this project, and although the print preview renders nicely, I can't
 make the actual display match, so I can find out if my street names will fit. The Worksheet layout is designed *very specifically* for the current printer, and the column widths cannot be altered for this reason. The font is only 7.5, so reducing it is also
 not an option. Samples below:<br />

<p>I had not, and it is still not very accurate, but is better than the normal view display. I admit I don't like having to change views (yet another step), particularly during production, just to run this check, but in conjunction with a test for string length,
 it seems to work well enough. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Freeze Shapes in Outlook Email &#40;without secondary screenshot&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I routinely add screenshots into my Outlook emails.&nbsp; Most of the time, it is necessary to add a Shape (from Insert &gt; Shapes) to highlight a portion of the original screenshot.&nbsp; If I send the email at this point, there is a chance the Shape I added will no
 longer be in the position it was originally added on top of the screenshot.&nbsp; For years, my resolution to this problem is to take a second screenshot of the picture with Shapes once all of the Shapes have been added, and paste my screenshot within the email.&nbsp;
 Then I must click each original picture/Shape and delete.&nbsp; Is there an alternative?&nbsp; Can you "freeze" the shapes to the original screenshot, so the secondary screenshot(s) are not necessary?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Heidi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how inconvenience it is that you need to take two screenshots after you've edited the first screenshot just to make sure the shapes are in place when you send it. The best suggestion that I can give you is to use MS Paint, paste your screenshot
 on MS Paint and edit it there then save it. After saving the edited screenshot in MS Paint, send it through Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            New OneNote UI on the Mac&#58; fancy, but confusing</h2>
                    <p>For all the enthusiast running Insider Preview who have turned on the "experimental features" like me, you must have noticed that the user interface of OneNote has had a major redesign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to mention that I generally like the direction in which they are going, but there are obviously a few flaws with the new design (at least in my opinion) that make its eventual adoption somewhat worrying.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Forget about where everything was, because we just applied "flip horizontal" to the UI.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is kind of confusing for me as a long-time user, now that the list of notes is located at the left (previously located at the right) of the window and the list of the sections and notebooks is also located to the left (previously located at the top).
 The contents of the actual note is now to the right, while previously it used to be to the left of the window. Basically everything is turned around at 180 degrees. This is kind of radical, in my opinion, and although I've gotten used to it after about 10
 days, I still think it's not the best idea ever.</p>
<p><em><strong>Before</strong>:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/373daadf-d719-4494-92a3-d776244945ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/373daadf-d719-4494-92a3-d776244945ae" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>After</strong>:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa60390e-a454-48d4-840c-bc718121a2cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa60390e-a454-48d4-840c-bc718121a2cb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">No more freedom to adjust the interface to your liking</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, it was possible to adjust the length of the column containing the list of notes. It was also possible to select whether or not you would like to see small picture previews of your notes. Not any more, this has been taken away.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The titles of your stuff don't matter any longer</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with seeing more than just a glimpse of the title of your notes with the new UI - I rarely get to see more than 2-3 words. The same applies to the titles of the sections, which are also extremely truncated. The title bar of the window itself now
 contains information about the name of the active notebook and (possibly) the syncing status. Previously, that's where the name of the currently opened note used to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how usable that is, especially when you sometimes you can't tell which note you're working on. Consider the screenshot below where I have scrolled down in the note and also in the list of notes. There is practically no way of telling which note
 I'm currently editing. I mean, I could probably tell, but when you're working on a couple of notes (that consist of more than just a few lines) and constantly moving from one note to the other, this becomes an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d51480af-9485-4103-85cc-5e75ca4b0b2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d51480af-9485-4103-85cc-5e75ca4b0b2e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">White, everything is white</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue with the new IS is the fact that, while being extremely elegant, it is relatively hard on the eyes (in my opinion). This is because almost everything is in white now, and that applies to the background of the note, the background of the list
 of notes and the background of the list of sections, which are displayed side-by-side. It is therefore harder to tell where one of these ends and something new starts, the thin grey lines between the three are not that helpful and this is coming from a person
 with good eyesight. I can imagine how hard it would be for someone who has problems with their eyes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A suggestion from a user with no background in design</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm not really a design expert, but I think that the usability of the new UI could be greatly improved in a very simple way - by making it build on the positive sides of the old UI. Below I attach two very amateurish mock-ups of how I see this integrated
 in the new UI so that it becomes easier for the eye to tell things apart:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Alternative A:</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecadba58-e8b1-41c6-a9dd-eb7cdd9c9a45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecadba58-e8b1-41c6-a9dd-eb7cdd9c9a45" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Alternative A, the list of notes is separated from the list of sections using a strip that matches the color of the section (currently the strip uses a rather desaturated color so it is harder to spot).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Alternative B:</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5afd241-5aa2-445a-9e7c-0c2657063109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5afd241-5aa2-445a-9e7c-0c2657063109" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternative B makes it even easier to tell things apart by using the same somewhat desaturated color for the list of notes and using white to distinguish the currently opened note from the rest (currently the opposite is done - the background of the other
 notes is white and the background of the selected note is shaded in the desaturated color). Just scroll up a bit and you will see how much easier it would be to spot what you're working on if it actually looked this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally, I'd still prefer to see the name of the note instead of the name of the notebook at the top of the window.</p>

<p>What an excellent summary of the new upgrade! I specifically searched Google for "OneNote for Mac 15.34 GUI" and found this great post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too had messed with the "experimental feature" and turned it off, preferring the standard (at that time) interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My #1 peeve is as you note is the loss of event titles as meaningful, they are concatenated to the point of uselessness, and now I simply have to depend on search, which I mostly do anyway, but why even offer a view that has no utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no issue with MS trying a new UI direction, but eliminating the excellent and productive interface that I had used for many years represents the type of "we know best, get over it" attitude that will start me re-evaluating my alternatives (maybe it's
 time to give Evernote another shot).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really love to see the old interface reemerge in a future upgrade. In the meantime, I've found the "Show Only Pages" view is the only usable one for me, but I really miss seeing the context of my categories.</p>

<p>I despise the new user interface. Please give us the flexibility to chose the new style or the old style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason the old style worked so well is that it paralleled a real notebook with sections on the top and tabs for pages on the right. And being about to assign colors to the sections was also very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new UI is completely flipped and white. It is awful!</p>

            I might be in the minority but I love the new UI.&nbsp; It's just so streamlined for my workflow I can't even handle using the old layout.&nbsp; I totally respect all the alternate points of view here I just don't necessarily agree with the conclusions.<br />

<h2>            New task manager sucks</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
Well, maybe I should call the new task manager as “recent apps”. It's quite annoying to find the app I want to switch to within a list of apps which &nbsp;are actually not running. And I really want the "real task manager" on WP8.1 back :(

<h3> fellipe silveira  say:</h3>
<h2>            Como adicionar uma pasta compartilhada no Outlook for Mac 2011</h2>
                    Bom dia,<br />
<br />
Estamos tentando adicionar uma pasta compartilhada em uma caixa de correio no Outlook for Mac 2011.<br />
<br />
Conseguimos adicionar esta pasta normalmente em um Outlook 2013 para Windows.<br />
<br />
O que precisamos é inserir apenas uma pasta compartilhada no Outlook for Mac 2011.<br />
<br />
O caminho para esta mesma configuração no Windows é o abaixo:<br />
<br />
1 – no menu principal do Outlook, localize no topo, a opção Caixa de correio – Seu nome<br />
2 – clique com o botão direito do mouse;<br />
3 – na caixa de diálogo que se abre, localize na última linha Propriedades de arquivos e dados;<br />
4 – na nova caixa de diálogos que se abre, localize no meio da tela à direita a opção Avançado e clique sobre ela;<br />
5 – abrindo nova caixa de diálogos, um pouco menor, localize uma aba no alto com a opção Avançado e clique sobre ela;<br />
6 – abrirá uma nova caixa de diálogos, e você deve acionar a opção adicionar;<br />
7 abrirá uma nova caixa de diálogos em que você deverá escrever o nome do usuário 'dono' da pasta compartilhada clicar em Aplicar, depois em OK e mais uma vez em OK. Isso fechará todas as caixas de diálogo abertas, voltando para o menu principal do Outlook;<br />
<br />
Qual seria o caminho para realizar esta configuração no Outlook for Mac 2011?<br />
<br />
Aguardo resposta, obrigado.<br />
<br />
Atenciosamente,<br />
<br />
Fellipe Freitas<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t turn on location for Windows Maps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr.saikatchakraborty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t turn on location for Windows Maps</h2>
                    Hello everyone . While first time opening windows maps on my Lumia 730..running win 10, I accidentally denied the use of location service for my maps. Now whenever I'm trying to access windows maps,it says location service turned off..we don't have permission
 to access your location,change it in location settings. When I go to settings,there's no option to turn on location for maps. I tried signing in and out of maps, tried to uninstall but it doesn't have that option too. Can somebody please help how to solve
 this issue and rectify my mistake?? Thanks.

    <title>AppleScriptTask misbehaving under Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevevillee  say:</h3>
<h2>            AppleScriptTask misbehaving under Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have a solidly reproducible case where the new AppleScriptTask command in VBA is apparently misbehaving. I am running Excel Version&nbsp;15.27 (161010) under OS X El Capitan&nbsp;Version 10.11.6. In the case described below, two incorrect things happen: (1) the
 executable 'myapp' that is supposed to execute never executes, and (2) the message box displayed by a VBA MsgBox statement disappears immediately as if the user clicked OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reproduce, download this file to your desktop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56475697/glitch.zip</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then uncompress glitch.zip, which should create files with these POSIX pathnames (assuming user chris):</p>
<p>
</p><p>/Users/chris/Desktop/glitch/Makefile</p>
<p>/Users/chris/Desktop/glitch/ShowGlitch.xlsm</p>
<p>/Users/chris/Desktop/glitch/myapp.c</p>
<p>/Users/chris/Desktop/glitch/myscript.scpt</p>
<p>/Users/chris/Desktop/glitch/myscript2.scpt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your "~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.Excel" folder exists, creating it if necessary. Then open Terminal, and enter these commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>cd Desktop/glitch</p>
<p>make</p>
<p>make installscript</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second command ("make") may ask you to install some developer software...go ahead and install it if it's not already installed, then do "make" again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Observe that myscript.scpt and myscript2.scpt are identical, except that myscript2.scpt has the call 'myscript("MyReport.pdf")' at the end. To see how the script is supposed to behave, open up myscript2.scpt in Script Editor, and click the "Run the Script"
 button (looks like a right arrow). You will see a "Choose File Name" dialog. Leave the default Save As file name as "MyReport.pdf", and click "Save". You should see the result in the window at the bottom:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"You said 'init' 'SamsungSSD128:Users:chris:Desktop:glitch:MyReport.pdf'."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now open up the Excel workbook ShowGlitch.xlsm, and enable macros. When you click the "Show Glitch" button, it should make the same call to myscript as myscript2.scpt made. Indeed, the "Choose File Name" dialog appears, indicating that it got into the script
 properly (although the dialog seems a little grayer than before). When you click Save, what should happen is a Visual Basic message box should appear, saying this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Response: You said 'init' 'SamsungSSD128:Users:chris:Desktop:glitch:MyReport.pdf'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, a message box briefly appears, saying this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Response: </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it's very hard to see this message box, because it immediately disappears, as if you had clicked OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open Console, there is no error log entry at the time you clicked Save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can shed light on what's happening here, I would very much appreciate it. We are trying to adapt our Excel-based product to work under Excel 2016, and we are pretty much blocked until this issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Thanks for pointing this out. However, even after correcting this, the same problem remains. The specific correction is that the sentence in my original posting</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure your "~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.excel" folder exists, creating it if necessary.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">should be changed to this:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure your "~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.Excel" folder exists, creating it if necessary.</span></p>
<div><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<p>I have updated&nbsp;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56475697/glitch.zip so that the Makefile has "com.microsoft.Excel" instead of "com.microsoft.excel".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curiously, even with the incorrect "com.microsoft.excel" in the Makefile, the "make installscript" was somehow still copying the script to the right place, as long as the folder I actually created was "com.microsoft.Excel". That indicates the cp command
 ('cp myscript.scpt "../../Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.excel"') in the Makefile action for installscript was somehow correcting the folder name on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, even with this correction, the same problem remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find out one other thing, though: the very fast dialog that appears is actually the Visual Basic message box. My colleague discovered this by taking a video recording of the screen, and then finding the frame where the dialog appears. However, there
 is no text after "Response:". So that indicates two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) The call to AppleScriptTask is returning a null string, instead of "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You said 'init' 'SamsungSSD128:Users:chris:Desktop:glitch:MyReport.pdf'." Most likely, myapp is never even getting called.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(2) Although Excel is displaying the message box, it is somehow pretending that I immediately clicked "OK", but I didn't.</span></p>

            <p>I found this stackoverflow article saying that a script invoked via AppleScriptTask cannot use the "choose" command, or else the AppleScriptTask command will return an empty string:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37142761/returning-a-value-with-applescripttask-word-for-mac-2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is true, it would explain the symptoms I am seeing, since I am using "choose file name" within my script. According to the article, the workaround is to use MacScript for the part that uses the "choose" command, and use AppleScriptTask for the part
 that invokes the app. I will try reworking the script to go this route, though my concern is that the MacScript command is being deprecated according to this article:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30949272/the-macscript-function-is-not-working-well-in-office-for-mac-2016-any-ideas</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to get a statement from Microsoft that MacScript is not deprecated if you are using it for a "choose" command.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions. I presume it was you who marked my earlier reply as an answer. I have unmarked it as an answer, because it does not actually answer the question. In that reply, I said that I would try reworking the script to use MacScript for
 the "choose" portion. But I have not been successful at this so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case it's not clear, the original question is not just an academic exercise. Our Excel-based product has a legitimate need to present a "choose file name" dialog, then pass the chosen file name with full path as a parameter into a C-based application,
 then return the response from the C-based application back to Excel. Under Excel 2011, our product can do this just fine via MacScript. We are trying to adapt the product to Excel 2016, and this is the issue we're running into. I have built this simple test
 case so that everyone can observe the problem without having to look at the internals of our product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a legitimate answer to the question would be one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) A modification to the simple test case so that it works properly (i.e., passes the chosen file name into the application and returns the response back to Excel). Not "could work", not "might work", but actually does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) A statement from someone knowledgeable about AppleScriptTask that what I'm trying to do is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm reluctant to join the fast insider program, because that would mean I'm running a development version of Excel. I want to be testing whatever version of Excel customers will actually be running. If the problem is fixed in some development version of
 Excel, that's fine...I just need someone from Microsoft to say so, and I'm content to wait for that version to be released to production.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did report the problem using the frown button in Excel, giving a pointer to this post.</p>

            <p>I've tried really hard to get this to work using MacScript for the "choose" part. But it's failing with "Run-time error '5': Invalid procedure call or argument" on the AppleScriptTask command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see for yourself by downloading this file to your desktop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56475697/glitcha.zip</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uncompress glitcha.zip, then open Terminal and enter these commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>cd Desktop/glitcha</p>
<p>make</p>
<p>make installscript</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see how the script is supposed to behave, open myscripta2.scpt in Script Editor, and click the "Run the Script" button. When the "Choose File Name" dialog appears, l<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">eave the default Save As file name
 as "MyReport.pdf", and click "Save". You should see the result in the window at the bottom:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>"You said 'init' 'SamsungSSD128:Users:chris:Desktop:glitch:MyReport.pdf'."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now open up the Excel workbook ShowGlitcha.xlsm, enable macros, and click the "Show Glitch" button. This should do the same thing as myscripta2.scpt, but instead after you click "Save" it generates the run time error. If you click "Debug", you will be on
 the AppleScriptTask command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it doesn't look like this approach is workable, unless someone can show me where I went wrong.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I thought about using Application.GetSaveAsFilename within Excel, but that function sets a default extension of ".xlsx", and there doesn't seem to be any way to change that default. We're trying to save a ".pdf" file. I suppose we could display a dialog
 beforehand asking the user to change the extension from ".xlsx" to ".pdf", but that would be rather ugly.</p>

            <p>A quick update on this: I have given up trying to get the AppleScript command "choose file name" to work properly when invoked from Excel 2016. It behaves erratically whether invoked through AppleScriptTask or MacScript.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, we are showing the dialog via NSSavePanel() from Swift. This seems to work nicely. For those who may be interested in the details, here is a zip file with a working example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56475697/glitchb.zip</p>
<p>
After you download, uncompress glitchb.zip, which should create files with these POSIX pathnames (assuming user chris):<br />
<br />
/Users/chris/Desktop/glitchb/Makefile<br />
/Users/chris/Desktop/glitchb/ShowGlitchb.xlsm<br />
/Users/chris/Desktop/glitchb/main.swift<br />
/Users/chris/Desktop/glitchb/myscriptb.scpt<br />
/Users/chris/Desktop/glitchb/myscriptb2.scpt<br />
<br />
Make sure your "~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.Excel" folder exists, creating it if necessary. Then open Terminal, and enter these commands:<br />
<br />
cd Desktop/glitchb<br />
make<br />
make installscript<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>Then open ShowGlitchb.xlsm in Excel 2016, enable macros, and click the "Show Glitch" button. Unlike with the earlier cases, this one works, i.e., there is no glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to link from Swift to C, so this accomplishes what I need.</p>

                    <p><span>These days I just applied for a code signing certificate from Thawte. the certificate is mainly used to sign my ActiveX controls and its installation package. as a result of the certificate is just apply for a personal code signing certificate
 and it has been issued for several days, my ActiveX control can't work fine.</span></p>
<p><span>here are the problems:</span></p>
<p><span>1. The downloaded file in Internet explorer 9 has no extend name[triggered by specifying the download url of the iframe].</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/990c06ea-2ff7-4fc9-a9a0-8f956294e0bd" /></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Through the "window.open" way to open the download link, the Internet Explorer shows "the file isn't a commonly downloaded file."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e643b2ae-f6eb-49e9-95f3-d4705e4bd587" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. when My ActiveX control is signed by the new certificate, the javascript can't find it in the Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>then problems above only happen when I sign my ActiveX with the new certificate. if I use other companies signing certificate to sign the same ActiveX, everything goes well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thawte is a well-known certificate authority, this should not have a problem. I think the problem is: the certificate is just apply for. the credit has not yet been established in Microsoft's credit system.</span></p>
<span>So how can i solve the problem now?&nbsp; This problems have seriously affected our normal software promotion.</span>

<h2>            Cannot access Hotmail account while on Chrome</h2>
                    <p>Help please. I have used a Hotmail account ever since the dawn of man and I want to keep using it. I can access the account easily from Edge, Explorer but not while I'm on Chrome! Every time I try I get an Oops message which says something about 'too many
 redirects, try again later'. Later never comes... and I have to revert to one of the other browsers :( . All is fine with my Microsoft account. Any suggestions very welcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers &amp; thanks</p>

            Hi Michelle,
<br />Did you test it in a private browser session? If it works, you just need to clear the browser cache.       
        </p>

            Hello MichelleC01, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having difficulty retrieving and reading your Outlook e-mails. I know how important this is to you, and rest assured, I will try my best to help you to resolve this together expeditiously.
<br />
<br />
Could you please provide us additional information about the issue? <br />
<br />
1. How long has this been an issue? <br />
2. Do you recall taking any recent action that could possibly result in this? <br />
3. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
<br />
It seems like a browser-related issue. May I suggest you to delete your <strong>Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies</strong> and clear
<strong>browser caches</strong> then restart the browser? <br />
<br />
- selectively deleting browser cookies <br />
<a href="https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10/clearing-cookies-from-just-one-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10...</a>
<br />
- clearing browser caches <br />
<a href="https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/</a>
<br />
- disable all extensions <br />
<br />
Alternatively, open in <strong>private mode</strong> ("incognito mode") or try to
<strong>reset your Google Chrome</strong> browser. <br />
<br />
Please ensure that your browsers have <br />
<br />
- <strong>JavaScript</strong> enabled: <a href="https://www.enable-javascript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.enable-javascript.com/</a> <br />
- <strong>Silverlight</strong> enabled: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/</a> <br />
<br />
Please ensure that you have a <strong>reliable Internet connection</strong> in the entire process.
<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you soon, <br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

            Hello MichelleC01,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your response.
<br />
<br />Have you tried all other suggestions as well? Corrupted caches is one of the reason that might cause the symptom.
<br />
<br />Corrupted cookies, interference from extensions, lack of required functionalities to load the webpage cause problems as well!
<br />
<br />Generally, based on my personal experience, I had to reinstall the Chrome browser to rectify this. I do not know what happened as well. Alternatively, you can just wait for days/weeks and the problem might fix itself. :/
<br />
<br />Let me know if it works.
<br />
<br />Regards.
<br />Sutharsan

If you choose to not buy any software to do any new functionality then you will be limited to the functionality that the N70 comes with out of the box. This is the same for any device such as the PC you're using to post these messages to this forum.<br />

There is still the option of using the N70 as a phone (!), camera and music/video player of course. If you find that these options do not help make the N70 useful then I would have to ask why you made the decision to get the N70 in the first place - maybe you're
 better off buying a supercomputer - but then again you would still have to pay for programs ! :)<br />
<br />
If you're after something that can make the tea and toast for you then I suggest you get a teamaker and toaster respectively.<br />
<br />
Please note - you will still have to pay for the electricity, teabags, water, milk (if you take it), sugar (if you take it), lemon (if you put this in your tea), honey (if you put this in your tea), bread, butter (if you put this on your toast), jam (if you
 put this on your toast) and peanut butter (if you put this on your toast).<br />
<br />
Please note that this is NOT a complete list of items you can put in your tea and on your toast, and that other condiments are available.<br />
<br />
Any decision you make should reflect this and also any allergies that you may suffer from.

<h2>            Build 10122 breaks MonoGame&#39;s Content Pipeline</h2>
                    <p>I have been working on a game that runs on MonoGame on my Windows 10 TP machine. After installing the latest fast ring build (10122), the pipeline tool (MGCB.exe) fails while running with errors like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'FreeImage': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at FreeImageAPI.FreeImage.GetFileType(String filename, Int32 size)<br />

<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">This is a problem that arose over night, and the only thing that has changed on my system is the OS version. I can confirm with someone else that they are also getting the same error with their MonoGame project. So, I am pretty
 sure that the issue is a compatibility issue with something that has changed since the last build, and therefore an issue with the OS and not MonoGame.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Can someone take a look at this?</p>

            <p>Mel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, if I wasn't clear enough...<br />
<br />
No, Mel, if you Upgrade during the 1st 12 months, you're done, period.&nbsp; You get it on the basis of, already, owning a 7 SP1/8.1 Windows License.&nbsp; Henceforth, once an End User has their license they don't keep paying over &amp; over for new software for their Platform.<br />
<br />
Let's say Windows 10 is released Oct. 26, 2015. One owns 8.1 or 7 SP1.&nbsp; Until Oct. 26, 2016 those people will be able to Upgrade to Windows 10, @ no charge.&nbsp; After that 1st year, there would be a cost, for the same path &amp; scenario.<br />
<br />
Do not have details, @ this time, regarding price structure going forward, whether Upgrading or brand new... whether @ release or for Upgraders, after the 1st year.<br />
<br />
We knew this was coming, new Platform, new approach.<br />
<br />
There won't be 10, 12, 13, etc.&nbsp; The 10 Platform will get Updates.&nbsp; We don't keep buying&nbsp;new OSs per se,&nbsp;anymore.<br />
<br />
With WAAS, personally, I will not take a stab @ how cost or fees&nbsp;will be done.<br />
<br />
Even I have said Windows 10 is not just the obvious OS... much &amp; many things have changed w/ it.&nbsp; For the better me thinks.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It <em>was</em> stated that we are moving to WAAS (Windows as a Service&nbsp;but, fees or cost was not addressed.&nbsp; We knew this was coming for quite a while.&nbsp; Once we saw Builds pushed out automatically it was confirmed.&nbsp; 8.0 to 8.1 (from the Store) was a big clue
 to what was coming, as well.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
And ponder this...&nbsp; Damn few will pay for it:<br />
1. The offer is there for 12 months.<br />
2. Most folks are on 7 SP1 or 8.1<br />
<br />
The unfortunate ones are those who clung to XP and the ones w/ Vista.&nbsp; They are not eligible.<br />
<br />
Most will do the Upgrade available to them during the 1st 12 months of Windows 10.&nbsp; Obviously, common sense wouldn't pass on it.<br />
<br />

            <p>The video today said nothing more than the upgrade itself would be free and that only for the first twelve months after release. It was said that they would update an upgraded device for its expected life time, but, nothing about that being free.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The statements about Windows as a Service becoming the largest Internet service on the planet and support for Windows in its current form being provided to enterprise customers for just a period of time, leads me to believe we are following the same path
 as Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fine print should be noted:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*It is our intent that most of these devices will qualify, but some hardware/software requirements apply and feature availability may vary by device. Devices must be connected to the internet and have Windows Update enabled. ISP fees may apply. Windows 7
 SP1 and Windows 8.1 Update required. Some editions are excluded: Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8/8.1 Enterprise, and Windows RT/RT 8.1. Active Software Assurance customers in volume licensing have the benefit to upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise outside of
 this offer. We will be sharing more information and additional offer terms in coming months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I hope that Microsoft really gives away the software/subscription free for everyone, forever. As a developer that would make me very happy, but, that is not strictly what was stated in the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As they say in the fine print, we will hear about more of this in the near future.</p>

            <p>Not to over-simplify it&nbsp;but...<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>We have know this was coming for a while...&nbsp; Once you have a Windows License, in the future, will not pay for updating.&nbsp; And, that's what will come, Updates to the Platform... not another new Operating System or Version (like 95, 98, XP, Vista &amp; so on).&nbsp;
 You will have Windows &amp; get updates.<br />
<br />
If you, already, have a license for Win7 SP1 or Win8.1 (on that basis) you are on the Windows Platform &amp; eligible for Updates going forward.&nbsp; After the 1st 12 months, that can no longer be done for free.&nbsp; But, once it's done you don't pay more.<br />
<br />
Actually, I understand it's similar to how Apple does it.&nbsp; But, that is basically hearsay for me.<br />
<br />
Myself, I don't think ongoing&nbsp;subscription fees.&nbsp; You will just buy Windows once.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll see but, that's what I see, right now.<br />
<br />

            To automate it, you can add table macros that run when data in a table changes.

            This is not considered good design. If you want to display a checkbox on a form or report set the ControlSource of the checkbox to:
<br />
<br />=NOT IsNull(SalesPrice)
<br />
<br />If Salesprice is empty, the checkbox will show a false and vice versa.
<br />
<br />Frankly, I would have a sold date field instead.

<h2>            All Metro apps still crashing since build 16226</h2>
                    <p>None of the metro apps like feedback hub, store, etc work. I thought this was a temporary problem so I let it be like this for a few weeks. I'm on build 16237 now and still have this problem so I guess I'm the only one...</p>
<p>I tried running the windows store apps troubleshooter and it didn't help.</p>
<p>I also tried running sfc /verifyonly and it didn't find any "integrity violations".</p>
<p>It started with either 16215 or 16226, not 100% sure.</p>
<p>I should also mention that I did a reset a week ago (kept files but reset windows 10) and that didn't help at all.</p>
<p>I'm kind of stuck here. What should I do?</p>
<p>edit: To be specific, the windows appear blank when launching and then disappear after less than a second, without any contents being rendered. I assume that is crashing.&nbsp;</p>

It doesn't make sense though. Doesn't a reset (while keeping files) reinstall windows clean while keeping all unrelated files intact? I assume it's like running an installer twice and then selecting "repair"? Shouldn't this have solved my problem? It doesn't
 make sense that it didn't. And I don't think a complete reset will make a difference.

<p>You know, many have had that question and it is a valid one. It is also one that I find rather hard to answer, for I am not privy to what a Reset/Repair (yes, you can take them as equals in this regard) exactly do, and more to the point do NOT do. The best
 that I've been able to come up with is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the difference between what a freshly graduated architect knows should be done and what a seasoned architect knows to work. So, yes, it should have fixed your issues, but it didn't, so the next step is to try the 'ultimate' solution, i.e. do a Clean
 Install. I won't bore you with the many times I have found a system could only be repaired by doing just that. Nearly always, I ended up with a system that to all intends and purposes was exactly the same as the 'before', both in hardware and software and
 settings and have it run as near flawless as you can get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarize: <strong>In practice, a Reset or a Repair is NOT the same as a Clean Install. Experience learns you this</strong>. Try it, but if it doesn't work, do a proper Clean Install on a newly formatted partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I agree with your assessment that doing a Reset without keeping files is unlikely to make any difference here.</p>

            <p>Hello Prashem,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I wasn't able to reproduce the issue that you're experiencing with the Maps app on my test devices here, so it's a little difficult to determine specifically how and why this is occurring.<br />
<br />
Since the buttons are just not present in the app, the app itself may be corrupted. As the Maps app is built in to the Phone's operating system, there is no easy way to reinstall it. My next recommendation would be to perform&nbsp;a factory reset of your Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To reset your phone
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the App list, tap <span><strong>Settings</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap <span><strong>About</strong></span>, and then tap <span><strong>Reset your phone</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You'll receive two warnings. If you're absolutely sure you want to restore your phone to its factory settings, tap
<span><strong>Yes</strong></span>, and then tap <span><strong>Yes</strong></span> again.<br />
</p>
<p>It might take a little while for the process to complete.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Important notes <br />
<br />
</strong>When you reset your phone, <b>you erase all personal data </b>and restore your phone to the state it was in when you purchased it. In other words, you are wiping your phone clean.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The personal content that gets erased after a reset includes: </b>Purchased and downloaded apps, ringtones, saved games, contact groups, any pictures, music, or videos, and text messages, which can’t be restored after they’re deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Items that can be restored to the phone include: </b>Media content that you previously synced with the Zune software, purchased apps, and saved games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I didn't want to have to recommend a hard reset, I believe that this will resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />
Matthew N.</p>

    <title>Getting Swamped With Junk Emails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Getting Swamped With Junk Emails</h2>
                    <p>In the last few weeks, I have been getting swamped with Emails to my Junk Folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; They seem to be coming from everywhere (get a loan, refinance, insurance, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp; I am getting 20 to 30 a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I copy any one of them to my Inbox and try to open
 one, I get message "Outlook Has Detected An Unsafe Link.&nbsp; Visiting this website may not be safe".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not go any further, and I delete the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why this started happening, and is there anything I can do to stop it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your help.</p>
