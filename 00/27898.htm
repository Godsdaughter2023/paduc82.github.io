<p>It might be easiest if you upload files (e.g. Excel file) to http://www.mediafire.com.</p>
<p>Do not expect us to solve your homework problems for you.&nbsp; But some of us are happy to give you information that will help you understand things better, the same kind of help you can expect from a teacher, TA or fellow student.&nbsp; Others regurgitate the mantra
 "we don't do homework".&nbsp; Just ignore them.</p>

            Thanks for your honesty about it being homework.&nbsp; I'll also keep an eye on the discussion along with joeu2004, and like him, will try to give hints/explanations without just handing you an answer.&nbsp; Actually, we "don't do homework" either, but we don't
 mind tutoring a little! :)&nbsp; Besides, any class still using Excel 2003 can't be all bad - I love it.

<p>Are you taking a class about Excel, as your subject suggests, or are you taking a class that uses Excel, like a stat class?</p>
<p>If this is a class about Excel, what level is it:&nbsp; beginning, intermediate, advanced?</p>
<p>I cannot imagine why your teacher would use a third-party add-in if the class is about Excel, unless it is an advanced class and the purpose of the assignment is to teach you how to deal with third-party add-ins.</p>

<p>joeu2004, I managed to download the file and open it in Excel 2010 but was initially informed that it was NOT as expected per the .xls file extension but elected to open it anyhow.&nbsp; It then appeared as an Excel workbook with 1 visible sheet and 1 hidden
 sheet.&nbsp; There are lots of stats questions and some financial functions (as present/future value) on it.&nbsp; The hidden sheet does mention "megastat" - that is, of holding information for megastat charting.</p>
<p>I then saved the file as an Excel 97-2000 file but was told I'd have "significant functionality loss", so I don't know what was lost.</p>
<p>I've put both copies on my website for download if anyone wants to try grabbing them and lending a hand:</p>
<p>The original file as downloaded (may not open in XL 2003 - [edit: I can't open this file in Excel 2003])<br />

<p>I had tried the same with XL2003; but in my case, the contents were complete gibberish. That is why I suspected it originated from a Mac -- some non-Intel-compatible.&nbsp; Don't know why.&nbsp; I have the MS patch to allow me to convert XL2007 files.&nbsp; Perhaps I need
 another MS patch to convert XL2010 files.&nbsp; Fodder for another discussion, when I get around to initiating it.&nbsp; I'll do a Google search first.</p>

<p>Yes, I see the worksheets ChartDataSheet_ and "Student 1".&nbsp;&nbsp; And I do see the homework questions in the latter.&nbsp; However, I also see areas where the cell grid is obviouosly overlayed with something, but it is invisible. For example, D56:E61, E86:G88 and
 I106:J115.&nbsp; I suspect that is some of the lost functionality.</p>
<p>No matter.&nbsp; I am still awaiting individual questions from Manny.&nbsp; If the "lost functionality" is important to understand __his__ questions, I would expect him to include that information when he asks.</p>
<p>I will look at the Mac forum to see if he is posting there based on my misdirection.&nbsp; "Sorry about that, Chief".</p>
<p>I have glanced at the questions.&nbsp; It raises my suspicions again that this is not an Excel class, but a stat class that uses Excel.&nbsp; Perhaps it is an advanced Excel class currently focused on stat functions.&nbsp; In any case, there is certainly a lot that I and
 perhaps others can help with.</p>
<p>But I might be hobbled by the fact that I do not have XL2010, much less Excel on a Mac, if that is Manny's environment.&nbsp; I might waste his time more than help :-(.</p>
<p>I also saw very little that would require a third-party add-in.&nbsp; The only one that I notice so far is #1, which calls for a box plot.&nbsp; Certainly doable without a third-party add-in.&nbsp; But no question that it would be easier with a third-party add-in.&nbsp; Moreover,
 "megastat" might be needed to give the teacher exactly what he/she is expecting.</p>
<p>We might be able to help Manny install "megastat".&nbsp; But first, Manny needs to clarify (to us) exactly what environment he is using.&nbsp; Mac or Intel-compatible?&nbsp; If a Mac, I believe some Macs now have the ability to run MSWin apps directly.</p>
<p>Awaiting Manny's participation here.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jerry's (JLLatham) efforts, I can now see most of the content of the Excel file.</p>
<p>The homework questions require a working knowledge of statistics and, to a lesser degree, finance.</p>
<p>What exactly are you "really confused" about:&nbsp; the use of Excel, or the stat/finance methods, or both?</p>
<p>If Excel, what is your level of expertise with Excel?&nbsp; Do you at least have the basic skills that you can learn from "Excel for Dummies"?</p>
<p>(Don't be put off by the book title.&nbsp; That's just how the editors chose to name the series of books.)</p>
<p>I believe you can do most of the homework without "megastat", although having "megastat" might make things easier and lessen the stat/finance understanding required.&nbsp; But frankly, I think you would gain more understanding by using "native" Excel functionality
 wherever reasonably feasible.&nbsp; The only exception that I have seen so far might be the need to do a box plot for Q1.&nbsp; Even that is not impossible without an add-in; but the effort might be distracting.</p>

<p>I pretty much agree with all you've said.&nbsp; The first question threw me, but the rest do seem solvable with:<br />
native Excel functions (not necessarily even out of 2010 - since he says they're using 2003)<br />
some knowledge of financial/accounting functions of Excel<br />
some knowledge of stats functions in Excel.</p>
<p>Remember that for some of those functions, the Analysis TookPak add-in of 2003 would probably be needed to be active.</p>
<p>Sad to say that I don't use stats/financial functions much at all - most of my work is "scientific" or simple business applications.&nbsp; But I think for some of the questions it is almost obvious that a search in Excel help for "Future Value" and/or "Present
 Value" and even "Trend Line" would be beneficial.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macstats.org/statistics-software/regression.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.macstats.org/statistics-software/regression.html</a></p>
<p>scoll down about 3/4 of the page for a writeup on Megastat and links to the above and the Megastat's author site.</p>
<p>Of course if Manny has the latest version of Excel for the mac, then that doesn't support VBA and I am sure Megastat uses VBA.</p>

<h2>            I need the 1st page to be on right hand side</h2>
                    In Word 2010, my document of 29 pages with mirror margins needs to have the first page start on the right-hand side.&nbsp; The document has 1 continuous section break between the front matter and the body in order to change page numbering in the footer from
 i,ii,iii,iv to 1,2,3,4.<br />
<br />
I produce a document with that layout every 3 months and the first page has always begun on the right-hand side, until now.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have compared every setting in layout, footer settings, margin settings, breaks, etc between the current document and a previously created one and can find no differences between them nor can I find any reason for this behavior.&nbsp; I have not changed the document
 layout; in fact, when I begin a new issue, I use a previous issue to begin so all the layout settings I worked so long to perfect would be there.&nbsp; I keep 'view all formatting marks' on also until the document is completed.&nbsp; There are no unwanted section breaks
 of any kind hiding in it.<br />
<br />
I am completely stumped with this.&nbsp; For some unknown reason something in the software has changed.&nbsp; There have been 6 Office 2010 updates installed since I last produced this document.&nbsp; I even ran the 'repair' process on my Office 2010 Home and Student installation.&nbsp;
 No change.&nbsp; What am I missing here?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I need this layout to work correctly, the document has to go to the printer and I don't have time for this.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Sharon<br />

            <p>I have put a modified version of your document in the following folder of my Windows Live Sky Drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=5aedcb43615e886b#cid=5AEDCB43615E886B&amp;id=5AEDCB43615E886B%21111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=5aedcb43615e886b#cid=5AEDCB43615E886B&amp;id=5AEDCB43615E886B%21111</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modifications that I made were to change the section start for second section in the document from Continuous to an Odd Page section break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also removed the multiple paragraph returns from the bottom of the first and second pages and formatted the first paragraphs of the second and third pages so that they would have a Page Break before them.&nbsp; There are other places in the document where that
 could also be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume that it is intentional that the first page of the second section of the document has the page number of 27.&nbsp; I now note that I omitted to update the table of contents so that it still displays 26 for that page.&nbsp; Select the table of contents and
 press F9 to update it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would find it much easier to create documents of this type if you defined and made use of Styles.</p>

</p><p>After removing the hidden objects, its back to normal. Phew!</p>

    <title>Outlook with iPhone AND iPad - Does not Work if on both - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert marqusee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook with iPhone AND iPad - Does not Work if on both</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I pray that someone can figure out what's going on with the following: in short, I can have Outlook mail on iPhone and it works fine. However, if I also install Outlook mail on my iPad, then Outlook mail on iPhone and iPad will not work. If I delete Outlook
 mail from all Apple devices, and reinstall on just my iPhone, Outlook mail &nbsp;works again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;When I about what mail on both my iPhone and iPad, the mail does not sync. Why is there the relationship between my iPhone and iPad with the same program on each? The problem prevents me from using &nbsp;Outlook mail on both devices. You would think that each
 installation would look to the server and sync. &nbsp; Note, if I delete outlook mail from just one of the devices it is still broken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have spent hours trying to figure out why in the world there is this relationship between outlook mail on to Apple devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you In advance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;I spent hours trying to isolate the problem - and there is definitely a problem. &nbsp;Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I do get a login failure on either device. &nbsp;I then enter my password, and the mail is there. &nbsp;However, the mail is only updated to the time that I installed Outlook Mail on my iPad. &nbsp;It will not update or sync new mail on either the iPhone or iPad. &nbsp;And
 I can get a recurring login failure notice - and it will pop back to mail. &nbsp;But the mail is not updated. &nbsp;I will discuss exact message below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;IMAP account via my private server (ISP) - A Small Orange. &nbsp;They have no fix and say it is a MS issue. &nbsp;I would tend to agree with them since I get my mail when Outlook Mail is "installed" on only one item. &nbsp;The ports are correct. &nbsp;Note: when I had this
 same issue with installing on my old iPad, I went through every possible port - but the same problem occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Not sure what you mean: &nbsp;I followed the usual procedure - I downloaded the app on my iPhone and iPad from the Apple App Store and went through the standard setting up of the IMAP account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;I have tried for hours on this issue. &nbsp;I have tried every port (as I said earlier). &nbsp;Here is the kicker: in order to get Outlook Mail to work again - I go into the settings - and delete the account "from all devices". &nbsp;Then I reinstall Outlook Mail on
 my iPhone only and it works great. &nbsp;Strange thing: my Apple Mail works fine with the IMAP mail server - the same account I use on Outlook Mail. &nbsp;And Apple Mail and Outlook Mail works fine together - but only if I have Outlook Mail on my iPhone only and not
 installed on my iPad. &nbsp;Note: to get it to work on iPhone after deleting from iPad, I literally had to delete the app, then reinstall on my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some of my thoughts on the subject: &nbsp;When you go to settings and you delete a mail account - it asks you if you want to uninstall from "this device" or on "all devices". &nbsp;Merely uninstalling from "this device" does not solve the issue. &nbsp;So, if I
 merely delete app from my iPad, my iPhone still does not sync - same issue. &nbsp;I have to delete from "all devices" and then uninstall the program completely from iPad and iPhone. &nbsp;I then reinstall on my iPhone and it works fine. &nbsp;But only on my iPhone - and
 I will not reinstall on my iPad - because I have tried it. &nbsp;It is in the second installation on my iPad that causes the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why in the world would you have to delete from "all devices" and not just one? in order to get it to work on my iPhone?</p>
<p>In other words, I have isolated the issue to some kind of communication between my iPhone and iPads in order to choose "delete from all devices". &nbsp;That makes no sense whatsoever. &nbsp;Each installation on separate apple devices should be independent - and there
 should be no correlation between having Outlook Mail on my iPhone and iPad. &nbsp;Why not just have each program sync with the IMAP mail server? &nbsp;So, I strongly suspect the issue is in this relationship between Outlook Mail on each Apple device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the exact error message: it merely says failure to login or timed out. &nbsp;I do not want to have to go through all this again - since I have literally spend hours and hours trying to isolate. &nbsp;Hopefully, what I have given you is enough to analyze the
 issue. &nbsp;Try it - if you have iPhone and iPad on same account (i.e., you own the two products under your Apple ID), I am sure you will face the same issue when you install on both devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue will impact every Apple user who wants the mail on two Apple devices.</p>

            <p>I think that I finally found the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Outlook Mail on iPhone and iPad is connected with iCloud, there was something interfering with the sync if I had Outlook Mail on both iPhone and iPad. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here, I believe, is the cause and solution of the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same IMAP account listed on my Apple Mail program AND my Outlook Mail on both the iPad and iPhone. &nbsp;Since Oulook Mail for mobile uses iCloud to sync, it caused a conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I inactivated the Apple Mail IMAP account on my iPad, installed Outlook Mail on the iPad and so far works fine = fingers crossed. &nbsp;But it seems to make sense that this caused the issue. &nbsp;Note: I did not inactivate my Apple Mail on my phone. &nbsp;But still seems
 to function together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this truly solves the issue, I hope I helped people having the same issue.</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 and new laptop with WIndows 10</h2>
                    I bought online from reputable store in England and had delivered Office 2016. Opened my account with Microsoft through new laptop and tried at various times over the last three days to activate the product key.&nbsp; Each time I enter the key I get a green
 tick, and I am told to 'take it back to the store'!&nbsp; I've emailed the company to ask them to sort it by email as if I rang them I would lose my cool with them!&nbsp; Nothing back from them so far and I am just getting more and more annoyed.<br />
Why if Microsoft give my key a tick will they not accept the key.&nbsp; I have paid for it and it was delivered two days ago!&nbsp; Do I really have to join the Christmas traffic and go to a store, as I am not paying to ring them!!! Merry Christmas to all.

 from previously registering software since Windows 95.&nbsp; I can't see how going to the store will do anything to solve this, but there seem to be a lot of trouble with other people and product keys.&nbsp; Give me a disk for extra money anytime!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why would Microsoft green tick the Product Key I entered while I am logged in to my account, but then say error, go back to the store?&nbsp; Never had this trouble before.&nbsp; Products are leaving suppliers so quickly that I ordered online for both while they
 were available.&nbsp;I have tried activating the key from the links in Windows 10, and&nbsp;from the Microsoft website, but whatever way I go, while logged in to my Microsoft account,&nbsp;I get the same&nbsp;message of error, take it to the store.&nbsp; Still nothing from the supplying
 company by email who I emailed yesterday.<br />
<br />
I&nbsp; don't do business on the phone, and so much of&nbsp;phone help even with people in UK are with people with heavy accents that are often difficult to understand.&nbsp; They use standard phrases and never listen to my questions if I am not sure of the&nbsp;terms used, but
 with email I can search for their meanings, and face to face, people do not get the better of me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea what you mean by Surface.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>I followed your suggestions, and had a chat with Howell M.&nbsp; I had to click a link to a long URL but it just went round in circles and I got back to the page your Url suggested I use.&nbsp; I was given a US phone number also, but as I was logged in to Microsoft
 with an email address ending in uk, surely they knew I wasn't in the US???&nbsp; Then he gave me a UK phone number, but I am NOT doing business on the PHONE be it landline or mobile as I have no record of what is said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT the simple thing I want an answer to is:&nbsp; WHY does Microsoft give my product key a green tick and then say error, take it to the store???&nbsp; I bought it online.&nbsp; Nothing makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I feel I have wasted my money by buying both a new Windows computer and OFFICE Home &amp; Business 2016.&nbsp; It does not encourage me to take the upgrade on my old laptop from 7 to 10 either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you any other suggestions as to how to get linked to those at Microsoft who can make my key work, please???&nbsp; £229.99d is wasted if not!</p>

</p><p>A Mircosoft Account is just that!&nbsp; But years ago the computer industry used the word account in a way it was not developed for.&nbsp; Account implies in English that money is involved but so many different 'log ons' or 'registrations' or 'identifications' are

    <title>Audio Crackling &#40;Also, why is it so hard to contact Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellenbarber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Crackling &#40;Also, why is it so hard to contact Skype service&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This is not how I wanted to spend my night. Fixing my grandmother's computer, updating drivers, reinstalling Skype, rebooting the whole system, trying to fix a problem I had managed to solve months ago, wherein any call, even that to echo, will be constantly
 crackling. First time out, updating the drivers fixed it. Now, something has updated, and undone my work. The drivers have not updated in months, so it seems a recent Skype update has brought it out of date with the drivers. Regardless of the cause, if my
 grandmother cannot make calls on Skype, then Skype has completely failed in its purpose. So, I need some sort of update, or hotfix, or some walk through more advanced settings (because no amount of fiddling with the options IN Skype has gotten me any progress),
 so my grandmother doesn't try to bring her whole computer to the shop over a software problem THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING, would be AWESOME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how the hell is this the only way that I can get help? The Skype COMMUNITY? I wanted to call somebody and get this figured out now. Or email somebody, and have it go straight to an employee. Relegating Customer Support to a community is not Customer
 Service. It's a large company telling it's users, "Good luck, figure it out amongst yourselves." Get it together, Skype. When somebody wants help, they want help from an employee, not John Random in Nashville, TN.</p>

            <p>I'm fairly certain that this is a bug. I installed this when it became available, and all of the directories under "Calendar Attachments" were created since I had installed office 2016. Outlook had created over a hundred sub-directories each numbered in
 sequence. Each of these sub-directories had sub-directories of their own that contained a few .attachment files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had enough meetings since I installed (I average 1, maybe 2 meetings a week) this software. To remediate this I closed out of outlook, and through terminal I created a tgz of everything under "Calendar Attachments" then removed all of the sub-directories.
 I restarted Outlook and haven't lost any data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since completing this Outlook has created 6 new dub-directories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure exporting the data would have solved the issue as it seems Outlook was creating these directories for no reason in particular.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Unable to activate Office 365 for Mac on OS X - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikebothman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to activate Office 365 for Mac on OS X</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday I downloaded OS X for my Mac and had Office 2011 running on that same Mac. After the download and install of the new OS X, Microsoft outlook would no longer function properly. Within 2 minutes of launch, Outlook would freeze until I forced it to
 quit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I decided to upgrade to Office 2016 through my godaddy account for the business I work for. After removing all previous Office 2011 software off of my Mac, I downloaded Office 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I attempt to use Outlook or any other Microsoft office application, when I attempt to activate, I am given a message that states "Unable to Activate Office. Please try again later. You can use Outlook in offline mode for free in the meantime if
 needed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and re-installed Office 2016 multiple times. I have followed all of the instructions located in the threads below. I have now spent about 12 hours attempting to fix this problem with all of the same results, "Unable to Activate Office."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Because different customers have different situations, please help confirm following information for further investigation:<br />
1.Do other users in your organization encounter the same issue?<br />
2.Please verify your account to check whether you’re using the right one and have a license for Office 2016 for Mac.<br />
3.Regarding “<strong>After removing all previous Office 2011 software off of my Mac</strong>”, please follow steps in this article to check whether Office 2011 for Mac has been completely uninstalled so that we can determine whether this issue is related to
 remaining data of Office 2011 for Mac: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Troubleshoot-Office-2011-for-Mac-issues-by-completely-uninstalling-before-you-reinstall-ba8d8d13-0015-4eea-b60b-7719c2cedd17?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot Office 2011 for Mac issues by completely uninstalling before you reinstall</a>.<br />
4.Please check your Mac firewall to see whether it blocks the activation process.<br />
5.As @JUANRamos1035 mentioned, reset your license files by running the script in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3025946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Knowledge Base article 3025946</a>.</p>

            Hi Jaime,
<br />
<br />Was Office attached to your Microsoft Account?
<br />
<br />If so, go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />Select Install Office - Install 
<br />
<br />From there you can deactivate the old installation, which should allow you to activate the current installation . . .

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I go through setup.office.com and login,</p>
<p>I would see that THAT product key is there.</p>
<p>I proceeded to install (step #2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After downloaded/installation it appears all is done.<br />
When I run excel/word, it says Activation Required.<br />
When I tried to activate, it says product key is not valid.</p>

    <title>Reputation problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reputation problem</h2>
                    <pre><span>Hello,

I am currently a member of the LGBT community.
Often, we have to send emails to our members as administrators, telling them about the different activities that are to come.
Recently our e-mails were blocked by Outlook at the Data Center with a targeted serial range and then we learned from our host that Outlook had blocked this a serial  range that it considered bad reputation the ips concerned.

Yet, we fully subscribe to the respect of the standards of Outlook in our mailings in group. For example, by allowing our members the opportunity to stop receiving emails.

That's my question now!

Is it possible for our community to no longer be seen as addressing bad e-mails even as an LGBT community?

If so, is there a program that would give our community the opportunity to claim us as a valid email address to our members?


Thank you</span></pre>

<br />Microsoft Word will open most PDF files and allow you to edit those . . .

</p><p>I have Onedrive for Business and for Business in Sharepoint server. I thought the two accounts will give me the upload blocked issue, so i removed the Onedrive for Business on my laptop. This didn't fix the upload blocked issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I reinstalled Window 10 and office 365, everything is back to normal. I only added the onedrive for business in sharepoint server on my laptop and access my Ondrive for business account online. Also, I will no longer access files on other devices such
 as IPad, Iphone, etc. I think having multiple onedrives and accessing onedrives on multiple devices were the cause of all these problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- &nbsp; Find the paragraph # by brute force searching each paragraph for matching text using InStr(String1, String2). This is

            <p>The brute force method is unnecessary. A quicker way to find the paragraph number is shown in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/GetIndexNoOfPara.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/GetIndexNoOfPara.htm</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This macro should do what you need, with a few caveats: It assumes the list of words is in column A of the first sheet in the current workbook. The line numbers it finds start at 1 at the top of each page in the Word document. An empty paragraph mark (a
 "blank line") counts as both a line and a paragraph. If you've restarted the page numbers, the&nbsp;wdActiveEndAdjustedPageNumber parameter will cause the macro to get the modified number (i.e., what a {PAGE} field would show); if you want the absolute page number,
 replace that parameter with&nbsp;wdActiveEndPageNumber.</p>

<h2>            Importing batch of CSV,Dat,Txt files efficiently</h2>
                    
<p>Sorry I know I started a thread just before this, but I also have another problem that I'm trying to "remedy". I have a huge chunk of csv, dat and txt files all with data and are all comma-separated.</p>
<p>Now, I have written a code before to import all this data by opening the data file, select and copying the range of data, change the next window (workbook that collects data), pastes data, change the next window again (the data file), clear the clipboard
 and close the data file document. I do this for multiple data files.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is a more efficient way of getting the data, thanks. i.e not having it to open in another "window" and closing the window, as that seems to slow it down a lot. Thanks.</p>

<p>Can I configure somehow on O365 side that Dirsync error report e-mails will sent to multiple recipients.&nbsp; On the portal I think I can put only 1 e-mail adress.</p>
<p>Is it possible to put a distrivution group e-mail address there?</p>

<p>Hi Kisjai3,</p>
<p>As I know, the DirSync error report will be delivered to the <strong>Technical contact email</strong> of the tenant.</p>
<p>Based on my test,&nbsp;I can input a distribution group as the email address&nbsp;and save. So please try it on your side to see if it works.</p>

<h2>            how to update MS outlook meeting request with &#34;no response required&#34;</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
In outlook 2007 (exchange), I recently received an update to a meeting request that I previously accepted where no response was required (update was just giving more details in the body). Usually, when I receive an update (location of the meeting, agenda of
 the meeting, ...), I have to click accept even though I accepted the meeting with the first request.<br />
<br />
What is the process to update a meeting request withouth requiring attendees (or all recipients to the request) to respond (accept/tentative/refuse)?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help, I can't seem to find the info elsewhere...<br />
<br />
