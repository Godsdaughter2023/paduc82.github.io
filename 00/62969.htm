            Hi,<br />
<br />
BitLocker on Windows 10 Home is not supported&nbsp;so you need Windows Pro or&nbsp;Enterprise.<br />
<br />
BitLocker is a professional&nbsp;level encryption program and should not be used unless one<br />
really understands that it is&nbsp;secure and can not be broken by any&nbsp;usual or inexpensive<br />
methods IF AT ALL. Only those with superior backup strategies should even consider
<br />
its use.<br />
<br />
BitLocker is more frequently used and supported by those&nbsp;in the TechNet IT Pro Forums.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Compatibility Center video cards</h2>

The ONLY way (even with the compatibility center) to be sure a video card is actually compatible and supported by its manufacturer is to check with the video card manufacturer themselves.<br />

            You may need to search the center a little to find the results. For example, if you look in 'devices' - 'graphics cards and components' and enter 'agp' as a search (as opposed to agp 8x) it lists 249 cards.
<div><br />
<div>Now, I'm not saying they are all AGP 8x but some are and they are not listed in the 'AGP 8x' 40 odd cards.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For example:</div>
<div><span>BFG NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT 512MB AGP Graphics Card -&nbsp;</span><span>BFGR73512GT</span></div>
<div><span>in its spec sheet is listed as "</span><span>The BFGR73512GT&nbsp;features</span><strong>&nbsp;AGP 8x&nbsp;</strong><span>bus compatibility"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>similarly,</span></div>
<div><span>Sparkle GeForce 6200 AGP DDR2 256MB Graphics Card -&nbsp;</span><span>SA6200256D2HPP, is listed on Amazon as '</span><span>AGP 8X'</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So there maybe more than the 40 listed as AGP 8x.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>I'm not saying these are excuses but AGP is maybe considered as getting a little long in the tooth these days as I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;few if any motherboards made after 2010 had support for it.
<i>"</i><span><i>By 2010 few new motherboards had AGP slots. No new motherboard chipsets were equipped with AGP support, but motherboards continued to be produced with older chipsets with support for AGP."</i> -&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Graphics_Port" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Graphics_Port</a></span></div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I guess it depends on if the card manufacturer has supplied a working W7 driver or not, rather than W7 itself.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Good luck in finding a card/driver. But even just 40 is not a bad choice is it?</div>

<h2>            &#34;The system image is on a hard disk, but Windows needs to format that disk to restore your computer. Choose a different image to restore.&#34;</h2>
                    I built a new system for my granddaughter this past Xmas with a 128gb ssd and 750gb hd. My big mistake was to partition the ssd with win7 on the first partition and win8 on the second and gave firm instructions to install everything on the hd. Although
 there was much on the hd the 'c' drive was full. At this time she not too crazy about win8 so I divided the hd into 3 partitions. I left all alone all files and programs in the first partition: installed win8 in the second; and created a system image in the
 third. I booted from the system disk. It found the image I just created and gave me the message "The system image is on a hard disk, but Windows needs to format that disk to restore your computer. Choose a different image to restore." The only choices I have
 are 'back' or 'cancel'. Any suggestions????

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does the image belong to Windows 7 or Window 8?</p>
<p>2. Why are you trying to perform a system restore when it's already installed on both the drives?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back with the details so that we could provide appropriate assistance on the issue.</p>

            <p>Hello, I have a similar problem. &nbsp;I am booting from a windows 8.1 recovery usb drive and trying to restore my SSD from an image I made prior to the disaster on an external &nbsp;HDD. &nbsp;The image I am trying to recover from is on a WD Passport hard drive. &nbsp;The
 reason I am trying to restore the image is because I had a hardware problem and sent my Qosmio 75 to Toshiba where they wiped my SSD and HDD and sent it back with the lame Windows 8 OS. &nbsp;I had a lot of software on it before they trashed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried booting from the usb drive over and over. &nbsp;I click on "System Image Recovery". &nbsp;I select Windows 8.1; The available image on my Passport is recognized; &nbsp;I select Next; Then the dead end message below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"To restore the computer, Windows needs to format the drive that the Windows Recovery Environment is currently running on. &nbsp;To continue with the restore, shut down this computer and boot it from a Windows installation disc or a system repair disc and then
 try the restore again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Next button is grayed out. &nbsp;I am in a vicious cycle in which I have spent hours on. &nbsp;Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you recall making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you get any error messages when accessing the internet in the normal mode?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Disable the security software temporarily.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats.
 In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus
 software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> If the above method does not work, you may put the computer to clean boot
 and check.</span></p>

<p><span>After you used the clean boot to resolve the problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click

<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type

<h2>            How do I set up groups on Windows 8 Mail contacts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to set up a group on Windows 8 Contacts tile. It is impossible.&nbsp; I can only add new contacts. Management is inexistent. The only way is is going to Outlook.com and do this but then the group does not synch with the Mail client and therefore I am
 unable to send mails with it. I can only use groups through Outlook.com! Not impressed. Any suggestions?</p>

<h3> therealgdcolon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Xbox app screen recorder shows &#34;Nothing To Record&#34; upon recording</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: left">
<p>Now, I am aware of the fact that several people have had this problem as well, but I still can't fix it.</p>
<p>In case the title is confusing, upon attempting to record a game through the Game Bar (Win + G, then red dot) a message pops up saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cfa8c07-1c28-4a31-af44-fd987fbbd8bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cfa8c07-1c28-4a31-af44-fd987fbbd8bc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This message has popped up in the past, though after rebooting it fixes and works like a charm.</p>
<p>However, now that does not work, and the error has been appearing for over a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; This message appears on every app/game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; The screenshot button works fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; "Record That" (background recording) gives the same message</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully there is a fix, as I rely on this thing. Third party screen recorders work terribly for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clear things up, here is what I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running troubleshooting in the control panel</li><li>Changing recording shortcut</li><li>Recording in fullscreen</li><li>Updating my graphics driver</li><li>Deleting temporary files</li><li>Spamming Win + Alt + R</li><li>Checking for Windows 10 updates</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling the Xbox app</li><li>Checking <em><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-IN/xbox-on-windows/social/troubleshoot-game-dvr-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://support.xbox.com/en-IN/xbox-on-windows/social/troubleshoot-game-dvr-windows-10">this page</a></em></li></ul>

<p>You should just stop replying to this thread, because you're not helping our problem. &nbsp;You clearly don't understand the actual problem and you obviously don't know how to fix it. &nbsp;None of these work. &nbsp;My laptop has the most recent update, the "record game
 clips and screenshots using game dvr" function is on, and I even checked my video card to find that it's an Intel HD Graphics Family 4531. &nbsp;Also, our problem doesn't have to do with the ending, the problem is that it doesn't start in the first place because
 the screen recorder thinks that "there's nothing to record." &nbsp;Our problem is a software problem that can be fixed by simply allowing the screen recorder to record&nbsp;<strong>ANY window</strong>, and not just
<strong>whatever the system thinks is a game.</strong></p>

<h3> rolyatocadabra  say:</h3>
<h2>            I often have to manually reopen Mouse &#38; Keyboard Center to make it start working</h2>
                    <p>I have had a MS mouse &amp; keyboard for awhile. It is a wireless dongle and there's the mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Microsoft Mouse &amp; Keyboard Center so I can control how the mouse buttons behave in various applications, or tweak the mousewheel scrolling settings, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason - and I have actually had this happen even after re-installing windows afresh (two or three times) - what seems to happen is that, sometimes, the MS Mouse/KB center application does not apply to an application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens when:</p>
<ol>
<li>I reboot the computer. I need to find the Mouse and Keyboard Center in my Program Files directory and run it.</li><li>A program is force exited, like if I close my internet browser because it is having some issue, and I restart it. I need to open the MS Mouse/Keyboard Center again</li><li>At unknown intervals, I have to open it again, because suddenly my mouse wheel makes me scroll way too much, until I re-open MS mouse and keyboard center, then it is back to normal.</li></ol>
<p>Also, when I do reopen the Microsoft Mouse &amp; Keyboard Center, there is a splash screen that can't even be minimized. So I have to just stare at it while it takes 10-15 seconds to open, then I can minimize it. If it didn't stop me from using my computer every
 time I had to re-open it, I could just ignore it. But it goes to a great length to prevent me from doing anything until the splash screen is done loading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my suggestion is:</p>
<p>1. Fix the hook, so it does not stop working so often, such as when a program crashes and is re-opened at some later time.</p>
<p>2. Make it start with the computer properly. BTW if you try to install it without specifically running as an administrator, it gives you errors. Every other software ever asks for admin privileges when it needs it - except this one, which is designed so
 it extracts to C:\adksadj23er2r (some temp directory)&lt; then tries to run setup.exe in that directory, then crashes because unless you run it as an administrator it can't read folders in the base directory of the C:\ drive. Get your act together. I mean, has
 anyone ever even tested this application? Jesus.</p>
<p>3. Just, either discontinue the software, or update it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            MUI cache problem</h2>
                    I am using WinXP SP3 and keep current on all the critical updates. Lately, I've noticed that occasionly my computer slows down considerably. When it does I run Norton Utilities and check the regestry. When I do, the MUI cache is always showing up as missing
 or invalid. I then have Norton Utilities correct that and any other problem that shows up. After&nbsp; the correction, my computer returns to running at it normal speed. I have a preety good idea what the MUI cache does, but I don't understand why it keeps going
 missing or invalid.

            Norton is probably the reason your system is running slowly - it is a know memory and CPU hog, I will never install it or recommend it for that reason alone and suggest you consider something with a smaller footprint and less overhead like
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> and supplement that with the free versions on <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MBAM</a> and <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SAS</a>.&nbsp; Your sytem will reward you with much better performance.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the fact that some people adore their Norton/Symantec products, but they will slow your system down.<br />
<br />
If you were to look around in the Norton forums regarding your issue, you might come across
<a href="http://community.norton.com/t5/Other-Norton-Products/Norton-Utility-High-Priority-warnings/td-p/407922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this advice</a> from Eric Carlstrom, a Norton/Symantec employee and Technical Product Manager:<br />
<br />
 to ignore it for future scans.&nbsp; </span><br />
<br />
I can tell you that the Support Engineer advice to run sfc /sannow will not help you and you do not have symptoms consistent with a need to run sfc /scannow.&nbsp; That is not how it works, that is not what it does and that is not what it is for.&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, that idea
 out of the blue with no symptoms indicating it is needed means "I have no idea what the problem is or how to correct it".&nbsp; It is just another one of there Support Engineer<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> wild goose chases.</a><br />
<br />
Should you chose to replace your Norton with MSE, be sure to use the Norton removal and uninstall tools that you can find here:<br />
<a href="https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?lg=english&amp;ct=united+states&amp;docid=20080710133834EN&amp;product=home&amp;version=1&amp;pvid=f-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<br />
Give MSE a shot and see how your system behaves.&nbsp; If you find that you don't care for it, you can uninstall it and reinstall your Norton again, right?<br />

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I would be very grateful if someone could assist me with my problem with Windows Vista 32 bit.<br />
<br />
Problem started when I restarted my computer for Windows Update to load…there was a black screen with the words ‘C://Key Regis… “ or something similar. As I moved my laptop the power socket came out and ever since then Window’s Vista will not start.<br />
<br />
I have tried to do System Restore - however it cannot resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
I have tried to go in as the “Administrator “ to access the system restore/repair to no avail as it needs a password, despite me not setting up a password to log into my laptop!!!<br />
<br />
The report from StartupRepair notes the following:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Problem Even Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StartupRepart V2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem Signature 01:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autofailer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem Signature 02:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.0.6000.16386.6.0.6001.18000<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem Signature 03:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem Signature 04:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 39322<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem Signature 09:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SystemRestore<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.0.6000.2.0.0.2561.1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1033<br />
</strong><br />
Now Windows Vista will not start at all and the only thing i can action is something from the System Recovery tools - which doesnt work.</p>
<p>Can I use command prompt to force the laptop to go start properly? I would be ever so grateful is someone can help me as I have a lot of files which I cannot lose on there.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Sarah</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are&nbsp; you able to access Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot?<br />
<br />
This could be a serious error and need tech support from a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks<br />
at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Vista disks. Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
With a Vista or Repair disk try Startup Repair - (the possible fixes are same as these though the titles<br />
are named differently.)</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or use a Vista Disk<br />

If you do not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy protected. Your<br />
System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already own Windows. Also you<br />
can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help :<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can retry System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

</a><br />
Or from the Command Prompt :<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\rstrui.exe<br />

<p>You need Vista disk then, either a repair or the OEM full version from your system maker. Both<br />
of those are outlined in the second section of the reply above.</p>

            Cancellation is not an option when a renewal is being processed. A payment method cannot be deleted if it is currently in use by a subscription or auto-recharge. To ensure your card does not get billed, you should cancel your subscription 3+ days prior
 to its expiration. This ensures the auto renewal does not take place, or reverses if it does. If you missed that window, it will generally attempt to charge the card for the next 3 days until your subscription expires. Once the subscription expires without
 payment, the subscription will auto cancel. You should no longer be billed to the card. At that point, the card can be deleted from the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I have a similar problem Microsoft/Skype want to bill me $119 for a renewal, and I cannot find anywhere how to cancel this.
</p>
<p>Why do they not have a simple "Cancel" button? </p>
<p>But no they make you jump through hoops so that they can extract another amount from you.&nbsp; In my case they want to bill me for
<em>"’Unlimited</em> <em>World 12 months’ subscription is up for renewal and we’ll charge you $119.88 (inclusive of applicable taxes) on Jul 4, 2019.
</em></p>
<p><em>And yet, I am logged in and nowhere can I find a way to cancel, this is extortion.</em></p>

<p>There is a cancel subscription link when you use the manage button. The key thing is to be signed into the correct account to see it. The email you received will generally state which account the subscription is tied to. If you cannot see the subscription
 to cancel it, you are not signed into the right account. Sign out of the wrong account and sign back into the right one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype accounts can be under:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. A unique email address (live: prefix account).</p>
<p>2. A Skype name you created long ago.</p>
<p>3. Your phone number.</p>
<p>4. A friend/family member account authorized (or not authorized) to use your payment source.</p>
<p>

    <title>unable to back up windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackfriend  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to back up windows 10</h2>
                    <p>In windows 10 back up I accidently disabled&nbsp;the external hard drive I was using for back up. Now I am unable to make any back ups.</p>
<p>I have tried setting up a drive in left hand side of the Back up page which I arrived at via "settings and update&nbsp; back up etc." but this is not possible, I can see the external hard drive I wish to use but the computer says No. Nor can I reset the drive
 or use a different drive</p>
<p>I have tried rebooting and restoring but no joy.</p>
<p>There must be a simple way to recover this back up setting but after trying all ways known to man I am unable to find it. So here I am unable to back up on windows 10.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated</p>

Can you tell us the program you're using to work with the video project? You must be right about the issue being with the HDMI or with the Windows settings. However, we need to check first the settings of the application that you're using. That must be under
 options, and audio settings of the app. On some movie editor application, the channel will not be stereo (nor any high definition sound) until the project is rendered and finished.</p>

 as laid down by one of the replies that were similar to much of yours, my husband brought home a new updated set of 'Blackweb Multimedia Computer Speakers" from Walmart... and it looks like it has actually solved the problems. I believe it loaded its own drivers

</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We also thought about the possibility that it might be our software program "Pinnacle Studio 15 Ultimate", because I've had a terrible time with even just loading 58 minute disks into the program...so it
 wouldn't surprise me if the problem was with Pinnacle...but in regard to the audio, it looks like Pinnacle has escaped final judgment at the moment!</p>

 speakers working, then it must be the fix we were looking for. The speakers we had were pretty old...Labtec 3900's ..&nbsp; So I'll hold my breath a little longer to see. If not, I'll rework some of the replies as the Microsoft Community so graciously went to the
 trouble to outline a possible fix for me and just start over. If it does work and it does 'hold' I'll let you know.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> trevkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Windows 10 bug with Microsoft generic device driver &#8220;StorAHCI.sys&#34; regarding SSDs</h2>
                    <p>During normal but light usage of Windows 10 the PC will suddenly freeze (at random but regular intervals) and will be completely unresponsive for about 25-30 seconds (apart from being able to move the mouse pointer). During the freezes the SSD disk utilisation
 will hit 100% and will stay there until the PC unfreezes. Once the PC has unfrozen any activity performed during the freeze will catch up. From investigating this problem on the internet and this website the only successful solution appears to be is to use
 another SSD device driver i.e. from the manufacturer. In case of my Intenso SSD Sata III this is not possible as the manufacturer doesn't supply its own device driver. This is proving to be a right pain. There is definitely a bug in the&nbsp;Microsoft generic device
 driver “StorAHCI.sys" that appears to cause some sort of reset of the SSD during its operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is already a topic from Microsoft called "Task Manager might show 100% disk utilization on Windows 10 devices with Message Signaled Interrupt (MSI) mode enabled" the change of which I have implemented but to no avail. However this topic discusses a
 very similar issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help? Thanks in advance....</p>

            I replaced the&nbsp;Microsoft Standard SATA AHCI Driver with a AMD SATA Controller driver. The PC still freezes but less often. When it freezes the same thing happens. The SSD disk utilisation hits 100% and will stay there until the PC unfreezes. The PC is
 completely unresponsive during the freeze apart from the mouse pointer. This time though it stays frozen even longer for up to 90 seconds. Something seems to be killing the AHCI driver and causing a reset of some sort. Can anybody shed any light?

            Apart from a couple of initial freezes (reported) after installing the&nbsp;AMD SATA Controller driver I have had no more problems with the freezing of my PC. Therefore the solution to the freezing problem in my case was to replace the Microsoft Standard SATA
 AHCI Driver with the AMD SATA Controller driver. Microsoft need to look at debugging their Standard SATA AHCI Driver and how it works with SSDs.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>How have you created a system backup?</span></p>
<p><span>You can't save scheduled system image backups on CDs or DVDs and depending on how much data you have, it might take several CDs or DVDs to hold your backup and you would need to store and keep track of all of them.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to boot to the desktop in order to read the files that are there in your DVD.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You can go to the Computer by clicking the start button and then select the DVD driver letter (X:) and right click
 and then select properties<span>&nbsp;</span>then you will be able to see view date.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In order to see the info in the DVD you should double click on the driver letter.</span></p>
<p><span>SuperFetch has two goals: it decreases boot time, and makes sure applications that you use the most load more efficiently. SuperFetch also takes timing into account, in that it will adapt itself to your usage patterns.</span></p>
<p><span>To turn on the&nbsp; <strong>SuperFetch</strong> follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Load the&nbsp;<strong>Services</strong>window by typing&nbsp;
<em><strong><span>services.msc</span></strong></em> in<strong>Start</strong> Search.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 keeps turning wi-fi off on Asus x54C - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -msar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 keeps turning wi-fi off on Asus x54C</h2>
                    <p>After some of the latest Windows updates during last month Windows 10 in my Asus X54C started turning WiFi off everytime I put my laptop to sleep or when I reboot / power-down.&nbsp;I can turn on wifi manually but it stays up only for 5-10 secs. After that it
 is turned off automatically by Windows and can be turned back on, but remains on for just a few secs making WiFi totally unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get WiFi back working is to uninstall the wifi adapter from Device manager and let Windows to reinstall it. Then WiFi works faultlessly. However that only helps until I have to put computer to sleep/reboot/power-down, then the trouble starts
 all over again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled power-saving option from wifi adapter from device manager. I've as well resetted all network settings/caches as instructed in some of the instructions on this community for similar cases. I've checked with Windows' troubleshooter by running
 it as Administrator that nothing erroneous is detected and I've checked that the drivers are the latest. Nothing seems to help. Any ideas how to move forward?</p>

            I assume that I needed to start the tool on "wireless and other network adapters" from the list shown by&nbsp; the link you included. The tool starts and detects that WiFi is turned off and turns it on. However after a couple of seconds the wifi is turned automatically
 off again. So no luck....<br />

            I did network reset. What happened was that after laptop rebooted and I joined the WiFi for the first time, I was able to connect, but Wifi was turned once again automatically off after a few seconds. Then I tried again uninstalling the WLAN card from
 device manager and re-installing it by doing "Scan for HW changes" to bring the device back. After that I am able to join WiFi network and WiFi stays on until I put computer to sleep or reboot, then the issue always comes back.<br />

            Any ideas how to move ahead with resolution? It is very annoying to everytime uninstall the adapter, re-install it and then enter WPA-PSKs again etc.
