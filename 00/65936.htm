    <title>3.5mm front panel headphone jack broken&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluecew  say:</h3>
<h2>            3.5mm front panel headphone jack broken&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday my speakers were working fine. Today i just turned on my PC and noticed a x symbol on the volume button down in the taskbar. I clicked to troubleshoot it, but there was no option to troubleshoot the front panel, only the rear panel ones. I tried
 unplugging and replugging. Tried restarting my computer. I troubleshooted it again, there was still no option. I played some audio, there was no sound coming out of my speakers. Then i unplugged the speakers and tried it with different headphones. I played
 some audio but couldn't hear anything through my headphones. My computer is only 2 years old. I have not installed or updated anything in the last couple of days. I tried all the jacks in the rear panel and the computer can detect them. I tried both front
 panel USB 3.0 ports and the computer can also detect them. The computer can also detect the microphone port, too. But what is weird is when i tried plugging the speakers into the mic port, the system auto-detects it as a speaker and it works! Only the headphone
 jack is non-functional. So will there be harm if i keep using the mic port as speakers, or do i have to fix the headphone port and use that instead (like before)?
</p>
<p>I have no idea how to replace a PC part, what should i do?</p>

<p>If you've already tried this very obvious step I apologise, but check the speakers aren't just muted. Left click on the volume/speaker icon and see what it's set to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the keyboard's function keys is probably a mute button and could well have been pressed by accident. I've done it myself more than a few times.</p>

            did you even look at the pictures? the icon clearly has a red x, NOT A WHITE X. A white x means its muted. Red x means theres a problem with the sound. I have a red x.

            Hello Bluecew
<br />
<br />That issue can happen if the audio driver is damaged or the operating system driver for that feature. I recommend download audio driver for that motherboard and install it or reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Let me know the result.
<br />
<br />Have great day

<h2>            Windows 10 new version update</h2>
                    My Windows 10 device keeps trying to update to the new version of windows 10 but fails during the install at around 40-60%. It then restores my previous version but keeps re-attempting this is driving me nuts as it takes ages anyhow. How can I stop the
 install from going round in circles or do I need to find an alternative to windows 10.

<p>Had mine failing at 45% (also failing at 75% and81% if upgrading via ISO disc) and I eventually found it was caused by the Wi-Fi card plugged into my PC. I unplugged the Wi-Fi card (when PC was powered down) and it upgraded ok on the next upgrade attempt</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;My Wi-Fi card on my Zoostorm PC showed Ralink in device manager ((Addon is also shown on the card itself &amp; the model number is NWP200Ev4). Other threads mention Amtel Wi-Fi cards (may be fitted to some Gateway PC's)causing the same problem.</span></p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If you’re trying to import the Excel table into Yahoo finance portfolio, then it could be an issue on the Yahoo website's end. Just to ask, have you already contacted them to know how to export the stock portfolio into an Excel spreadsheet?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, you may try to do this with the use of </span><strong>Excel's Data menu</strong>. Choose
<strong>Get External Data &gt; Run Saved Query</strong> to run one of the samples or select From Access, From Web or From Text options:</p>

    <title>Skype for Business On-Premise communication with Skype consumer not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> woodytim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business On-Premise communication with Skype consumer not working.</h2>
                    <p>I've set up a Skype for Business on-premise server and gotten federation working with O365 Skype users. Now I need the on-premise users to communicate with "consumer" or "regular" Skype. By this I mean the original Skype that existed before Microsoft bought
 it and turned it into SFB. As if this problem wasn't "ungoogleable" enough as it is, MS calls this setup "Skype Connectivity" which is couldn't be more ambiguous and confusing when looking for help. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/deploy/deploy-skype-connectivity)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found some other instructions (https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/canitpro/2015/11/09/step-by-step-skype-connectivity-configuration-with-on-premise-skype-for-business-2015/) and followed them, but I still get an error when I try to IM from SFB on-premise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I add a contact by their email address I get the contact, but it says "Presence unknown" next to the contact and when I try to IM I get the error: "This message wasn't sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** due to company policy." When I try to IM the other direction
 from consumer Skype to SFB I get no error, but the IM doesn't go through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding the user in the format&nbsp;name(example.com)@msn.com, but that didn't help either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the topology settings set up for Skype-to-Skype federation and Skype search on the edge server.</p>
<p>I have the SIP Federated Provider and the External Access Policy set up in the Skype for Business 2015 Control Panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is some more information:</p>

<p>Hi WoodyTim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure both user's username are on each other's contact list. This will allow them to instant message each other. If the Skype for Business user's username cannot be added into Skype consumer
 contact list, please try following workarounds and check if the issue persists: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)Let the Skype consumer user to go to web.skype.com to add the Skype for Business user to his contact list.</p>
<p>2)Or let the Skype consumer user to use the Skype consumer mobile client to add the Skype for Business user to his contact list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I'd like to gather following information to better help you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.May I ask what your deployment is? Skype for Business pure on-prem or hybrid?</p>
<p>2.Did the issue happen to every Skype consumer contacts or just single users?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<p>Hi Leo,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't a problem adding the user, but it shows up in the contact list as "Presence unknown" and IMs don't go through. To answer your other questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The deployment is pure on-prem in the sense that all of my users are on-premise on our local sserver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I only have two "regular" Skype users in my contacts, but neither of them work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi WoodyTim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If both sides have already been added as a contact in each other's contact list and the issue persists, my suggestion is contacting our dedicated Skype for Business on-prem forum to further look into
 the issue. We have different support teams to handle this kind of questions and our team mainly focus on Skype for Business hybrid and online questions. If you have further questions regarding Skype for Business hybrid/online, please don't hesitate to let
 us know and we are pleased to provide further help. </p>

                    I have setup a network bridge between my wireless network card and a local LAN port on my motherboard, I have my xbox connected to the LAN port and the wireless card has the connection to the internet.&nbsp; It all works as expected and I have full access to
 the internet on the PC and xbox.&nbsp; The issues occurs when I put my PC to sleep then wake the system, the wireless connection is working as expected and can see my router but the Network bridge does not re-connect, I have to disable the bridge then enable it
 again before it will work..<br />
The same setup of Vista worked without issue.

<p>I'm having the same problem as you, I'm trying to use my laptop to connect my Xbox 360 to my wireless network. It works just fine, only I have to disable and then re-enable either the MAC Bridge Miniport or Local Area Connection after every standby resume
 before it will work again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed that I cannot even ping the Xbox until one of these actions is performed, I do not think it's actually a problem with the Network bridge, but with the ethernet connection (Marvell Yukon 88E8038 PCI-E Fast Ethernet Controller for me). I agree
 that I believe it to be an OS issue though since I also don't encounter the problem with ICS but then cannot have Open NAT status for the 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An obvious workaround is a script that you can run to disable and re-enable the Local Area Connection, does anyone at least have an easy way to do that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually I think I just solved the problem by doing the exact opposite of what I've seen as the proposed solution several other places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open the Device Manager</p>
<p>2. Select Network Adapters, find your ethernet card, right-click on it and go to Properties</p>
<p>3. Click on the Power Management tab.</p>
<p>4. Make sure the "Allow the Computer to turn off this device to save power" box IS CHECKED</p>
<p>5. Apply the settings and click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DONE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps you.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
I understand that you are facing issues using Modern UI interphase. Please follow the methods and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1:<br />
Check in safe mode and Perform clean boot.</div>
<div>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows
 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />
Clean Boot Notes:<br />
•&nbsp;You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot.<br />
•&nbsp;Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still
 exists.<br />
•&nbsp;If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to change the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft
 support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
I suggest you to try the steps provided, in the link below in order to perform a clean boot on your computer.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></div>
<div><br />
Method 2:<br />
Uninstall and Reinstall Graphics Drivers. Follow the below steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click on Start. A menu will come up.<br />
2.&nbsp;On this menu, click "Control Panel".<br />
3.&nbsp;Find the icon that says "System", and click it.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click on the "Hardware" tab.<br />
5.&nbsp;Click on the Device Manager" tab.<br />
6.&nbsp;Scroll down to the "Display Adapter" and click on it. A menu will pop up.<br />
7.&nbsp;On this menu, click the "driver" tab.<br />
8.&nbsp;Click "Uninstall".<br />
9.&nbsp;After Uninstalling reinstall Graphics Drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 3:<br />
Use the system File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.</div>
<div>Follow the below link:</div>
<div><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</span></a></div>

            In my previous version Windows 7, I was able to 'select all' e.g. when wanting to delete multiple emails - this function is missing from W10 -&nbsp;as has the facility to tick one email, then whilst pressing the 'shift' key, use the down or up arrow key to
 tick multiple emails...

<h2>            Whats happening to IMAP servers last 3 days&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using WLM2012 to access 1 Outlook.com account,&nbsp;3 Hotmail.com accounts, and 1 Gmail. Gmail OK. Outlook and Hotmail accounts started 'Checking mail' forever, especially at 'Inbox',&nbsp;until an error message saying IMAP server not responding. Last 3 days, sometimes
 it will download headers for new email, and sometimes it will download new messages only after repeated tries. Today zero new emails are downloaded...only headers. Constant error messages saying IMAP server not responding or the server has terminated the connection.</p>

            <p>I wish there were more users like you documenting these difficulties rather than just complaining about them. Since you're quoting PDT times, I assume you're in the same time zone as MSFT Redmond. I'm not experiencing the same problems over here in England,
 so I have to rely on observant users elsewhere to keep us informed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks as if there is some throttling going on, for whatever reason. You might be able to avoid it by trying a different set of IMAP servers, e.g. those named
<strong>outlook.office365.com</strong>. Just enter that instead of imap-mail.outlook.com on the
<em>Servers</em> tab of the account's properties dialogue.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Mouse pointer starts moving on its own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rajfx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Mouse pointer starts moving on its own</h2>
                    <p>I had installed Windows 10 in August - almost immediately my (Wireless - Anker) Mouse pointer started moving in the vertical direction! I tried &nbsp;lots of things -and ultimately got fed up and went back to Windows 8!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping a series of bug fixes would have stabilized Windows 10 - I once again upgraded! The problem does seem alleviated a bit- though its after about an hour - the pointer starts moving on its own - AGAIN! This time in the horizontal direction! Sometimes,
 the pointer seems fine for a day and then does this !</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone know of this and how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>feel Windows still in beta - albiet somewhat polished beta! Am wondering if I should just roll back to Windows 8 until June to upgrade (just before the free upgrade offer expires -in hope that the irritants would be resolved by then)?</p>

<p>I replied to his original suggestion just to eliminate that non-helpful tract - was hoping to get some sort of developer input since I assume MS would be wanting to fix a lot of these issues with W10 with the community instead of boiler plate responses that
 don't help :( ! Sadly, got another boiler plate response "Scan for driver changes", "Run Anti Virus", "Clean your temporary drive" ! When I read these suggestion from a "Support Specialists" - I know that I've hit &nbsp;a brick wall! :(</p>

<p>Ok I might have found the potential problem! I use a gaming peripheral called Saitek's HOTAS (its a flight stick). I noticed whenever I fire up games that use this - the problem tends to occur ! (though many times AFTER I've ended the gaming session and
 hours after that sometimes).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This particular Saitek model called X52 also has a mouse controller built it (I never use it) - during a session a few mins back - I noticed my mouse pointer started moving again ! But for the heck of it - I tried using the controller's mouse &nbsp;and immediately
 the problem stopped! (I just moved the mouse for 1 sec).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could be a driver conflict with Saitek's HOTAS drivers perhaps? anyways, I'm not able to uninstall the drivers in W10 (cant even find them). After this, my W10 froze again - and I've decided to roll back to W8.1!</p>
<p>Hope someone in the Dev community reads this and fixes it !</p>

            <p>I've experienced similar problems and tried to switch mice, reinstall drivers and buying new glasses.</p>
<p>I tried to observe the circumstances involved and it seems that the issue (also) occurs when Word (just Word) repaints the screen (for unknown reasons). IMHO, this is related to the earlier painting issue where indents were sometimes not observed or random
 garbage appeared on the screen until a forced repaint (click the Paragraph icon). It seems to be triggered when scrolling with the wheel but once I take my hand off the mouse and begin to type, Word does a repaint after a few seconds.</p>

</p><p>Any clues in the Event log?&nbsp; FWIW supposedly my Surface video driver is crashing occasionally but I usually get a message window about that.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in W8.1&nbsp;I used to see the opposite of the OP's symptom description where it seemed that the pointer would occasionally be dragged down to the bottom of the window on its own.&nbsp; I thought it might be caused by contention for the pointer, e.g. each
 pointer device seeing the other moving the pointer and thinking that it would need to do it too.&nbsp; My workaround for that was to use Mousekeys to move it in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Usually that stopped it.</p>

<h2>            Windows updates have killed my Remote Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I use remote desktop a lot at home, and after today's batch of Win 10 updates suddenly I can't connect to any of my other home PCs. They're running Win 7 by the way which has never been a problem before. I did a search and found some gobbledygook about CredSSP
 updates supposedly fixing a vulnerability in the RDC but I have no idea what I'm supposed to do to get things working again.</p>
<p>As a last resort I'm going to have to uninstall all those updates, unless someone on here knows what's going on?</p>

            Could be a number of reasons why this stops working.
<br />Most to do with firewall changes and updates can do that.
<br />To test theory first, turn off all firewalls on your machine just to test.
<br />Also antivirus.
<br />
<br />Follow the suggestions below in the link as that is what i would have do anyway.
<br />Also reboot your modem first let it come up and then reboot your machines.

    <title>Windows 7 Update won&#39;t stop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Update won&#39;t stop</h2>
                    I was trying to upgrade my Windows 7 to 10 but when I did it kept getting stuck on looking for updates towards the end. I stopped the process and decided to just check for updates for Windows 7 before upgrading to 10 as I couldn't find a way around it.
 I set updates to never and could not skip the process. Now I have been looking for updates for Windows 7 for roughly 26-27 hours and it has yet to stop. Any suggestions would be appreciated as I am at a loss.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Joann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;suggest you follow the below methods and check if it helps</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>

<h2>            Thinkpad X380 Yoga&#58; Tablet Mode doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Thinkpad X380 Yoga as a work issue computer which was sent to me November 2018.&nbsp; When I got it I could easily navigate from Desktop to tablet mode and back.&nbsp; However tablet mode no longer works.&nbsp; I try flipping the screen over to enter tablet
 mode and the touchscreen stops working as if it's frozen.&nbsp; I will still get a notification box asking if I'd like to switch to tablet mode however I can't get that prompt to go away.&nbsp; I can try to click 'ok' with mixed results.&nbsp; Sometimes the prompt goes away
 but it always comes right back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference I can think of is in early December my company forced an update to Windows 10 Enterprise however numerous internet searches haven't confirmed any link between a windows update and my specific issue.&nbsp; I have searched my system for any
 available lenovo updates and I think I've done them all.&nbsp; I'm not an IT expert but the only thing I can think of now is a manufacturer reboot, which I would like to avoid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other recommendations would be extremely appreciated.&nbsp; -- Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Hyper Terminal&#47;ProCommPlus</h2>
                    I was going to buy a New Lap Top for my personal use at my job. I need Hyper Terminal to dial into modems and direct connect to other devices. Why did'nt MicroSoft include this in Windows 7?&nbsp; Can I load Procom Plus?&nbsp; Otherwise I will have to get another
 XP machine.&nbsp; This is such a simple program a think it should have been included. :(

            Skype number is a way to go for you. You will be given one number which people can call from their mobile / landline and you receive the call in Skype client (Computer, phone or tablet). Hence your device needs to be connected to internet to receive calls. 
<br />
<br />Q. Will it be strictly a wi-fi call number or a cellular call number as well?
<br />A. Strictly internet not cellular call number
<br />

 (finding?) the drivers that will allow me to access the external SD card on the phone so that I can transfer music/files. Thanks!

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Uninstall and reinstall USB controller drivers and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps:<br />
a. Click Start, right-click on Computer and select Properties.<br />
b. Go to Device Manager.<br />
c. Click on View and click on Show Hidden devices. Navigate to Universal Bus Controllers“, right-click on it and choose “Uninstall” for all the USB<br />
devices listed there.<br />
d. After the un-installation, click “Action – Scan for hardware changes”.<br />
e. Install the device again.<br />
f. Reboot the computer and see how it works.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><span><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: Do not uninstall the USB controllers for your mouse and keyboard.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Visit this link to download the drivers for Samsung Captivate:<br />

<p>Over the past several months, I have been building an underwater world&nbsp;on a seed that is over 99% ocean (the seed started with only two oak trees on a tiny island).&nbsp; While the seed was perfect for underwater construction on a massive scale, it meant that
 I had to forgo many items/blocks that simply didn't exist on the map, including jungle trees, cocoa pods, vines, spruce trees, birch trees, and cactus.&nbsp; Since I play exclusively in Survival, there was no way to add those&nbsp;things to my world.&nbsp; That has now all
 changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many already know, if you create your game with bonus chests on, a bonus chest will appear in your spawn area that is impossible to get rid of.&nbsp; You can destroy it, but it will respawn when you next load the game.&nbsp; This allows you to farm bonus chest
 items, since everytime you destroy the chest, save and reload, the chest will reappear with more items.&nbsp; Rather than being a boon, however, for most of the game's history, this has been more of a nuisance, since the objects in the bonus chests were of little
 value once you got your economy up and running--no one really wants to farm&nbsp;wooden pickaxes.&nbsp; In the latest update, however, the developers have greatly expanded the assortment of items that can be found in a bonus chest.&nbsp; In so doing, they have used the "bonus
 chest" mechanism&nbsp;to provide players with access to many new items that were added in prior updates, but which were previously unaccessible to players without abandoning their old world.&nbsp; Items now available in bonus chests include: jungle saplings, cocoa pods,
 birch saplings, spruce saplings, oak saplings, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, cactus, red mushrooms, brown mushrooms, potatoes, and carrots.&nbsp; This is in addition to the items that have always existed in bonus chests--wooden tools (and a few stone tools), wooden
 planks, wooden sticks, oak wood, and apples.&nbsp; The items available in bonus chests is random and changes each time you destroy the chest and reload the game.&nbsp; For example, I found jungle saplings the&nbsp;first time to tried this after the latest updates, but it
 took me 10-12 tries before I was able to obtain the birch sapling--the last one I was missing.&nbsp; While I've not found vines in the bonus chest, I expect I should be able to obtain them by groawing the jungle saplings.&nbsp; There are still a host of items/blocks
 I don't have access to in my world (i.e., lily pads, snow, ice, ocelots, wolves, and circle stone brick), but the bonus chest has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me.&nbsp; Since I know that there are many Survivalists playing on older seeds and
 may not have access to jungle trees, melons, etc., I thought it would be helpful to alert everyone to this great new resource.</p>
