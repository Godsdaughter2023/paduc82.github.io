            You need to move the data from the .pst file to the local folder.<br />

Outlook Mac only imports .pst files.<br />
<br />
Tip: If you import any PST files in the future, create a new Identity to import the file. Some users have lost all data after importing a PST file. Once you verify the imported file is OK, under File &gt; Export select to export as .olm file. Import this file
 into your Main Identity. <br />

<h2>            Word 2010 web view vs edit mode</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a word 2010 document. &nbsp;It is a doc saved on a shared drive. &nbsp;My boss made changes to the doc while in web view mode. &nbsp;When I went in to do additional edits I could not see his changes. &nbsp;I had to go to web view mode to change what he entered.
 &nbsp;Why is this and how can this be corrected? &nbsp;</p>

            If the document is opening in Read Mode, you won't be able to edit it unless you go to Print Layout view (you can press ESC to exit Read Mode and return to Print Layout). At File | Options | General, clear the option to "Open e-mail attachments and other
 uneditable files in reading view" and see if that helps.

    <title>Windows 7 and Facebook games. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark chevalier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 and Facebook games.</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 - 64 on a Dell Studio 17. 8gb ram, I7 quad-4 processor and an ATI Mobile Radeon HD 4650. All of my drivers are up to date, including Radeon's CCC and Flash.&nbsp;Everything appears to be working properly except for Facebook games like MyTown.
 When I open to full screen mode my screen blacks out, blinks back on at moments in white, or inverts the colors like looking at a negative, or enlarges my mouse pointer. In the end the only option I have is to reboot the machine.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this problem? Is there a fix?</p>

<p>Hey Mark,</p>
<p>Since you claim that the drivers are upto date, I'd want to have a look on whether Internet Explorer is likely causing the issue.</p>
<p>Since you also mentioned that except for facebook games, everything else appears to be fine, I'd consider that you've crosschecked with other online games that require flashplayer.</p>
<p>If not, give it a shot.</p>
<p>If the issue is only with respect to Facebook games, it could be that another add-on is conflicting with the flashplayer that is installed.</p>
<p>Run the Manage add-ons tool in Internet Explorer to figure out what add-ons are installed and which one is conflicting with the flashplayer.</p>
<p>Ensure that you don't disable flashplayer as it is required to play facebook games.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><strong>Using Manage Add-ons in Internet Explorer<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Internet-Explorer-Add-on-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Internet-Explorer-Add-on-Manager</strong></a></p>
<p>Once you figure out the issue, you may either keep the add-on disabled or remove it from the system depending on your convenience.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I'd suggest uninstalling Adobe flashplayer as it could have gone bad.</p>
<p>Get the latest flashplayer from:<br />
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/</strong></a></p>
<p>Could be the Java as well. Get the latest Java from</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some video card drivers do not permit you to change settings.<br />

<h2>            OneNote 2013 Insert File Printout Overlap</h2>
                    When I try to insert more than one file printout (pdf format) to one page, the second one tends to overlap the first and so on. How can I overcome this issue? I do not want file printouts on multiple pages either.

                    I recently deleted a contact from my address book, but the contact remove itself. Upon further research I found that it is an old skype contact linked to my Microsoft account. I went to the skype program and deleted them, but the contact info still won't
 disappear. How can I fix this permanently?

            Please note that once you deleted a Contact it should no longer show as Online on your end. Make sure you have removed the person on your Contact list. Simply follow the steps below.
<br />
<br />1. Sign in to Skype for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />2. In your contact list, find the contact you want to remove. Right-click the contact name and select Remove from Contacts. The contact is removed from your contact list but will still appear in the Recent tab with a question mark.
<br />

</p><p>This was one of the first steps I took. Unfortunately although the contact has been removed from my skype list, it still appears in my outlook.com people contact list as a skype contact. The issue is that it is an old phone number so it keeps trying to override

            My e-mail account type is Microsoft Office Outlook 2007.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I randomly put out this same question on google, and someone said to try and start Outlook in the Safe Mode and then I would be able to delete the e-mail file folders that way.&nbsp; Simple
 explanation and it worked.&nbsp; What I don't understand is why it happened in the first place.&nbsp; Microsoft Office Outlook seems to have a lot of problems as far as I can see with being very slow sometimes, and quite often shutting down for no reason at all, and
 then the problem I had with just trying to delete a simple file folder from my list of e-mail folders.&nbsp; Why it leaves a mesasge saying the folder is full and cannot be deleted or renamed, I still don't know, and to be truthful this site was not much help.&nbsp;

            <p>One thing that causes the &lt;Folder is Full&gt; message is a corrupted view - simply resetting the existing view in the folder to &lt;default&gt; rectifies the problem in many cases without having to restart Outlook. Even though the error message is encountered - you
 can still go to the O'2007 menu bar </p>
<p>View --&gt; Current View --&gt; Customize Current View --&gt; Reset Current View</p>
<p>We've encountered this issue several times with customer pst files sent to us and attempting to change the view on the data. Other times, the issue occurs when constant changes are made with custom forms and changing views on data using the custom form.
 Or to put it another way - there's no singular definitive cause - leastwise none that is apparent and the only way something like that is going to get fixed is if an "offending scenario" can be replicated and the issue traced since from what we've seen - it
 appears to be data related in some fashion with the end result being the view has become corrupted.</p>

            <p>In order to get help in a forum you must first provide some information. You provided none. You still haven't. There is no such mail account type as "Outlook 2007." The only way to figure out what your specific problem was would have been to know what type
 of account and data file you are using and what steps preceded the problem. Here are some guidelines to help you use forums more effectively:&nbsp;

<h2>            All of a sudden, I can&#39;t open any of my existing word files, and nothing works.... &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    Everything worked fine until yesterday, and today, all of a sudden, I can't open any of my existing word files. I use Window 8, and now reinstalled Office Home trial version (thinking that my office had issues). I tried everything that was suggested here,
 but my documents still give me error messages, saying some part of my documents are missing, and that my documents are corrupt. I tried Safe mode (which didn't work) and Open and Repair option wouldn't open the files either. I can still open a new document...
 but none of the&nbsp;existing ones.... Could anyone please help me with this? Did I really lose ALL of my documents? :(

    <title>Lumia 950 volume drops to zero - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ga99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 volume drops to zero</h2>
                    <p>I have a new 950 and it has this problem with volume when I'm listening to Groove tunes with headphones. The volume periodically drops to zero and I cannot increase it. It's like the down volume button is stuck. Rebooting the phone does not correct it, which
 makes me think it's a hardware issue. Then just as suddenly it works again. This happens nearly every time I listen to music.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this? Otherwise, the phone is great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>George</p>

            <p>Same thing happened on my 920. Was hoping the 950 would fix it. Nope, same problem. In my case I have to reboot the phone to get the volume back. I'm using Yurbuds with the mike and volume control.

<p>
</p><p>Also, I have the 29 update and still can't get Yurbuds Bluetooth to work. Worked fine on my 920.</p>

<p>I suggest you download these three apps:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CCleaner</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AdwCleaner</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Malwarebytes
 Free</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First install and run <strong>CCleaner</strong> at default settings to clear out temporary files, cookies, etc. It'd be good to delete old system restore points, as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do that in CCleaner by choosing <strong>Tools</strong> - System Restore. Delete each of them.&nbsp;<strong>Note</strong>: the latest will be greyed out, so you can't delete it, which is good. It gives you one to go back to, if need be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next run <strong>AdwCleaner</strong>. It doesn't require an install and will create log files into a newly created AdwCleaner folder at top of your Windows drive, usually C. It'll reboot your system.</p>
<p>Install <strong>Malwarebytes</strong> and check for updates. Run a full scan, which will take awhile.
<br />
<br />
Post back if you have any questions, or problems. Let us know if it doesn't seem to be cleaned up.</p>

<p>You didn't pay a cent for your OVI Mail account, you got it for free as a bonus with your phone. You can't complain at that price!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need professional e-mail support then you need to go with a professional e-mail service provider that bundles support in the cost. A pro account with gmail for example comes to mind.</p>

            @excelse I'm in same situation as you. Lesson learn is either use a yahoo or gmail account for personal emails. When is the last time you heard those services going down. Personally it's service like this makes you want to get a iphone.

<h2>            WordArt picture or texture fill is missing word 2016</h2>
                    Hi. I suddenly realized (just when you need it and it's not there) that Word 2016 seems to have dropped the option for a picture or texture fill for WordArt. Am I missing something?

            Hi BJosephs, 
<br />
<br />It's there. When selecting the word art, you'll see the Format content ribbon which has Fill options.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c53cc769-85dc-4151-b9f3-4b0328b86635?upload=true" />

<p>This is complex. You are not missing anything. What you are referring to are controls that were there in Word 97-2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For WordArt created in Word 2013 or later neither picture fill nor texture are available. The controls that Diane is showing will control the textbox containing the WordArt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Add-In that can give you access to these controls, but only in documents that are in Word 2010 compatibility mode. If the .docx format is from Word 2013 or later, you lose those controls, although not necessarily the WordArt already formatted.
 (That depends on the WordArt.)</p>
<p><a href="http://addbalance.com/word/download.htm#WordArtAddIn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2003 WordArt Add-In for 2010-2019 (365)</a>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, this is in compatibility mode. It is using the picture or texture foreground.</p>
<p>Here is the same thing not in compatibility mode. (Converted to Word 365)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://addbalance.com/word/download.htm#WordArtAddIn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02faeee6-7b44****-845f-9aacb9401122?upload=true" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The text has lost its picture and neither picture nor texture are available. The texture and picture controls for shape will give background to the textbox that holds the WordArt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These all were added to ribbon version documents using my Add-In for legacy WordArt. It retains some of the function of the old in Word 2019l365 but it is hit or miss.</p>
<p><a href="http://addbalance.com/word/download.htm#WordArtAddIn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2003 WordArt Add-In for 2010-2019 (365)</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Word 2010, you can add the WordArt using the Add-In and edit it the same as you could before. Such a document can be saved and used in Word 2019 and as far as I know it will work but editing in Word 2019/365 may not be feasible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible, using a macro, to back-convert a document created by later versions to Word 2010 .docx format.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It requires the following in a macro or in the immediate window.</p>

<p>Thanks, Charles, for your thorough answer. The funny thing is that Powerpoint 2016 still has the option</p>
<p>I&nbsp; would have thought that it uses the same graphics engine/controls as Word:</p>

            Hi Mark, "Workbook Sharing" feature is a legacy feature which isnt supported on iOS. If you want to access the same file being open in Desktop and open in iOS you will need to be on the Office Insider Fast builds where we have Co-authoring enabled for
 Excel Desktop. In case you dont want to move to Office Insider, you can also open the same file on Excel Online and iOS and edit at the same time. But for co-authoring with Excel Desktop you will need to wait till the feature is made generally available on
 Office 365 builds.&nbsp;

<h2>            &#91;Hybrid&#93; On-prem user asked for credentials when attempting to view O365 user calendar</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: Hybrid between Office 365 and Exchange 2013 CU7. Using AADSync with password sync.</p>

<p>I have the following issue... When an on-premise user attempts to view the calendar of an user that has been migrated to office 365 the on-prem user gets prompted for the credentials of the office 365 user. If the on-prem user hits cancel the calendar of
 the O365 user displays just fine.</p>
<p>Some other scenarios that I've tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-prem to on-prem works just fine. </li><li>O365 to on-prem works just fine. </li></ul>


<p>What can I do to solve this? I've searched and validated my config and I still have the issue.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi GonzoO365,</p>
<p>About “<em>When an on-premise user attempts to view the calendar of an user that has been migrated to office 365</em>”, I’d like to confirm how on-premise user tries to view Office 365 calendar. Do you mean on-premise user uses Outlook client -&gt; open another
 calendar -&gt; browse the Office 365 user in GAL -&gt; Open Office 365 calendar?</p>
<p>If so, open cross-premise calendar folder is not the officially supported scenario, as it requires cross-premise permission. Cross-premises permission scenarios are not supported:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200581(v=exchg.150).aspx#considerations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>In hybrid environment, the supported scenario to view cross-premise calendar free/busy information is to use
<strong>Scheduling Assistant</strong> in Outlook client or OWA. This is served by the availability service in the hybrid server and don’t require mailbox folders to be opened.</p>
<p>Here are 2 related threads:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/p/185929/542979#542979</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/t/318012</p>
<p>If this is not your situation, could you provide the detailed steps of your local Exchange environment and how you open Office 365 calendar? So that I can do further research and tests for you. For example,</p>
<p>1. Is it pure Exchange 2013 environment, or Exchange 2007/2010 + Exchange 2013?</p>
<p>2. Does the issues occur when on-premise user uses <strong>Scheduling Assistant</strong> to view Office 365 user’s free/busy?</p>
<p>3. etc…</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>The scenario in full is this...</p>
<p>Lets say I have 2 users... *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, I have synced both users using AADSync, I migrated *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to Office 365 and everything went smooth... Now, when I attempt to view the calendar of *** Email address is removed for privacy *** using
 Oulook 2010/2013 with the profile of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, User2 gets asked for the credentials of User1, obviously User1 does not know the credentials of User2 so the only option is to click cancel. When User1 hits cancel the calendar of User2 displays just
 fine but if User1 wants to view any other date the same thing happens when it is updating the User2´s calendar.</p>
<p>The way User1 one is viewing User2´s calendar is: switch to the calendar tab, click open calendar from address book, select User2 and then open.</p>
<p>When I do the same using OWA it does not happen.</p>
<p>To answer the questions:</p>
<p>1. Exchange 2010 HUB/CAS/MBX, Exchange 2013 CU7 as the hybrid servers.</p>
<p>2. It is kinda intermittent because I just tested it and I wasn't asked for credentials but I remeber being asked for credentials.
</p>
<p>To be clear, this behavior is expected in this particular scenario (AADSync with password sync and no ADFS/SSO), right?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi GonzoO365,</p>
<p>You’re correct that the scenario you described is by default behavior.</p>
<p>As @Young has mentioned before, the cross-premises permissions are not officially supported in an Exchange based hybrid deployment, even though sometimes it may work. Currently to view the cross-premise calendar free/busy information, it’s recommended that
 we use the <b>Scheduling Assistant</b>&nbsp;in Outlook client or OWA, your understanding is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi gonzoo365,</p>
<p>here is an article that states cross-premises permission is not officially supported:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200581(v=exchg.150).aspx#considerations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>This is an excellent idea to help improve the quality of your product.</p>
<p>Besides getting unit tested which, otherwise hardly a chance effort made by your group, it will help people feel good by converting their frustrations that come with frequent crashes/hangs and replace it with some incentives (lollipop) and think of me who
 wants to make some easy money.</p>
<p>Overall its a Win-Win idea!</p>

    <title>Publisher error when trying to open a file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Publisher error when trying to open a file</h2>
                    <p>I created a website in Pub 2002 - everything was going swimingly until I tried to open the Pub file today to make some changes. I got an error in both Pub 2002 and 2007. I found this article:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928890/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928890/en-us</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I used the Fix It tool which by the way is VERY COOL. It did fix it for Pub 2002, but not 2007. I can live with that. But now when I open the file every time, I get that warning before I can open it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried doing a save as, I thought that might fix the problem, but I still get the error message. My question is, how do I find and fix whatever the problem is in the file that's causing the problem in the first place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>In 2007 it won't open still, and it says: "Publisher has detected a problem in the file you are trying to open. To protect your computer, Publisher will not open the file." When I hit CTRL SHIFT I, I see that it's error 1100931.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Pub 2002 (which is what I use more and created it in), I get, "Publisher has detected a problem in the file you are trying to&nbsp; open. If you are certain that this file came from a trusted source and does not contain harmful information, click ok&gt; If you
 received this file from another person or machine and are not sure that the contents are safe, click Cancel."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I click OK, and it opens fine, but my concern is what on earth is in this file that's causing the problem to start with - there's no script, I started with another pub file, deleted all but the first page of that, used it as a template and started from there
 - that original&nbsp;file opens fine. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary (I probably have 40 of these files), and now I get these strange errors... I don't want to do a lot of work and not be able to open it one day and that message makes me nervous.</p>
<p>Thanks for polishing up your crystal ball on this one.</p>

            Hmmm, I don't remember Publisher XP too well but I *think* there are some settings under Options about Security.&nbsp; Please look at see what you see there...&nbsp; That is probably the place you have to fix that part.&nbsp; As for Publisher 2010, where is the file
 you are trying to open?&nbsp; On your Desktop ot in your Documents folder?

            <p>I couldn't find anything about Security unfortunately. And just to clarify, it's Pub 2007, not 2010. I had installed 2010 until I discovered the removed the web options, so I went back to 2007... But I found that 2002 actually is easier to work with web
 files in for some strange reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there something in 2007 that would "fix" a file? Maybe I could edit the registry for 2007 so it'll open the file, then fix it there, then go back to working on it in 2002?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Did you make any changes to the file in Publisher 2007?&nbsp; And, there is no *fix*, something got corrupted and the trick is to figure out what that is.</p>
<p>Just to be clear... which version do you want to work?</p>
<p>As for web options... the reason it's getting harder is because it is removed from Publisher 2010 completely.&nbsp; In 2007 you could still kind of *work* with them.&nbsp; Which is something you might want to take under consideration going forward.</p>

            <p>I want to work in 2002. I did not open it nor make changes in 2007. I took an existing 2002 website 2002 pub file, opened it, deleted all but the first page (this site opens fine btw), used this page 1 as a template to start a new web file from, added about
 4 more pages, no outside code, saved it, dumped it to htm, posted it, closed it. Then when I came back to open it is when I got the error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think I'll switch to 2007 because some of the stuff I've been doing doesn't work in 2007 so I hope I can stick with 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just would like to find and learn from what went wrong in this file. </p>

            <p>I am stumped...&nbsp; Did you confirm that the Registry Key is in place?</p>
<p>What went wrong was the Update from Microsoft... seems it *broke* something and it's not likely to be fixed as that version is no longer supported.</p>
<p>You say you have no code but then you say *all the stuff it's doing doesn't work in 2007*, what stuff?</p>

            <p>I think I found a work-around. My main concern was that down the road I don't have a problem with that file. So I started a completely new .pub file, copy and pasted the entire site into it and started over. The new file opens without the warning, so I presume
 that it's all good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I use code to for example make a link open in a new window - I didn't use it in this site. I also have a tool I run on the htm to center the website on the page - that doesn't work in 2007. I like to dump the files using the filter in 2002 and
 haven't found a way to do that in 2007... things like that is why I want to stay on 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think it was due to any updates as none of my other files were having this issue. I guess there was just something wonky in that one file and I'll never know what.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time to move on I guess. Thanks for your suggestion along the way, I'm always trying to learn more stuff!</p>

<p>Just a FYI. Publisher 2007 had full web functionality. It was only in Pub 2010 that MS started deprecating it and you could still edit web publications produced in earlier versions. Further you can still produce single HTML pages much as you can in Word.<br />

<h2>            Need help install tech preview 10074 and was updating then lest internet due to storm</h2>
                    <p>I was installing tech preview 10074 it was successful. The I went to see if their were updates under program settings updates. &nbsp;I chose fast for the options under developer tools. The I had to leave home so I left computer on when I got home my room mate
 said we lost internet due to storm he called ISP and got it reconnected. When I checked my computer the login screen was on the monitor and as I logged in I noticed the build was still 10047 and I could no longer access the start button in the bottom left
 corner. I went back to see if I could re initiate updates and the updates screen is gone, just a rotating circular dot appears. if there is any way to solve this without trashing my drive let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried reverting back to windows 8.1 under restore a previous version but it tells me all windows old files had been removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help is appreciated&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Auto-recharge suspended due to monthly limits being exceeded</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My Auto-recharge function on my Skype Credit balance has been "suspended", as I have apparently reached my monthly spending limit. I have used
 more credit in the past than I used this past month, and the message simply says "try later". All of my credit cards on file are valid and up to date. They also recommend setting up an alternative payment method "such as Pay Pal".&nbsp; Anyone know if 1) there's
 something I can do to use the system immediately 2) if Skype is intentionally trying to push consumers to the Pay Pal payment system?&nbsp; Thanks.</span><br />

                    My password stopped working for my Office 360 email account. As I am trying to update my password I'm realizing my alternate email address is incorrect - because of this I can't follow the verification steps and I am unsure how to correct it.

    <title>Problems replying to emails in outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjc_1969  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems replying to emails in outlook</h2>
                    <p>I use an outlook account (with a hotmail address) for work.&nbsp; For the last couple of days when I go to reply to an email as soon as I click to begin typing it saves the message as a draft and brings up the next email.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to go into drafts, answer the email, go back to the inbox, reapply the filter and repeat several hundred times.&nbsp; I am going crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does it on both my home computers and laptop but not computers that are not on my wifi network and not under my google account.&nbsp; It also happens if I use internet explorer not chrome.&nbsp; I have cleared the cache and restarted the computer and it is still
 happening.</p>

            Very Strange behavior does it also do it if you've opened you reply email in a secondary window to reply?
<br />Double click on the email and it will open in a secondary window then click reply from there. 
<br />Try opening email in a private browser. For IE CRTL and SHIFT KEYS while holding press the P. Put in the URL <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />If it works find using the private browser then problem is being caused by an extension within the browser. Happens when we download and install from the internet. 
<br />Just to be safe and make sure there is not some kind of Malware on your system.
<br />Download and run Adwcleaner by Malwarebytes.
<br />First save and close out of all applications as it will want to reboot system 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />Download and run. 
<br />I run it weekly even though I have an Antivirus installed. 
<br />Let me know the results please or if we need to troubleshoot further.
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

<p>As I said I can receive and send fine.&nbsp; What I cannot do is reply to an email without it immediately saving it as a blank draft and going to the next email in the in box.&nbsp; Over the past few days I have done a complete clean install of windows 10 (which cost
 me my copy of office that came with the computer thanks very much).&nbsp; This morning I could reply if I had a separate explorer window just for email and used Chome for everything else.&nbsp; It didn't work when I used explorer for everything and it was painfully
 slow and kept stopping working so I reinstalled Chrome so could at least get some work done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was two hours ago and now it is back doing the same thing again.</p>

<p>How can I be sure that site is reliable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No it doesn't (at this point in time) do it in a secondary window but surely a completely clean install of Windows 10 should have helped with that.&nbsp; One of my kids says he downloaded an autoclicker so he could have got a virus as well but it wasn't on this
 computer so it would have to be attached to my google account as it wasn't on this computer.</p>

            Thanks.&nbsp; It is actually worse now in that I don't get the chance to start typing before it goes to draft.&nbsp; I have tried clearing all caches I can find uninstalling Chome again in case it was a chrome issue and all things that are supposed to help but they
 don't seem to so I must be missing something.
