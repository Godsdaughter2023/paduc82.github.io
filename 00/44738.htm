<h2>            Games you&#39;re looking forward to...</h2>
                    
<p>It 's almost that time of year, and I'm personally looking forward to some awesome games coming up before Christmas.</p>
<p>Forza 4 - Everything shown so far looks amazing - think I'll nvest in the limited edition, which has some cool inclusions</p>
<p>Fifa 12 - Surprise, surprise, but this year's collision engine really looks awesome.</p>
<p>Skyrim - I've loved the Elderscrolls series since Morrowind, and this one looks set to define further the RPG genre again - Loving it!</p>
<p>What are you looking forward to over the next few months?</p>

<p>As for 2011 now I think about it the only game that's really peaked my interest is the Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, which looks fantastic.&nbsp; But there's also Halo: Anniversary Edition and FIFA 12 which I'll probably end up buying at some stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might look at renting Gears of War 3 simply because the multiplayer doesn't really excite me and I'm only interested in the solo campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp; Call of Duty and Battlefield 3 aren't really on my radar to be honest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I've got Oblivion &amp; Bioshock for the PC on their way from nzgameshop.com so I guess I'm looking forward to those?!

            <p>There are&nbsp;a lot coming up in just the next three months that I'm interested, let alone the holiday period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August on Games for Windows Live there is <strong>Age of Empires Online</strong> which will be free to play.&nbsp; I've always loved this series and the beta was great fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>September brings us <strong>Gears of War 3</strong>.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to the conclusion of the story but will probably spend some time with the multiplayer here too, another beta that was a hoot.&nbsp; Also interested in <strong>WarHammer 40K: Space Marine</strong> (<strong>Kill Team</strong> is pretty good and available on arcade now) and I'm also going to grab <strong>The Gunstriger</strong>.&nbsp; Keen to see how Twisted Pixel transition from arcade games to a retail title and it'll be a lead in for me for the Kinect titles coming around Xmas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October I want <strong>Batman: Arkham City</strong> (will probably get that on GFWL) and then <strong>Forza 4</strong> towards the end of the month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inbetween, I'm still picking up some older titles that I missed when they first came out.&nbsp; Lots of sales on at the moment.</p>

<p>Very true that, only a fortnight ago I managed to pick up Lost Planet 2 for the PC (but it has GFWL support) for only $10 from MightyApe.&nbsp; It's amazing how quickly games depreciate in value these days - it only released last year!&nbsp; One who refrains from
 purchasing their favourite game on release and waits for sales these days would do very well indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, on topic, I think I'll pick up one of the rugby games that are being released this year, albeit probably not on release (I'm not really buying into all the Rugby World Cup hype to be honest).&nbsp; However Rugby 06 was a great game back in the day so
 I'm definitely interested in a current-gen sequel!</p>

    <title>unable to uninstall updates in windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarahb_847  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to uninstall updates in windows 7</h2>
                    Version of Windows: 7 Home Premium, 64-bit OS (I don't see any service pack # when I look at Windows Edition under Computer--system properties. &nbsp;If there is somewhere else I should look, let me know)
<div>the problems (performance so slow I can't do anything) started after installing downloaded updates</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-update for MS OneNote 2010 (KB2553290)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-update for MS Office 2010 (KB2553310)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-update for MS Office 2010 (KB2553092)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-update for MS Office 2010 (KB2553270)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>when the computer starts in normal mode, it is EXTREMELY slow and I get various pop up messages like 'problem starting rundll'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried to do a system restore, but there is no system restore point. &nbsp;I have read that I can create a system restore point now, but I don't see how that will help me since I need one from a time before the updates were installed. &nbsp;Is there some way
 I can find such a system restore point that I don't see when I choose system restore?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried to uninstall the updates but see 'an unknown error occurred. &nbsp;the update could not be uninstalled.' &nbsp;Perhaps that is because I am in safe mode, but I can't uninstall in normal mode because I can't operate the computer in normal mode.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried using a microsoft support fix it tool to diagnose problems with windows updates. &nbsp;the result is</div>
<div>Issues found: &nbsp;Repair Windows Update components &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fix status: not fixed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did have a similar issue with a windows security update in the past. &nbsp;After installing that update (I don't have a record of the name/number of that update), I got countless messages about not able to run xxxx. &nbsp;That time, I went back one day with system
 restore.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My anti-virus program is Norton AntiVirus.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please tell me if you have any suggestions to either help me do a system restore or how to uninstall the windows updates. &nbsp;I would love to get back to using the computer in normal mode. &nbsp;Thank you very much!</div>
<div><br />

            <p>All Microsoft Windows operating systems ship with the System Restore component. System Restore enables the user to restore the computer and its programs to an earlier point in time. The System Restore component may be initiated through Windows, or may be
 run from the command line in Safe Mode. System Restore is very useful when troubles<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart your computer, and then press and hold F8 during the initial startup to start your computer in safe mode with a Command prompt.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the arrow keys to select the <strong>Safe mode with a Command prompt</strong> option.</li><li>If you are prompted to select an operating system, use the arrow keys to select the appropriate operating system for your computer, and then press ENTER.</li><li>Log on as an administrator or with an account that has administrator credentials.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <span>%systemroot%\system32\restore\rstrui.exe</span>, and then press ENTER.</li><li>Follow the instructions that appear on the screen to restore your computer to a functional state.</li></ol>

    <title>Streaming network quality problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdh5153  say:</h3>
<h2>            Streaming network quality problems</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to stream my living room Xbox One to my laptop, but I've been running into some pretty severe problems lately. It's worked flawlessly in the past, so I'm not sure what's going on now. The console is an Xbox One S, connected via ethernet cable to my Linksys WRT 1900 AC router. At first I was using WiFi on my laptop but it kept giving me the network quality problems warning on very high or high settings (I prefer to use very high to have it look as good as possible).</p>

<p>Figuring it must be some sort of interference with the WiFi I went out and grabbed a 25 foot cat 6 cable and hooked my laptop up to the router as well. I think it's even worse when connected via ethernet. It's become entirely unplayable, with terrible lag and artifacts all over the screen.</p>

<p>Is there some setting I could be missing to make for a better experience? I have 200mbps internet, and use a 5ghz WiFi network that is usually incredibly fast. I have a Steam Link in the bedroom over the same network and it works flawlessly over WiFi with no lag. I can also stream Steam games from my desktop to my laptop over the same network without any lag, so I feel like the problem is on the Xbox's end.</p>

<p>Any idea for how I can make this a better experience would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi MikeWeedon,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Task Manager &gt; See if there is any Skype process running. If yes, right click on it and disable.
<br />
<br />If this is Windows 10 Store Skype (v8 and v14 both will be written), then you can uninstall this app
<br />
<br />Uninstall - Windows Key+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below and paste into Powershell and Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Merging an offline account to a LIVE account</h2>
                    
<p>I've been playing XBox 360 for 3 years on an offline account. Recently, I got my XBox 360 online and got my XBox Live account on it, but all of my achievements and game data are on me offline account. Is there any way I can merge my offline account to my
 Live account, or, even better, transfer my achievements and game data from my offline accounbt to my Live account?</p>

<p>Sorry, but there is no way to merge accounts or transfer anything from one to another. Since you just got the gold subscription, you could try calling support to see if they can cancel it and then go online with your offline account.</p>

<p>First the Mature ratings in games are only for the campaign Online activity is not rated. And the Ratings are only for buying the games you have to be over 18 to purchase a M rated game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second You agree to abide by the rules when you sign up for the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I liken it to this MS wants Live to be E for everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So say you walk into a Chuck E Cheese ( a kids establishment) Knowing that you should abide by certain rules and you decide that you want to just start cussing out other people that are there in the establishment. Do you not think you should get kicked out
 of that establishment for breaking the rules that they set forth?&nbsp; That you agreed to upon entering that establishment?</p>

    <title>Windows 8 RT Printer recommendation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobchuck5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 RT Printer recommendation</h2>
                    My stepfather recently purchased a Windows 8 Rt Tablet for my grandmother, and it does not work with her old printer. I already tried to go to Best Buy and purchase a printer for her as my Christmas present, but they were not sure if ANY of the printers
 they had were compatible with the Windows 8 RT Tablet. <br />
<br />
I've looked online, and there are very few options currently available, all of which are very new. Since they are all very new printer models, there is very little
<i>unbiased and independent</i> information as to the Useability and Reliability of these printers.<br />
<br />
I don't want to get her a junk printer that will fail immediately after the warranty expires, and I especially don't want to get a printer with lots of "options" that try to "help" with new "features" - she's my grandmother; she knows how to use a computer,
 but any sort of customization is beyond her ability and interest. All she needs it to do is print paper - I'm not sure she even needs color.
<br />
<br />
I'm reasonably sure that, given the option she would like to have a printer that can print photos and scan and so on, and I'm also reasonably sure that, unless those features are
<i>extremely simple to use</i>, she will need my stepfathers' help to set them up - and also wherever they fail.<br />
<br />
Does anyone here have any advice, beyond "wait another six months for more details"?<br />

            <p>Take the Surface with you to Best Buy (or whatever retailer). These stores should have a WiFi network set up (maybe several networks), see if you can install a printer of the model you like on the Surface. See how many of the features of the printer work,
 for many printers&nbsp;the scan, fax and other bells and whistles won't work with the Surface.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find&nbsp;a printer&nbsp;you like and it works with the Surface, be sure to come back and tell us.

            <p>Many of the major brand printer will work with RT, the main issue being a change in the process which is used to install the drivers. This is severely flawed in that the system does not run through all the options and often drops out before offering integrated
 drivers which can work.</p>
<p>From what has been said on here you are more likely to get a printer to work via network instead of USB and printers that use standard PCL are a slightly better than GDI based printers. This means that the more basic office orientated printers would be a
 better choice than the all bells and whistles domestic type. If nothing else due to that driver change many of those "extras" are not available from a Surface RT.</p>
<p>I have 2 HP printers, one all-in-one and an A3 and both OfficeJet. They failed to install via windows update which seems to be fairly common but manually installing and selecting HP class drivers work well.</p>

            <p>I too have a Nokia 2520 Lumia tablet with the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>RT 8.1 Wind</strong><strong>ow</strong></span>. While I love it, I am getting very discouraged with it. I have an older HP 7500 I adore and both this new tablet and my Iphone 4s print to it beautiful after I updated the driver. Its awesome. Now I want
 a portable printer and there is my issue. All it needs to do is have a battery and print in black. Not asking much. I bought the Canon Selphy because I ordered it from Canon and the gal must have been new. She gave me the wrong information and now I am returning
 it. HP recommended the Envoy, I don't need that. I have a nice printer.</p>
<p>SO!!!! No one has come up with a solution for that. Epson said to replace my new tablet with an Ipad. Jerk! Canon says they don't have anything either and HP keeps recommending the big printers.</p>
<p>Now, here is my question: What about just using <strong>Bluetooth</strong>, will that let me use a portable printer or do I still have to make sure it is compatible with my tablet.
</p>
<p>Thank you, Jo</p>

            <p>The connection method does not do away with the need for a driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Admittedly one method might be more reliable than another but to Windows it is just a port. The job is submitted to a driver and the driver is connected to a port. The driver is still required.</p>

            to anyone looking for help. I have surface pro windows 8.1 rt tablet. For the last 2 years I've been using cannon MG2922. This is a print copy scan printer. I can use it via USB or wirelessly. If your looking for something simple before this I had the

<h2>            Mixed Reality Portal doesn&#39;t work after KB4093105 update</h2>
                    <p>WMR doesn't work since the KB4093105 update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I uninstall KB4093105 WMR does work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But SteamVR will not run because it requires the latest update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the latest update is applied SteamVR will run but it still fails because the Portal fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried every combination of starting conditions I can think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Thanks for responding Andre.</p>
<p>Yes I have tried that.</p>
<p>If you read my original post you will see that I wrote that WMR does work if I uninstall KB4093105.</p>
<p>Uninstalling the update is not a solution because it then breaks SteamVR.&nbsp;</p>

            What kind of dependency would SteamVR have for a recently released update to break it? Have you tried reinstalling SteamVR after uninstalling the update?

<p>It doesn't have a dependency other than it requires the latest update in order to work. If you read what I wrote carefully you will see that when I uninstall the update that makes steam not work but the windows mixed reality portal will work. steamVR requires
 the latest update but the latest update won't allow my virtual reality headset to work. I want them both to work at the same time. So you see uninstalling the update is not a solution.</p>
<p>I will try to summarize:</p>
<p>pre update wmr worked and steamVR worked.</p>
<p>after update wmr does not work and as a consequence steamVR does not work as well</p>
<p>Uninstalling the update allows wmr to work but steamVR will not because it requires the latest update to work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have explained this enough times now.</p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Normally a mouse would not be the cause.
<br />
<br />Be sure to check with Luxo Amun's Support and Forums as there could be known issues. How well does the system fits the specs that the game requires?
<br />
<br />I would do a Performance check for the entire system.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a  process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />=====
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there
<br />Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

    <title>Why does Windows 10 have problems with the wifi connection and why - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sommysombrero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 10 have problems with the wifi connection and why does it randomly restart&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I had Win 10 installed on my computer, I've had problems with the internet connection. The wifi stopped working every 40 seconds or so and I had to re-connect almost every time I tried sending messages on Skype or Discord for them to go through. Call
 quality was terrible and it was either me who couldn't hear my friends or they could barely hear me. I know the wifi connection isn't faulty because when I connected to it with other versions of Windows on my computer, the internet worked just fine. Again,
 it's not the router that's faulty. It's the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, whenever I'm watching a video on YouTube or when I'm listening to something on YouTube and drawing in Paint Tool SAI, my computer likes to freeze up, shut down and restart at random. Sometimes, it just freezes and refuses to do anything and I'm forced
 to shut it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could I solve these problems and why are they there in the first place? Thanks.</p>

<p>I cannot locate the parental control feature to remove it.</p>
<p>I have parental control settings turned on, but I have no other users in my account.</p>
<p>I therefore cannot remove anyone or remove the control as directed.</p>
<p>When I want to add a program, I am asked to find my "parent' to sign in &amp; ask for permission.</p>
<p>This is turned on in a global setting but I cannot find the location to set it to 'off.'</p>

<p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify the issue, are you referring to parental controls in Internet Explorer or family settings in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Parental control, mostly known as Content Advisor in Internet Explorer is a feature that allows users to view content on the web, and to control the types of content that your PC accesses on the internet. This feature is no longer available in Internet Options
 like it used to be in the older versions of the browser.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly provide more information regarding your concern so that we can provide you with the proper resolution.<br />
</p>
<p>Your reply is most important to assist you accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot locate the parental control feature to remove it.</p>
<p>I have parental control settings turned on, but I have no other users in my account.</p>
<p>I therefore cannot remove anyone or remove the control as directed.</p>
<p>When I want to add a program, I am asked to find my "parent' to sign in &amp; ask for permission.</p>
<p>This is turned on in a global setting but I cannot find the location to set it to 'off.'</p>
<p>I am using Windows 10 with Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I do not have any other members in my family, I am not give the options to turn off/remove parental controls.</p>
<p>I cannot find the setting to turn off parental controls!!!!</p>

<p>Thank you for the information, Susan. It seems that the setting you're trying to turn off is not parental control/content advisor in Internet Explorer but Family Safety in Windows 10. If you are receiving a message asking a parent to sign for permissions,
 it means that the Microsoft account that's associated with the user account is added as a child account. If that is the case, you would need access to the adult account in order to make the needed changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other accounts on your PC? If there are, we suggest checking the accounts on your PC, as well as checking your email for any signs of your Microsoft account being added as a child account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this, you need to remove your account from any family account that it's associated with. Should you find/have access to the adult account, here is a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027707/microsoft-account-turn-off-family-settings-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> on how to turn off family settings in Windows 10 for you reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above resolution does not work for you, and there are no other accounts in your PC, or other Microsoft accounts that you know of, try creating a new user account, and then try to add a program. Check if you will still be prompted for an adult sign-in.

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can solve many problems by installing the latest drivers for your PC and the latest firmware for your wireless display or Miracast adapter. For more info about installing drivers on your PC, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 to download and install that firmware. You can also check the Windows Store to see if there’s an app from the manufacturer of your wireless display or Miracast adapter that updates firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also refer to: <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2013/11/12/windows-8-1-on-your-big-screen-with-miracast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Sorry for the slow reply. I was seeing if HP had the answer. I cannot change the resolution after duplicating my screen via miracast even after updating my drivers. It works with extended desktop just not duplicate.

            Hi - I am having the very same problem - I have an Asus Transformer T100 which can display duplicate screen using miracast on WD Media Player with no problem at all, but when I try to use Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter using same tablet on another
 Insignia TV, it reduces the tablet resolution from 1368x768 to 1280x720 - just the same as screen capture and it is greyed out so it can't be changed while I'm connected to tv. &nbsp;It can't run most apps due to the low resolution. I'd appreciate your help, as
 I have been trying to find a solution but am unable to resolve the issue.

<p><span><font><font color="#000000">Based on the issue description, it appears that you are unable to get signal when connecting the TV to HDMI port.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">I will certainly help you out with this issue.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">Here are few steps that you may try in order to fix the issue.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><b><span>Step 1.</span></b><span> First you <font>
<b>need a video cable</b> for making the physically connection. For better picture quality, you should connect the computer to the
<b>TV using standard VGA ports or via the DVI to HDMI cable</b></font> provided your TV supports these ports.</span></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><br />
<font><font color="#000000"><font><b>Step 2</b>. Open the "<b>display settings</b>" in your Vista computer and
<b>activate output to the TV screen</b></font>. You can either mirror content of your computer on the TV or extend the display just like a dual monitor screen.</font></font></p>
</span>&nbsp; <span>
<p><br />
<font><font color="#000000"><b><font>Step 3.</font></b> Pick up your TV remote and switch to "External Inputs" from the menu. You will need to change the default "Video 1" to a different selection which may be "HDMI 1" or "Video 2" depending on how you have
 made the connection.</font></font></p>
</span>&nbsp; <span>
<p><br />
<font><font color="#000000"><b><font>Important:</font></b> Make sure you connect the cable to the TV before turning on the computer as sometimes it may fail to recognize external display.</font></font></p>
</span>&nbsp; <span>
<p><br />
<font color="#000000">You may also need to change the screen resolution of your TV using the Display settings in your Control Panel else the picture may appear distorted.</font></p>
<p><br />

WLM has many features the others dont including backing up.<br />

            Thanks for the reply.
<div><br />
<div>Somehow, only the calendar and mail are in sync between WLM and Hotmail/Outlook.com. &nbsp;Contacts/People are not in sync.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Deleting contacts from WLM doesn't delete contacts in Hotmail/Outlook.com.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Changing contacts doesn't seem to 'carry over' either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Are WLM and Hotmail/Outlook.com looking at different databases when they pull contact information? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Or is this another bug in MS's Contacts/People application.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
It seems to not work for other folks.....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help will be appreciated.</div>

<p><span>Usually it will sync all the account that you configure with Windows Live Mail, but in your case it seems having an issue fetching information form the said application that’s why it come up to me to ask if you are getting an error message when you

<h2>            How to recover the operating system on an HP Pavilion dv8000&#63;</h2>
                    A friend gave us an HP Pavilion dv8000 laptop. &nbsp;It came with XP Home Edition; she installed Vista and always had problems with it. It worked very briefly for us - it would work for a bit, then it would freeze up and we'd get a blue screen. My son tried
 to reinstall XP; unfortunately, it was for a Dell. &nbsp;Now we get a message to activate this copy of Windows, but we can't. &nbsp;I want to get recovery discs to start from the beginning again, but it looks like we can't get them from HP. &nbsp;Any other ideas on what
 we can do/where we can get recovery discs? &nbsp;Will that even work if we can get them? &nbsp;Help - and thanks!!&nbsp;

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ -
 check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it
 must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.
