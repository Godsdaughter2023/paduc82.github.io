                    <p>I just bought the xbox, and it somehow couldn't download a single game. It always pops us the error code 0x87e0000d and tells me to check if I have logged in to xbox live, which I have done. Tried re-boots a few times but it didn't work</p>

    <title>Windows 10 mail setup impasse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dirtless  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 mail setup impasse</h2>
                    <p>I have a new machine, running Windows ten.&nbsp; I have a good network connection, a valid email account (IMAP, POP), a valid Microsoft account that I had to set up to proceed with the mail setup, and I am 100% certain that I have the correct email address/password
 combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start the mail program the only screen available is the Add Account screen, which accepts the email address and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It comes back "We could not find info for that account.&nbsp; Make sure the account is correct and try again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stranded on that screen.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>D</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I categorized this as an unknown o/s version, because it would not allow mail questions for W10</p>

            <p>This problem is specific to the Windows 10 Mail program. &nbsp;No browsers I have tried are affected, including iE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have verified that the email address and password combination is correct. &nbsp;I did this by logging into my email (with ISP Eastlink Canada) through their webmail portal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There &nbsp;is no error code. &nbsp;I am stuck on a very spartan screen, which offers the ability to Add Account. &nbsp;When I click Add Account it accepts my email address and password (which are confirmed correct) and come back with the single message I indicated before:
 "We could not find information for that account....try again".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eastlink is a POP/IMAP server. &nbsp;Does Windows 10 support these? &nbsp;Can I download and use a previous email program? &nbsp;Windows 7 was delightfully simple and stable.</p>

            Don't even waste your time. Key thing if the tech asked you about browsers seriously it's app if you built thing you should know about it. I bet these techs are running macs as to why they have no idea what your talking about.

<p>Hi, I bought the "All-In-One" pack which says it unlocks all 17 games in this collection, but the title still says it is the trial version. Nothing has been unlocked. It's as if I never spent those 2000MSP. I've tried re-downloading the "All-In-One" pack
 and hitting "Play Now" when the "All-In-One" pack has downloaded, but nothing works. Help!</p>

<p>XYEMx solution fails try that...</p>
<p>Got to in game marketplace (and remember you have the "core" game in your hd first = download capcom arcade cabinet, but i presume that phase you already done...)and go to All in one pack pres there...and confirm if that show the option download again or
 download free (you already pay for that) wait download finish and see if the games has there.</p>
<p>If that fails go to your biling history and see if that buy is there if yes call MS support and explain all solutions already have and try theirs too.</p>
<p>I hope i help you and forgive my bad english it´s self learnerd.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies. In the meantime, Capcom have confirmed (on their Capcom-Unity forums) that you must purchase the 400MSP base-game (Black Tiger, 1942, Avengers) before the "all-in-one" pack will work. So it's not so much an "all-in-one" pack as a
 "the-rest-of-it" pack.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your Windows 10 Home is&nbsp;activated?</li><li>Have you purchased a valid Windows 10 Pro product key?</li></ul>
<p>To&nbsp;perform the upgrade, you will need to know a few things. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, You must be signed in as an <strong>administrator</strong> to upgrade your edition of Windows.</li><li>You need a valid serial key for the Pro edition. If you don’t have one already, you will need to purchase one.</li></ul>
<p>Follow the steps outlined below to&nbsp;upgrade your Windows 10 Home edition to the Pro edition:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch the Settings&nbsp;app from the Start menu. You can use a shortcut by clicking on the Windows key + I.</li><li>&nbsp;In the Settings page, click on <em>Update &amp; Security</em>.</li><li>Click on <em>Activation</em>.</li><li>Notice that Windows 10 is running the Home edition and is currently activated. Click on
<em>Go to Store</em>, which&nbsp;will launch&nbsp;with a special upgrade page.</li><li>In the Store application,&nbsp;in&nbsp;the <em>Home</em> tab, you will see&nbsp;<em>Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro,&nbsp;</em>followed by a blue button. If you do not have a Pro edition product key, you will need to click on that button and pay $99.99. Once you complete the purchase,
 Windows 10 will turn into the Pro edition and activate the relevant extra features once the bits have been downloaded.</li><li>6. If you already have a product key you can avoid having to pay for it. Click on “I have a Windows 10 Pro product key” just below the $99.99 button.</li><li>7. Enter your Windows 10 Pro product key. Click “Start Upgrade”.</li><li>Now your copy of Windows has been upgraded to Pro.</li></ol>
<p><span>I hope this information helps. Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank You.</span></p>

<h2>            Complaint Line&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The way the treat their customers over the phone is horrendous!&nbsp;</p>
<p>They couldnt help me with anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got charged Xbox Live March 16th for a February 2nd billing cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is beyond me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted this fixed- as it shouldve suspended and turned off my account if the card did not work in February (lost card)</p>
<p>it shoukd not have waited until March to charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They would not fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They would not accomadate me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spend hundreds of dollars each month towards games and ingame cash, movies, etc. i am a loyal customer who receives NOTHING FOR BEING LOYAL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the superviser-samantha said i should receive deals and promotions- nope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I receive nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they cant even fix my problems!&nbsp;</p>
<p>They DO NOT care about loyalty or customer satifaction. They do not refund for accidently having charged your card twice. They have weird rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xbox support is rude.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with your subscription. The length of time for an account to become suspended is usually 2 months of missed payments. The reason being for example your case: Lets say you got paid on the 6th of February but it renewed on the 2nd. They
 don't immediately suspend it, they will try through that month a few times to get the payment for the subscription. It has always been this way and it works out great. You will have to try and call in for a different agent. Sorry for the experience you did
 have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Hi, i think that idea is stupid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xbox live is not a phone bill, PGE, rent, etc. &nbsp;why on earth would your bill roll over as if it is mandatory? No. Its luxery. So it should be automatically shut off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xbox does not care abour their customers or their complaints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I requested a refund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent 100$ in game. It accidently charged twice. I called and they said to do whatever online. Did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well my answer was no, they will not refund my 100$ even though it was a duplicate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am out 100$ there as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have now robbed me of $110 and still no one has done anything or gave me any type of accommodation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>XBOX DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SATIFACTION OR CUSTOMER LOYALTY</p>

<p>
</p><p>You mean like how any other subscription service on the planet works?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't really decipher what your problem is - you've posted about Xbox Live Subscription charges, but then you're saying you bought a game twice for $100 accidentally.&nbsp; The system doesn't really let you buy a game twice (although it's a computer so I wouldn't
 put anything past it).&nbsp; Did you by chance buy currency for a game twice on accident?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you give us the facts and we can either tell you how to fix the problem, tell you why it can't be fixed, or tell you where you can go to get it fixed yourself.</p>

    <title>KB4041676 automatic update kept failing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lamthai  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4041676 automatic update kept failing</h2>
                    <p>I bought an HP ENVY - 15t-as100 CTO with a factory installed Windows 10 Pro about 4 months ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last two weeks, Windows automatic update KB4041676 has kept failing without any error code. Specifically, after every 'installing/ restarting' process, I got a notification via the ACTION CENTER telling me 'failed to install'. Of course, this is
 very annoying because this auto-update would keep on enforcing and keep on failing every time I use my computer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any suggestion for me to deal with this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lam</p>
<p>P.S. Normally&nbsp;an OS updating process goes through two cycles 1) updating and shutting down 2) restarting and cleaning up - before going to the startup process. Both of these cycles usually take a few minutes to finish - but with this KB, the second phase
 just briefly flashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I resolved the problem by manually downloading the KB package then deleting the entire content of 'C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download' folder before running the KB.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, there is an unknown compatibility between my computer and the update, which was a bit mysterious even to Romel B. a Microsoft support technician, who helped&nbsp;me to resolve the problem yesterday. Romel took over my computer remotely and loaded
 it with various tools to pin down the root cause of the problem. After almost two hours, his final verdict to me was to wait for the next update... but whatever Romel did, I'm feeling much better now as the system is up-to-date (w/o having the KB installed).
 In addition, I don't have to deal with the repeated updating event for the KB after disabling 'Windows update' service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to my post. Both Microsoft Community&nbsp;and Microsoft Support Unit&nbsp;have helped ease my anxiety from worrying that I could be in limbo when I found nowhere to turn to in case of need.</p>
<p>

    <title>Why do I have to reset my console to make my mic work when I join a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay wilko x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I have to reset my console to make my mic work when I join a party&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got a really annoying problem that won't go away. Ever since I first used my play and charge kit to recharge my controller, when I join or create a party I cannot hear or be heard by anyone in there. The circle lights up green so my mic is supposedly working
 ok but I can't hear or be heard.</p>

<p>I've tried unplugging my play and charge kit (or plugging it in if it wasn't already), leaving and rejoining the party and turning my controller off and on again but nothing works. The only way I can start using my mic is by resetting my xbox, so for the
 past 2 weeks or so whenever I join a party I can only talk after resetting my xbox, after which it works absolutely fine.</p>

<p>At first it wasn't so bad but after doing it 100+ times it's getting increasingly annoying. Hopefully someone can help. Cheers guys.</p>

<p>The kinect sometimes doesnt reconize you, so your labled as a guest, &nbsp;when your labeled a guest it will prevent you from hearing/talking. &nbsp; &nbsp;Ive found a little work arount. &nbsp;Simply get out of view of the camera and then walk back into view, &nbsp;it will often

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard Mouse combo 2.0 USB receiver</h2>
                    I have the new surface pro with docking station and sculpt keyboard and mouse both quit working, error I get is that the sculpt usb receiver is 2.0 and port on surface and docking station are 3.0.&nbsp; The only fix I have found is to unplug usb, remove the
 device in the control panel and then plug back in.&nbsp; This works for maybe a day.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?

            Can you upload a screen shot of the error message?
<br />
<br />1. If you don't use the dock and just use your Surface and plug the receiver in to the Surface, same problem or not? (trying to determine if the issue is the Surface or the Dock). 
<br />
<br />2. While undocked, I'd recommend running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403723...</a> 
<br />
<br />3. it would also be worth checking if the dock has the latest firmware <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-dock-updater#update-a-surface-dock-with-microsoft-surface-dock-updater" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surfac...</a> 
<br />
<br />4. do you have any other USB 2.0 devices and if yes, same problem or not?

<h2>            Running 64 bit Programs Instead Of 32 bit Program By Default</h2>
                    I Have A Windows 8 64 bit Computer. I Am Just Wondering If There&nbsp;Is Any Way To Launch A Program (Mainly Windows Program), Let Say Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player in 64 bit Instead Of 32 bit By Default Instead Of Having To Open Program Files In
 The C: Drive Which Is Quite Time Consuming. <br />
<br />
I Have Other Programs Downloaded In A 64 bit Version Which Is Why It Always Runs In 64 bit Mode.<br />
<br />
Any Answer Will Be Appreciated. &nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 8.1 activation on laptop which was using Windows 8.0 with bios key</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop with Windows 8.0 and oem key in BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HDD broken and I bought the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find any place to download windows 8.0 so, I have found 8.1 right on microsoft web site. I was able to install it with generic key, then I found applicatio which can read keys from bios and was hoping to activate 8.1 with this key. BUT it doesn't
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is how can i restore my laptop? I see only two ways:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there any way i can download windows 8.0 from MS website?</p>
<p>2. Previously there was a REALLY USEFUL live chat with MS support and support guys was able to connect to PCs directy and manage all the activation problems. BUT now the chat is replaced with this s***d machine agent which is simple search )). Maybe the
 live support still exist somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thenk you.</p>

            Hi 321EGOR123, even though you had Windows 8, you can reinstall Windows 8.1 at any time, you will not need to enter a product key and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 8 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />VERY IMPORTANT
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<p>I know my Englishis bad, but please... ))</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We speak about Windows 8 which was previously installed to this laptop. Forget windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The HDD is dead. It's not upgrade. No SKIP button for the key during the installation. Nothing. The only option is to enter the generic key and then get the key from bios by using the special software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I did all those steps and I do have the key from bios now and installed windows 8.1, but the key is from windows 8.0 so, it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is: Is there any way to download windows 8.0 from microsoft? media creation tool does 8.1 disks but not 8.0</p>
<p>

<h2>            Flash player - why cant I watch videos&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never been able to watch videos on my xbox one via internet explorer or edge. I get the message saying I need flash player and to click to download it, so I do and it takes me to adobes website where it tells me that flash player isnt supported on xbox
 one. But I know somehow that you can watch stuff as I've seen it on my friends xbox one about 4 months ago. I've read that Edge has it as standard but I don't seem to have it as I still get the same flash player message. Can someone tell me how to download
 it, or enable it, or whatever else I may be able to do. Perhaps there's an app I'm missing or a setting elsewhere on my xbox? I've tried turning on mobile websites option in edges settings, &nbsp;it then says"Cannot download file. Xbox one does not support downloading
 files to local storage"</p>
<p>Am I missing something somewhere? Can anyone shed some light and tell me what I'm missing or doing wrong? Thanks.</p>

<p>Flash player is not supported on Edge. I don't think it will ever be possible to get Flash onto the Xbox One -- it's becoming a very deprecated standard for online videos and animated media. While Edge is basically a port of the same browser found in Windows
 10, it is a limited experience on the Xbox One since you are not allowed to download files, install add-ons, or customize too many settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Anyway, what you might be looking for is "HTML5"</strong></em>. That is supported in Edge; I'm able to watch YouTube videos (as well as interact with the video player buttons) without a problem. If it is YouTube you're trying to watch, you could
 always download the official YouTube app on the Xbox Store for free. If it isn't YouTube, you'll probably have to hope that the video site supports HTML5 for video playback or they have their own Xbox app. Otherwise, I'd just stick to watching the videos you
 want on the computer, tablet, or smartphone.</p>

    <title>How To&#58; Open NAT to resolve multiplayer and party problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arminatorx  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To&#58; Open NAT to resolve multiplayer and party problems</h2>
                    
<p>This is a slightly updated post with input and corrections from Misses Quinzel. Its purpose is to help you to get an open NAT for your Xbox 360 console to improve your multiplayer or Xbox Live Party experience.</p>
<p>It's a long read, but the most important information to open your NAT are at the beginning of the post. NAT issues only affect multiplayer or Party sessions.</p>
<p>If you want to find stuff out for yourself, I can recommend checking out the
<a href="http://portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/Xbox_Live_360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox 360 section of the Port Forward website</a>. (Keep in mind however, that this page often shows you an advertisement to buy their PFConfig software.
<strong>You do NOT need to buy this tool</strong> if you don't want! The tool just automatically does for you what you can manually do in this guide yourself!)</p>
<p>Try the troubleshooting tips below, if you already tried to open your NAT and it still shows up as moderate or strict. And finally, if you're just curious what NAT is, and why you are currently stuck
 with it, you can scroll down to the last chapter(or 
click here) for an explanation of what NAT is, and why you need it to be open.</p>
<hr />
<p>Table of contents:<br />
How do I know my NAT Status? <br />
How do I open my NAT ...<br />
... with Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)? This is the easiest and recommended method!<br />
... by manual port forwarding/DMZ? <br />
<br />
Troubleshooting<br />
- Double NAT (two routers or having to use 3G/4G Internet or some ISPs with Carrier Grade NAT and DS-Lite)<br />
- Issues when using a Laptop with Internet Connection Sharing<br />
- Firewall or Intrusion Detection enabled on the router<br />
- Two or more Xbox consoles in the house<br />
- The instructions didn't work and I need help! <br />
<br />
What is NAT anyways?</p>
<hr />
Open, moderate or strict NAT? How do I know my NAT status?
<p>Just turn on your Xbox 360 console, go to the "Settings" Hub on the far right, then select the "System" tile in the upper left, and then "Network Settings". Choose your appropriate connection type (wired or wireless), and then
 do a network test to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>If your console doesn't show you an error message about NAT, you already have an open NAT. Congratulations! You are done here. Go play! If you experience problems with some friends, ask them to do the network test for themselves,
 and if they have a strict or moderate NAT, direct them here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, however, your Xbox tells you something about strict or moderate NAT, read on to hopefully resolve this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
So how do I open my NAT?
<p>That depends on your router and network configuration. Since I can't possibly know all routers, I will give general instructions on how to configure your router to get an open NAT. How you carry out these instructions on your
 specific router, is up to you. If in doubt, check your router's documentation or the

Networking Hardware Information forums. Also, don't forget to check out the <a href="http://portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/Xbox_Live_360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Portforward website</a>. If you still struggle with any of those options, please make a post! When asking here for help, please
<strong>provide us the exact make <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
and</span> model of your router and modem</strong>. Just telling us you have "a Netgear WLAN router" won't help as much as telling us you have "a Netgear WGR614 v3 connected to a Motorola SB2100 cable modem". That way we can (hopefully) find the user manual
 online and help you out.</p>
<p>So let's try to open your NAT yourself. It's really easy with most routers. Especially if yours is capable of UPnP.</p>
Use Universal Plug and Play
<p>This is the <b>only</b> method to get two or more Xbox consoles online at the same time. If you have two or more consoles and no way of using UPnP, there is unfortunately no way around getting a new router (unless your current
 router can be updated with a Firmware patch).</p>
<p>Look in your router's documentation to see if it is capable of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UPnP</a>. If it is supported, enable it in the router's configuration, and you should be done (sometimes your router needs to be restarted. If necessary simply pull the router's
 powercord and plug it in again).</p>
<p>Some routers don't have a proper implementation of UPnP, which might be fixed in a Firmware update, so check the manufacturer website to see if a newer Firmware is available for your router.</p>
<p>If you continue to have a non-open NAT, look at the
troubleshooting tips below or if you only have one Xbox console, try manual port forwarding.</p>
My router can't use UPnP: Manual port forwarding
<p>This method will <b>only</b> work if you have only
<b>one</b> Xbox console in your network. If you have two or more consoles, you will have to use UPnP.</p>
<p>If your router doesn't support UPnP, or supports it badly, you need to manually create a port forwarding list for your router. This process is different for every router, so again: Please check your router's manual on how to
 do it.</p>
<p>Another great resource of information for this is the
<a href="http://portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/Xbox_Live_360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Port Forward Website</a>. Just find your router model in that list, and you will get a guide with pictures and detailed instructions on how to forward ports on your router.</p>
<p>Since you forward ports to a specific IP address in your network, we must make sure that this IP address doesn't change on the console. Otherwise the Router will forward the ports to the wrong address, should the IP of the console
 automatically change for whatever reason. So you need to set the address on the console manually.</p>
<p>To do this, go to your console, and to the "Settings" hub on the far right. Select the "System" tile in the upper left, then "Network Settings". If necessary, choose the connection type you use (wired or wireless) and take note
 of the current IP settings of your console.</p>
<p>For example, if your console is set to automatic, it might have an IP of 192.168.1.23, Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0, Default gateway of 192.168.1.1 (this is the internal IP address of your router), and the IP of the DNS should also
 be 192.168.1.1 (the IP of your router as well).</p>
<p>Now set your consoles network configuration to manual, and simply copy the settings for IP, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway and DNS into the appropriate fields.</p>
<p>If you want to be 100% correct, make sure you choose an
<strong>unused</strong> static IP <strong>
outside</strong> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DHCP</a> IP-range of your router. Again, check the manual of your router for information about how the router sets up DHCP.</p>
<p>Take note of the IP of your console (in this example 192.168.1.23) and go to your PC.</p>
<p>On your PC, browse to the configuration page of your router with your internet browser. Either look in the documentation of your router, or simply type in the IP of the default gateway the console has shown you into the browsers
 address bar (in our example, you would enter "http://192.168.1.1" in the address bar of your PC's web browser).</p>
<p>If necessary, log into the administration page of your router. Again, consult the routers manual if you are unsure. You will want to set up the IP address of your console with DHCP reservation before port forwarding. The manual
 will be able to point you in the direction of where that is located, or check out the

Networking Hardware Forums for more information.</p>
<p>Depending on the router model, find the appropriate configuration page for port forwarding. Look for menu items labeled "<b>Port Forwarding</b>", "<b>Exposed Host</b>", "<b>Virtual Server</b>", "<b>NAT</b>", "<b>DMZ</b>" or something
 like that.</p>
<p>If you find something like "Port Triggering" or "Port Mapping", this is
<b>not</b> what you're looking for. But you're very close. Instead of "Triggering" or "Mapping" look for "Forwarding".</p>
<p>You should get to a configuration page, that usually asks for incoming port, protocol and internal IP address.</p>
<p>You will need to forward the following ports to the static IP of your Xbox console, that you set up earlier (In our example this was the 192.168.1.23)</p>
<p>Now forward the following ports to that console IP:</p>
<ul>
<li>UDP 53 </li><li>TCP 53 </li><li>TCP 80 </li><li>UDP 88 </li><li>UDP 3074 </li><li>TCP 3074 </li></ul>
<p>Sometimes a router allows a protocol setting for "both" TCP and UDP combined. If so, choose that to save you some work and create only a single rule for ports 53 and 3074.</p>
Whoa! Wait a minute! Opening ports! Don't hackers use open ports to hack you?
<p>Well, yes and no. Open ports themselves are not the real danger. Vulnerable software listening on opened ports is. Let's make an analogy here. Imagine your router is a large government office building with departments like the
 immigration office, or the department of motor vehicles. Each bureau has a specific room number (port number) and a very specific task (i.e. you can't go into the department for motor vehicles and ask for an immigration visa and vice versa).</p>
<p>Imagine a hacker scanning your public IP address of the router's outside interface (since that is the only thing the hacker can see from the Internet), and he detects that port 3074 is open since you're playing an online multiplayer
 match on your Xbox console.</p>
<p>So the hacker goes inside the office with the number 3074 (as all other offices are closed) and sees a clerk with Xbox uniform hard at work managing a Halo Multiplayer match.</p>
<p>The hacker opens the small window at the counter, starts to shout exploits and throws hacking tools at the clerk. The clerk just looks at the hacker and says "Sorry kid. Wrong office. I only do Multiplayer here! I have no idea
 what you are doing," and slams the small window into the hackers face.</p>
<p>As long as you only open the ports necessary for the applications you use (and trust), you have nothing to fear. Just think of it that way: Even if you refuse to manually open ports: right now, when you open a web page, the router
 has already opened an incoming port itself, to let the website data inside to your PC that requested it. Otherwise you couldn't read this text.</p>
<p>So don't be afraid of opening ports. Just be careful to open
<b>just</b> the ports you <b>really</b> need, and forward it to the <b>correct</b> device.</p>
But I have a strict or moderate NAT and am able to play with people. Magic?!!?
<p>Not really. The Xbox Live matchmaking service just managed to match you to a player that has an open NAT himself. And in that case it works just like
that example below with the PC actively requesting a webpage. Your Xbox console just shouted to the router "Hey router! Xbox Live told me about a Halo match at 123.45.67.89, please connect me to that." and the router will do
 that, and since he now knows that the Xbox requested that connection, it will automatically route the incoming Xbox Live multiplayer traffic to your Xbox console.</p>
<p>However, as soon as a second player with a non-open NAT joins that game (or a Live Party), it can lead to various problems.</p>
<p>So even if you were able to play with some folks while having a non-open NAT, make sure you get your NAT opened.</p>
Troubleshooting: I turned on UPnP or I manually forwarded ports to the
<em>correct</em> IP. But it still doesn't work!
<p>From the insight I got from the old NAT thread, these are the most common problems you encounter when trying to open your NAT.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
Double NAT
<p>When you signed up for your Internet service, you might have gotten a cheap (or even free) modem device with basic functions from your Internet Service Provider. Maybe you wanted more comfort and maybe you wanted a Wireless access
 point. So you buy a new (wireless) router, connect it to the modem you got from your ISP, and all is seemingly well, since you can go to websites do your email and so on.</p>
<p>But you find that you have a non-open NAT, so you log in into your new WLAN router and set up everything correctly. But it still won't give you an open NAT.</p>
<p>In that case, the cheap modem you got from your ISP might be a Modem with built in NAT functionality (also called a Gateway). For example some Motorola Surfboard modems are able to simultaneously connect up to 31 devices to the
 Internet, despite having just one ethernet port (with the help of ethernet switches).</p>
<p>So while you told your WLAN router to allow Xbox Live traffic to the Xbox, the Motorola router "in front" of the WLAN router you set up correctly still refuses to let anyone inside.</p>
<p>To resolve that, you need to configure your modem for "<b>bridge mode</b>" or "<b>pass through</b>" mode. In most cases, you might even have to call your Internet provider, as a lot of modems get a custom firmware specifically
 made for your Internet Service Provider, and you can't change anything on the modem yourself.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to configure the modem for bridge mode, try to plug the cable that goes from the modem to the router into one of the router's LAN ports instead of the router's WAN interface. This way you circumvent the
 NAT routing of the WLAN router, and just need to configure the Modem's port forwarding (if possible).</p>
<p>If everything else fails, you probably need to buy a new "stupid" (i.e. with no NAT capabilities) broadband modem.</p>
Carrier Grade NAT (CG-NAT) with DS-Lite
<p>Recently, some internet providers have started to run out of public IPv4 Internet addresses for their customers, and start to NAT their own network (known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Carrier Grade NAT</a> or "CG-NAT", with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_transition_mechanism#Dual-Stack_Lite_.28DS-Lite.29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DS-Lite</a>). This means the ISP only uses one public IP address for their customers IPv4 traffic, and "hides" most of their customers behind that one IP (just like your home router does with all your devices at home). In that case, you need to contact your
 Internet provider and specifically request that you want to get a public IPv4 Address. If that is not possible, there is no way around but getting a new Internet provider.</p>
<p>The same is often true for 3G/4G/MiMo/Mobile Internet users</p>
<p>If you live in an area with bad landline (cable or DSL) Internet coverage, your only alternative often is a cellphone based Internet connection like 3G/4G. Some providers also offer access through a gigantic "WLAN"-like access
 point for a whole town, which requires a strong antenna.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these mobile Internet providers face a problem, as they can't predict how many devices will connect to that access point where you live, and often do NAT inside their own Data Centers (Carrier Grade NAT) as well.
 If that is the case for you, there is nothing you can do about it besides switching to a landline based Internet provider with enough free IPv4 addresses to give you an unique public IPv4 address.</p>
<p>If you want to check if your ISP is putting you behind his own NAT, browse to your router's configuration. Find the router's WAN IP address (check the router documentation again, if in doubt). Make a note of that WAN-IP address,
 and then browse to a page that reads your public IP address (simply <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2acj2xk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Bing for "what is my ip address"</a> or <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">go here</a>).</p>
<p>If the IP address shown on the website is different to the WAN-IP in your home router, you have a double NAT. Either your Internet Provider puts you behind a NAT, or your Modem is also a NAT device.</p>
I use my Laptop as a wireless bridge to connect my Xbox to the WLAN router.
<p>See above for the Double NAT problem, as the Internet connection sharing on your Laptop is basically also an additional NAT device. In order for this to work correctly, you need to configure your router to forward the Live ports
 to your Laptops WLAN IP address. Then in the advanced settings of the shared connection, you need to forward these ports again to your Xbox console connected to the Laptop.</p>
<p>Or, to make things easier, instead of using Internet Connection Sharing, bridge the connection without using NAT. To do that on Windows, press "Windows key + R", in the small window type "ncpa.cpl" and press OK. Select both your
 LAN and WLAN adapters on your computer (if necessary hold CTRL while clicking on each adapter). Right click on the selection and choose to bridge these interfaces.</p>
<p>Now just configure your router to 
forward incoming Live traffic directly to the Xbox's (static) IP address as above.</p>
<p>For more information on how to properly set up Internet Connection Sharing or Bridging,
follow the instructions in this Post.</p>
Restrictive Firewall or Intrusion Detection Systems in your router
<p>Some routers specifically have a Firewall running on them. In my (personal) opinion this is a simple marketing ploy to convince the buyer in getting this router, since it has "more" functions that the other router.</p>
<p>You see, most non-technical people think, that a Firewall is like an Anti-Virus Software, that blocks "evil" Internet traffic from entering your network. But this is
<b>not</b> how a Firewall works!</p>
<p>Even if you turn this firewall off (or buy a device without firewall in the first place), the router itself
<b>still works</b> like a Firewall in a home user scenario! Because if you didn't specifically give the router a port forwarding list, the router will reject all unknown incoming Internet traffic. But for Multiplayer you specifically
<b>want</b> incoming traffic to your Xbox. <br />
<br />
The purpose for a Firewall would be, you want incoming traffic <strong>only</strong> from a small group of known Internet addresses, like for example: "Only allow the office branch in Chicago with a specific IP address access to your email server in your main
 office in New York, and <strong>no one else</strong>!" But since you usually want players from all over the world to join you, a restricting Firewall makes no sense for your home network.</p>
<p>Having a Firewall enabled on a router, is like telling one bouncer at your disco to allow your friends inside for a multiplayer match (the port forwarding rules in the router), while telling a second bouncer (the Firewall) to
 make sure <b>no one ever</b> gets past that other bouncer. Not even your friends.</p>
<p>A similar problem is with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). These tools are there to defend your network from malicious attacks. But since attackers aren't marking their attacks as malicious (just imagine a terrorist asking
 a policeman if it's OK if he just goes in that building there to blow it up), IDS systems try to look for patterns in network traffic, that
<b>could</b> be an attack.</p>
<p>Now if you initiate a multiplayer match, a lot of different IP addresses are suddenly asking your network if there is still room in your match for another player. The pattern of a lot of "strangers" suddenly asking for access
 into your network could be mistaken as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Distributed Denial of Service</a> attack, and therefore the router will block these requests.</p>
<p>So just turn off these "security" features of your router. In your private home network you will have no security gain from these functions.</p>
Two or more Xbox consoles for multiplayer at the same time
<p>If you have two or more Xbox consoles that are supposed to play online multiplayer at the same time, the router is stuck with the same dilemma as with the quiet listen server in the
"What is this NAT thing anyways" explanation below. If there are incoming Xbox Live data packets to the router, to which of the two consoles should these packets be sent? Xbox A or Xbox B?</p>
<p>Let's make an analogy: Your router's public IP address is the street address of an apartment complex. In that building you have two men named "John Smith".</p>
<p>Now imagine the mailman arrives with a packet for "John Smith" at that street address (but no apartment number), and the postman sees two Mr. Smith on the doorbells. In the Internet, the mailman just throws away the packet and
 walks away. Both consoles have a strict NAT.</p>
<p>The tricky part with two consoles in your network is: You can manually
<strong>only</strong> configure port forwarding rules for <b>one</b> specific port to only
<b>one</b> specific destination.</p>
<p>To keep with the analogy: This would mean that one Mr. Smith puts a sticker on his doorbell reading "All packets from Xbox Live to John Smith are to be delivered to me in this apartment here!"</p>
<p>This way, only <em>that</em> Mr. Smith with the sticker on his doorbell will get all Xbox Live packets (the one Xbox having an open NAT), while the other Mr. Smith still won't get any packets.</p>
<p>Placing the other Xbox into a DMZ (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28computing%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">De-Militarized Zone</a>) is like one of the Mr. Smiths camping outside the apartment complex near the doorbells, and grabbing every
 Packet for any John Smith himself before the mailman even reaches the doorbells.</p>
<p>Depending on how the router prioritizes DMZ or Port Forwarding over the other, the mailman could still tell the camping Mr. Smith, that the sticker on the doorbell reads to deliver Xbox Live packets for Mr. Smith
<em>there</em> instead of the camping Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>Either way, one of the two Xbox consoles will <strong>
always</strong> have a non-open NAT.</p>
<p>The only solution to this problem is to use a router with a
<b>very good</b> implementation of UPnP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all routers with UPnP are able to support two (or more) Xbox consoles. Therefore, Microsoft has tested several routers, and those that were able to support multiple Xbox consoles, got a certification and an
 official "Compatible with Windows 7/Vista" sticker.</p>
<p>You can check out the 
Network Hardware Information Forums to see what devices the Xbox staff knows are capable of supporting multiple consoles.</p>
<p>So if your router does not have UPnP, or if it has a "bad" UPnP implementation, and one or both consoles show a non-open NAT, you need to check for an updated Firmware or buy a new router.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind, that the Games for Windows Live Client on a PC uses the same Xbox Live ports for multiplayer. Even if you don't have two consoles, this might be the problem.</p>
I think I followed these instructions correctly, but it still won't work
<p>If you think you did everything right, and already checked for the most common problems mentioned above, specifically the double NAT problem, feel free to post here, and ask for help.</p>
<p>But <b>please</b>, in order to help you, you first need to help us, by
<strong>describing your network setup as specific as possible</strong>.</p>
<p>Try to describe all devices that your Xbox needs to traverse in order to reach the internet. Please use the full model name of the device(s).</p>
<p>A <b>bad</b> request for help would be "HELP! I have a Netgear router, and I can't play multiplayer!"</p>
<p>A <b>good</b> request for help would be something like this: "Help! I have a Netgear WGR614 v3 router connected to a Motorola SB 2100 cable modem with 'Speedy Fast Co. Internet'. My console can connect to Xbox Live, but complains
 about moderate NAT. I can't play Black Ops with my friends!"</p>
<p>The more we know about your network setup, the better we can help.
<b>So please help us help you! Thank you!</b></p>
What is this NAT thing anyways?
<p>For those wanting that extra background knowledge: NAT is an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">acronym</a> for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network Address Translation</a>. Its purpose is to allow multiple devices in your home to access one internet line and be connected online simultaneously.</p>
<p>Those with enough networking knowledge, please keep in mind, that this explanation is intentionally kept simple, and oversimplifies the whole process, so the average "I don't want to become a Cisco Certified Network Associate,
 I just want to play Black Ops with my friend!"-person can easily relate to what's happening in his home network.</p>
<p>While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
IPv6</a> resolves most of the problems described below, keep in mind that currently nearly all Internet Service Providers still only use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IPv4</a> for private home users.</p>
<p>As you might already know, each device on a TCP/IP network (and the Internet is just a very large IP network) needs to have its own unique
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IP address</a>. When you sign up for Internet service with your Internet provider, you usually get one connection to the Internet, and only
<b>one</b> IP address. But since you want your Laptop, your PC, your Xbox 360 and many other Internet aware devices in your home to connect online, you may begin to see the problem. It's not possible for your Internet provider to give all your devices unique
 IP addresses, as you would need to tell him about each new device you buy, and IPv4 addresses are basically "sold out", so all your new devices can't get one anyway, as the amount of IP addresses your provider has bought are limited.</p>
<p>To resolve this, you can get a router from your Internet provider, that does NAT. The interface, that connects to the Internet (called WAN Interface, for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wide Area Network</a>) receives this unique public IP address visible from the Internet from your Internet provider. It's basically the "street address" of your home for the Internet.</p>
<p>On the "inside" of your home, the router gives <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
private IP adresses</a> to the devices connected to its LAN ports (for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Local Area Network</a>). So your PC, Xbox, Laptop and internet-aware fridge will get an IP address from certain reserved IP ranges. Usually IP Addresses in the range of 192.168.XXX.YYY or 10.XXX.YYY.ZZZ.</p>
<p>To better explain what NAT does, let's make an example.</p>
<p>You are sitting at your PC and want to go to Xbox.com, while your sister is doing homework on her Laptop and wants to do some research on Wikipedia. Both of you type the address of the websites into your browsers and hit Enter.</p>
<p>Your PC now shouts to the router "Hey router! I'm the PC, and I want to fetch http://www.xbox.com!" The router now takes the order, writes in a list that the PC wanted to see Xbox.com, and relays the order to the Internet. The
 laptop shouts: "Hey router! I'm the laptop and want to go to http://en.wikipedia.org!" and the router also writes in that list, that the laptop wants to see the Wikipedia homepage. It then shouts to the Internet "Hey Wikipedia! Hey Xbox.com! I'm the router
 at the public IP Address 123.45.67.89 and am requesting these pages for some devices inside my network!".</p>
<p>Eventually the website at Xbox.com answers, and sends data to the public IP address of the router. The router now looks at its notes, and remembers that the PC wanted to see Xbox.com. So the router forwards the incoming data
 to the PC. When Wikipedia answers, the data gets routed to the Laptop according to the list.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But there are multiplayer games, that use so called "listen servers" (imagine an "ear" the computer uses to listen to incoming other players) to host a game. This means, that for example you start a game of Counterstrike
 on your PC, your PC will silently listen on its internal IP 192.168.1.20 for other players.</p>
<p>The problem with that is: No one knows that the PC is simply listening to incoming requests. In the previous example, the PC shouted out its order to fetch Xbox.com. Now it's quietly sitting there, listening for other players.</p>
<p>Just imagine a router being a bouncer of a popular club with gaming consoles inside, and you, inside the club, use your cellphone to invite your friends over to the club for a gaming session.</p>
<p>When your friends arrive, they are stopped by the bouncer: "Stop! You are not on my guest list, and with these pants you don't get inside here."<br />
Your friend: "But I am invited! See? My friend sent me that message, that he's playing Counterstrike here!"<br />
Bouncer: "I don't know you, and I don't know of any Counterstrike match. So beat it, before I beat you!"<br />
Your friend: "Okay, calm down! I'm going already..."</p>
<p>Inside you're wondering why your friends don't show up.</p>
<p>Had you told the bouncer that you are doing a Counterstrike match and awaiting your friends, he could write your friends on the guest list, let them inside and direct them to the gaming area where you're waiting for your buddies
 to arrive.</p>
<p>In router language, this "guest list" would be forwarded ports. So in natural language you would tell the router: "If there is incoming traffic on port 27015, this is data for a Counterstrike game on the PC, and if data arrives
 on port 3074, it's meant for the Xbox 360, so please forward it that way."</p>
<p>The router will then do exactly that, and your console won't know a router is there, which results in an open NAT.</p>
<p>I hope this clears up a bit about the confusion what NAT is, and why it's not in Microsoft’s hands to "get rid" of NAT. Maybe in the (not so distant) future, the use of IPv6 will get more popular. With IPv6, any IPv6 capable
 device has its own unique publicly accessible IP address, so NAT isn't necessary. Until then you need to rely on UPnP or manual port forwarding to resolve your NAT issues.</p>

            <p>Solution I found and it works for me:</p>
<p>http://www.sevenforums.com/drivers/319261-bluetooth-peripheral-device-no-driver-found.html</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Start &gt; Search &gt; Device Manager &gt; Other Devices &gt; Bluetooth Peripheral Device &gt; Update
<a href="http://link.tweakbit.com/tds/7fDU?source=SFdrv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Driver</a> Software</li><li>Continue from <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=20229038&amp;postcount=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Step 5 to Step 9</a></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Required XDA steps:<br />
Installing Windows Mobile Device Center is not necessary. The peripheral just needs a standard bluetooth COM port driver.<br />
<br />
1. In the Bluetooth device window, right-click the phone icon and select 'Properties'<br />
2. Click 'Hardware' tab then 'Properties'<br />
3. Click 'Change settings'<br />
4. Select the 'Driver' tab, then 'Update driver...'<br />
<strong>5. Click the second option: "Browse my computer for driver software"</strong><br />
<strong>6. Click to choose the option "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"</strong><br />
<strong>7. From the list "Common hardware types", Select 'Ports (COM &amp; LPT)'</strong><br />
<strong>8. Two droplists appear. Choose 'Microsoft' in the "Manufacturer" list, then 'Standard Serial over Bluetooth link' in the "Model" list</strong><br />
<strong>9. A warning window pops up. Ignore it by clicking 'Yes'</strong><br />
10. Presto, the device functions properly.. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>I cant redeem my xbox live trial code - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I cant redeem my xbox live trial code</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys so I bought an xbox live trial code which I tried redeeming on both the console and the website. On the console (360) it just said invalid code and on the website it recognized that it was a trial code but later said "something went wrong". I tried
 both a couple more times and still the same thing. I talked to the seller who said he talked to microsoft who said that the codes were real but there is a problem with their redeeming system. He later said to give it 24 hours for them to fix it and still nothing.
 Is anyone else having this problem? Should I wait longer or contact microsoft myself? He also said that if there is still problems he will give me a refund. Thanks to everyone for help in advance.</p>

<p>Why would you buy a trial card</p>
<p>Lord there is no cash value </p>
<p>Not to mention they are limited </p>
<p>codes are specific to the region they were purchased in and don't give you full access to gold features and have limited access to certain games and modes</p>
<p>Did you check your account here if you are on the trial or not?</p>
<p>If it is on then it's working just don't expect to be playing destiny or ranked matches</p>

<p>As Stated above, there is no value in buying Trial codes, unless you only plan to play for that long, otherwise buying a 1 month code is much better, that way you get access to all xbox live gold benefits, where with trial codes, you only get a very limited
 access. </p>
<p>The reason why it isn't working could be one of the below: </p>
<p>The Code is from a different region - so you cant buy a code from Australia and use it on an American Account
</p>
<p>The Code Is From An Online Code Generated - These have been noted to not work but also cause trouble with the account</p>
<p>Your Current Xbox Live Hasn't Expired Yet - when redeeming Xbox Live gold codes, you need to wait until reverted back to silver before you can redeem more xbox live gold, dont know why but its just the way it is.
</p>
<p>Best thing is the ask for you money back, and in future only buy codes from known retail outlets
</p>
