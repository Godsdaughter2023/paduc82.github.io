<p>
</p><p>I dug into this a bit and it looks like your computer is reporting images to have an unexpected file&nbsp;type.&nbsp; Instead of them showing up us "image/jpeg" they are coming in as "application/jpeg".&nbsp; Is it possible you recently installed some software that has
 changed how your computer handles images?</p>

<h2>            Missing DATA1.MSI in Office 2000 Professional</h2>
                    
<p>During a "cleanout" of old files, etc. inadvertently lost the DATA1.MSI file for MS Office 2000 rofessional installed on the computer. Check with MS database, etc. and "answers" all indicate I must have original CD to reinstall, repair, etc. Unfortunately
 the original CD is long gone.... I never used anything except PP, Word or Excel, and my other computers all have Office 2010 Home and student version. Price is good, but need to know a couple of things on this machine:</p>
<p>Do I have to uninstall Ofc 2000 first?, or will 2010 overwrite it?</p>
<p>How do I do a complete uninstall of Office 2000? Is there a utility required from MS? Or will the control panel method work?</p>
<p>Any assistance would be great.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, I was on adobe site and saw something in global settings about allocating from zero to 100mb of local storage for applications running flash--is that something I need to increase--it is only set to about 30mb now?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Are you getting any notification about running out of memory?</p>

</p></div>
<div>"Out of memory (OOM) is an often undesired state of computer operation where no additional memory can be allocated for use by programs or the operating system. Such a system will be unable to load any additional programs and since many programs may load
 additional data into memory during execution, these will cease to function correctly. This occurs because all available memory</div>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you scroll through a Web page in Microsoft Internet Explorer, the <strong>
CPU Usage</strong> meter in Task Manager may indicate 100 percent CPU use. Because of this behavior, other programs may slow down or become unresponsive. For example, if you play a video DVD, an audio DVD, or an audio CD while you scroll through a Web page,
 you may experience video or audio distortion. </p>
<p>
You can try disable the <strong>Use smooth scrolling</strong> option in Internet Explorer and check if that helps.&nbsp;To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp;
</p><ol>
<li>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu in Internet Explorer, click
<strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>
Advanced</strong> tab.&nbsp; </li><li>Click to clear the <strong>Use smooth scrolling</strong> check box.</li></ol>
<p>Hope the information helps. </p>

    <title>Equation Editor Matrices in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Equation Editor Matrices in Word 2010</h2>
                    Is there any way to create a matrix of arbitrary size in the equation editor in Word 2010?&nbsp; The old equation editor had the ability to specify an arbitrary number of rows and columns.&nbsp; I can't find this in 2010.

            I know this is an old topic but I certainly came across it at the top of Google results when I had this problem.
<div><br />
<div>These methods (especially Jay's second solution)&nbsp;definitively&nbsp;helped. Having nested matrices is a nightmare especially when the columns start to not line up when they have different sized content.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It soon becomes a nightmare trying to manage large (even 5x5 matrices) in linear mode, keeping track of ampersands and brackets as the whole thing slips off the end of the page.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So what do I have to add to this question a year and a half after it was first posted? Hopefully a little wisdom that will keep the steady stream of people currently finding this help page satisfied:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b><i>Right clicking on an element in a matrix brings up a context menu with insert and delete row/column commands.</i></b></div>
<div><br />
<div>That's it, so simple and so many people including myself have missed it for so long. Anyway this makes matrix manipulation so much easier to manage. I hope I've made a few people's lives that little bit easier by posting this.</div>

<div>Hi there! I noticed a feasible truncation of this syntax, by using "@" to denote number of extra rows, and "&amp;" to denote number of extra columns you want. Hence we have:</div>

    <title>Cant access OneDrive after name change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant access OneDrive after name change</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of our users changed her name following her wedding and since then nothing syncs in her onedrive and there are a number of errors in the sync. Most of the errors state the credentials are required and the only option is to Open the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on open the file opens it but the user cant make any changes. Looking at the URL, it points to the onedrive with her previous name so for example the URL is : /userbeforenamechange_domain whereas with&nbsp; her account onedrive opens at /newname_domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing the credentials, reboot, repair but nothing seems to work. Surely a simple name change should not affect onedrive as it is still the same account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user can navigate to the new url onedrive but when trying to navigate to the older URL we get a page doesn't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Panos,<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing the information with us in the private message.<br />
<br />
After read the post again, it's not the issue I thought in the previous post. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to explain that after we change the name of the user, her OneDrive for Business URL will also change and to sync this modification to local, we need to re-sync our OneDrive for Business library to let the OneDrive for Business client aware this
 change. So, please perform the following information to check the outcome:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[Updated by Fraser Xu MSFT, 3:17 AM, Sep 15, 2016 (UTC)]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, please let the user back up all the files in her local OneDrive for Business folder.<br />
<br />
Right click the OneDrive for Business icon in the task bar, if you see the pop out window as below, please try these steps:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f87b0f9-f410-43e2-ac70-a13e61d7634a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f87b0f9-f410-43e2-ac70-a13e61d7634a" /></a><br />
1.Click <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Account</strong>&gt;<strong> Unlink this PC</strong>.<br />
2.Login in to <a href="https://www.office.com/1/?auth=2&amp;home=1&amp;from=ShellLogo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Portal</a> and go to <strong>OneDrive</strong>. <br />
3.Click <strong>Sync </strong>to re-sync the user’s OneDrive for Business library.<br />
<br />
If the pop out window is similar as this one, please try these steps:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/880fc065-bab9-40aa-bcbf-5462080a7ce2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/880fc065-bab9-40aa-bcbf-5462080a7ce2" /></a><br />
1.Following steps in “<strong>Stop syncing a library</strong>” section of this article to stop sync the user’s OneDrive for Business:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-sync-connections-in-OneDrive-for-Business-21aac895-9f32-4e3e-a75a-6f12824f0975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair sync connections in OneDrive for Business.</a><br />
2.If the user are syncing other SharePoint document libraries, please also perform the same steps to stop sync those libraries.<br />
3.Login to OneDrive for Business and click <strong>Sync </strong>to re-sync her OneDrive for Business library.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Fraser<br />

I am not the original questioner, but I have a similar question.<br />
<br />
I need to make a formula that will execute a set number or iterations and then exit.&nbsp; It's like a VB do loop, but I want to write it without using VB for reasons of portability, simplicity, and future modification by users who don't know VB.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            Excel Options / Formulas / Calculation options / Enable iterative calculations and set the maximum number of iterations to whatever you want.<br />
<br />
If that does not solve your problem, you will need to post details of your problem, along with examples of data input and desired output.&nbsp; It would be best to do this in another thread.<br />

    <title>Support for hierarchical folders in Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter fbrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Support for hierarchical folders in Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I currently use a Windows 7 phone together with OfficeSmallBusinessLive and I am currently evaluating a shift to Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One limitation that I face with OfficeSmallBusinessLive is that the list of folders that I create in Outlook (as my PC email client) can ONLY be a flat list of folders and not a hierachically organised or nested list, as I would be able to do with a full
 Microsoft Exchange server or previously with BPOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two questions therefore:</p>
<p>- does Office 365 support hierarchically nested folders in mail?</p>
<p>- ditto for the Windows Phone?</p>

            I recently started using the email service associated with Office 365 at the university where I teach.&nbsp; The email service allows for hierarchically nested folders (I've only got some folders that go 3 deep).&nbsp; My windows phone, which has been upgraded to
 the latest mango beta finds folders that I've created but does not beyond the 1st level of folders, so it does not appear to support hierarchical folders beyond the top-most folder.<br />

</p><p><span>Windows10 will be remembered as one of Microsoft’s greatest achievements, once the bugs get worked out. But quite a few people are having problems with it right now because it&nbsp;still&nbsp;has&nbsp;some bugs, and some compatibility issues with third-party programs,
 and also because upgrading is an inherently problematic thing. At this point, many people want to remove Windows Defender because they’re experiencing persistent problems with it crashing, using too much CPU, failing to update, etc., and haven’t found a fix.
 Other people might just find it ineffective against malware. </span></p>

</p><p><span>Removing Windows Defender in Windows 10 was meant to be safe and easy, because&nbsp;no one is trying&nbsp;to prevent you from choosing another AV app. As soon as you install a third-party AV app, the Windows Security Center should turn off Windows Defender,

<br />
1.Did you add the domain in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center</a>-&gt; protection-&gt; spam-&gt; block list?<br />
2.Were the emails delivered into your Junk folder or Inbox folder?<br />
3.Please provide the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/View-the-Internet-header-information-for-an-email-message-5665156B-9192-471C-9AE1-47C668E60199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mail header </a>of one of the emails.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message with the test account. Here is the URL of the PM:

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>No, sorry I never get as far as that. </p>
<p>I the Exchange Admin Center, I can type a domain, like ex "contoso.com" into the Blocked Domain Box, but when I hit save nothing happens, and the Blocked Domain Box just goes blank. I can't save either Bocked Domains og Blocked Senders.</p>
<p>I don't get error-messages, - I am very simply just getting ignored :-)</p>
<p>Any ideas? pls help.</p>

<p>hello kristian,</p>
<p><br />
i did a test and were not able to reproduce this issue. in order to do troubleshooting, i want to collect some more details:<br />
1.&nbsp;does the issue occur in multiple web browsers?<br />
2.&nbsp;are you able to see this screen, or just nothing happened at all?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=07cb20a9-d67c-49b3-aac4-dfacfcc5a974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>if you don’t mind,&nbsp;please do a test using powershell. it can help us identify whether anything is going wrong in the exchange online server side:<br />

<p>The drop down menu is slow and as I move the mouse over the folders, they&nbsp;will not automatically open the lists of individual sites to open one of them.&nbsp; I only get a shadow outline of the list of individual sites.</p>

            <div>Unfortunately none of&nbsp;the suggestions given worked.</div>
<div>However I found the answer quite by chance. Searching IE9 on Start, I had the options of IE, IE(64bit) and IE (No Add-ons). I tried the 64 bit option and the drop down favorites menu worked OK and also all the other drop down menus were much more responsive.
 To make sure I always get IE 64 bit, I moved it to the task bar and deleted the old one, presumably 32 bit.</div>
<div>The only time IE sometimes opens in 32 bit is when I press a hyperlink on an e-mail or similar.</div>
<div>I think the problem may be the Bing toolbar as it was not on IE 64 bit , but when I downloaded it to add, the same old problem reoccurred. I have therefore given up on Bing and downloaded Google toolbar instead which is OK . On searching Bing and 64 bit,
 it does seem to be a problem, of incompatibility which nobody has an answer to.</div>
<div>I hope this information on the problem is useful.</div>

<h2>            Changing primary PC for synchronization from PC&#35;1 to PC&#35;2&#63;</h2>
                    Hi I need help with changing primary PC for my Windows Phone 7 synchronization.<br />
<br />
I purchased WP7 phone, on my PC#1 I installed Zune 4.8 and I connected my WP7 phone to that PC#1. I did some update until NoDo version and everything works fine.<br />
<br />
Now, what I need:<br />
<br />
1) I have also another PC#2, which I would like to make it primary for sync with my WP7 phone now, so my phone would not appear there as a guest. I would like it to be guest on PC#1 now.<br />
<br />
2) I need to be able to make OS updates of my WP7 device on that new PC#2. I suppose, if it would be guest on PC#2, I would not be able to make updates, am I right?<br />
<br />
3) I would like also to be able to sync my content (just Music, Pictures and Video) with the first PC#1 after that, will be that possible in guest mode?<br />
<br />
4) Is there some possibility to transfer restoration points, which were created on PC#1 during updates processes from 7004 version to NoDo to PC#2?<br />
<br />
5) Do I lose those restore points, when I will change sync relationship from PC#1 to PC#2?<br />
<br />
Please, tell me, what should I do in chronologic steps.<br />
<br />
Thanks for clarification!

            <p>Hi Kositch,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your forum contribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, you could have 2 PC's linked to your Windows Phone without problems and you can also run updates on a different PC as a guest.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, to answer your questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. To change PC1 to guest, I would recommend to go to settings and under accounts/ computer and devices remove PC1. That way your Windows Phone will appear as a guest.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>a. connect your Windows Phone to PC2</p>
<p>b. click on the Phone in the left hand corner</p>
<p>c. click on change relationship</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. As mentioned above, updates can be done on any PC, even if you are just a guest on that PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Sync mode is possible as Guest and normal. So no worries on that part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Unfortunately, that cannot be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Not sure, so I will further investigate and get back to you as soon as I can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marc A.</p>

<h2>            MyPhone Website and IE8</h2>
                    Just a note that the MyPhone website has problems with IE8 (Rc1).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The only&nbsp;item under "Phone" that works is Text Messages. If I click on Photos, Videos, Music, or Documents, the page blinks a couple times, the tab caption changes to "Continuing", then goes back to MyPhone home&nbsp;page&nbsp;(Last Synchronized, etc).&nbsp; (Contacts, Calendar,
 or tasks appear to work, but it might be working because I have nothing sync to those categories, since my phone syncs with Exchange.)<br />
<br />
Note that these pages work with Firefox (v3.0.6).

            Hi,<br />
<br />
From the symptoms described it seems that it could be related with the security level defined in your browser.<br />
<br />
Can you check what is the security level of the browser, lower it and try again?<br />
Let me know how it went.<br />
<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;I had thought of that.&nbsp; I have the site listed in my Trusted Sites zone, running at medium; protected mode off.&nbsp; When I switched&nbsp;to medium-low, then the site worked.<br />
<br />
Also, since my post I found something else.&nbsp; Being a web site developer,&nbsp;I tried to debug what was wrong, at least from the client side.&nbsp; I loaded Fiddler to see what was going back and forth.&nbsp; But with Fiddler's proxy in place, the site works just fine!&nbsp; No
 problems.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.&nbsp; Sorry I cannot provide more information, especially as to which download of web page component is failing.

    <title>N97 Touch Screen Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> froschy  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 Touch Screen Problems</h2>
                    
<p>My N97 has intermittent touch screen problems where it will either respond in the wrong location, lag, or just be completely non-responsive. I'm pretty sure that it's not hardware as after completely rebuilding (remove all apps, format the mass memory, hard
 reset, re-install v2 fw, hard-reset, re-install apps, re-load mass memory) the phone and the touch screen work with no problems for several days, then after 3-4 days the problem reappears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect it's related to two problems with the phone: the first is that there is still a bug with the lock/unlock slider; the second is that the phone is too underpowered (CPU &amp; RAM) to multi-task (especially email retrieval) and process the input of the
 touch screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anybody else having similar problems with their N97 touch screen, if so do you have a solution?&nbsp;</p>

            Dont mean to worry you , but i had exactly the same problem . its now got to the point where none of the touch screen works unless i also hold another point of the screen (at the top near earpiece) . I am now waiting to have some some spare time so i can
 take the damn thing back and get it sent off for repair . Hopefully yours wont go the same way but thats my expierience .

 the screen from dark to semi dark when switched. i cant see anything on the screen at all. my phone never fell or anything i really dont understand this. i tried calling it with another device but it only goes to voicemail. i tried to reinstall v20. by plugging
 it to the pc an it doesnt even make the plug in sound it usually makes. its not hooking up to the pc. i paid alot for this phone, im to the point now with answers feeling frustrated because i've never had to deal with something like this before owning a nokia
 mobile. have i lost my money with a bad product?? is there any help??

            In the default browser mine has an intermittant issue where it will just refuse to select a hyperlink and instead will just scroll around and around or just refresh. Sometimes goes away and sometimes requires switching off and back on. I'm on V11 thanks

            @ docsymbian - while I can sympathise with your N97 problem, it sounds like your issues are bigger than just the screen display and the touch screen responsiveness. All I can recommend is that you take your N97 to a Nokia Care Centre.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having the exact same issues you have pointed out. I also have the v20 firmware installed, but the problems appeared for me first during the v11release version. The screen touch input is affected and when I "click" an area, a different section of the
 screen is activated. Sometimes the screen reaction is as if I am keeping my finger pressed against it in a different location, quickly changing back to that location as soon as I lift my finger. This also prevents activating any regions of the screen as the
 phone is already detecting presses in other regions. It is also coupled sometimes with no response at all (no matter what I do - except solution below - lock/unlock. In my particular case, the Answer/Hang-up keys are also affected and in some (very few) cases,
 the hardware "menu" button is also not working. This is NOT a permanent problem, it happens only from time to time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also think it is not a hardware related issue (i.e.. Faulty screen), but rather related to either insufficient CPU / Memory or too many resource intensive apps running. I came to this conclusion by noticing that during this intermittent problem occurrence
 if I lock/unlock the handset multiple times, it eventually goes away (sometimes). What ultimately suggested it is either software or resource related, is the fact that during these lock/unlock sequences, the phone occasionally pauses for longer times during
 the unlock action. Ergo suggesting it is busy doing something else and not having enough CPU time or memory to react to the unlock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the problem does not happen all the time and is really hard to reproduce. What I do know, is that free space on the PHONE MEMORY does not affect it in any way. Right now I have about 41MB free on the phone memory and there is no noticeable difference.
 I can also suggest&nbsp; disabling GPRS / 3G connections (especially if they are transferring stuff) to see if it helps in any way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still on the lookout for some key behavior patterns to root it out by manually adapting my usage style until a complete fix is provided. However, this is completely unpleasant and utterly annoying. If anyone has had any results in this sense, please
 share with the rest of us.</p>

<p>Hey cheatman - Thanks for your detailed response, these issues are identical to mine. At first I thought it might have been Nokia Messaging so I removed this and setup the default mail client. This seemed to work for the first couple of days but then the
 problem reappeared. I think retrieving mail (whatever client) is fairly resource intensive and could be the cause of the lagging response but there must be something more otherwise there would be a lot more N97 owners facing this issue. Perhaps a software
 conflict (The only third-party software that I have running all the time is Best Taskman and Best Profiles) or alternatively an issue with accessing data on the telco network (I'm on AT&amp;T who never really had a good 3G network to start with and then dumped
 tens/hundreds of thousands of data hungry iPhone users onto it). Do either of these possibilities fit with your experience? I have to send my N97 off to get the scratched camera lens fixed at some point so I will also highlight this problem but unless I can
 replicate the lagging the care center will just give it a cursory check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With firmware v20 and when the touch screen is functioning properly the phone works nicely but unfortunately sometimes when I need to do something with it (like turn off the music player, check the calendar, etc...) the touch screen lagging will make the
 phone completely unusable. Making me a very frustrated N97 owner.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have given myself an idea in the last post and I seem to have been able to pin the issue down a little. It is (at least in my case)&nbsp; related to the radio (GSM) services. When the problem occurs, if I set the profile to "Offline" and all GSM / WiFi / BT
 activity is forcefully ended the screen is fully working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I switch it back to the "General" profile, in a couple of seconds, the problem is not there anymore, but happens again after some time (can't really say WHEN, which is my current target). Now that I have at least a partial solution (can't do it while
 receiving a phone call) it's going to be a little better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, for anyone who encounters the problem signaled in the first post, try doing this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Switch the current profile to "Offline".</p>
<p>2) Wait for all connections to become inactive (usually a couple of seconds are enough).</p>
<p>3) Test while in offline profile if the screen starts to function normally and detect the correct input.</p>
<p>4) Switch to the "General" or other profile you are normally using if all is ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternately, try locking and unlocking the device via the side switch. This seems to produce some results, but is not as reliable as the first method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I ever find the reason (or situation) behind the screen input issues, I will let you guys know. Right now I am concentrating my effort towards the GSM / WiFi usage, as I don't usually have BlueTooth on, so it's a safe bet it is not the one causing the
 problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hey cheatman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After your last post I had the lagging/non-responsive touch screen issues three times. Once was the complete non-responsive kind and the other two were the screen lagging kind. I tried your suggestion but with a minor modification, instead of switching profiles
 I long pressed the hang-up (red phone) key to end the packet data. This worked for the two times when it was just the lagging screen issue, as soon as the packet data was ended the touch screen started responding as normal. The time when it was non-responsive
 I could only resolve this by locking and unlocking the phone several times. These three experiences lead me to believe that there are actually two issues: the first is that there is still a bug with the unlocking/locking slider resulting in the non-responsive
 touch screen; the second is that the lagging touch screen issue is some how caused by the 3G packet data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My N97 is the RM-507 (NAM) variant and I'm on the AT&amp;T network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is due to the 3G network perhaps I should try a pre-paid sim card with Verizon, apparently it's a much better 3G network.</p>

            Tried that several times with no success. Found that I had to set : Bing home page /Preferences / Location (
<a href="http://www.bing.com/account/general?ru=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bing.com%2f&amp;FORM=SEFD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Ovi Maps 3.0 Not Supported on N97 &#43; Rant</h2>
                    Is it me or are all of us N97 owners getting very seriously short changed with EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
I am now onto my 5th Nokia N97 with various problems from rattling phones to creaky back covers to scratching noises on the haptic vibrate function i seem to have had them ALL. Now i'm pretty happy with this one in terms of hardware only to try using Maps this
 weekend to find out that the software doesn't work at all. I have no way of getting the magnetic compass to work due to me having the auto rotate on. "oh sorry nokia, i am sorry i have to turn that OFF in order to get it to work?" WHY???????<br />
<br />
Okay so the magnetic compass doesnt work and i'm stuck in Wembley north west london and need to get back to Woking surrey so I thought as i didnt know the area i'd use the navigation. Why the hell did I do that, it kept dropping out, and I was always at the
 turnings before they reached me on the map. What the hell is the point in that.<br />
<br />
It now turns out that Maps 3.0 is not supported on this phone [url]<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/explore-services/maps/features#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/explore-services/maps/features#</a>[/url] but yet it is available on the lesser (non
 flagship) 5800. WHY???????<br />
<br />
I want answers and I want them now. Nokia Care do not and cannot help with anything and neither can their dedicated regenesis backed Helpine.<br />
[B]<br />
Dictionary.com definition of flag⋅ship<br />
<br />
the best or most important one of a group or system[/B]<br />
<br />
I like many of you have paid £500+ for this phone only to not get ANYTHING that we were shown and sold on TV or in the retail outlets such as Transitions, GPS Navigation and Seemless Connectivity with the internet.<br />
<br />
<br />
What can we do? Do we all get together and get them to sort it out. I have the address of their complaints department and I am VERY VERY close to writing a legal document to them.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry having a product that has been demoted in terms of software availability is the last straw for me and i'm getting tired of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
<br />
Phil

<p>Sigh... I agree, I sure feel like I have been short changed to the level that Class Action suite looks to be in order if a properly working solution is not put forth within 30 days. (hey, 30 days shows I'm willing to be resonable, though I would like a fix
 yesterday!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been said before and I have to agree... in so many words... Nokia's strong suit is not in software development.&nbsp; Now, it looks like hardware (fault GPS units in Nokia N97's?) is the next stop on the spiral descent into the abyss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should have gone with a $199 iPhone 3GS over the Nokia N97's $650 price tag with seemingly faulty hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Nokia N97 worked as well as Nokia's Marketing I would be pretty darn pleased and would recommend this product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have let me thoughts be known via Twitter and several forums related to SmartPhones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was promised Assurance of Quality, but it looks like Nokia drop the ball on Quality of Assurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you trying to decide iPhone 3GS or Nokia N97? I think my post makes it clear which I would recommend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia... get your house in order, hire the best software developers you can afford (including team/project leads... nothing like a lead or program manager will horrible judgement, product/end-user understanding), and for goodness sakes... test your phones
 better.&nbsp; (e.g. scratch on camera lense issue, fault GPS(?) laden units, Unruly OS bugs&nbsp;choking the life out of the Symbian OS 5th Gen. Ed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps... no wonder no American carrier (in part?) will carry this phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and in conclusion...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*SIGHhhhh*</p>

<p>to be honest with you I would be happy with an omnia at the moment. The phone is just useless as a multimedia device that it was marketed at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple 3GS certainly seems like a good option at the moment however I will now not get my money back that I have WASTED on this rediculous £529 piece of Nokia. I don't get how they can just all of a sudden push Ovi Maps for the N97 offer and OTA for Nokia
 3.1 then with the latest firmware for the Nokia and on the Nokia site only Maps 2.0 is supported.</p>

<p>SO, why the OM3 are no more supported? And what about licences which were already transfered from Maps 2 to Maps 3?</p>
<p>For this moment I have my N97 in Nokia Care Centre for repairing the legendary GPS...</p>
