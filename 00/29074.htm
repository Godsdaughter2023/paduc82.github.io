    <title>How to Fix Drivers after Clean Windows 10 Install&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luis garcia osorio  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Fix Drivers after Clean Windows 10 Install&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Dell Inspiron 15 5577 laptop, and I recently added an SSD to it to compliment the HDD it had. I used Microsoft's software to use a usb drive to install Windows 10 on the SSD. However, unlike the Dell version of Windows 10 I was using, this clean
 version appears to not have the drivers I need. The sound is noticeably lower quality, and the GTX 1050 graphics card is not operating in games. I already tried installing NVIDEA and updating the drivers, and tried copying the drivers from my older HDD into
 the newer SSD. However, the issue persists. How do I go about solving this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things to know:</p>
<p>Windows does not let me boot from the original hard drive.</p>
<p>Wndows does not boot on the SSD if I disconnect the original hard drive.</p>
<p>I tried doing another clean install, but an error arose telling me that a new partition could not be created on the SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who replied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before comments were posted I proceeded to do another clean install on the SSD, doing the steps Greg mentioned, but this time I had disconnected the HDD. This worked, but then another issue arose. The version of Windows
 10 I installed was the generic version without the Dell drivers needed for my laptop to function. However, I then proceeded to the Dell site and used their own software to create a recovery thumb drive. I then redid the installation process, and now my computer
 is just like factory settings, but its running on the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the moral of the story is to disconnect the HDD when installing Windows. Would have taken be 10 minutes to upgrade instead of the 8 hours I spent today trying to make it work. Amazingly, I did not read this from all
 the sources I was using to figure out the process.</p>

            Can you disconnect the other hard drive during install so it won't interfere?  By installing with both connected it has left the boot files on the other drive and merely configured a Dual Boot so it's dependent on the other drive to start.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of Disk Management, which we read like a doctor reads X-rays:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />Then follow these steps to Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have a UEFI BIOS you must boot the media as a UEFI device, delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space, then click next to let it auto-create and format the needed partitions and begin - this makes it foolproof.  
<br />
<br />For non-UEFI Legacy BIOS you need the SSD set first to boot in BIOS Setup:  <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>

Can I reinstall Windows 10 on my computer after upgrading?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need a product key for re-activations on the same hardware. If you make a meaningful change to your
 hardware, you may need to contact customer support to help with activation. You’ll also be able to create your own installation media like a USB drive or DVD, and use that to upgrade your device or reinstall after you’ve upgraded. To learn more,

<p><span><span>Re-install means that you are installing the Operating System again to recover from some issues you might be facing whereas clean install will wipe out all your data
 and your computer will be new like the time you bought it.<br />

    <title>Unable to add an android phone in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tirthadas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to add an android phone in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Recently with windows 10 update, I am seeing an option in "Settings" under "Phone" to add a phone to my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>However, after following the steps I still don't see the phone listed in my Microsoft account. My phone runs on Android.</p>
<p>The option to add a phone under this "Phone" setup option, sends a link to my phone. This eventually asks to install Microsoft edge.</p>
<p>I have done the same and logged in with Microsoft account in the phone.</p>
<p>Still nothing happens. The phone does not show up neither on pc nor on web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, practically how to get it working?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So does it only work for Windows phone?</p>
<p>If so, then why Microsoft is promoting the feature for Android phones?</p>
<p>BTW, I do not have a Windows phone, it is a Android one. However, even after having Edge, Onedrive, Office, Launcher and configuring them with my microsoft account, the phone does not show up under devices in my microsoft account. Is this intended?</p>

<p>It would be depending on the device that you're currently using if it would be compatible or supports the feature to be added to Windows 10. Can you kindly confirm what is the make and model of your device? Also, are you signed in to your Microsoft account
 when you tried to add your device? We also would like to know if there are any Windows apps currently installed on your Android phone and are you logged in to your Microsoft account as well with those applications?</p>

<p>If you are on the Xbox 360 and your wife wants to enjoy the benefits of gold on her own account, then you would have to pay for an additional membership. If you are on the Xbox One, then only one of you needs to have a gold account for EVERY account on the

Pertaining to the Xbox 360 (as this forum indicated), yes, she would need a separate Xbox Live gamertag and Gold membership. On the Xbox One due to the Home Gold feature, one Gold membership enabled gamertag is needed on the console for all users to have Gold
 priviliges.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you know Google&nbsp;stopped support for Chrome in XP, Vista, etc. which means they will no longer be&nbsp;updating Chrome.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2015/04/providing-updates-for-chrome-for-xp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 secure operating system. Such older platforms are missing critical security updates and have a greater potential to be infected by viruses and malware.<br />
<br />
Today, we’re announcing the end of Chrome’s support for Windows XP, as well as Windows Vista, and Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8, since these platforms are no longer actively supported by Microsoft and Apple.
<br />
If you are still on one of these unsupported platforms, we encourage you to move to a newer operating system to ensure that you continue to receive the latest Chrome versions and features.<br />

                    Hello guys. So I've been using skype for window for quite some time and I wanted to download skype on my phone and so, I downloaded the skype for iphone and had to create another account. I used the same email and surprisingly, I was able to create an
 account. BUT. My skype account on the desktop and in the&nbsp;iphone is totally different. I need some help in this. Pretty sure I'm still using the old skype on my desktop but whenever I "check for update", it'll always tell me that it is updated.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>If you have created an account before by creating a Skype name or username, then you can still have another account by using the email address, by using

<h2>            Years subscription payed for, can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t access account</h2>
                    Hi, After being auto billed for a 3rd time for a live account that I was no longer getting use out of, i decided to set up my Xbox again to make the most of a service that I had just unwittingly paid for. Then, after trying, and failing to turn off the
 auto-renew due to the linked, old, email address being repeatedly declined (even though Microsoft is aware of, and has been contacting me through my current address) for some reason the old address is required to switch off auto-renew. I went to the bank and
 they issued me a new debit card, theory being that this would be the simplest way to prevent further unauthorised payments being taken, as i cannot seem to find a UK contact number. This was around a week after my account had been reactivated. Today I receive
 an email telling me my card has expired, which is correct, but I find I can no longer access my Xbox live account. What is the reason for this? I have spent hours researching, and trying to get the auto-renew turned off, to no av

<p>[quote]<span>I have spent hours researching, and trying to get the auto-renew turned off, to no avail.[/quote]<br />
</span>I find that very hard to believe because any sort of search result on any web browser with the following keywords "cancel xbox live", "turn off automatic renewal xbox live" brings up direct information on how to turn off automatic renewal.<br />
<br />
If you have old security information on file you need to correct that in order to turn off automatic renewal online and for that you need to visit this link
<strong><a href="http://www.xbox.com/lostproofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
As far as not being able to find the UK contact information if you visit the Contact Us link
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us#0:0:7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>&nbsp;and select Billing and Subscriptions, Account Management, and then Other you see the option for Chat and Phone support light up. You click Request a Call and you can get a call back
 or find the direct number for your region.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
When you have a subscription setup via a credit/debit card that payment method needs to be active at all times as you're on a subscription service. Periodically Microsoft checks accounts to make sure their payment information is valid and as you noticed your
 card had expired, in order to keep the account in an active state you would need to put a new card on file and then simply turn off automatic renewal. Cancelling the card from your bank and getting a new one does not stop automatic renewal from any sort of
 subscription based service or company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cheers for the help fellas, problem resolved. As for turning the auto-renew off, I know how to do it. However, I have been unable to retrieve the email account that it is linked to, despite repeat attempts. The new recovery process seems foolish, as anyone
 who has forgotten their password, has also likely forgotten the necessary info for recovery. Hey ho</p>

    <title>Touch Pad BUTTONS no longer work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Touch Pad BUTTONS no longer work</h2>
                    <p><span>Laptop Touchpad Buttons Stopped Working</span></p>
<p><span>It is not a driver issue. It is not a program issue. It is not a touchpad issue.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue is in MS Downloads from Win 10.</span></p>
<p><span>Easy To Follow Details Below; Thank you.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have a script for registry (or a fix) . . . Dell Alps Touchpad Buttons have stopped working on win 7 after the MS Office Suite download.
</span></p>
<p><span>I know this is not being caused by the Office Suite 2010 download. I am relatively certain this is being caused by MS downloads. Many people on the net are having the same issues no matter which touchpad they are using; it's always the buttons not
 working. But there are no fixes that I know of other than to delete MS Suites, Word, Outlook, etc. I need these programs.
</span></p>
<p><span>History: </span></p>
<p><span>I was happy for many years with win 7. Even after downloading the Office Suite a few years ago, I had no issues; everything was great for years. But I made a mistake five months ago when I upgraded to win10. Even then, though, everything worked great
 all this time until about three weeks ago on the last MS download. That’s when the touchpad buttons stopped working. They would/will work every once in a while. They completely stop working while inside Word and Outlook. That means I cannot copy and paste
 inside Word, and as an online masters student, I need these programs very badly every day.</span></p>
<p><span>It was so bad that I had to use my Dell reinstallation disc, get rid of 10 and went back to factory settings for win 7 using the reinstallation disc. After doing this, everything was great again until I re-downloaded the MS Office Suite; and now the
 buttons on the touchpad are not working again, which helps me to know the issue is in MicroSoft Downloads, not the Suite program and not Alps drivers. I've deleted the drivers, restarted, and went to Dell's drivers and redownloaded it. It's not the drivers,
 and it's not Office 2010. I deleted windows.old in Disk Clean Up. But you know how the registry may be causing this, and there may be some win10 stuff lingering in the registry. I believe it’s a win10 issue, even though win10 was deleted from my system from
 the Reinstallation disc when I went back to win 7.</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft will not address this very serious issue because they want everybody to switch to win10. The only way to do that successfully is to purchase a new system with 10 on it.
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you;</span></p>
<p><span>Gary</span></p>

            I have never seen anything about this before. &nbsp; While it may be an incompatibility issue triggered by Office, the issue is with the touchpad and its drivers and the only way to overcome it will be to obtain a new driver that works with WIndows 10, or use
 an external mouse.

<p>I'm not running win10. </p>
<p>However, I have tried all the Dell touch pad alps drivers for this system from their inception, and none work. The buttons on the touch pad work great until Office 2010 opens. This never happened until the win10 upgrade from 7 to 10. That's why I got rid
 of 10 and am back to 7 on a clean hd. There is something lingering with 10 causing the issue, even though I'm using 7.

            However, I downgraded back to win 7 Pro and actually prefer this os because my system was built for win 7. The fan seldom runs now; and when it does, never more than level one&nbsp;(which had nothing to do with the other--I'm just mentioning this because of
 how great win 7 works on this Dell Latitude E5520). &nbsp;

<p>comprei um One no lançamento. mas este&nbsp; mês o controle parou de ligar. "uso pilhas recarregáveis nele" levei para uma eletrônica local, onde abrimos ele e descobrimos o defeito em um componente "SMD 1acmd"&nbsp;&nbsp; gostaria de saber se alguém sabe onde posso comprar
 este componente.&nbsp; ou similar pois não encontro em lugar nenhum,ou se nao caso alguém tenha algum controle sucata e puder me "doar" agradeço kkkk</p>

<p>Bom.. Se o XONE estiver na Garantia Visite a Aba: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/pt-BR/browse/xbox-one/warranties-and-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../warranties-and-repair</a></p>
<p>OBS: Selecione Opção de Garantia pelo Console, mesmo sendo apenas o controle !! Você pode tirar suas dúvidas Referente a Garantia...</p>
<p>e a Microsoft disse que se o XONE foi danificado independente se foi controle, kinect etc..em um prazo de 90 dias eles Reparam por conta própria!</p>
<p>Agora... Se passou da Garantia, Você pode mesmo assim contatar o Suporte do XONE e Perguntar Sobre Lugares Autorizados a venda de Peças, Contate Aqui:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/pt-BR/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a></p>
<p>OBS: Aconselho a Não comprar em Lojinhas mesmo que ela seja Bonita e Organizada por dentro, pode ser que a peça não seja original, e eu que não arrisco por uma peça não original em um XONE , pois pode Danificar ainda Mais em um futuro... Espero ter Ajudado,
 Caso tenha alguma dúvida eu posso te ajudar, me adiciona nos Amigos e a gente conversa!</p>

    <title>Auto-renewal off, still charged. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxleebee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto-renewal off, still charged.</h2>
                    
<p>This account was mainly used for local play. It was used on Call of Duty and Minecraft back in February for (I believe) one day each. Auto-renewal is off and this account hasn't even signed in since March 10th, and that was while our primary account was
 already signed in, so technically the "activity" was just copying whatever the primary account was doing. Theoretically, the account wasn't even being used.
<br />
Before that, it was used on February 17th for Call of Duty and the 4th for Minecraft. Basically, just looking at my account history, it was used once a month, and sometimes it wasn't used at all for over a month.<br />
<em>This is just demonstrating how little the account has been used, I'm not here to question the use of the account, though.</em><br />
<br />
<br />
If auto-renewal is off, why was I charged $10 in March (I may have turned auto-renewal off before or after the March billing, so this doesn't concern me), and now $20 here in April? I simply ask because we turned off auto-renewal and deleted the account from
 the Xbox, and now I'm being charged $20, which put the funds on hold in my bank account until the 23rd. I'm living on kind of a tight budget at the moment (hence turning off auto-renewal) and that $20 was supposed to be my gas money until pay day on the 25th,
 so this is kind of an inconvenience.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I guess the whole point of this post is.. <br />
Why do I have an funds on hold for $20 to Microsoft, if auto-renewal is off, I didn't sign into the account, and I didn't manually purchase anything?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
inb4 "you're an idiot", "you did this/that wrong", "this is your fault", etc responses I know are inevitably coming.</p>

<p>Hey there! Man, I am definitely sorry to hear you got hit with a charge you weren't expecting. 20$ doesn't sound quite right for just one month of renewal. &nbsp;Let's check out the billing history on
<a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://commerce.microsoft.com</a> and see what's up with that fee, if you don't recognize it you can hit up a billing agent here:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> &nbsp;If it does look like the expected charges, then you can also confirm that renewal is off, and that should be the last we see of anything like that.</p>

<p>Hey can I ask are you being charged about 19.98 for two month of xbox live and well to let you know that if your card goes in declined state you can still play xbox live so then when its time to take out for the next month, then that is when you will see
 this 19.98 for xbox live now if you dont want to be getting billed like this I would have to say you need to remove your card off your account and get a prepaid month card.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgrade my Windows 7 pro machines (HP &amp; Dell) to Windows 10 Pro. I am getting the following error on startup. RunDLL</p>
<p>There was a problem starting C:\Program&nbsp; The specific module could not be found. I can go into start up and disable the message "Windows Host Process (Rundll32) and it goes away. Do you have any ideas what this may be. I think it is related to programs that
 the upgrade found that were not compatible with Windows 10. It seems to be happening on HP and Dell laptops and not all of them. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to run SFC scan and check if any of the system files are missing or have got corrupted.

<p>Where do Internet Options get the personal certificate information, and how is this different from certmgr.msc&nbsp;? What could be the reason the personal certificates present in certmgr.msc are not present in IE options, and how can this be solved ?</p>
<p>Solutions proposed in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7/ie-will-not-install-certificates/c0ffdeaf-e538-4767-971f-969ea696aece?page=1">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing certificates in the user profile could be due to the previous user profile being corrupted. Hence,&nbsp;you may continue using the new one and transfer your data from previous user profile to the new one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>E</strong> to open File Explorer</p>
<p>b. Double-tap or double-click the drive that Windows is installed on (typically, the
<strong>C: drive</strong>).</p>
<p>c. Double-tap or double-click the <span><strong>Users</strong> </span>folder.</p>
<p>d. Double-tap or double-click&nbsp;previous user name (click new user name in the other file explorer)</p>
<p>e. Open the folders that contain the files you want to retrieve.</p>
<p>f. Copy data from previous user and paste it in the new user profile's library.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><em>Please ensure you transfer all the data to new user account before your delete the old user account.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to delete old user account:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press the <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and then select
<strong>Computer Management</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Now, select <strong>Local users and groups</strong> and then <strong>Users</strong>.</p>
<p>c. Now, right click on the account that you want to delete and click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

    <title>Latest update caused dvd and printer to be unrecognizable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mperemsky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest update caused dvd and printer to be unrecognizable</h2>
                    <p>My machine kept failing to install the 1709 cumulative&nbsp;update. I followed the instructions here&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/2018-04-cumulative-update-for-windows-10-version/43723fa7-93ec-482f-a07f-6f11a80d2348">Fix</a><br />
</p>
<p>After running the updates I noticed that my cd rom was no longer functioning. It showed up under device manager with a marker that said the driver was not signed, but nothing else. Windows said the latest driver was installed. however, I could not get the
 machine to recognize anything inserted into it. I uninstalled the driver and reinstalled it, which did not work. I uninstalled the ide and dvd drivers and reinstalled them and that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same with the printer, I had to scan something but the printer was not found. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver software but it failed to find the printer after reinstalling the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am forced to look for a laptop in the house to install Windows 7 on. I would love to resolve the Windows 10 problems. However, I am not a fan of Microsoft thinking they know better than me and forcing these updates onto my machine that are
 constantly breaking it. I suppose they are right, they are protecting me. If I can't use the machine it can't get a virus!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi mperemsky, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Up until this morning the latest update had been repeatedly failing to install. For whatever reason, it succeeded this morning and the printer is now working again. I had fixed the DVD issue with the suggestion from a previous post so, not sure if the addition
 of the additional update "also corrected" this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, This is the reason I held off on applying updates to begin with. If I had a stable system I didn't want to break it. Last night I needed both my scanner and my DVD to complete time sensitive tasks and had to scramble around this morning
 to find alternate solutions. I am very put off with this forced updating of my machine.</p>
