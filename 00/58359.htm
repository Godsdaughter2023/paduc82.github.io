            Hi PG.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's a browser hijacker that collects your personal information.  
<br />
<br />Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Check for any remainders in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, and also in each of your browser's Extensions or Add-On's as shown here:  <a href="https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-Account/How-To-Disable-Plugins-Add-Ons-Extensions-In-Multiple-Browsers/ta-p/19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-...</a>
<br />
<br />Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can disable its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Accounts tab.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>MBR ERROR PRESS A KEY - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadetree1  say:</h3>
<h2>            MBR ERROR PRESS A KEY</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I boot after installing Win7 Pro the error listed will halt.&nbsp; Depressing a key will then load the new Win 7 boot manager&nbsp;and selecting either Win 7 Pro or earlier Windows&nbsp;version (XP Pro) will continue fine.</p>
<p>After a&nbsp;week of not being able to reboot unattended (bugs me), I am asking for help.</p>
<p>One question not to go off topic,&nbsp;can my Win 7 HDD have two MBR's on it?</p>
<p>I have three HDD's with Win 7 and XP on their own drives and storage on the other.&nbsp; The BIOS is set&nbsp;to load the Win 7 drive first.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;tried to fix&nbsp;this with the Win&nbsp;7 recover image and the installation DVD both&nbsp;reporting no startup&nbsp;errors.</p>
<p>Thank you for any help,</p>
<p>shadetree1</p>
<p>PS.&nbsp; The new boot loader is nice!&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK TrekDozer,&nbsp;</p>
<p>You got me thinking about BCD and I went poking around the root of my drives discovering all the&nbsp;drive's information was on the XP root.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to test this theory I select booted&nbsp;the XP drive instead of 7 and OMG, it loaded the WBM.</p>
<p>Changed the BIOS&nbsp;preferred HDD&nbsp;drive&nbsp;to Win XP and all is&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Strange that&nbsp;the&nbsp;installer loaded the Manager on the XP drive?&nbsp; That is why&nbsp;I was thinking of two MBR's on the 7 drive.&nbsp; I guess there was two MBR's I was dealing with to boot.</p>
<p>Thank you much for&nbsp;helping me,</p>

<p>Each of the System Tools has its own "exe" or "msc" program. Most of these programs are located in the C:\Windows\System32 folder.&nbsp; Accessories\System Tools is a folder in your Start Menu, which contains shortcuts to the various System Tools.&nbsp; It is most
 unlikely that you could have deleted the individual programs from Win XP - so I suspect you have merely deleted or moved the folder that contains the shortcuts.</p>
<p>The first thing to check is whether you have really deleted the "missing" folder .&nbsp; If it is still in your Recycle bin, you can restore it to its proper location..</p>
<p>If the System Tools Folder is not in the Recycle bin, you might have moved it to an incorrect location.&nbsp; To check this possibility, click on Start / Run... - and type explorer.exe in the "Open" field.&nbsp; This will open Windows Explorer.&nbsp; Expand the folder
 tree and scroll down to "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories".</p>
<p>Your "System Tools" folder might be very close to its proper location, so look nearby for the "missing" folder.&nbsp; If you find it, move it back to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories\.</p>
<p>If you can't see the "System Tools" folder anywhere in Windows Explorer, you will need to search your entire hard drive.&nbsp; Open the search menu and click on "All files and folders".&nbsp; Type System Tools in the file name field.&nbsp; Then, under Advanced Options,
 you should include system folders, hidden files and folders, and sub-folders in the search criteria.&nbsp; Perform a full search for the missing file.</p>
<p>If the search locates the missing folder, move it back to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories\.</p>
<p>If the System Tools&nbsp; folder really is missing from your system, you could re-create the folder.&nbsp; To do so, open Windows Explorer and scroll down to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories.&nbsp; Then, click on File / New and create
 a new sub-folder named System Tools.</p>
<p>Open the new, System Tools folder and create a separate shortcut for each of the system tools.&nbsp; Each shortcut should point to the correct location, as follows:</p>
<p>System Information = "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\MSInfo\msinfo32.exe"<br />
Files and Settings Transfer Wizard = "C:\Windows\system32\usmt\migwiz.exe"<br />
Character Map = "C:\Windows\system32\charmap.exe"<br />
Backup = "C:\Windows\system32\ntbackup.exe"<br />
System Restore = "C:\Windows\system32\restore\rstrui.exe"<br />
Disk Defragmenter = "C:\Windows\system32\dfrg.msc"<br />
Disk Cleanup = "C:\Windows\system32\cleanmgr.exe"</p>

<p>Bob,&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I am somewhat, ok very much, computer illiterate and it took me a while to figure out how to create a separate shortcut for each of the system tools.&nbsp; But, I figured it out.&nbsp; I created a shortcut for each of the files you said
 to do.&nbsp; However, when I tried to create a shortcut for Backup, I get the following error message; The file C:\Windows\system32\ntbackup.exe cannot be found.<br />
<br />
After I created the shortcuts, I then opened up both Disk Defragmenter &amp; Disk Cleanup and both opened up and ran.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any idea on what's wrong with the Backup address?&nbsp; I copied and pasted your shortcut address as to not make any spelling mistakes.<br />
<br />
Thanks for you help!!!<br />

<p>Are you using the Windows XP Home Edition or Windows XP Professional?</p>
<p>By default, Win XP Home Edition does not include the Backup utility.&nbsp; However, you could search your hard drive for a file named ntbackup.exe, to check whether Backup is installed on your computer.&nbsp; Don't worry, if it is missing.</p>
<p>Incidentally, you will find a complete list of Accessories shortcuts at www.hm2k.com/posts/missing-accessories-shortcuts-from-start-menu-on-windows-xp.</p>
<p>The most important utilities are System Information, Character Map, System Restore, Disk Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; I wouldn't bother to create additional shortcuts for other tools that might be missing (with the possible exception of the Scheduled
 Tasks utility).</p>
<p>I hope my response has helped.&nbsp; If so, please click on the "vote as helpful" option in the Desktop and Personalization forum.</p>

<p>Can this be done or am I just better off removing the hard disc and throwing the computer?</p>
<p>I have deleted everything &amp; emptied the recycle bin, but I have read that this does not permenantly delete the files &amp; that they could be recovered by someone with the right knowhow.</p>

            <p>Sorry, first post was not very clear.</p>
<p>The old computer that I want to completely delete all my files &amp; pictures but not the operating system and give away originaly came with Xp which I upgraded to Windows 7.</p>
<p>I do not have an Xp disc &amp; only have a Windows 7 disc that upgraded Xp to Windows 7.</p>
<p>So I can't use software to erase everything off my hard drive including operating system as I would have to reload Xp first which I do not have a disk for.</p>
<p>My new computer has Windows 8 installed.</p>
<p>Does this make more sense?</p>

            <p>Perhaps I am being over cautious.</p>
<p>However, my wife accidentally deleted her entire pictures folder and all she had to do was purchase a program, quite cheaply, that recovered everything that had ever been deleted, since the computer was bought,&nbsp;off the hard disk not just the pictures she
 had lost.</p>
<p>So I do not want to run the risk of having all my &amp; my family's personal files &amp; photographs being looked at by complete strangers.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best thing to do is remove the hard disk &amp; throw the computer to be safe.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the imformation Ken.</p>
<p>I would format the drive but I only have the upgrade disc so could not reinstall an operating system as I did not get an Xp disk when I bought the Computer from Dell all those years ago.</p>
<p>I also read on another post that Formatting does not get rid of the files either.</p>
<p>Don't know if that is true though.</p>
<p>No secret files,&nbsp;a lot of family history though that would be an identity thief's dream come true.</p>
<p>You obviously know what your talking about and I thank you for taking the time to answer my question but the world being the way it is today I don't think I will take the risk.</p>
<p>I already get enough&nbsp;e-mail&nbsp;telling me&nbsp;their is a problem with my bank account and can I "log in" to sort it out.</p>
<p>Only problem, I don't bank with any of the banks the e-mails are from.</p>
<p>Would not like my computer to&nbsp;end up in&nbsp;these peoples hands.</p>
<p>I think I have 2 Choices.</p>
<p>Remove my hard drive or use a programe that completely and permenantly removes everything off the hard drive including operating system.</p>
<p>Paranoid? Possibly.</p>
<p>I will check that website out you have posted&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>Thanks again Ken.</p>

<p>Why would I want to pay $99 to put Windows 7&nbsp;on a computer I&nbsp;am going to give away?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            .Can&#39;t print in Home Group. Error&#58; &#34;Windows couldn&#39;t connect to printer. Check the printer name and try again.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: .Can't print in Home Group</p>
<p>Trying to print from LapTop in Homegroup. Tried installing printer to laptop. It will search and find the printer but when I try to install it&nbsp; wont's let me. Gives msg about checking to be sure path is correct. All permission blocks in homegroup are checked
 on both computers. I can see the homegroup members and access files on each. However Can not print from laptop (printer is connected to PC) there is no printer.&nbsp; I go to Device and printers in control panel,&nbsp; and add printer, add a network printer, it searches
 and finds the printer on the PC/homegroup. Hoeever, when I select it and click next it tries&nbsp; to install it but fails and it tells me "Windows couldn't connect to printer. Check the printer name and try again.If this is a network printer make sure that the
 printer is turned on and that the printer address is correct." Printer is on and I can print from connected PC. It previously worked. Tried to correct problem and finally tried reinstalling Win 7 on LapTop. Problem continues.<br />
<br />
Also when I open Home Group and get the "Change Homegroup settings" page, I do not get the message that Homegroup has found a new shared printer on the network etc. So I do not get the option to install one.<br />

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the printer?</span></span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b><span> Try the steps in</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-print-to-a-printer-in-my-homegroup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-print-to-a-printer-in-my-homegroup</span></span></a>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:
</span></b><b><span>Reinstall the printer by adding a port:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click start and click Control Panel, Printers, and delete offline printers. If they won’t delete, it may be because there are pending print jobs in the queue.
 Open the printer and Cancel the jobs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Printer properties, Ports tab, delete the previously installed printers (offline status) that appear as Client Side Rendering Provider under the Description
 column. To do this, highlight the port, then click on Delete Port button. Click Apply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now reinstall the printers as follows:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Control panel, Printers, and click Add a printer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Add a local printer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the "Use an existing port" radio button, and select LPT1: (Printer Port).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Install the printer driver.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When adding the printer and creating a local port, you will be prompted to select driver.&nbsp;You can either select Have Disk or specify the location of the associated .inf driver file.&nbsp;Proceed with installing the printer and test the ability to printer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next window, accept the printer name or type in a new name. Leave the "Set as default printer" box unchecked. Click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should now install the printer. A window should open saying "You've successfully added printer name.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DO NOT Print a test page at this time, because nothing is connected to the LPT1 port on the laptop. Just press Finish. The printer you just added should appear
 in the Printers window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click ONCE on the newly added printer to highlight it, then right-click and open Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Ports tab, click Add Port, select Local Port, then click New Port.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Port Name window open, Enter a port name as follows: \\servername\printername (replace servername with the name of your PC or the servername acting
 as print server, and printername with the name of your printer). Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;k.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should now have a new port listed on the Ports tab of the printer Properties, but now the Description should be Local Port, instead of Client Side Rendering
 Provider. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;l.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can go to the General tab, and Print a Test Page.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Asking for Product Key&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>- ( Windows 7 64bit Upgrading to Windows 10 )&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started to install the upgrade about 24 Hours ago ( At least 5 Hours before free offer ended ) It got all the way up to 99% and it just stayed like that for about 6 Hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently there is a fix that if you turn off updates or whatever it should work,&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I restart my computer and launch the Update Assistant and it starts to work and goes past 99%&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it is telling me that I have to enter a product key !?!? &nbsp; Is this because I had to restart my computer because it would not even get passed 99% !?!?!?</p>

            I know it ended yesterday that is why I started upgrading 6hours before, But their software did not work so it was stuck at 99% for few hours then when I manage to find a fix then restart it, It asks me for a key. Such bs, I'm not going to buy windows
 10 because of their software not working as it should.

<p>I have updated the bios filmware through the device manager of windows.</p>
<p>After the dowloading of the update it asked me to reboot the system .</p>
<p>After rebooting msi logo apppeared normally, and some additional prossess had started ,performing some bios configurations saying something like &nbsp;“please wait”. (It was in the booting phase ,it had not entered windows &nbsp;yet)</p>
<p>After that the laptop restarted but no msi logo appeared and only black screen was seen.</p>
<p>I tried the delete button and all other f buttons to entrer the bios but it is dead, nothing happened .</p>
<p>When i press the on button i hear the fans spinning i see thebacklit of the keyboard on but the screen is just black. No logos ,nothing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried to unplug i from dc and press continously the on button.it didnt work .(i cannot remove my battery because its internal.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>do you have any ideas on how to procced , or that might be the problem?</p>
<p>thank you.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mobile SD Card Encryption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christophermilan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile SD Card Encryption</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 950XL in which I have a 64Gb SD Card installed. Unfortunately my work has decided that all media must be encrypted and has therefore blocked me from using the card. My colleague using a Samsung S7 does not have a similar problem as Android
 will encrypt removable media. I was hoping to recommend Windows 10 Mobile as the default OS for my organization as it integrates perfectly with Exchange however I do not want to go down the route of getting a handicapped OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft have any plans to introduce removable media encryption? There is BitLocker on the Go for desktop so I assume that it is something that can be applied to Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider this feature for future releases.</p>

            <p>Hi Nyima</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device encryption is not a problem. My onboard storage on my 950XL is being encrypted correctly. The problem is that W10M will not encrypt SD cards installed on the phone and therefore my organization has blocked access to my SD card. For a phone that has
 so much potential in the work environment this is a major failure. My colleagues Android device has no such problem as his OS can encrypt SD cards. If Bitlocker On The Go exists why doesn't Microsoft also apply it to W10M??</p>

            However, a most basic question would also be "Can Windows Phone 10 read Bitlocker encrypted micro SD cards?" And my answer, from personal experience, is NO. I installed in my cell phone a previously encrypted 32GB&nbsp;micro SD card that I had&nbsp;in my laptop
 PC. I was expecting that my phone (a Lumia 435 with Windows 10) would take care of it and it didn't. I don't think it has to do with the phone model I have, since Windows 10 works perfectly well there. Two things happen: 1) the micro SD on the status bar (on
 top) shows as an icon with the universal&nbsp;sign of "forbidden", i.e. a circle and a crossing line, and 2) when checking "Storage" (Settings / System / Storage) it only shows local storage ("This Device") and the micro SD car is nowhere to be seen. So, I guess,
 for the time being we would have to do without it: No encrypted micro SD in Windows Phone 10. I find that unacceptable. Can Microsoft listen to users and take care of this? This is really crucial, in my view. Thanks.

<p>We are MSFT partners and developers and several of our team are former MSFT Blue Badges, so please take this with the caveat that we are both a) no strangers to Windows in small packages (CE, Mobile, Phone, then Mobile again), and b) we are not here to bash
 MSFT - we are quite pro-MSFT around here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a feature (one of many, sad-to-say) that was AVAILABLE in Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.x - the OS based on Windows CE that came before Windows Phone and Windows 10 for Mobile. See
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/2007/03/26/windows-mobile-6-storage-card-encryption-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this blog entry</a> for more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked very well, very quickly&nbsp;and kept the entire device (phone or palm-able) encrypted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that this is the case, the way we see it, this is just another in a long line of reasons why Windows 10 for Mobile just isn't really cut-out to be a business-class OS (at least, not in the way that CE or the original WinMo was, for small devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also one of several reasons why we don't develop our hand-held platform products on Windows 10 for Mobile. Another&nbsp;reason: the fact that the W10Mo platform might as well be an Apple iOS platform, in the way MSFT keeps a very tight rein over the ability
 to build device-drivers for W10Mo. Our devices require kernel-level drivers to perform well, and MSFT won't give us "approval" to build them, so we're stuck on Android which works but which most of us do not really like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I second that request. If it's truly MSFT's intent to keep making Mobile platforms (vis-à-vis Surface devices, for example), they need to get off the pot. Not to do so would be to cede the ground to Google.</p>

    <title>Account Problem on windows 10 pc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curiosity_009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Problem on windows 10 pc</h2>
                    <p>My Microsoft&nbsp;account does not sync after 2017-09 cumulative update for windows 10 version 1607 for x64-based systems. All my browser data is gone. When&nbsp;I try to check my mail it shows that my outlook account settings are out of date; there is a "Fix Account"
 option, but that does nothing at all. Ironically I can still use my account from a web browser. My Microsoft account is signed in on&nbsp;the device, but when I try to sync it, it shows that I need to sign in to an account in order for syncing. What is the problem
 and how to fix it?<br />
<br />
*Note: I have antivirus software installed and it shows I have no viruses or any sort. So I don't think the problem is with viruses!</p>

            The issue might be the cumulative update recently installed. To isolate the problem, try uninstalling the update to see if functionality is restored.

Press Windows key + R
Type: appwiz.cpl
Hit Enter
Click View installed updates
Select the recent update
Right click it then click uninstall.

Try uninstalling the update to see if it restores functionality.

Click uninstall

Restart your computer then check if your system performs normally.

            You could always reinstall the security update, since the objective is to isolate the problem. But since its installing the new Feature Update, proceed to do that and then check if the issue is resolved. It might take a while.

<h2>            Windows update failing&#58; 0xC8000222.</h2>
                    <p>I just had my hard drive replaced yesterday (windows explorer crashed constantly and when I ran the system check it said the hard drive needed to be replaced). I am using Microsoft VIsta Home edition (32 bit sytem). I just restored windows using the restore
 disks but now I get this error message (0xC8000222) when I try to update windows (to at least service pack 1 or 2 because right now I don't have either). I also get an error that WIndows Update can't be&nbsp;updated because the program isn't runnig and to restart
 my computer (which I did 3 times to no avail). I tried running the "fix it" tool microsoft offers but when it downloaded it it said it could not be run. I hadn't installed Norton yet, but when I did, I could not run the updates from LIve Update either.
</p>
<p>Any Help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

 list of people they send to the upper station even though it was 3-5 days I'll wait longer before recontacting them or maybe I'll just end up having to make a new account and I've only &nbsp;had my account for like 2 months lol</p>

<h2>            Getting hit off Xbox Live by possible DoS or DDoS attack</h2>
                    
<p>I'd like to report a possible DoS or DDoS attack on my IP address last night through Xbox Live. I have two gamer tags i would like to share that i feel are behind the attack. I would like for there to be an investigation on their accounts and hopefully you
 are able to catch and retaliate against the person who has committed the attack. The following gamer tags from xbox 360 who I feel are behind the attack are &nbsp;:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>

<p>Please solve my issue. I don't want there to be anymore issues with these possible attacks associated with these &nbsp;gamer tags and my IP address and i would also like to secure the safety of not only my xbox information but also my PC information as well.
 I would also like to be informed if there is or is not a possibility of the flooding of my IP address with illegal material because therefore i would be in a lot of trouble if that was the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mod Edit: Please do not name and shame on the forums, thank you.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, please do not name and shame on these forums, it is against the rules. File a complaint and block the attackers, if you communicate with the attackers after blocking and doing what I say below, they can start again.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>A [D]DoS Attack is when somebody floods your router or cable modem with useless packets until it crashes. This is a federal crime, which currently give up to a ten-year sentence in the United States (if used in this manner). You will not be in any trouble
 for this unless you were the attacker.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>To stop the grievance, you should shut off your router or cable modem for about 15 minutes, usually getting yourself a new IP address. The attackers need this to send the packets to your router or cable modem. If this does not help, you probably either communicated
 with the attackers again allowing them to get your new IP, or your IP did not change. Contact your ISP (Internet Service Provider) about the issue and they will usually issue a new IP address for you.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Hope this helps, good luck!</p>

<h2>            speech recognition wizard</h2>
                    <p>I have just got a headset which I use with Cortana (Windows 10) with no problems. However, when I try to start the speech recognition it comes up as 'Cannot start speech wizard' and says to check audio settings. As far as I know settings are as they should
 be. What can I do as I would like to use speech recognition on MS Word?</p>

            Hi. Is your microphone working correctly? The message most likely refers to the microphone could not be recognized by the System. Better check it again.

            Thanks for your reply. As I said, I have no trouble using my headset with Cortana. Maybe some extra info might be helpful.&nbsp;I am using a Toshiba laptop and have the headset plugged into the 3.5mm jack. The headset has two plugs - one only connects the microphone
 while the other connects the microphone and the single earphone. When I have gone into hardware and sounds&nbsp;settings, the only microphone shown is the built in one.

<p><br />
I think I lost from here, but do find any error message when you plug the headset's mic-jack? If your system could not identify that the mic of your headset when plugged, the possible things that you need to consider is that the jack or its chord has been compromised,
 or the phone socket of your Toshiba.<br />
<br />
What is the make and model of your Headset? Have you tried contacting their support lines in order to grab more info about the issue?<br />

            The headset has a pink plug (microphone) and pale green (microphone and earphone) which I believe is standard colours. It Is not the headset, as I cannot get the wizard to work even with the built in microphones ( which is recognised).

<p>But have you tried to test your Headset to another computer if it works?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn't it that your headset has its mic?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The fact that the built in laptop mic is recognized by the wizard makes it true that the Headset (Together with its Mic) can no longer be recognized. IF you try plugging it into the computer and you do not receive any error message nor plug-notification
 sound, this would mean that the Headset can no longer be recognized and has been compromised.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please get back to me once you've tried the suggestion --to check if the headset (and its Mic) will work with another computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<br />
IF the Headset (With its Mic) worked perfectly with another computer, then this would mean that our Toshiba laptop - Its jack for mic (PINK ONE) has a problem. To determine this, check if you can use a Microphone with the pink slot. If you are able to record/
 test (what so ever) when using the pink jack with another mic, then your Headset (with its mic) has to be replaced.<br />

            Tried suggestions in the post - no change. To the best of my knowledge the recogniser&nbsp;language does match the&nbsp;language of the user interface. I don't know if this helps, but the recognition 'icon' appears on start up, but after about 5 seconds it disappears
 to be replaced with the error message.

    <title>Windows 10 email problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annehawson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 email problem</h2>
                    <p>In the past couple of days our computer Windows 10 email system has displayed a problem-notice on our email tab for our virgin.net account.&nbsp; At the top of the windows 10 email page appears a cream-coloured line with the words "Your Virgin account settings
 are out of date" and there is a tab saying "Fix account", and a second tab saying "Dismiss".
</p>
<p>Also, there is a little triangle with an exclamation mark inside it, and this sign appears on the tabe for our virgin.net emails.</p>
<p>If I click "Fix account", up comes a square with the words "Attention Required" and below it are boxes asking us to fill in our username (for the virgin.net email) and our password, and it asks us "Please update the password for this account".</p>
<p>We do as it asks us and fill in the various boxes with the password and our email address (virgin.net) and for a few seconds the Warning Triangle with exclamation mark disappears, and the cream line at the top vanishes and the problem appears to have been
 resolved.</p>
<p>But after a few seconds it all comes back!</p>
<p>No matter how many times we do what it asks, this nuisance keeps recurring. </p>
<p>This seems (to me) to be a problem with the Microsoft Windows system: I say this because when I go onto the internet and go to the Virgin media email webpage, we can easily and quickly log in there to see and send emails.</p>
<p>What is the matter with the Windows system?</p>
<p>Why does this nuisance happen?</p>
<p>Why does it not get resolved?</p>
<p>What should we (or you) do?</p>

            <p>If you were a ASDL Virginmedia user then it's possible that your account has been closed, all ASDL users were transferred to Talk Talk early last year &amp; users had a year to transfer their emails to another address.&nbsp;<br />
There's a lot of posts on the Virginmedia forum with users having similar problems with virgin.net addresses.</p>
<p>You could try deleting the account &amp; recreating it rather than choosing fix which imo doesn't work.</p>

    <title>Unable to extend drive C - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel avitha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to extend drive C</h2>
                    My computer came with a 320 GB hard disk with pre-loaded Vista. The partition of the Hard disk is as follows:<br />
C: 20 GB NTFS System, Boot, Page File, Active, Crash Dump, Primary Partition<br />
D: 15 GB FAT32 Primary Partition<br />
E: 265 GB NTFS Primary Partition<br />
<br />
Currently the free space is as follows:<br />
C:&nbsp; &nbsp;1%<br />
D: 80%<br />
E: 92%<br />
<br />
The free space in C: drive was only 8%(1.7GB) even on purchase of the computer, with Vista Home Basic preloaded. Currently the C:Windows folder takes 16 GB space, meaning that very few programs are installed in C: drive. Since the free space in C: is dangerously
 low at 300MB, I have tried to extend the volume, without success. Over the past year, as the free space became less and less, I have tried everything I know, like Disk Cleanup. Uninstalling programs installed in C: and re-installing in E:, moving the mail
 folder to E:, clearing log files&nbsp;and so on.<br />
<br />
Is there any other way of reducing the C: drive disk space used by Vista? <br />
<br />
The files in D: are very important because the&nbsp;computer manufacturer(HCL India)&nbsp;providing us with a their own Restore System, which is installed here. Since this program is working out&nbsp;good for error&nbsp;recover,&nbsp;deleting this volume or moving the contents of this
 volume is not an option.<br />
<br />
So is there are any way the free space in E: be used to extend C:?<br />

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
To extend any partition you need either unallocated space or a spare partition right next to it, i.e, to the right of the C: drive; and even then I would trust Windows Vista disk managment tools to extend the drive, I would much prefer third party partitioning
 software such as Paragon Disk Manager Suite (see this review on my website of the 2008 edition);
<a href="http://www.winuser.co.uk/reviews/paragon_hard_disk_manager_suite_2008.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.winuser.co.uk/reviews/paragon_hard_disk_manager_suite_2008.html</a><br />
<br />
What you basically need to do is to delete the E partition (assuming there is nothing on it, if there is then thins needs backing up to a removable hard drive). This will now give you unallocated space. Next create a temporary partition andf copy the conents
 of youe D: partition to it (remember that your D: drive is currently FAT32 so make sure the new tempoery partiton you create is also FAT32) Once the D: drive is empty delete the D: drive. You shoud now have unallocated space right next to your C: partition.
 Now using something like Paragon Disk manager you should be able to extend your C: drive into, what originally, was your D: drive. Your temporary partition you used to copy your D: drive will then appear next to the C: partition. It may not have the same drive
 letter as before, but that can be changed to bring it back to D:, even though it is somewhat fiddly to do so.<br />
<br />
Either way you are going to have to move the D: partition in order to accomplish what you want to do.

<p>&nbsp;QUOTE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Probably too late to help the OP, but for others: SpeedyPC Pro is a scam. It is also directly tied to their payment processing company, "Safecart". Neither is US-based making it a mess to try to get refunds...or repairs. It pops up if you're unknowingly
 trying to email an exceedingly large file or search using terms like "slow PC", "sluggish", "email won't load" etc etc. Lesson 1- NEVER buy software that magically shows up when you're having problems. Once it's downloaded, paid for (usually Paypal-to-Safecart)
 you are asked to "activate" it - requiring remote access to your PC. Lesson 2 - any unknown, non brand-name software support person should NEVER be allowed remote access...even major companies should be allowed only controlled access, usually spelled out in
 the user agreement (which is vital reading for any software "requiring" external/remote access. If folders or files appear missing, renamed, moved etc. and you call support, you will again be asked for remote access. Do not allow it. They will then state the
 only other support level is paid support (usually $300 or so, with the price dropping if you vacillate). Lesson 3 - refuse paid support. Then, when it's obvious you're in trouble, you will want to remove it - which they will help you with if you allow them
 REMOTE ACCESS!.. Again, you MUST refuse. You can ask for email instructions, which they will promise to send - and never do. You can ask to speak to a supervisor, and will be placed on hold - forever. You can remove the software - but it will leave some visible
 and more hidden files and folders you CAN'T see, even if you tick the "show hidden files and folders" box. You can do a system restore - same problem, not everything is gone. In a recent situation, after several requests for removal instructions via email
 and assurance they cannot still a system after the software is "removed", activity was noted...external access. The computer was immediately taken offline. Lesson 4 - you can't fix it yourself. Bottom line - removal of this **** is requiring a trip to an expert
 tech shop, where the hard drive will be removed, *hopefully* critical files saved, the drive wiped clean and the system reloaded from scratch. Not a cheap fix, and the $30 purchase price won't begin to cover the charges. There's also no way to go after them
 as so many layers are involved. If you've never heard of it, can't find reviews by major players (Cnet and such) avoid it like the plague. And if it's too late, not only have your PC wiped but re-set ALL passwords (resetting user names is also a good idea)
 and re-set the security on your home or business network. (FWIW the first review site says "SpeedyPC Pro Exposed?" - and is "comparepcsoftware.com, coincidentally owned by the same company as SpeedyPC Pro. That should give you a clear indication of how they
 work). There is plenty of quality, name band software out there. And some small outfits produce great stuff - but they market through normal channels and if truly good will have reviews by known experts. SpeedyPC Pro is a very, very costly way to find out
 how software doesn't work and how data retrieval DOES. Here's a simple, clear rating site. It'll give you a pretty good idea of where they stand: http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/www.speedypc.com PS - The fact that they are a Microsoft Partner surprises me
 not at all."</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Rewards Missing Xbox Live Gold</h2>
                    Resolved: As of 4/15/19 the rewards redemption store does not display the 3 or 12 month Xbox Live Gold options. When will they be back? I see in the past that they needed to be "restocked" is that the case this time as well?

<p><span>Hi Russ,</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>When was the last time it was working fine?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Are you able to start the service manually?</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest that you manually try to start the Windows Search service and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>
 type&nbsp; <strong>services.msc</strong> in the <span>search</span> box, and then click&nbsp;
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the&nbsp;<strong>Services (Local)</strong> list, right-click&nbsp; <strong>Windows Search</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 the&nbsp;<strong>Startup type</strong> drop-down list is set to a value of &nbsp;<strong>Disable</strong>, select the&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Automatic</strong>option from the &nbsp;<strong>Startup type</strong> drop-down list, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the<strong>File</strong> menu, and then click &nbsp;<strong>Exit</strong>. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step fails then refer the below link and run the microsoft fixit tool available.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Windows search is not working and search is slow or shuts down</span></strong></span></p>
