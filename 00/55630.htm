                    <p>can anyone tell me how I enlarge my own video image that normally appears in the top left hand corner of the screen. Before the Sky updates it used to be about 4cm x4cm now its smaller than a stamp and I can seem to enlarge. Main video of the other person

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are using the Skype for Windows 10, please be advised that option to enlarge your call monitor is not available. It was design by
 default. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you wish to have enlarge call monitor, we suggest for you to use the classic Skype version.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have further questions, kindly let us know.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This issue could occur due to incompatible or corrupted device drivers. Let’s try to follow these methods below which can help us resolving this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:&nbsp;Run audio troubleshooter.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>You might be able to solve some problems by running a troubleshooter that will automatically fix some common issues with audio.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows key</span></strong>&nbsp;on your keyboard</span></li><li><span>Type&nbsp;<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>..</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>view all</strong>&nbsp;(on the left)<br />
</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Playing&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>Audio&nbsp;</span></strong><span>troubleshooter</span></span></li><li><span>Follow the prompted steps to troubleshoot this issue.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If the issue persist, follow method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></span></strong><strong>Update&nbsp;the sound drivers.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Check for the latest driver update through Windows Updates.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>At the Start screen, type&nbsp;</span><span>Windows Update</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click or tap&nbsp;</span><span>Settings</span><span>&nbsp;on the right side of the screen, and then select&nbsp;</span><span>Install</span><span>&nbsp;optional updates from the left results.</span></li><li><span>When the&nbsp;</span><span>Windows Update</span><span>&nbsp;control panel opens, click on “</span><span>Check for Updates</span><span>” on the top left corner to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Incompatible or not properly installed graphics card drivers are the most common cause of this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2: Follow the steps below to update the sound drivers.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows + X</span></strong>&nbsp;key on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Go to&nbsp;<strong><span>device manager.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Right-click your&nbsp;<strong><span>audio/sound&nbsp;devices.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Update Driver Software</span></strong>&nbsp;and then follow the steps in the wizard that appears.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Check in</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>compatibility mode.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Download the drivers from the computer manufacture's website&nbsp;for Windows 10, if not available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on&nbsp;<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>‘compatibility’</strong>&nbsp;tab and check the box&nbsp;<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong>&nbsp;and select Windows 8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>

<p><span>Is %SystemRoot%\MyPrograms\PFE\pfe.exe % 1, really the location of your program? I used the MyPrograms folder as an example, also there shouldn’t
 be a space between the % and 1.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Associations are shown in the registry (and can be changed rather than using assoc and ftype) as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>1.
</span><span>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. In the left pane, look for the extension, for example .txt. The (Default) field in the right pane contains the filetype, e.g. txtfile.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. In the left pane, scroll down beyond the extensions and look for the filetype, for example txtfile then click
 shell\open\command. In the right pane, the (Default) field shows the full path of the program that opens it, e.g. notepad.exe.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE. If there are any registry entries in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes, they take precedence over the HKCR keys. Equally,
 if there are any entries in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes they take precedence over both the HKLM and HKCR keys.</span></p>

    <title>No audio, &#39;No Audio Output Device Is Installed&#39;, have already - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoff_903  say:</h3>
<h2>            No audio, &#39;No Audio Output Device Is Installed&#39;, have already updated BIOS and chipset and drivers, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>There is the dreaded red 'x' over the little speaker icon in the lower right of my screen ('No, &nbsp;Audio Output Device Is Installed'), and when I look into device manager, under Sound Video and Game Controllers, it says 'Realtek High Definition Audio', with
 a yellow exclamation mark next to it. Under System Devices, it lists 'High Definition Audio Controller', also with a yellow exclamation point next to it.</p>
<p>When the problem first surfaced, I went to my laptops maker's website (it is an Acer Aspire 5 481PT), and downloaded the chipset, urned off my virus checker, and installed it, then I downloaded the audio drivers for it, and installed them. The rest of the
 machine works fine, so I can't guess what had gone wrong before, so that there is no sound. I am getting the Device cannot start, Code 10 error, in Device Manager. I opened the machine and checked the connections to the audio board, and they're fine. I even
 tried "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement" upon booting up, but the yellow exclamation points remain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the Media Registry and noticed this-<br />
Media&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4D36E96C-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Audio and video devices&nbsp;&nbsp; -there were no UpperFilters and LowerFilters valuess to change. Does that have anything to do with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also looked at this Microsoft.com help page, http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/no-audio-output-device-for-windows-10/c7ce9fa7-9ce8-42e4-84dc-e704fff47cb8&nbsp;&nbsp; and it says -&nbsp; if you expand "Sound, video and game controllers"
 (two up from "System Devices") "There should be a Realtek entry there, and it'll have "VEN_10EC" somewhere in the hardware ID."&nbsp; But there is nothing like that there.</p>
<p>And I don't have this in Services.msc&nbsp; -"Multimedia Class Scheduler"&nbsp; ( Mmcss.sys ), maybe that's not important either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done chkdsk /r and chkdsk /f&nbsp; as well as sfc /scannow in safe mode, and yet nothing seems to be wrong. When I run dxdiag, it says under Sound, "No sound card was found.&nbsp; If one is expected, you should install a sound driver provided by the hardware
 manufacturer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally tried the Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /source:wim:<strong>X</strong>:\sources\install.wim:1 /limitaccess&nbsp; trick (I mounted it and used the command prompt, but it didn't fix my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get one error, "Error detected in index $I30 for file 65592", but I have no idea if that means anything important. Also, the ffdshow codec comes up as an error, but I don't know what, or where, that is, and suspect it isn't important, either. Both
 the Windows Audio and the Windows Audio End Point Builder services are running. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what to try next? Am hoping to avoid a reset.</p>

</p><p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your efforts to work on this issue is very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have not yet tried this then suggest you to uninstall the audio driver from the Device Manager and restart the pc so that the default driver would get loaded.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to completely uninstall the audio driver and restart the computer to reinstall the default drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press “Windows key + X” and click on “Device Manager”.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the list of devices, you should see the audio or sound drivers.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right click on the driver and then select "Uninstall".</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the Action menu of Device manager, select “<strong>Scan for Hardware changes”
</strong>option. This will cause the device driver to be reinstalled. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Review Windows Update. The Windows Update service is a key item to review. Windows Update may have updated drivers available that may be relevant to your current issue. Many times, updated drivers are listed in the "Optional"
 section of Windows Update. Install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.</span></p>

            <p>Yes I've tried every possible combination of uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers.&nbsp; I have installed all Windows Updates all along, I'm sure I have all the ones including those that were marked optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the speaker icon lower right on the screen, it tells me there are no playback devices, and no recording devices.&nbsp; "No audio devices are installed." That sounds pretty bleak to me.<br />
<br />
Under the "Sound, Video and Game Controllers" in Device Manager, it lists:<br />
Realtek High Definition Audio&nbsp; (with the yellow exclamation mark); I noticed that when I right clicked on it, and get the Properties pop up, it then says for 'Events':<br />
Device ROOT\MEDIA\0002 was deleted.<br />
Class Guid: {4D36E96C-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sure what to do about that.<br />
<br />
When I deleted and reinstalled the Realtek drivers, I checked the same properties pop up/'Events' tab for Realtek High Definition Audio, and this is what I got:<br />
Driver Management has concluded the process to add Service IntcAzAudAddService for Device Instance ID ROOT\MEDIA\0003 with the following status: 0.<br />
<br />
When I right-click on High Definition Audio Controller (which also has the yellow exclamation mark) , it tells me the Device cannot start, Error Code 10, and for the "Resources" tab for this item, it says:<br />
"This device isn't using any resources because it has a problem" and it says "The installation failed because a function driver was not specified for this device instance."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am running out of ideas. Any suggestions appreciated.</p>

            I guess I'm wondering if it is my board that needs replacing, or if it is just a Registry problem? The&nbsp; dxdiag check said that 'No sound card was found.'&nbsp; And the 'Resources' tab in Device Mangager for the audio driver says 'The installation failed because
 a function driver was not specified for this device instance.' The Media Registry doesn't look right to me; for the Media one,
<br />
4D36E96C-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318&nbsp; Audio and video devices&nbsp;&nbsp; -There weren't any LowerFilters values listed (does that matter?) For "(default)" it reads "Value not set." I'm willing to attempt anything right now, it just won't give me any sound at all.

            <p>Please, any more suggestions? I'm thinking that there is a way to fix this. </p>
<p>And when I updated the driver for 'High Definition Audio Codecs', Device Manager switched it to 'Realtek High Definition Audio', even though that was already listed under 'Sound, Video, and Game Controllers' (so now&nbsp; 'Realtek High Definition Audio' is listed
 twice under r 'Sound, Video, and Game Controllers'. </p>
<p>Device Manager also allowed me to install 'Intel WiDi Audio Device', but it still makes no sound at all.</p>
<p>And under 'System Devices', my computer tells me that the driver for 'High Definition Audio Controller' is up to date, but it still has a yellow bang mark next to it (nothing I do seems to ever change that - any suggestsions?)</p>

I already updated those Realtek drivers and the chipset from Intel that goes with my board, all that seems OK, but still my laptop claims there is 'No audio device installed'.

            Can you get into Safe Mode? To do this, repeatedly tap the F8 key as the computer is starting up. This will get you to the diagnostic menu. Use your arrow key to select Safe Mode and press the Enter key. Let us know.

<p>By "getting into Safe Mode" I meant if you could actually run Windows in Safe Mode. I interpret your reply to mean that you have tried Safe Mode and other options (including Last Known Good Configuration) from the diagnostic menu (F8) and you are unable
 to log into any Windows user account. Please confirm this, including whether you have been able to get into Safe Mode Command Prompt without the error.</p>
<p>If you can get into Safe Mode Command Prompt, then at the prompt type:</p>
<p><span>c:\Windows\System32\restore\rstrui.exe [press Enter] to start System Restore. If you can get System Restore to start, restore to a time when things worked.</span></p>
<p><span>BTW</span> , what's the answer to The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?</p>

<p>Thanks again for your assisstance. Went into Safe Mode and then to the Command Prompt and immediately got a page full of Driver information such as :</p>
<p>SCSI(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)Windows\System32\Drivers........ etc, etc for the full page which lasted about 30 seconds and then reverts to the blue screen again.&nbsp; In relation to the First Question of Troubleshooting, the answer is NIL as I had not installed
 anything nor deleted anything and only had used my PC for sending/replying to family emails and a little browsing. It has me stumped. Once again thank you so much for your time.</p>

<p>That's too bad. Well, your options are limited at this point. It could have been caused by something you installed (malware, bad drivers) or it could be hardware. Googling around indicates drivers but since you can't get into the system there isn't anything
 you can do about it from Windows. If you have a fairly high level of computer skills, you can boot with a rescue system like a BartPE or another proprietary third-party disc to see what's going on. If the machine were in my shop, I'd pull the data off the
 hard drive if necessary, test the hardware, take a look with said proprietary rescue disc. Final actions would depend on whether Windows failed because of software or hardware. Let me know if you want details about doing any of that.</p>
<p>You know your skill level best. If you decide to take the machine to a reputable local professional, don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place.</p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help with a problem bothering me of late. I'm running Windows 8.1 Pro on a Dell Latitude E6410, however for the past 2 days the OS does not recognize the wireless adapter no matter how many times I reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically it appears the adapter/drivers, etc is not picked up by the OS as it even does not appear under Network Adapters in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to repair the boot via&nbsp;bootrec/fixmbr, bootrec/scanos, and bootrec/rebuildbcd to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me if anyone has a solution.......</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hey guys, so this is my first post under this gamertag, a lot of you may know me from my other gamertags in the past but i wont go into that right now.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Basically, I got the red rings of death on my first 2 360s (old school white ones), so I traded everything in and got myself a cheap PS3, was unhappy with that (especially with PSN), and overall missed my experience with 360/Xbox
 Live, so I traded all THAT stuff in, and got myself a new 360 (250 gb),and am very pleased so far (have had it for about a week now, my old 360s were back in the first 2-3 launch years)<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I used to have a ton of games for my 360 but now I only have Gears of War and Call of Duty 2 (old but classics). I've also been playing the Gears 3 beta a lot, which i love over Gears 2</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I used to be really competitive in Gears, was in several clans such as vVv, would love to get back into it but i doubt the Gears community for the first game is very tight these days</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Anyway, just wanted to introduce myself, see if anyone wants to play some Gears, and ask you guys if theres any cheap games I should go grab for my new 360. I'm thinkin bout buying a new game as well (L.A. Noire? Brink?) but moneys
 a lil limited right now so it may be wiser for me to just buy a couple cheap games that can last me through the summer before Gears 3, Battlefield 3, etc. etc. etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Feel free to respond.<br />

<p>thanks lithium rain</p>
<p>thanks for the suggestions sic and covert bike...the reason i havent gotten portal 2 is because i am looking for either a lengthy single player game or a multiplayer game that can last me a while, i just feel like portal 2 is a great buy for the price and
 have read great reviews but it will prolly be something that collects dust by next month</p>
<p>i am somewhat familiar with red dead...i dont think it has multi but its a pretty long single player game is that correct? or does it have multi as well?</p>

    <title>Black screen with a blinking LED power light after installing the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenevans1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen with a blinking LED power light after installing the newest video driver</h2>
                    <p>My HP p6754y desktop running Windows 10, only loads to a black screen with a blinking LED power light after I updated my Geforce gtx 560 ti video card to the latest Geforce driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.)&nbsp; I reset my computer to the original Windows 10 settings.</p>
<p>2.)&nbsp; I used a well recommended driver cleaner to clean out all the Geforce files, and reinstalled the new driver again AND did the same with a older stable drivers, that used to work fine, both in safe mode and regular mode.</p>
<p>3.)&nbsp; I stopped Windows from auto installing the windows driver while I was trying to install the video driver and repeated #2.</p>
<p>4.) I tried all the above with the analog cable connecting the computer to the monitor as well as with the HDMI cable, and as well with both connecting and trying to switch the setting between the two on the monitor.</p>
<p>5.) I have removed the Geforce card used the onboard video card and it works fine.</p>
<p>6.) The screen works fine in safe mode or if the Geforce card is disabled.</p>
<p>7.) Black magic</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something in WINDOWS 10 or in an update that is conflicting with my video card or video drivers???&nbsp; It seems like maybe windows 10 is trying to kick my system to the original onboard video card everytime I enable the Geforce card with whatever driver
 is installed??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is it possible the video card died?</p>
<p>
</p><p>SIDE NOTE:&nbsp; The video card had a short time (a couple hours) that it worked fine with the new driver and the latest Windows 10 update.&nbsp; Then I accidentally set my resolution settings too high which caused a conflict with the monitor.&nbsp; I fixed that issue
 by changing my connection to a HDMI cable, and that worked for a couple hours before it went to a black screen with the blinking LED light and hasn't worked since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance!</p>

            See if its possible to boot into Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />Click Startup Settings
<br />Click Restart
<br />Press (4) to Enable Safe Mode
<br />Wait while Windows 10 starts in safe mode.
<br />Log in
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Display Adapter
<br />Right click your Display adapter and click Uninstall
<br />Exit Device Manager
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />Do you have a working spare computer you could try the video card in?
<br />
<br />If you motherboard supports integrated graphics, remove the video card then try connecting to your motherboards video adapter then boot the system.

            Well, its either a compatibility issue with your system or you need to install an older driver to see if it works or try the latest beta drivers.

            You say it works for a while before carping out. Could it be that the video card is overheating and shutting down?

<p>Hello YTOLIA,</p>
<p>You need to obtain a Rights Account Certificate. <br />
To do so, follow the instructions in the link above for Set permissions that Suuresh sent to you.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a certificate, contact a network administrator or, if your computer is connected to a home network or if it is connected directly to the Internet, you can obtain a certificate online from Microsoft by using<span>Windows Live</span> credentials.
 In the <span>User Accounts</span> dialog box, click<span>Add</span>, and then in the
<span>Rights Management Configuration</span> dialog box, click<span>.NET Passport account</span>. The wizard will walk you through the process of creating<span>Windows Live</span> credentials and obtaining a certificate.</p>
<li>
<p>Rights Account Certificates obtained using <span>Windows Live</span> credentials can only be used to view XPS documents that have been sent to you, not to digitally sign or set permissions for a document you’ve created.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Rights Account Certificates obtained using <span>Windows Live</span> credentials apply only to XPS documents created in the<span>Microsoft Office</span> system. Documents created in other programs can only be accessed and protected using a corporate Rights
 Account Certificate.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            Phone calls from Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>I am receiving phone calls every few days from someone who states they are from Microsoft out of Washington and that there I a problem with my Microsoft CLS # and they want me to go into Windows while they are on the phone to verify my CLS number for security.&nbsp;
 They say Microsoft is receiving messages that someone is hacking into my computer and they want to help me but first they have to verify my number by me holding the Windows key down and pressing the letter R.&nbsp; Please let me know this is not a true&nbsp;message
 from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It is not from Microsoft. It is a scam.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Cybercriminals often use publicly available phone directories, so they might know your name and other personal information when they call you. They might even guess what operating system you're using.</p>
<p>Once they've gained your trust, they might ask for your user name and password or ask you to go to a legitimate website (such as www.ammyy.com) to install software that will let them access your computer to fix it. Once you do this, your computer and your
 personal information are vulnerable.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not trust unsolicited calls. Do not provide any personal information.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>How to protect yourself from telephone tech support scams</p>
<p>If someone claiming to be from Microsoft tech support calls you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>◾<strong>Do not purchase </strong>any software or services.<br />
◾Ask if there is a fee or subscription associated with the "service." If there is, hang up.<br />
◾<strong>Never give control of your computer </strong>to a third party unless you can confirm that it is a legitimate representative of a computer support team with whom you are already a customer.<br />
◾Take the caller's information down and immediately report it to your local authorities.<br />
◾<strong>Never provide your credit card or financial information to someone claiming to be from Microsoft tech support</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever you receive a phone call or see a pop-up window on your PC and feel uncertain whether it is from someone at Microsoft,
<strong>don’t take the risk</strong>.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Bluetooth works for 30 seconds and then stops</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10... Boy, what a huge mistake that was...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Months later I am still struggling with problems. One of the biggest issues is with my (previously working) bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, bluetooth won't work... So here is what I have tried to fix it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall all bluetooth drivers in device manager</li><li>Search for hardware changes</li><li>The computer scans for hardware changes, and eventually install the drivers for the bluetooth</li><li>The drivers install correctly</li><li>My bluetooth keyboard works just fine for around 30 seconds...</li><li>Then the driver gets a yellow exclamation mark after it and totally stops working from then on</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I can take a screenshot if nobody believes me. Very frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Here are some screenshots I have taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first one you can see that bluetooth appears to be working fine. The drivers are loaded (although I don't know why they are under the "unknown" category device manager). You can even see devices in the bluetooth page, and I have the little blue bluetooth
 icon down the bottom of the window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the second screenshot the drivers have disappeared and I have the yellow exclamation mark on the Generic Bluetooth Adaptor. Bluetooth icon is gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice the time on the clock down in the bottom corner!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens without me touching a single thing on the computer between bluetooth working and then not working. Very frustrating!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/556a9a31-abb3-44d7-b8cb-bf8d5b899748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/556a9a31-abb3-44d7-b8cb-bf8d5b899748" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbc721c7-a359-4b1e-b961-22bb85eb376b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbc721c7-a359-4b1e-b961-22bb85eb376b" /></a></p>

            <p>That's all fine and good, but the Windows 10 upgrade tool didn't mention anything about breaking my Bluetooth.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It basically said "Yep, it's all fine. Go and upgrade and have a happy and carefree life".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the upgrade basically broke a part of the computer that I used on an everyday basis. With all of the prior information to tell me it was going to break it. But it didn't tell me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now you are suggesting that the solution is to go and PAY for something that I didn't need before but because your new software broke it I now have to do it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's worse, during the upgrade it said "Hey, be chill! If the upgrade doesn't work you can always go back!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well that was a load of B.S! I tried to revert back to Windows 7 today - turns out that you can't do this if more than 30 days have elapsed! And I just happen to be on frigging day 32!!!</p>

<h2>            Computer won&#39;t reboot after updates</h2>
                    <p>I have been having an issue with my laptop rebooting after Windows updates, software installations reboots etc. I get the black screen that says press the esc key to start boot menu but if I press it&nbsp; nothing happens. I have waited for up to 5 minutes and
 finally tapped the power key but that shuts it down completely. I am running Windows 7 Home Premium and this is my first laptop. PC maker was no help at all with Windows issues.</p>
<p>Should I worry or should I leave well enough alone and just power it off and power back up?</p>
<p>Wasn't sure whice topic to post this under either as this is my first time to the forums.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>My compte is an HP Pavillion g7 notebook. It is running </p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit</p>
<p>AMD A-3300 M APU </p>
<p>Radeon HD Graphics</p>
<p>1.90 GHz</p>
<p>6 GB RAM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought this notebook in June and have not used it very much at all as it has been challenging for me to learn a new system. So I only know that it updates itself and I have no idea what or where to find that information that has been updated.</p>
<p>I was eligable for the Windows 8 Pro upgrade and took avantage of that but did not keep it because it seemed to take my computer forever to boot up. So many things that were not useful to me not having touchscreen. Anyway HP helped to restore my pc back
 to it's orginal state. I thought maybe installing Windows 8 would fix this issue but it didn't and this notebook has had this prblem from day one no matter what system is running. The reboot problem also happens when installing software and requires a reboot
 as well but the thing that is most confusing is it does't happen every time but 7 out 10 times.</p>
<p>I am not real computer savvy so trying to fix things is a hard thing when most times I don't know the right terms to use to ask the questions. LOL</p>
<p>So, I will make sure my personal files are safe and I will follow the steps you have suggested and see what happens. I don't mind the compter having to be shut down but it makes me wonder if the updates are even getting installed properly and what happens
 if I need to do a clean install and this feature malfunctions. Because even if you press the esc key it just pauses startup instead of giving the startup menu.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for your speedy reply and I will come back here after I follow your instructions and give you an update.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shasta</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t open .sys file extension when trying to install usb drivers</h2>
                    I'm trying to install usb modem drivers for a Motorola sb5100 cable modem on my Vista 32bit OS. These drivers I dwonloaded directly from the Motorola support website and saved to my desktop. However,&nbsp;when I try to install the I get an error messege " Windows
 can't open this file:&nbsp; RNDISMPK.SYS. To open this file Windows needs to know &nbsp;what program you want to use to open it. Widows can go online to look it up automatically........ When I click&nbsp;- Use the web service to find the correct program - &nbsp;it takes me to
 all sorts of registry cleaner programs which I've downloaded and none of them seem to resolve my issue. What can I do? I already have registry cleaner software installed on my computer. All I want is to be able to install my modem divers. Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to install Motorolla modem divers. I will try to help you with this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The file that you have downloaded “RNDISMPK.SYS” is not the execution file to install. It is the system file.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would have you refer the link below to download the correct drivers.</span></p>

                    <p>Windows 10 indexing stopped working. &nbsp;I have worked with Microsoft support (not 3rd party entity) on several occasions and for several hours at a time. &nbsp;Each time they resort to reinstalling Windows and assuring me that it will work now. &nbsp;It does not work.
 &nbsp;Nothing I do will start the indexing program no matter how many times I initiate its operation. &nbsp;It is very difficult searching for files and, as well, searching in Outlook where I have thousands of emails I use on a regular basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone that actually has an answer that does not include hours of work on my part without any resolution? &nbsp;Please!!!</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you've tried but if you open control panel&gt;administrative tools&gt;services.... from here open services with double click or by whatever you use to open things.&nbsp; From here scroll down until you find 'Windows Search' click on (make sure extended
 tab at bottom of page is selected) and click restart at top left, if this fails open Windows Search and in Start up Type select Automatic and
<strong>apply </strong>and in Service Status select start OK &nbsp;then close everything and restart. Once restarted open file explorer select a file and type something in the search box to see if index in running. If you need to change options (assuming index is
 running) click in search box and in options click advanced options and then change index locations.</p>

            Thank you for the suggestion. &nbsp;I have tried that several times and the result is always the same. &nbsp;Every time, it says that the Windows Search Service on the local computer started and then stopped. &nbsp;I also attempted to delete and rebuild the index thinking
 it was corrupted and search would work with an intact index. &nbsp;That also fails. &nbsp;There appears to be no way to start the indexer and I have been without a search function for several months (I have worked with Microsoft support over the months with no results).

<p>As you said, they resorted to reinstalling Windows. &nbsp;The first reinstall was just a refresh. &nbsp;The second was a clean install (which I resisted since my entire business is on the PC and I had to manually save vast amounts of stuff that would otherwise have
 been lost). &nbsp;Unfortunately, contrary to their assertion that it would be fine after the clean install with a special version of windows they provided, it still did not work. &nbsp;What I don't understand is, my Surface 4 has had the same upgrades but it works.
 &nbsp;My desktop worked before the anniversary update and did not work after. &nbsp;Support seemed nonplussed about the failure of search and basically just gave up and left me without a solution and hours of restoration back to a non-functional machine. &nbsp;If the computer
 was several years old, I would just dump it and start over but it is quite recent and fairly powerful (expensive) and I don't have the money to replace it right now.</p>

            <p>Smells to me like some software is in the way. Could be as simple as a driver for external&nbsp;hardware or an unusual&nbsp;application. That's why I asked about how early during installation you tested indexing. So be suspicious of anything you've installed that's
 out of the ordinary.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft 3600 Bluetooth Mouse not detected by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 13 7000 series laptop running Windows 10. I purchased a Microsoft 3600 Bluetooth mouse to use. Upon purchase, the mouse paired up and worked very well. Yesterday, the mouse stopped pairing and connecting with bluetooth. I have tried
 unpairing and was unable to detect the mouse in my attempt to pair the device again. Mutliple troubleshooting attempts on the bluetooth adapter have been made with no success. I do not have another computer in the house to use this mouse with. However, the
 mouse is less than two months old and I replaced the battery just in case. It sits on my desk and is not dropped or carried anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My bluetooth detects my apple watch and my television set but not my mouse.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for us to provide you the most appropriate solution, may we know what specific steps did you try aside from replacing the battery and re-pairing the Bluetooth mouse? Also, what are the changes on your PC prior to this issue? A Windows update perhaps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't tried further troubleshooting steps other than the steps that you mentioned, you can refer to this article:
