Noticed since SP2, Outlook no longer uses the default email account to compose a new message, it uses the account associated with the email that happens to be currently selected (no I'm not hitting Reply). Anyone else experiencing this? Just sent a dozen emails
 from the wrong account assuming all was working like it has forever.

<div>Outlook creates new messages with the account that you presently have selected. Once you've clicked on the account, you've selected that account to create the new message.</div>

<h3> joostforvh  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMDC 6.1 on windows 2008 server connected via terminal service doesn&#39;t recognise local ports</h2>
                    
<p>This is the situation:<br />
<br />
I have a laptop with XP SP3. A Symbol pocket pc is connected via a com cable. There is another XP machine where Active sync is installed. I take over that machine with remote desktop. In local resources I have marked that the other xp machine should recognise
 my local serial ports. When I open active synce on the XP machine I took over I can see my local serial ports and can connect to the symbol pocket pc. So that is the way it should work<br />
<br />
Now I do the same, but I take over a windows 2008 server with remote desktop, again mark serial ports in local resources, open up WMDC, go to the connection settings, and I only see the local comports from that windows 2008 server machine and not the ports
 from my laptop. So why is that? A policy or security issue??<br />
<br />
Does anybody has a solution for that??<br />
<br />
THANKS!!<br />
<br />
Joost</p>

            Greetings Joost!&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!<br />
<br />
I believe the problem you are experiencing is due to the subtle differences between using a Terminal Services client to access XP and the use of Remote Desktop connected to Windows 2008 Server.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are entirely different situations, so you should expect
 totally different outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would suggest connecting to the Windows Server 2008 via Terminal Services in order to make the two situations more alike, which will aid you in troubleshooting this issue further.&nbsp; I suspect that you may have better luck in
 that situation anyways, if you had success in the XP case.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
However, I should mention that my and my fellow Moderators will likely have no experience with how well Windows Server 2008 works with ActiveSync, unless you have Exchange Server installed and configured to allow Mobile Device connections.&nbsp; If so, I would heartily
 recommend talking with our peers in the <a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ucintegrationwithexchange/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Server</a> forums instead...

            <p>Re:&nbsp; randbetween<br />
<br />
It provides a random number that is independent of previous numbers it generated.<br />
That said, there has been much discussion off and on about how truly random the results are.<br />
For 'ordinary' purposes it does just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have posted in the programming forum, so one step you should take is to use the "Randomize" statement in the line of code immediately before you use the randbetween function.
<br />
Also, avoid using any random function within a loop.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I assume that you are using RANDBETWEEN in Excel or WorksheetFunction.RandBetween in VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither function uses the same "seed" as the VBA Rnd function.&nbsp; So neither function is affected by the VBA Randomize statement.&nbsp; See footnote [3] to demonstrate that fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, RANDBETWEEN and WorksheetFunction.RandBetween use the same "seed" and pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) as Excel RAND.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial "seed" for RAND is randomized each time we start a new instance of Excel.&nbsp; Excel does not allow us to control the initial "seed" [1].&nbsp; Each new instance of Excel generates a new sequence of RAND values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In contrast, VBA Rnd uses the same initial "seed" with each new instance of Excel, unless we use VBA Randomize to create a new "seed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technically, no software PRNG creates a truly independent sequence of random values.&nbsp; But ideally, it emulates an independent sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will find a variety of opinions on the quality of the Excel and VBA PRNGs.&nbsp; IMHO, they are good enough for most of us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest problems with VBA Rnd is its extremely short period (how many calls before repeating the same sequence) and the fact that the "seed" can degenerate to zero, causing Rnd to return zero repeatedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before Excel 2010, Excel RAND had a significantly longer period.&nbsp; And I do not believe the "seed" could degenerate to zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note:&nbsp; That is not the same as whether or not RAND could return zero.&nbsp; I believe it could.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting in Excel 2010, Excel RAND was significantly improved, replacing the previous Wichman-Hill algorithm with a Mersenne Twister (MT) algorithm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, the MT paradigm is thought to be the best PRNG.&nbsp; But there are design choices that can "make or break" it.&nbsp; So that says nothing about the quality of the Excel MT algorithm per se.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[ERRATA] Previously, I wrote that Excel RAND used a linear congruence algorithm before Excel 2010.&nbsp; Actually, it is VBA Rnd that uses a linear congruence algorithm. [2]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>----- </p>
<p>[1] Some very early versions of Excel did allow for specifying the initial "seed" on the Excel command line.&nbsp; That was some time before Excel 2003.&nbsp; I forget when.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[2] The VBA Rnd algorithm is described in support.microsoft.com/kb/231847.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Excel RAND algorithm for Excel 2003 and 2007 is described in support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/828795.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[3] To demonstrate the independence of Excel RAND (ergo, RANDBETWEEN and WorksheetFunction.RandBetween) and VBA Rnd, create a new Excel workbook with two worksheets and perform the following steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Sheet1 object, create the following VBA procedure:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub doit()<br />
Dim r As Long, i As Long<br />
r = Cells(Rows.Count, "a").End(xlUp).Offset(1).Row<br />
For i = 1 To 10<br />
Cells(r, i) = WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(1, 100000)<br />
Next<br />
MsgBox "done"<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Sheet2 object, create the following VBA procedure:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub doit()<br />
Dim r As Long, i As Long<br />
r = Cells(Rows.Count, "a").End(xlUp).Offset(1).Row<br />
For i = 1 To 10<br />
Cells(r, i) = Int(100000 * Rnd) + 1<br />
Next<br />
MsgBox "done"<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save and close the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the workbook and execute each VBA procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save and close the workbook a second time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the workbook and execute each VBA procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Sheet1 (created by RandBetween), you will see two different rows of values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Sheet2 (created by Rnd), you will see the same sequence of values in each row.</p>

    <title>No Notifications on Accounts Linked to Outlook Account for Android - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toopricey  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Notifications on Accounts Linked to Outlook Account for Android Applicaton</h2>
                    <p>On the Android app for Outlook.com, I do not receive any notifications for different emails linked to my microsoft/outlook account. &nbsp;A similar question was asked before (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/osettings-oemailset/outlookcom-android-app-no-notifications/c41649eb-ef65-40e8-a1f5-e850a770d99d),
 but I believe there was some difference here. &nbsp;To explicitly define my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I do not receive any notifications on email accounts linked to my outlook account. &nbsp;That is, I linked them on outlook.com directly, and view all of them there as well.</p>
<p>* These emails are directed to specific subfolders for each email. &nbsp;I have no found a way to direct them to the main inbox, either in the app or on outlook.com</p>
<p>* I do receive notifications on emails that are signed into the Outlook app, but NOT connected to the outlook account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled the application. &nbsp;I have set notifications for all mail, and have tried turning off the focus inbox entirely in case its getting confused. &nbsp;The current reviews on the Play store seem to indicate this isn't an isolated incident. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get notifications to work for these email accounts? &nbsp;I will accept getting them all to go to the main outlook inbox, but I would rather just get notifications as currently set up. &nbsp;I could just individually add each email account, but this
 removes the synchronization with outlook.com which I feel like <strong>is the entire point of the app. &nbsp;</strong><br />

</p><p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We understand the inconvenience caused and we will try our best to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per your query, I like to inform you that; on outlook.com, you can receive the email from other email account as well, in the main inbox itself.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>On Outlook.com, we have Mail Fetching feature, which helps to fetch the emails from other email account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Outlook.com’s mail fetching feature is ideal when you have another email account that can’t automatically forward mail to you. It will work with
 any email account that supports the standard POP3 protocol. After setting up mail fetching, Outlook.com will automatically check your other email account for new email and pull it into your Outlook.com inbox.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Mail fetching has some limitations. It’s limited to a maximum of 50 messages, which are fetched every 30 minutes. If you have more than 50 messages to receive, they’ll be grabbed by Outlook.com
 at the next 30-minute refresh.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) Login to your
<strong>Outlook.com </strong>account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2) Click on the
<strong>gear</strong> symbol and select <strong>Options</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3) Under Manage your account, select
<strong>Sending/receiving email from other accounts </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4) Click on
<strong>Add an email account </strong>option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5) Provide the email address and password of your other account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6) Click on
<strong>Next</strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7) Outlook.com will try to determine the appropriate POP3 email server settings automatically.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You’ll be asked whether you want to receive the email in your inbox or in an account-specific folder. You’ll also have to log into the email account
 and click a confirmation link before Outlook.com will start showing you the account’s email.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since, you are not receiving any notification for the linked account in Outlook.com app for android device.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to remove the Email account the Outlook.com android app and try adding it again and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps, reply to us with the status of your issue. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<p>I click on download and it registers the click (you can tell from blink of the writing when you press on it) but nothing happens after that! No error message etc. nothing. It just doesn't work on any film I have.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Jurgen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is with downloading purchased movies, the streaming works fine (either in app or via the website...though we should stick to talking about the app here to stay on topic)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signing in with a different User Profile would mean buying a movie&nbsp;under another account, which I'd prefer not to do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot download&nbsp;movies&nbsp;on my desktop PC&nbsp;either, so I don't think it is related to the Surface 3 but rather the Microsoft network services!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eagerly await and appreciate your further assistance in this matter.</p>

            <p>Hey. A few clarifying questions so that we can investigate:</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS build? Are you Insiders? Desktop or mobile? Are you running the latest version of the app (3.6.1239.0)? Are you blocked from downloading all the time or just intermittently? Are you blocked from downloading all of your movies or just specific ones? Neither
 of you get an error code? It just fails silently?</p>

            <p>I too had the same issue. I rented a movie 4 times. The first time I rented and selected download for offline viewing and nothing ever came up. After contacting support and got no help I rented it again and the download button appeared but never did anything.
 I did this another 2 times with the same results. I contacted them and finally was at least able to get a refund but I wanted to rent and watch a movie not on WiFi but no one could help.

            <p>Hi Ellen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not an insider and Windows 10 is fully up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app build of 'Film&amp; TV' is 3.6.1239.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The download function simply never works - there is no error code; you just click download and nothing happens (so fails silently as you say). This is the case for all movies and TV shows I have of which there are quite a few to test!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help - as you can imagine this is a huge issue for many of us.</p>

 I can get my money back. &nbsp;i rented these movies to watch on a plane - going to be in the air for 10+ hours...</p>

            <p>The only way I've been able to get this to work on my Surface is by switching to a different user account on that machine. I have two user accounts on it: (1) the original account I used to set up the machine, and (2) a second account added later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you first run the Movies and TV app it auto establishes that machine as one of the devices in your Microsoft Account connected to the Movies &amp; TV service. For some reason the Movies &amp; TV app would never make this connection in the first account but
 in the second account it did. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There's some weird user account bug thing going on that could be affecting this.

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the information. Since the latest iOS version is 11.4, I suggest you update iOS and check if the issue still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, to help us further narrow down the issue, please provide some more information:</p>
<p>1. To determine if the issue is related to OneDrive sync, please upload a file in OneDrive and check if there is an issue.</p>
<p>2. When did the issue start? After you update OS or Lens?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your update. I have tested with Lens 2.11 and iOS 11.2, I could not reproduce the issue. Since the issue is more likely related to Lens, we suggest you uninstall Lens and reinstall it from app Stone, check if the issue still exists.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>According to the screenshot you provided before, it seems that you are using
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest you try the steps below:</p>
<p>1.In Office Lens, in<span style="font-weight: bold"> Export To</span> window&gt;click your account&gt;click Edit&gt;select your account&gt;Sign Out&gt;Done</p>
<p>2.Quit Lens.</p>
<p>3.Open Lens again, capture notes, add your OneDrive for business to Lens again.</p>
<p>4.Check if you can save the notes as PDF and then save it to your OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we'd like to confirm the following information for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.Please check if you select the other 3 types of mode to capture notes, then save the file as PDF and then check if you can save the file to OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Please check after you have captured the notes, in
OneDrive</span> in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Save To</span> list, can you save the file to OneDrive normally?
</p>
<p>(It seems that you chose
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.If it is convenient, could you check if you sign in Lens with another OneDrive for business account, can you save the files to OneDrive? If may help to check if the issue is related to a specific
 account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>All other options are working.</p>
<p>I have a personal OneDrive account and Business OneDrive account. It stopped working while I was using the personal account. I added about 10 pdf's and then encountered the error. I switched to my business account and it worked for about more 10 pdf's and
 then that account stopped working as well. I have not been able to get either working again.&nbsp;</p>

<li>The Hard Drive requirements for the Windows 10 upgrade are 16 GB.&nbsp; My Tablet has nowhere near enough free space, with less than 3 GB at present (and likely to become less).&nbsp; Am I right in thinking that the fact that W10 will be

 external USB HD</span> or some other device can be used?&nbsp; I have read that any recent machine (mine is only a few months old) which can run Windows 8 now, will be able to run Windows 10. The suppliers of my Quantum View 10.1 Tablet emailed customers while

<br />
If you are upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, then it will replace the hard drive space. If you are planning to install dual boot, then you need to have extra 16 GB of space. You will not be able to install Windows 10 on external hard drive.<br />

                    <p>At the bottom of an email, there are several options to show all meetings, attachments etc.&nbsp; All are empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have many emails, some&nbsp;with attachments from several different contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I look at an email from one of those contacts, their history is not showing up in the Contact's Info Window at the bottom of the email.&nbsp; It displays "There are no items to
 show in this&nbsp;view"&nbsp; even though there are many emails, attachments and appointment from that Contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I scheduled a test meeting with a contact and then went back to that email to see if it appeared and it doesn't.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have closed and restarted Outlook, that doesn't help.&nbsp; I have opened contact from within email to ensure it knows the correct contact...that
 doesn't help.&nbsp; I scheduled a meeting from within the email itself and that doesn't help.</p>

<p>Okay I solved this. It was a glitch with my profile.</p>
<p>I went to Control Panel, Mail 32bit, Show Profiles and I added a new profile. I then clicked on the option to prompt for profile and then opened Outlook.
</p>
<p>The people pane finally works! Then I went back to the Control Panel, Mail, Show Profiles and changed the selection to always use my newly created profile. I didn't delete the original profile because I wasn't sure what that would do.</p>

<h3> drstevepg  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows security credentials request</h2>
                    <p>I have been working with an organization where I was required to connect to their SharePoint site using a login account on their domain.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This access was done through desktop machine within their domain.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They also had a domain site for remote access with the same domain login.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The challenge is after making the initial connection <strong>all</strong> my Office 2010 applications repeatedly pops up a Windows Security credential request with their domain, my old account and their remote web address to connect to this remote SharePoint
 site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have come to the end of my contract, but I cannot locate a way to disassociate my personal machine’s Office Applications from this remote SharePoint site.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can locate many references to this site within the registry within “My Site” values.<span>&nbsp;
</span>How can I officially remove references to this association?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In case it is required, my system is using Windows 7 Ultimate with Office 2010 Professional</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Well I have found a solution.&nbsp; It is not the greatest solution from a user's perspective and I am really sad Microsoft has built something which needs a registry hack to correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also this is NOT a SHarePoint issue but is an Office issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix this you do need a registry hack using regedit.&nbsp; This is not normally advised and before you start export a copy of the registry in case the cat walks across your keyboard or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the registry go to</p>
<p>&lt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER&gt;\Sofyware\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this section you will find something like Shared Sites inside of which you will find several references to MySite.&nbsp; Inside each of these will be the url which references the site.&nbsp; There will also be DWORD Values of IsMember and IsPublished.&nbsp; Delete the
 whole tree containing the urls you no longer need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want none of the Save and Publish entries in your Office applications&nbsp;you can delete the tree Shared Sites tree from Common.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck and do not forget to take the backup before you start to hack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try following (one by one and check the result after that step. Try point 10 first) -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors.<br />
<br />
2. Repair the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Review following link - https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/manage/office-365-and-windows-10-problems-and-solutions<br />
<br />
6. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
7. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
8. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
9. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
10. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
11. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
12. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
13. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

    <title>MS Word Quick Parts and SharePoint Collaborative Editing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karl f. kamysek  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Word Quick Parts and SharePoint Collaborative Editing</h2>
                    <p>I have a small team working on a fairly complex document that we are collaboratively editing on SharePoint. &nbsp;In an effort to standardize the formatting I built several Quick Parts for inserting intricately formatted sections of the document that will be
 repeated throughout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like the Quick Parts available to the rest of the team, much like the Quick Styles I built for the document are when they open the document for editing from SharePoint. &nbsp;However, the Quick Parts I prepared are only showing on my local machine/copy
 of Word, and not on my team members. &nbsp;How do I save/embed the custom Quick Parts I built for this document so they are available to all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>When you save a Quick Part, one of the dropdowns in the dialog box is "Save in". It defaults to Normal.dotm, but you can choose any template that's currently open/loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a document that's being edited collaboratively, the document should be based on a custom template specific to that project, and each editor should have access to that template (usually by placing the template in a shared folder and setting the Workgroup
 Templates location in each user's copy of Word to that folder). If that's the case, then the Quick Parts should all be in that template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can move the existing Quick Parts to the template as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>While that template (or a document based on it) is open, click Insert &gt; Quick Parts &gt; Building Block Organizer. Select one of the Quick Parts you made, click the Edit Properties button, and change the Save In setting to the name of the template. Repeat for
 the others. When you close Word, you'll be prompted (separately) to save changes to the template and to Normal.dotm; click Save for each one. You have now moved those Quick Parts out of Normal.dotm and into the document template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you aren't using a shared template, use the same process to move the Quick Parts into a new template. Move that template to the folder %appdata%\Microsoft\Word\Startup and restart Word. The Quick Parts in the template should be available in Word. You
 can then distribute a copy of the template to each of the other users, with instructions to store it in their ...Word\Startup folder.</p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I just created a new account with my university e-mail to download office 365 for students. however, despite my subscription appearing in my account, I cannot download any of the office apps. When I click on "install software" it redirects me to a page that
 shows the error message "One drive business is not available for Mac". Oddly one drive business isn't even meant to be part of the deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have heard of multiple other students with a Mac that struggle with the same issue, I was hoping you could help us solve this!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

    <title>iPad One Note extremely slow when typing after latest update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrian rodriguez goyeneche  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPad One Note extremely slow when typing after latest update</h2>
                    <p>OneNote in my iPad mini just got updated. &nbsp;I am syncing a notebook with one drive for business. &nbsp;It used to work fine but after the update every time I type, it takes up to 5 seconds for the letters to show up. &nbsp;While the notebook is large, it used to work
 perfectly fine until the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device: iPad mini with retina with iOS 8.3</p>
<p>OneNote Version 2.11.4 (150411)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be an issue with syncing the large file. &nbsp;I have tried several things in previous posts from 2013 but have not been able to resolve this.</p>
<p>- Re-start iPad.</p>
<p>- Delete OneNote and re-installed it</p>
<p>- Deleted the notebook, logged out, then logged back in and re-download it (all pages seem to have downloaded)</p>
<p>- Issue related to the large notebook. &nbsp;I created a new notebook in the same one drive for business and works fine (no delay while typing)</p>
<p>- Issue seems to be related to Sections created in the past. &nbsp;If I create a new section or even a new section group, new notes work fine (no delay while typing). &nbsp;Any new notes in older sections, or editing previous notes are extremely slow up to 5 seconds
 for each character to show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How can I go back to the older version of OneNote? &nbsp;Or fix the current one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Adrian</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured out a workaround. &nbsp;I noticed that adding a section and then a page in the same notebook works fine (no keyboard delay). &nbsp;So what I did is created a new section and moved all pages from the old section to this new one and voila! &nbsp;Everything works
 fine now. &nbsp;Further more, after syncing, I moved all pages back to the original section, and everything works fine. &nbsp;I can add pages and edit old pages with no keyboard delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is definitively a bug, but easy to workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Adrian</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple of days, it is back. &nbsp;It looks like the only way to keep it working is to keep the number of pages in a section to a minimum. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Adrian</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using Microsoft Excel 2016 on MacOS. Every time I copy from web to paste into my excel table, the format changes and I have to manually click on the "Match Destination Formatting" to change it to my table's format. Is there any way I can set
 it as default instead of doing it manually?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Marcus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to isolate the cause of the issue. We suggest that you follow the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run the Power Troubleshooter to find and fix problems with your computer's power settings. Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>On the search bar, type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>, and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong> from the results.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Click on <strong>System and Security</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Power</strong>, click on <strong>Power</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe) to repair your Windows installation. For the steps on how to use DISM and the commands that you need to run, kindly refer to the following link:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
System file check (SFC) Scan and Repair System Files &amp; DISM to fix things SFC cannot</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>Restore your PC from a system restore point. This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. This method should help if the issue is caused by a recent change on your computer. For steps
 on how to perform a system restore, refer to the&nbsp;<strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong> section in the following link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thanks for the reply, those didn't work but I went ahead and read up on how to examine memory dump files and narrowed down the cause to Logitech software for my mouse. When this program isn't running, my system wakes up fine with no blue screen. My next
 step now is contact them about the issue, but seeing as I'm running an insider preview, they might not have support for it.
