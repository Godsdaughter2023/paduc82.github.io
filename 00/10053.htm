<h2>            Delete item in Word Index</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2016, I have created an index in a document. I have never done this before, so I am struggling. Assume the word “cheese” is one of the entries in the index. This word appears multiple times in the document. I have decided I want to remove this word
 from the index. What is the procedure for deleting a word from the index?</p>

            <p>The entries in the index are pulled from XE fields in the body of the document, which you created by using the Mark Entry dialog box. The XE fields are all marked with Hidden font formatting, so normally they're invisible. To remove a particular entry from
 the index, you have to delete every XE field that mentions that entry, and then update the index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the ¶ button on the Home tab to display nonprinting and hidden characters, so you can see the XE fields. Open the Replace dialog. In the Find What box, enter</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>^19 XE "cheese"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The code ^19 matches the opening field brace, the XE is the field code, and the word or phrase for the entry, in quotes -- for your example it's "cheese" but substitute whatever term you want to delete from the index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leave the Replace With box empty, and click the Replace All button. On completion, Word will tell you how many instances it removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, click the ¶ button again to turn off the invisible characters (this is important so the visible XE fields don't mess up the page numbering). Right-click in the index and choose Update Field in the menu.</p>

    <title>Loss of Edge Favorites in Host Computer after CI of 18277 in VMware. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Loss of Edge Favorites in Host Computer after CI of 18277 in VMware.</h2>
                    <p>Installed Build 18277 as an upgrade from 17763 in VMware. As this was a CI upgrade, nothing was synced after installation. Shortly thereafter, all Favorites were totally wiped out on my Host computer as it somehow synced with the virtual machine that had
 no Favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily I had a program called "EdgeManage" and was able to backup my Favorites from my test laptop and got them restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck is going on at MS. Losing data, loss of Activation, still no October Release.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue after issue, expected with Insider, not with my main system running Release. Deplorable! Maybe MS staff should stop their World travels to actually create a product that works. Shame!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Thankfully my test laptop was off, shut down main and was lucky to retrieve them with EdgeManage. Of course when I imported them to my main, didn't like as Edge was an older version than one in 18277. Edge would just crash.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I reset Edge on my main, it held the favorites so luckily it all worked out. Main is still not Activated though. Now backed up these Favorites. Great little program for Edge backups.</p>

<p>Same Settings here Hawkeyes, my vm should have grabbed the Favorites from the Host as it normally does. Not wipe them out in the Host with nothing there.</p>

</p><p>It appears to have made other changes in my Host computer, clicking on Saving a picture was pointed at a totally different folder than I normally used, same as my Download folder which is on another drive. Will add this to FBH.</p>

<p>I am wandering if the activate problem and the favs missing are connected at all and with your problems Johnny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I don't mind playing at home with computer problems but my work computer 'm there to work not fix a problem that MS somehow created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>FYI I ran the activate trouble shooter which sorted that problem on my host computer for Hyper-V and my work computer.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Numbering Page X of Y in different sections - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jc scien  say:</h3>
<h2>            Numbering Page X of Y in different sections</h2>
                    I want to be able to have different page numbering for an appendix within a document, but cannot figure out how to change the page numbers Y in the Page X of Y feature.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example, if the main body of the document is 10 pages and the appendix is 4 pages, I want the footer of the main body to read Page 1 of 10, Page 2 of 10, etc., while the appendix will read Page 1 of 4, Page 2 of 4, etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can change the page numbering of the X value, but not the Y value. &nbsp;The appendix currently reads Page 1 of 14, Page 2 of 14, etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be much appreciated.</div>

            You're probably using the standard feature for <span style="font-weight: bold">
X of Y</span> which employs the <span style="font-weight: bold">NumPages</span> Field resulting in the total number of pages in the document. For a more complex layout involving sections you need to replace the
SectionPages</span> field.<br />

<p>Whenever I open office 2007, i get the following two errors:<br />
1 "This document cannot be registered. It will not be possible to create links from other documents to this document."<br />
2 "There is insufficient memory or disk space. Word cannot display the selected font."<br />
<a href="http://bit.ly/gba9XV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/gba9XV</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/fETfBG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/fETfBG</a>&nbsp;these
 two links are two possible solutions to these problems.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What I have tried so far: deleted my printer entirely (I have 0 printer drivers installed). Tried opening in safe mode to see if it still presented a problem. it did (IE is not caused by a 3rd party add in).<br />
-onto the other page now -<br />
went into services.msc and played around with the dcomlauncher, even ran dcomcfg and confirmed all my permissions were set to default. no change. I deleted /DATA under office 12/word in the registry. no change.&nbsp;<br />
-other misc. stuff I tried-<br />
rebooting. it persisted<br />
microsoft office diagnostic tool. everything (check for known solutions, and memory, compatibility, disk and setup diagnostics) checked out. but it popped up saying it had fixed something...let's check that out...nope error still pops up.<br />
<br />
this error causes me to not be able to use any fonts but cambria or calibri. that's a bit of a problem.</p>

<p>Very first thing, INSTALL a PRINTER. Word is absolutely dependent on the default or currently selected printer driver.&nbsp; Word uses information from the printer driver, like font info, to control how it displays text on the screen. I suspect the same applies
 to your other Office apps.</p>
<p>Try using the Windows Explorer search to find NORMAL.DOT. The path you mention for Win7 is unfamiliar to me. In Vista the only copies of NORMAL.DOTM I find are in our personal ROAMING folders, ie</p>
<p>C:\users\&lt;username&gt;\appdata\roaming\Microsoft\templates\normal.dotm</p>
<p>( I have no idea where it would be stored on your configuration)</p>
<p>The thing about NORMAL.DOT(M) is that it stores "personal" configuration customizations. The Word program itself has the default parameters for NORMAL.DOT(M) hardcoded in it.&nbsp; If normal.dot(m) is deleted, Word will re-create it using those defaults.&nbsp; So
 it makes sense to me that they only appear in personal config folders.</p>
<p>If adding the printer doesn't help try following this trouble shooting procedure:</p>

<h3> saati---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N95 Software update</h2>
                    I recently updated ny Nokia N95 software from V12.0.013 to V20.0.015. Before updating as advised i had taken backup of all my data in memory card. After updating the software I restored the back from Memory card back to my phone. Even though all my messages,
 photos, music files where available but my Calender entries have been not been restored.<br />
<br />
Can somebody please help me to know whether it is possible to once again restore the Calender entries back to the Phone 'Or' Is it possible to get this from the Memory Card. I had a practise of keeping record of important daily events in my Calender for the
 last 2 years which is now not available.

<br />
Mine is not Network branded. The new version is not yet made available for all the N95 Codes.<br />
<br />
Nokia software update tells you whether the new version V20 is available for your phone. You have to know your phone code.

    <title>Today Screen&#47;Wallpaper&#47;Theme Problem Verizon xv6800-Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothy mieyal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Today Screen&#47;Wallpaper&#47;Theme Problem Verizon xv6800-Windows Mobile 6</h2>
                    
<p>Hello to all and thanks for your time here!&nbsp; I have a Verizon xv6800 with Windows Mobile 6 and am having a problem with my today screen background which remains blue no matter what, and will no longer set
 anything else as wallpaper, no matter what I do.&nbsp; What's even more puzzling is that I've discovered that when I click "set this picture as background" the screen remains blue but when I click the "Start" icon and the menus pop up on the left side of the screen
 I can see the photo only behind those items!&nbsp; I guess, in short, that blue screen is blocking the photos, or any other themes,&nbsp;from displaying as my background.&nbsp; Any idea why this is or how I could fix it?&nbsp; I don't even know where to start!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am sure is connected to this problem, and what I really hope to do is get my weather theme program up and running again (see bottom of this post).&nbsp; I've had this on my phone since the day of purchase
 in mid-June but yesterday the weather themes stopped showing up and I got the blue screen.&nbsp; I removed the "stocks and weather today" program and reloaded them via active sync today, the current weather continues to update fine but still no themes, only that
 darn blue screen.&nbsp; I really enjoy having those weather themes change the background of the today screen based on current weather conditions and hope to get it back working again if at all possible.&nbsp; It has worked great for the past five weeks so I know it's
 possible!&nbsp; However, since I am really only a novice when it comes to computers, programming, cell phones and especially Windows Mobile, this problem is way over my head and I would so appreciate anyone who might be able to help.&nbsp; I hope someone has an idea
 or two on how to get this problem resolved - sincerest thanks in advance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim</p>
<p>7/23/08</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Here are two relevant links - first to the exact weather theme program purchased at Handango and the second one to the company web site.&nbsp; I have been using this program error-free on my cell phone
 for the past five weeks, Handango states clearly&nbsp;at the top that this program&nbsp;is compatible with my phone (and&nbsp;it has worked for the past five weeks - until yesterday!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stocksandweathertoday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.stocksandweathertoday.com/</a>&nbsp;- near the very bottom
 center of their home page is the "Theme Pack" link to the free 100 extra weather themes.&nbsp; I've downloaded and synced that as well, just as I did in June, but this time the themes do not show&nbsp;up.&nbsp; Once again, thanks in advance to everyone!</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>

<p>It sounds like there is perhaps another today screen plugin or program that is cuasing the problem.&nbsp; Can you list the programs you have installed on your device and what (if any) programs you have installed recently?&nbsp;

<p>Hi and thanks for your quick response - I appreciate it!&nbsp; No programs have been added recently and the only ones I have installed on my phone are Stocks and Weather Today, Mobile E-Mail, Elecont Weather and Concrete
 Software Aces Texas Hold-Em.&nbsp; I think it is important to mention that the problem began when I used Microsoft Word Mobile and saved a short document on Tuesday July 22nd.&nbsp; From that point on, the weather themes stopped working and a whole host of other problems
 began, including synchronization errors, no more deleting files, my four programs were "moved", the weather themes/Today screen background stuck, etc.&nbsp; I am so grateful to the person who posted the following "fix" to similar problems as I followed those instructions
 and now everything is working correctly again, except the "Stocks and Weather Today" themes / my Today screen background.&nbsp; Here is the "fix" I am talking about, right from these wonderful forums (it is the last entry on the bottom of the page, and then is
 talked about quite a bit on page 4 of that question forum):</p>

<h3> tom ligon&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Equation Editor &#34;commutative diagram&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I want to create a typical "commutative diagram" using the equation editor. This can be done in the diagram add-on for LaTeX, and I can do it in PowerPoint, but I would like to know if it is possible to do it directly in the equation editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example of a commutative diagram, taken from Frauenfelder, Urs and van Koert, Otto, The Restricted Three-Body Problem and Holomorphic Curves. Springer (2018)
<span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/9****" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://doi.org/10.1007/9****</span></a></span>, equation (7.10). This diagram was created with the diagram add-on package for LaTeX.</p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65883f36-2aa2-48b4-88ee-5515ffdb607e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65883f36-2aa2-48b4-88ee-5515ffdb607e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Now, I would like to create a similar diagram using the Microsoft equation editor. One way I know of doing this is to use the equation editor within PowerPoint, save the diagram as an image file, and import that into Word.
 Here is a version created with PowerPoint (but it was more work than I like):</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/556ff1e6-d07f-48b4-b95a-aa528c24f40a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/556ff1e6-d07f-48b4-b95a-aa528c24f40a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>Is it possible to create such a diagram using the equation editor alone? I don’t see any way to rotate the right and left arrows. Also, I tried creating a 3x3 matrix and putting the respective elements in that, but there is no way to adjust the size
 of the elements of the matrix, as is possible in HTML tables. However, that might not be necessary. Also, it would be nice to be able to adjust the length of the top and bottom arrows.</span></p>

            It may be that you can only do this in PowerPoint or Excel. It seems that what you are looking for are connectors for a diagram rather than equation elements. It may be possible to do this in Word using a drawing canvas.

<p>This is the best I could do in Word's equation editor:</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's built as three separate equations in three paragraphs, the top and bottom lines and the&nbsp;<span>π</span>&nbsp;labels in the middle. The small labels are in the superscript portion of a "script" template
 rather than in an arrow operator. The arrows are drawn with the Insert &gt; Shapes tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drawbacks are that the horizontal arrows can't align vertically with the expressions on the left and right because the superscripts are too low; and it took a fair amount of trial and error to get things in the right places using spaces in the equations.
 Also, the arrows have to be anchored in a paragraph above or below the equations (otherwise the equation becomes left-aligned as a non-display equation), which means they could easily move out of alignment. Altogether, this is not a good solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, there are vertical arrows in the Symbols part of the Equation ribbon. Click the bottom of the three arrow buttons on the right side of the Symbols gallery, click the down arrow next to "Basic Symbols", and click Arrows in the menu. The fourth
 box in the top row is a downward arrow character. However, it can't be extended, and the&nbsp;<span>π labels would still have to be added separately.</span></p>

    <title>Subreports with null values not appearing in parent report group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dextermum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subreports with null values not appearing in parent report group header &#40;print preview&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am really new to Access and don't know how to code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have a parent report with 3 subreports linked by the person ID number. The record source is a query of a bunch of tables outer joined to each person using a table in between to form a relationship (e.g. tblPerson - trelPublication - tblPublication).
 Since not every person would have a publication, their ID wouldn't exist in the table in between. The lack of records is causing some of the subreports to go missing in print preview but they look perfectly fine in report view. Not sure if its worth noting,
 but the subreport headers are in the subreport group or report headers; they don't exist in the main report so the whole thing ends up as a blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to make it so it appears regardless if there is data? I've tried using the VBA code below while keeping CanShrink to Yes but to no avail:<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Private Sub Report_NoData(Cancel As Integer)</em><br />
<em>Cancel = True<br />
</em><em>End Sub</em></p>

<p>Subreports won't display if there is no data, so you have to fool Access into thinking there is data. You can use a Union Query as the Recordsource of your subreport, and make sure the union returns something (even if it's just blank data).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can substitute a Label on the Main report for your supreport.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, if you have column headers in the subreport, you could move those headers to the main report, which would always show regardless of whether the subreport is showing.</p>

            Following are likely solutions (Option 1 should fix the issue)<br />
<br />
1. Please try to repair your Office as a quick fix.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
7. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
11. Review the KB articles - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2779852<br />
<br />
12. If none of above works, please uninstall the current installed Office, and reinstall it again. Before resorting to uninstall, make sure that you have the license keys.<br />
<br />
To uninstall the Office, follow the instructions in the following support article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 &amp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179/en-us<br />
<br />
Note: Ensure to save the Fix it on the desktop and then run the file.

<h2>            Error&#58; 0x80070005 when launching OneNote on Android phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use OneNote on an Android phone, a Windows laptop and a Windows tablet, using the same Microsoft account to sync between them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to sign out of OneNote on the phone and sign back in again, to try to solve a syncing problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to sign back in, this appeared after I’d entered my email address and password:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Something went wrong and we can’t do what you asked. We’re sorry. Error: 0x80070005</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve tried pressing on ‘try again’, but the error just keeps appearing again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve tried restarting the phone, updating the installation of OneNote, and disabling and re-enabling it, but this still always happens when I try to launch it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OneNote still works OK on the laptop and tablet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could anyone please help?</p>

<p>Hi Jamshed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, but this didn't work. When I re-opened OneNote after reconnecting the wi-fi, and then pressed 'Sign in now', the 'Gettings things organized' screen appeared, but then the 0x80070005 error message appeared again.</p>

<p>Maybe I should explain what happened earlier, in case it helps ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened OneNote on my phone, and it wasn't syncing. On the main page, where 'Graham's Notebook' was listed, there was a red '!' icon next to it. I tapped this and then chose something like 'Show syncing error' (sorry, can't remember the exact words).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it said something like 'Password is needed to sync - tap here to enter password' (even though I was already signed in). I tapped this, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I signed out of OneNote, then tried to sign in again, and that was when the&nbsp;<span>0x80070005 error appeared, as explained in my original post.</span></p>

<p>That looks like it might work, but it did not work for me. My error code is the same as this article: 0x80070005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I log out of all my OneDrive &amp; Msft accounts, and uninstall and reinstall OneNote, then I get more than just the error box with a Retry and Close (which is really no choice at all), then I get something about being unable to connect through the network.
 So I tried the approach in this YouTube video. Yet I've used the network in other apps on the phone (before during and after this troubleshooting bonanza), so I'm certain it's not the network being unavailable. Perhaps the network is not available just to
 this app, but that points to a potential app development problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had similar issues around about the time of Graham's issues, between my android tablet and phone and desktop versions of OneNote. Then the problems stopped about a month or more ago, seemingly as no result of anything I did differently. Now I bought a
 new Samsung S9 and I can't login to OneNote on that phone, with this error 0x80070005. Phone new a few days ago, downloaded OneNote multiple times today from GooglePlay Store so those should not be factors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone from Microsoft help out here please?</p>

<p>Alright, today it just seemed to work. Partially. Not clear what's different, except that I checked OneNote while at the office. So two things I'd recommend to anyone else:</p>
<p>1. Just keep trying, who knows what might or might not work to solve whatever the problem is behind 0x80070005</p>
<p>2. Maybe it was the hotel network preventing some type of data transmission, as it connected using cellular data today (which I also tried yesterday)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also clarify, it sync'd one of my notebooks, then showed a red bang ! icon, no explanation behind that red bang, no error msg. I tried adding my other three notebooks (that I've maintained for a few years each) and they appear to be empty, also
 with red bang's. That's from using both cellular data only and also "hotel" wi-fi, and after attempting a Sync All. And I believe the one notebook that appeared to sync has 2-day old info, likely didn't sync from my other device that I worked on yesterday.
 Sigh.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your response. Are you installing the Creators Update then upgrade to the Preview build? You may try to directly install the Insider build 16251 using the ISO file then update to build 16275. Use the link below to get the ISO file of the Insider
 preview build. </p>

            <p>No. Trying to figure out what this does. See below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, i was wondering if this makes a notification pop up in lower right hand corner like my MS Outlook does at work when i get an email. Do you understand what i am saying? &nbsp;You need to have used Outlook to understand that or a version that did that for
 you.</p>

<h2>            Where is Version 14.2 of Outlook Connector located&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have posted on many forums including MS and all of the Outlook sections regarding this problem. I was using Outlook Connector when a pop up came saying there was a new version avaialble. I pressed upgrade and the program was downloaded. When I ran the
 update it would not load giving a flat this program did not install message. I uninstalled the previous version tried to run the upgrade. It would not work. I then downloaded the latest version available 14.1 and it wouldn't load, same error message and saying
 that there was a new version available. I cannot find a newer version and can't get anything to work. Since MS in it's infinite wisdom won't let users of WP7 phones directly sync with outlook, I'm as a dead end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone out there have a solution to this problem. </p>

<h2>            MS Project 2016 - Timeline issue with Master Project</h2>
                    <p>Hello - looking for some help please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a master project containing several subprojects. These all display as expected in the Gantt chart. When I however try and select tasks to display on a timeline, the tasks for one subproject get repeated against each subproject on the hierarchy
 displayed in task selection pane which pops up. If I try to add a task (e.g. task 3 of subproject 1), the incorrect task of subproject 3 will display. I have tried adding tasks to the timeline by right-clicking the respective task, however this still results
 in the same problem. I have also tried creating new files and adding these...all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or ideas? It feels like something is not working. I created the individual subproject files from a common file (to get consistent format), not sure if this would have caused an issue?</p>

<p>DarrenW_310,</p>
<p>Do you have cross-project links (i.e. links between tasks in different subprojects)? If so then you will see "repeated" tasks in the hierarchy of the timeline task selection window. That's because cross-project links create "ghost" tasks in each subproject
 and although you won't see the ghost tasks in the Gantt display at master level, (since the real task is already displayed), they do appear in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see an issue with incorrect tasks being added to the timeline. Can you provide a screen shot of an example?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do see is duplication of tasks. If you select a task via the hierarchy window and then also add the same task by right clicking, you will see the task duplicated on the timeline.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for the response.<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 7 Professional in two computers. &nbsp;The problem has been the same in both. &nbsp;I have tried Firefox, Explorer and Chrome. &nbsp;Although the Active X installation window never shows, I have installed it separately. &nbsp;I am the single user and administrator.
 &nbsp;I have never had any problems in that regard as far as installing software goes. &nbsp;I shut down Avast, AdAware and Malwaraebytes.<br />
<br />
The symptoms are this: &nbsp;When I press the “Play Now” button, a window opens that says the program is downloading, but it never downloads. &nbsp;Also, another symptom is that pressing the Play Now button results in nothing happening.<br />
<br />
A link on the window that has opened goes to “Having Troubles?”. &nbsp;This presents a long list of things to try, and I have tried all of them on all browsers.<br />
<br />
Cleared browsing history.<br />
<br />
There isn’t much in the way of add-ons (concentrating on Explorer, now). &nbsp;Java is turned off, but I understand that this is the recommendation, now, for all browsers. &nbsp;It's turned off in Chrome and Firefox, too.<br />
<br />
Just pressed the play now button in Explorer, again, and nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Pop up blocker is turned off.<br />
<br />
Reset internet security settings and cleared the cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't think of anything else to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            As I mentioned previously, none of the three browsers: &nbsp;Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer give satisfactory results. &nbsp;Firefox and Chrome both open a window that states the program is being downloaded, but nothing ever happens. &nbsp;In Internet Explorer,
 pressing the play now button results in nothing at all happening--as if the link goes nowhere.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I reset Internet Explorer and got no results as before.<br />
<br />
One thing I just noticed is that pressing the play now button implies that one wants to the play the game and not download it. &nbsp;But my Chrome and Firefox both open a window that says it is being downloaded. &nbsp;None offers to the play the game immediately.<br />
<br />
I Googled the issue, and learned that many people are having similar problems. &nbsp;My Windows 7 Pro is box stock. &nbsp;I have no problems at all with game or other issues. &nbsp;I cannot imagine anyone else with a similar OS doing any better. &nbsp;At this point I can only
 conclude that the problem lies with MSN Games. &nbsp;Shame on them for not managing their web page any better than that!<br />
<br />
I got to digging around in an older computer in which I played checkers and found a folder entitled MSN Installer. &nbsp;Apparently this folder is what MSN downloads for one to install the games. &nbsp;I am wondering if I could just transfer the folder to the computers
 in question and install the games from there?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continuing support.<br />

            After wasting may hours, my friends and I are convinced that this is an MSN problem! &nbsp;We are all engineers, technicians and experienced computer people. &nbsp;All have experienced the same problem when trying to download checkers--either no response at all
 or a window which states that the downloading is taking place but nothing happens.<br />
<br />
All have tried Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox. &nbsp;No amount of tinkering with browser setup has any effect.<br />
<br />
The problem behaves as though the URL is busy, but an interesting fact is that if one already has the game installed, it plays fine over the 'net. &nbsp;It is just the downloading function which does not work. &nbsp;A web search shows that many have had similar problems
 with MSN. &nbsp;The web page http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/msn.com.html sort of hints of that, but it does not seem to be a denial of service. &nbsp;It is more a denial of downloading activity.<br />
<br />
To really "put the frosting on the cake" and give proof to the issue, we located an MSN Installer file. &nbsp;In one or two instances in the past, it has installed OK, however if you try to use it you get a message window from MSN that it is unavailable at the time
 and to try later. &nbsp;We have tried it over and over at various times of day, but get the same message: "try again later". &nbsp;MSN is obviously aware of the situation but makes no effort to help. &nbsp;This is not an installation problem, but one in which the URL is
 not available for downloading!<br />
<br />
To those unfamiliar with the problem, the logical thing to do is to suggest that one try the various browser and computer checking exercises. &nbsp;Links on the web also refer to those same suggestions, but by and large the suggestions are linked to MSN as a source.<br />
<br />
It certainly does not speak well of MSN to deceive in this manner. &nbsp;A simple explanation would be appreciated by all.<br />

<h2>            proxyaddress in on premises in hybrid exchange</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When dirsync synchronize, there are 6 attributes which writes back including "Proxyaddresses", my question is does it overwrite whole value? or append and add x500 value to it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi SM,</p>
<p>It won’t overwrite the entire values stored in the ProxyAddresses attribute.</p>
<p>When a mailbox is moved from the on-premises environment to the Office 365 environment, the on-premises mailbox is converted to a Remote Mailbox. The Remote Mailbox's LegacyExchangeDN will be updated to reflect the new "External" administrative group. And
 the LegacyExchangeDN of online mailbox will be synced back as x500 address.</p>
<p>For more details, please refer to: <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/19901.dirsync-list-of-attributes-that-are-synced-by-the-azure-active-directory-sync-tool.aspx#Table_2_Attributes_that_are_written_back_to_the_on-premises_AD_DS_from_Windows_Azure_Active_Directory_in_an_Exchange_hybrid_deployment_scenario" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Cannot Delete or Change Alarms in Events in Default Calendar App in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a semi luddite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Delete or Change Alarms in Events in Default Calendar App in Samsung Galaxy S5</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 and I use Outlook for work. &nbsp;When I accept an invite and it appears in my Outlook calendar, it also appears in my Calendar app on my phone because I set up my phone calendar to sync with Outlook. &nbsp;The problem is that even though
 there are no alarms set on my computer's Outlook, the events appear WITH alarms in my phone calendar and there is no way that I can find to delete or to modify the alarm. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already contact Outlook Support on my phone and they told me that they do not know how to do this and they referred me to Office Support and to Android Support (Android Support cannot help me, I tried).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As&nbsp;I understand you are using default Calendar app which comes with your phone to sync Outlook Calendar and&nbsp;wants to turn off alarms in Events.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since it is a default app,&nbsp;we are not sure about the settings so you need to check with Samsung/Android support.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to install Outlook app and setup Outlook.com to access Calendar and check if it works fine.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are using Outlook app for Android, then refer the steps below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Tap the overflow icon in the top right corner of the app --&gt; Settings --&gt; Select email account --&gt; tap the name of the sound in line with "New mail sound" or "Event sound" and select "silent" or "none".</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or </p>
How do I turn on/off calendar alerts/notifications?
<div>Enable calendar alerts/notifications by following these steps:&nbsp;
<div>
<ol>
<li><span>Tap "Settings" in the bottom right corner of our app.</span></li><li><span>Under Calendar tap "Notifications"</span></li><li><span>Toggle "Enable Notifications" on or off.</span></li><li><span>If you would like to edit sounds --&gt; Tap "Sound" --&gt; Select a sound or "Off"</span></li></ol>

<h2>            Message notifications</h2>
                    SInce last time Skype upgraded my Desktop application on Windows 8.1 (to 7.40.0.104), message notifications have stopped working. I have gone through all my settings, and everything is on - and it was working previously. When I receive messages, I get
 no audio notification, and the Skype symbol in the taskbar doesn't change colour like it used to, so I can't see when I get messages. Could it be a problem with the new version?

                    I installed the Office Professinal 2007 upgrade several weeks ago.&nbsp; I can open an old 2003 document and edit it in Word, but CANNOT open a NEW Word document and insert anything.&nbsp; I have NO cursor, words are counted, etc and when I go to close the document
 I am asked if I want to save it.&nbsp; Please help, this is extremely aggravating.&nbsp; All other Office programs work fine.
