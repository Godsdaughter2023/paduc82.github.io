<h2>            Error Code-0X8007000d-Data Is Invalid</h2>
                    Note: I encountered superb tech support from Microsoft and the Problem was fixed. But what has me worried is what was it's cause ? I installed G-Data IS2010&nbsp;&nbsp; Security Suite, and the support rep stated that it might be interferring, or partially the cause.
 Strange because G-Data is recommended by Microsoft as a preferred vendor, on their list of third party vendors. We intitiated a system restore on the&nbsp;date of installing&nbsp;G-Data and sure enough on Windows 7, Action Centre it&nbsp; showed not activated. We initiated
 a second system restore back to my old apps, P.C. Tools Firewall Plus, Sunbelt's Vipre, Prevx 3.0 and Malwarebytes and all of a sudden the Installation Numbers appeared on the Activation window&nbsp;! &nbsp;I've left a posting on Ultimate Internet Security's Forum,
 the U.K. third party vendor for G-Data, and am at the moment uneasy about downloading the product again, due to this conflict. Has anyone else encountered this Error Message or conflict specific

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>When exactly did you get the error message?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>There are many reasons why we get this error message.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>When you try to use Windows Anytime Upgrade (WAU) to upgrade Windows you may receive the error message.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>This problem occurs because Windows Internet Explorer 7 recognizes the MIME type of the digital license and determines that the link must be opened by using the Software
 Licensing Commerce Client (SLCC).<br />
<br />
This problem may also occur if either of the following conditions are true: </span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>An error occurs during the download process.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>The Automatic Update Manager (AUM) does not correctly format the XML for the Digital License Package (DLP) before the download process is started.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Ok, so I got past all the nonsense regarding unable to connect to Live. I got to where it said it required my email and password or whatever to proceed, so I selected continue. Almost immediately after, a window pops up saying:</p>
<p>This feature is temporarily unavailable.</p>
<p>Please try again later</p>
<p>Status Code: d0000033</p>


<p>Anyone else have/had this problem?</p>

<p>I figured out the problem. Without the completed update, I thought maybe the Xbox didn't know how to prompt me for the password... that's why the feature is unavailable. So, I signed in with someone else's gamertag who had never connected to Live since the
 update (so it won't prompt the password automatically) to complete the update and then I tried to sign into Live and it worked. Pass it on!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>The error "the</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>installation failed in First_Boot phase with an error during SYSPREP operation" often happens when Fast Boot is enabled in a computer's UEFI settings, and also if you have a third-party antivirus
 program enabled during the installation. We recommend temporarily disabling any third-party antivirus software you have before attempting the update.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>have to</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>If your computer supports UEFI, follow the steps below to access the UEFI settings:</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Click <strong>Start</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Type <strong>Settings</strong> and <strong>Press</strong> <strong>
Enter</strong>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Click <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Click <strong>Recovery</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Under <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>Startup</strong>, click <strong>
Restart</strong> <strong>Now</strong>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>After your computer restarts, click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Click <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>Options</strong>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Click <strong>UEFI</strong> <strong>Firmware</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Click <strong>Restart</strong>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Once your computer restarts, you should be taken to the UEFI settings, which varies for each manufacturer. Find the boot settings and turn off
<strong>Fast</strong> <strong>Boot</strong> if it's on.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Restart your computer and see if you're able to install Creators Update after that.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Have you already tried installing Creators Update from a<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>clean boot</span></span></a><span><span>?
 It's possible that some drivers that are installed on your<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>computer</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>are causing conflicts with the installation, which could be solved by doing the installation while in a clean boot environment.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay in responding. I transferred all the files I made using office 2007 wps. Microsoft help line told me windows 10 using office 365 2016 in unable to read office 2007. They stated I will have to download 2007 in order to use those files,
 bummer.</p>

            If you just want to read them search Google for microsoft word reader or microsoft excel reader. You could also try a free version of office like Libra Office or Open Office.

            <p>I'm surprised Office 365 won't open your documents, what format did you save them in.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never used Office 365 but thought it was an online suite similar to Google Docs. Based on that I would have thought you could still use Office 2007 if you need to. You could still try a free version of Office as I suggested earlier and if that doesn't
 do it for you then go the Office 2007 route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

            office 365 opens the documents, but they can not be read. I had Geek squad at Best Buy download and they put everything in a file, but office 2007 didn't transfer. Can't find the disc, so I opted for 365. Microsoft help desk tried and also verified it
 was office 2007. &nbsp;What is the free version called? I only saw an icon for a free trial version of 365? &nbsp; Geek squad also downloaded my info to an external hard drive, so if I have to just start over I can. If I put 2007 on the computer will it interfere with
 365 which I have paid a year for?&nbsp;

            Hi Debby,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Thank you @ DaveM121. I followed your instructions however, that did not fix the issue. I received a message stating, "There was a problem resetting your pc." I will have to get a computer repair Tech to take a look at it. Again, thank you for your time.

<h2>            Dell Precision M4600 backlit keyboard not working - standard keyboard driver will not correct issue</h2>
                    I replaced my keyboard and tried to turn on the keyboard illumination in the BIOS. &nbsp;It changed, but then kicks an error saying that the driver is inaccessible. &nbsp;Need the backlit keyboard driver. &nbsp;Cannot locate it on the Dell website or via google search.
 &nbsp;I have Win 7. &nbsp;Keyboard works fine except for the backlit function which is operational on the M4600 models, but requires the updated driver.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Booting From USB Not Working</h2>
                    Suddenly one of my laptops stopped working. It was running Windows 10 and gave me an error on startup that said UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME. I did not recently download or change anything that would've harmed the computer (i think), and after researching the
 issue, I decided to use a different laptop to use this&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8 to download a Windows 8.1 32-bit OS (what I had before the windows 10 upgrade) to a freshly puchased 32gb USB stick. I installed it onto the usb,
 and once it was finished I took it out and plugged it into the broken computer. I opened BIOS and made it boot to SanDisk (the drive im using) and it started up without fuss to the Windows 8 logo. After the dots finished their spinning, I got a blank screen
 with nothing but my mouse which was functioning normally. I don't have an exactly high-end machine, so I figured I would let it sit for a while. Half an hour later still nothing. I read from an article that something like t

            <p>There are varied reasons for that error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have hard drive failure, etc.</p>
<p>This information from Dell describes it</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/SLN129813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/SLN129813</a></p>
<p>
UNMOUNTABLE BOOT VOLUME <br />
<br />
INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE
</p><p>These two errors have similar causes and the same troubleshooting steps apply to both of them. These stop codes always occur during the startup process. When you encounter one of these stop codes, the following has happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>The system has completed the Power-On Self-Test (POST).</li><li>The system has loaded NTLDR and transferred control of the startup process to NTOSKRNL (the kernel).</li><li>NTOSKRNL is confused. Either it cannot find the rest of itself, or it cannot read the file system at the location it believes it is stored.<br />
When troubleshooting this error, your task is to find out why the Windows kernel is confused and fix the cause of the confusion.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>The SATA controller configuration in the system BIOS</strong> If the SATA controller gets toggled from ATA to AHCI mode (or vice versa), then Windows will not be able to talk to the SATA controller because the different modes require different drivers.
 Try toggling the SATA controller mode in the BIOS.</li><li><strong>RAID settings</strong> You may receive this error if you've been experimenting with the RAID controller settings. Try changing the RAID settings back to Autodetect (usually accurate).</li><li><strong>Improperly or poorly seated cabling</strong> Try reseating the data cables that connect the drive and its controller at both ends.</li><li><strong>Hard drive failure</strong> Run the built-in diagnostics on the hard drive. Remember:
<strong>Code 7</strong> signifies correctable data corruption, <strong>not</strong> disk failure.</li><li><strong>File system corruption</strong> Launch the recovery console from the Windows installation disc and run
<strong>chkdsk /f /r</strong>.</li><li><strong>Improperly configured BOOT.INI (Windows Vista).</strong> If you have inadvertently erased or tinkered with the boot.ini file, you may receive stop code 0x7B during the startup process. Launch the recovery console from the Windows installation disc
 and run <strong>BOOTCFG /REBUILD</strong></li></ul>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Media Player 12 in Win 8 won't play any type of DVD Disk or File due to licensing reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your options would be to activate Media Center, which will play them, as well provide additional codecs for some other file types for Media Player...</p>
<p>To do this in Win 8 Pro, there is a fee of $9.99.</p>
<p>For Win 8 Base, you will need the ProPack which is considerably more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, you may already have a program like CyberLink, Nero, Roxio\Sonic on your machine that will play them... If not, there are a number of free players available.</p>
<p>VLC and Media Player Classic are the two I see mentioned the most, but there are others.</p>

<h3> engineer_and_you  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows-7 Task Scheduler doesn&#39;t Wake the laptop at the scheduled time</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Instead of Shutting down my laptop, I put it to sleep at night. Thereafter, the laptop is scheduled to execute the following
<strong>sequence of tasks scheduled in my Windows</strong>-7:</p>
<ol>
<li>At 4:00 AM, execute a 'Task A'. To perform this task, the <span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
laptop&nbsp;</span>wakes from its sleep because 'Task A' has&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">the "Wake the computer to run this task" enabled.</span></li><li>At 5:06 AM, Hibernate (not to be confused with Sleep) the <span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
laptop&nbsp;</span>by running the command "rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,0,0"</li><li>At 5:30 AM, run a 'Task B'. To perform this task, the <span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
laptop&nbsp;</span>is supposed to wake up from its hibernation because this 'Task B' too has the "Wake the computer to run this task" enabled.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>
<p>The laptop&nbsp;faithfully wakes from its sleep at 4:00AM to perform 'Task A'. However, it isn't always faithful in waking from its hibernation at 5:30 AM. 3 days ago (on 13th April), it woke up at&nbsp;5:46 AM instead of 5:30 AM. Today, it hadn't waken up even even
 by 6:05 AM!!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Then there are the following
</span><strong>interesting phenomenon&nbsp;</strong>around<span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)"> this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Today, at 6:05 AM, when I found that the <span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
laptop&nbsp;</span>hadn't woken up, I checked whether the power supply was ON...it wasn't. As soon as I turned on the power supply, it automatically woke up. When it woke up, it showed that the battery was charged 64% !! Implying, my manual intervention of switching
 ON the power supply shouldn't have been needed in the first place!<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Earlier, on 13th April, however, no manual intervention of any sort happened and the computer had its power supply ON throughout the night. Yet it woke up AFTER the scheduled time.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Then this act of waking up from hibernation after the scheduled time is intriguing for me. From my viewpoint, the computer should either wake up at the scheduled time, or it shouldn't wake up at all
 because I have NEITHER selected the <em>"Run the task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed"</em> option NOR the
<em>"If the task fails, restart every"</em> option.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here, I would like to provide a few <strong>clarifications &amp; confirmations</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are no defects in the backup provided by my laptop's battery because it does provide safe backup for around 2-to-3 hours. Even as I am typing this post, my laptop's actually on battery, not on AC power supply.</li><li>I generally let the laptop's power supply ON for the whole night as a precaution against battery running out of power. Even on 13th April, it was ON. Last night was the first exception in this regime which started 21 days ago.</li><li>I do not have either the "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power" or the "Stop if the computer switches to battery power" options enabled for either of the scheduled tasks in question.</li><li>I also have the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Advanced power settings
<em>"allow wake timers"</em> is set to enable for both <em>"On Battery"</em> and <em>
"Plugged In"</em>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I have the following <strong>questions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does the computer faithfully wake from its sleep but not as faithfully wake from its hibernation?</li><li>Does the state of power supply play any role in this act of waking from hibernation? Does it matter whether the computer&nbsp;is on battery power or on AC power at the time of waking up when neither the&nbsp;"Start the task only if the computer is on AC power" nor
 the "Stop if the computer switches to battery power" option enabled?</li><li>Finally, what can I do to correct this erratic behavior?&nbsp;</li></ol>

            <p>"<em>2&nbsp; Does the state of power supply play any role in this act of waking from hibernation?" -
</em>Yes, for many computers**, Task scheduler cannot wake a computer from hibernation whatever settings are made in the Task definition unless the AC power is on.&nbsp; This limitation is not documented but it is real, as you have discovered, and it has been a
 limitation&nbsp;for at least 16 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[**&nbsp; There might be exceptions but I have not seen one.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also seen tasks behave as though the&nbsp;<em><span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Run the task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed</span></em> option has been set.&nbsp; This unexpected behaviour has also been around for some time but I have never
 seen an explanation for it.&nbsp; Windows 10 has the same behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>3&nbsp; Finally, what can I do to correct this erratic behavior?&nbsp;</em>"&nbsp; Nothing&nbsp;- you have to&nbsp;adapt to it.&nbsp; For example, I have a timer set for early in the morning so I must remember to sleep the computer instead of hibernating it the night before.&nbsp; Hibernation
 has therefore become, for me, an exception - if I'm not using the computer I sleep it&nbsp;whereas&nbsp;if I am putting the computer into my rucksack I hibernate it.</p>

 useless.</p>

            <p>Right - a Scheduled Task cannot be configured to wake the system from Hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the task Properties the Condition is "Wake the computer to run this task":</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63e76562-a3b8-4231-ab01-15ad5d1b2dbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63e76562-a3b8-4231-ab01-15ad5d1b2dbd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The key words here are "Wake" and "Sleep".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your system is sleeping it is still able to look for stimulus...&nbsp; like a mouse click or keyboard stroke to wake it up or a Scheduled Task to wake it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way you can be awakened is if you are sleeping - you cannot be awakened if you are hibernating (aka powered completely off=dead).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot use a ST to wake the computer from Hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to set an option in your BIOS to power up the system at a certain time and then have a ST run a few minutes after that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to configure your router to send a WOL (wake on LAN) packet to the system at a certain time and then have a ST run a few minutes after that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Useless replies?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some frequently banned user has some good advice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ignore replies that begin with the words "Hi" or "Hello" contain <strong>Methods
</strong>and <strong>Steps</strong>, ignore sentences that begin with word "try" and replies that end with the words "check if it helps" you can save yourself an awful lot of time and frustration.</p>

            <p>Disabling Cortana is not enough. A lot more had to be done to fix it, plus other problems needed to be fixed, such as getting a search box in the start menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I scoured the internet in search of a customer service number for Microsoft and I finally found one. They hide it very well but I found it.&nbsp; It wasn't even a number. I had to click on a button to have them call me back.&nbsp; I tried finding it again and couldn't,
 but just the same my issue was resolved.&nbsp; The Microsoft people finally did it after a few hours of working on it for me remotely.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few hours later the supervisor called me to see if everything was ok. I was lucky because everything wasn't ok and I'd have a hard time trying to get a hold of the Microsoft people again.&nbsp; I hated that Windows 10 didn't have it like Windows 7 did.&nbsp; I was
 lucky the supervisor called me back to ask if my problems were resolved because I thought they were but they weren't.&nbsp; After the first MS guy helped me the background on my laptop was gone, the supervisor put it back, and finally the Cortana search engine
 was eliminated.&nbsp; Before the supervisor called, the Cortana search engine still popped up, but not as frequently. She will be calling me back tomorrow to see if the problem was resolved this time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to you all in getting rid of the Cortana search engine from popping up on your own. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I found out that the Microsoft moderators are not Microsoft employees, and the guy from Microsoft told me that all the moderators do is try to trouble shoot problems without real knowledge of how to fix them.&nbsp; I didn't know this.&nbsp; I still think
 its wonderful that the moderators try to help and I am very thankful and grateful that they are here to give us computer dummies hope. :)</p>

    <title>Problem with drivers at installing Windows 7 Ultimate on clean HDD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with drivers at installing Windows 7 Ultimate on clean HDD</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I bought an ASUS Eee PC 1005PE computer last week. It came with windows 7 starter, and a bunch of programs I didnt really wanted to have, like games and others.</p>
<p><strong>The partition was like the following:</strong></p>
<p>1 primary partition C &lt;- 7 starter on it (NTFS)</p>
<p>2 primary partition D &lt;- empty (NTFS)</p>
<p>3 hidden partition &lt;- Recovery image disc or something to boot from BIOS settings to restore computer to factory state (FAT32)</p>
<p>4 unkown partition &lt;- for ASUS Express Gate, a mini SO to do basic stuff. (??)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I didn't wanted to waste space on the last 2 partitions, cause I had no interest it, but for safety I would waste 10G space on the hidden partition to restore to factory state.</p>
<p>So I deleated all the other partitions, and got myself a Windows 7 Ultimate DVD image on a usb pendrive.</p>
<p>On the pendrive, I made the steps to get it bootable and plus, I added a file where I put all the drivers for my computer, that I downloaded from ASUS site.</p>
<p><strong>Now, I wanted to leave the partitions of my disk in a personal way, like this:</strong></p>
<p>1 Primary partition &nbsp;for windows 7 ultimate (NTFS)</p>
<p>2 Primary partition &nbsp;for backups (NTFS)</p>
<p>3 Extended partition</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.1 Primary partition for all my data (NTFS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.2 unallocated space (25G)</p>
<p>4 Primary partition with the image to recover to factory state (FAT 32)[this is actually at the end of the HDD]</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The problem</span></strong></p>
<p>So I clean all the other partitions, except the one with the recovery Image, I tried to use the 7ultimate to partition but when the installation reaches the part about where to install, it says the classical error about drivers and a CD/DVD, and to browse
 for drivers.</p>
<p>I go to my pendrive file with the SATA drivers for my ASUS Eee PC 1005 PE, and even trying with the drivers that are not listed cause they are not compatible, and with the compatible ones that appears on the list, it says: "No new drivers could be found.
 Make sure the driver files are correct and located on the driver installation media"</p>
<p>So as I couldn't pass this, I got an Ubuntu Live CD installed on another pendrive I've got, and used the application GParted to partition the disk as I mentioned above, as I wanted it to be. Then, tryied to install Windows 7 Ultimate and having still the
 same problem. So I went into forums and checking the reasons of this problem, and I see some recommend as solution, changing the BIOS settings, of the HDD drive to ACHI, so I did go into my BIOS and I found the configuration was already (enhanced) ACHI, so
 i changed to (enhaced) IDE, to (compatible) and to (disabled), all the options for the SATA drive on the BIOS, and I tryied all the drivers that appear when I select and open the driver I downloaded on ASUS site, so, I gave up and tryied to boot to the recovery
 image thing, that leaves the computer like factory settings and then try to upgrade it, but it seems that after cleaning all the partitions except it, the BCD changed.</p>
<p>So then I went to google again and look for solutions to the BCD, and I tryied to fix it, re make it and everything and nothing. So now I cannot boot to that partition with the F9 option on my BIOS settings, and I cannot leave the computer with Windows 7
 started as factory state was.</p>
<p><strong>In resume:</strong></p>
<p>I cannot install windows 7 ultimate regardless of what I do. I'm using diferent configurations on my BIOS for the SATA HDD, I'm using all the drivers that appears for the ASUS on the oficial site, and still I cannot get to pick where to install windows 7
 ultimate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I been like this, trying and trying for over 3 days now, and still no solution, so I would really appreciate some help here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Steve</p>

            I got it working, the problem its the lame way the installer works, drivers and computer was fine. Microsoft shouldn't even mention about the chance of installing windows 7 from a USB pendrive, if the installer its so lame to not recognize certain information
 during installation.

<p>The ... I will not say it now... but lets just say -not good- windows installer, "ejects" the pendrive/unit where you have the windows installer, at that point, so all you have to do, is unplug the usb pendrive/harddisk where the windows 7 dvd image is on,
 and plug it back again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah yeah, I know it dosent sound like it, but thats the solution, the message of error its pretty wrong and the installer shouldnt eject the usb on the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. I didnt posted this before cause I was really mad, and didnt get any real support from microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I'm using ubuntu now btw, far way better)</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Switch Accounts</h2>
                    <p>I recently redeemed the Minecraft Windows 10 Beta for one of my accounts, but I realized that I had redeemed it for the wrong account. Is it possible to transfer the game to the other account without creating a new account, or destroying Xbox profiles on both? I would like the two accounts intact after the transfer if possible</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

How to Do a System Restore in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html</span></a><br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Mouse - look for TouchPad Settings - mine is under Device Settings tab and yours<br />
maybe different (it is NOT the Scrollings tab which is for the mouse). On some you can enable<br />
and disable the scroll and/or set the size of the area and the sensitivity of the touchpad.<br />
<br />
Some will&nbsp;have a&nbsp;TouchPad control progam/icon in the Notification&nbsp;Area near the clock&nbsp;- lower<br />
right.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Some setups have Hotkeys that control some of the TouchPad Settings.<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker's Support, on-line documentation, and the Dell forums. In fact the forums<br />
are probably the best single source of information.<br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
If needed : (make sure you have rebooted at least once if the above did not work)<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on Touch Pad - Driver's Tab -<br />
Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers), now RIGHT CLICK<br />
on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself (all in it). REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack. <br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Vista and Windows 7's is the same except we need to clear the<br />
specific device if present.<br />

<br />
Then go to System maker's site&nbsp;and get the latest touchpad drivers.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.</p>

You should have either an icon in your notification area (system tray), or set up for the touchpad in Control Panel. From there you can set all of your touchpad features. If you can't find help in either location, check the manual that came with the laptop,
 or the online documentation from Dell.</p>
