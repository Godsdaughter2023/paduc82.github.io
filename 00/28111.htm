    <title>Outlook 2010 meeting&#92;appointment tracking issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 meeting&#92;appointment tracking issue</h2>
                    <p>Responses from external meeting invitees are not being picked up by Outlook 2010 tracking they just show as 'none' when the accepted response has been delivered directly to the Inbox and opened. There are no rules set for acceptances.</p>
<p>This only appears to be for a couple of users and I can't replicate it sending a meeting request to the same people.</p>
<p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>1. New Outlook profile</p>
<p>2. /cleanfreebusy</p>
<p>3. /sniff</p>
<p>4. /cleansniff</p>
<p>5. Checked 'Automatically process meeting requests and responses to meeting requests and polls' under Outlook mail options</p>
<p>6. Checked 'Automatically update original sent item with reciept information' under Outlook mail options</p>
<p>7. Checked 'Update tracking information, and then delete responses that don't contain comments</p>
<p>Internally within my organisation meeting tracking is updated immediately and works fine.</p>

            <p>Were these responses also received as special meeting response items or as regular email messages? The message icon should be a giveaway ;-)</p>
<p>As you cannot replicate the issue, it could be that something went wrong with just this specific meeting request. From the information provided, it would be hard to determine that cause though.</p>

            <p>They were the special meeting response items with the picture of the calendar with a tick through for accepted.</p>
<p>It's not just 1 meeting, it has done it for&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;external meetings they have organised for the same groups of people from a number of companies.&nbsp;Unfortunately they are director level meetings with a number of banks so it's difficult to do a lot of
 testing with them.</p>

<h2>            Authentication Protocol not supported by this version of Office - One Drive for Business</h2>
                    
<p>i have seen this question asked elsewhere, but there never seems to be a resolution.</p>
<p>i have successfully connected onedrive to my office 365 account and that is synced. &nbsp;the problem is that when accessing a shared folder by another user on the same domain and office 365, i get "the server you are trying to access is using an authentication
 protocol not supported by this version of office" &nbsp;i have done complete uninstalls and reinstalls of all office 365 product with no luck. &nbsp;things were working fine up until a week or so ago. &nbsp;help!</p>
<p>i have the groove.exe version number:16.0.6366.2056</p>
<p>again, i can sync my own folder just fine, but accessing a folder that was shared with me is the issue and it was working previously until now. &nbsp;our office 365 admin cannot figure this out either.</p>

            Take a close look at the lower right corner of the document window. To the right of the Scroll Bar arrows there is a button that looks kinda like this:&nbsp; ◫ Drag it to where you want the split. Or, you can double-click it, then drag the split bar to where
 you want it.<br />
<br />
Another option is to select Split in the Window menu then either dbl-click the Horizontal split bar to remove it or drag it to the top edge of the sheet.<br />

<h2>            Linking fields in different tables with unique values&#59; URGENT HELP REQUIRED</h2>
                    Hi guys!&nbsp;<br />
I got asked in my job to make a database, did so but one of the main things they need is a field that recognises the option chosen from a combo box and decides on the calculations used in the following fields based on the selection. Need URGENT help as I fear
 I may lose my job in the company if I cannot do this. I will attach links to screenshots of what I mean. If anybody can tell me how to do this/ can do it for me I will give my word that I will reward them, via PayPal, upon confirmation of it working.
<div><br />
I will describe what you are seeing from these links in the following lines;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://gyazo.com/06e7eed2ae9ee2191ba0cb665a1a15ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gyazo.com/06e7eed2ae9ee2191ba0cb665a1a15ce</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This shows the product column, the company chosen, and the plan from the company. What I need is for the percentages to be filled in automatically from another table. Y1, Y2 stands for Year 1, Year 2.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://gyazo.com/7d5d3366c9f763ab669d1e14b067e058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gyazo.com/7d5d3366c9f763ab669d1e14b067e058</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This shows all the plans and the percentages for y1, y2. I need these to be automatically entered in the form spreadsheet from the image above. Image 1 is from a form, while 2 is from a table both in access. The % in 1 were manually entered and usually
 appear as blanks when filling in the record but I need it to appear based on the plan chosen in image 2. I may need to add more plans and % so hopefully whatever solution will be able to just continue on and recognise the new inputs.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>Can this be done?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please reply with any help asap.</div>
<div><br />
As I said I will reward.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

            <div>Ok thanks Karl, Sorry it was a bit of a rushed request for help earlier. The pictures in the links are now displayed below.</div>
<div>The explanation for the database is as follows. We are a financial broker that sells all type of insurance, seen below in "Product". &nbsp;We offer many different insurance plans, shown for many different companies. The first 3 fields shown below. All 3 are
 short texts, in a combo box, and a value list to display all the different types of plans available. The "Plan/Plans" field is linked with the "Company Plan" field so it shows all the plans on offer.</div>
<div>We then need the field "Monthly Premium" to show how much each client pays as a premium for their plan, this field is a currency and format as euro. We then have a hidden field which is "Monthly Premium - 1% Government Levy" This is a calculated field,
 simply multiplying "Monthly Premium" by 0.99. Then we can generate commissions that our employee who sold the deal gets and that the company itself gets. We do this by using a calculated field of "Monthly Premium - Levy" multiplied by 12, (to give annual pay).
 Then this result is multiplied by the individual commission plan for each individual insurance plan. And then multiply this result by the % the employee receives and the company receives. This is done for each year with a different % being applied each year.
 All fields use currency for their calculated value in either euro or % format.</div>
<div><br />
The second image shows some of the plans on offer, with their individual commission rates for each year. &nbsp;What I am looking for is some way of getting these % figures to automatically appear when the administrative worker chooses the plan from the "Plan/Plans"
 field to generate relative to their chosen plan meaning all that the worker has to do is enter the figure into Monthly Premium and then the results of our commissions received will be calculated.</div>
<div>From the images it can be seen that the % figures do not match up as the % in the first image were put in manually. So really what I'm looking to do is link the % figures for Y1, Y2, Y3 etc. to their relative plan. Can anyone help with this??</div>
<div>Many thanks and all help welcome,</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>James</div>

<div>And really what I am looking to do is link the values from the "Y1 % Commission" field in the "Contact List" form to the "Y1 Commission %" field in the "Commission Calculator" table and to their individual row.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So an e.g would be that, if "Calledonian Indexed" from the first image was chosen as the Plan it would link that the commission rates for the relevant years would be 100% for Y1, 40% for Y2, 20% for Y3 and so on from "Commission Calculator". And it would
 automatically &nbsp;be entered in the "Y1 % Commission" "Y2 % Commission" and so in the "Contact List" form.</div>

            Well first, you have design issues. Its hard to tell, but you need at least three tables here.
<div><br />
<div>You have your contacts table, a plans table and a commissions table. Your commissions table should NOT have fields like Y1 Commission. That is known as a repeated group and violates normalization rules. The commission table should look like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblCommission</div>
<div>CommissionID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>PlanID (FK)</div>
<div>CommissionType</div>
<div>CommissionPercent</div>
<div><br />
<div>So instead of fields for Y1 Commission, Y2 Commission, you would have records for Y1 Commission and Y2 Commission etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, to do a report on the commission amounts, you would create a query that joins the tblCommision to tblPlan and calculates the commission amounts.</div>

            Ok Thank you Scott.
<div>So I should create a new table for the Commission figures. Just going to make sure I understand this I create a new table called Commission, thats what tblCommission is right? And then the first field would be an Autonumber field called CommissionID. What
 does PK mean? And the next field would be a field called PlanID as a short text? Then fields CommissionType and CommissionPercent. Could I add fields called CommissionPercent1, CommissionPercent2, CommissionPercent3 etc as the commission percentages would
 change each year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What would the tblPlan have in it? Just the Plan names?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I apologize for my lack of knowledge on the subject as I said earlier I really no very little on access aside from the very basics of making new fields and using the correct data types.</div>
<div><br />

            PK means primary key. PlanID is a Foreign key, So the data type for PlanID depends on the datatype of the Primary key of your Plans table.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>No, whenever you have fields that are numbered like CommissionPercent1, CommissionPercent2, etc. that is a repeating group. I suspect you are more used to working with spreadsheets then relational databases. CommissionType would identify the year or you
 could add a Year field if there are different types of commissions within a year. You may need a lookup table that just lists the commission types. In that case, you would select the commission type from a combo that uses the lookup table.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You want a vertical structure where each record represents a type of commission rather than a horizontal structure where fields identify commissions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for the Plans table, it depends on your data. If each client has one plan and one plan only, then you would not need a separate plans table. and instead of using PlanID as a foreign key you could use ClientID. If a client can have multiple plans, then
 you need a separate Plans table with whatever info you need about each plan,</div>

            Ok I understand how to create fields as Primary Keys and foreign keys. I am learning how to do a lot more on that this evening or tomorrow evening with someone who said they could teach me how to use them.&nbsp;
<div>Yes I am a lot more used to working with spreadsheets then relational databases.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ok I think I understand what you mean. So what would I do regarding fields if it was the commission rate would only change on a yearly basis. e.g in year 1 it would be 100% commission, year 2 it would be 20% commission, year 3 it would be a different figure
 again and the same for year 4. &nbsp;I currently have a lookup table working to identify the plans and a combo box offering the different plans, but that is all it does. It only shows the plan and you can select the plans from a different table.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ok yes I understand the piece on plans I think. I know that some of our clients, in fact a lot of them, have multiple plans so I need another table with the info of the plans. Meaning I will have to use PlanID as the primary key yes?</div>

            Like I said, you have a record for each commission type. So if you have a different commission rates for PlanA for Year1, 2, 3, 4, &amp; 5, then you would have different record for each year. If you have only 3 years for PlanB then you would have 3 records
 for PlanB.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if you identify the commission only by year or whether there are other identifiers. If so, you may need both a Commission Type field and a Year field.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>You don't have to use PlanID as the PK, but you need to have some PK for the Plans table. I prefer to use an autonumber for my PKs and name then tablenameID. So the PK for tblPlans would be PlanID.&nbsp;</div>

            Ok. What do you mean by commission type? Would this be a combo box say of the type of plan relating to say pension, investments, savings etc? Or something else? We would only base our commission only by year. I have been given a sheet of the commission
 percentages for every plan which just gives a table with a plan column and then year 1 column year 2 column year 3 column etc. The commissions are predetermined values that just need to be entered onto a computer.&nbsp;
<div>So I could just follow your idea on the 2 tables and in the tblPlan I would have a field PlanID, short text, as the PK and create a record for every plan there is e.g a record for Aviva Option 1 , another record for Aviva option 2, option 3 etc. Is that
 all I would need in the tblPlan?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then in the tblCommission I would have an Autonumber field ID as the PK and PlanID as a FK, another field as CommissionType and CommissionPercentage as another field.</div>
<div>Then create records for year 1 a new record for year 2 another for year 3 etc. and fill in the relative values for each year.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Am I correct in thinking this?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regards,</div>

<p>Bookmarks in the Favorites Bar when imported show in reverse alpha order.&nbsp; In other words, they start with&nbsp;Z, as in Zebra&nbsp;and list in reverse alpha order&nbsp;to A as in Apple.&nbsp; How do you reverse the order, or alphabetize the&nbsp;imported bookmarks in Favorites
 to list bookmarks from A to Z?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The answer is simple, but unpleasant...&nbsp; "Sort" and "Manage Bookmarks" no longer exists in Edge as it did in IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must manually drag &amp; drop the bookmarks to get them in the order you wish.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>There is a posting in other forums about a 'fix' in the Registry.&nbsp; But I believe that is one time only and you'd need to repeat it every time you want to alphabetize.&nbsp;

</p><p>The folks in the Windows Insider program have been testing a version of Edge that has native support for sorting.&nbsp; I'd expect that this version will be available in July with the release of the Anniversary Update to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can use a 3rd-party application called EdgeManage to manage bookmarks and perform sorting (no waiting!)</p>

<p>Hi Andy , </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply . I exactly know how you feel . But the <strong><em>domain</em></strong> and country can not be changed .If you want to use the same domain , you need to release the trial account first . But it will take up to 180 days before it
 finished . </p>

            You can set up multiple phones under the same Microsoft account.&nbsp; But if you are planning to use one phone for yourself and then let someone else use the other phone (like a spouse or child), you need to be aware that all the contacts &amp; appointments that
 are stored on that Microsoft account will sync to both phones, any files that are stored on the OneDrive account will be synced to both phones, and any connected services, like facebook, twitter, linkedin will also be shared across both phones - different
 users won't be able to set up their own facebook, twitter or linkedin accounts on the separate phones.<br />

            <p>Nokia Mix Radio accounts are based on MS account info now. Don't know how that will work with two phones giving the same info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not have phone backup turned on. If you do both phones will receive all text messages. If you delete a test on one phone it deletes it on the other.&nbsp; Without phone backup your phone settings, app list text messages are not backed up. Not sure how
 this will effect the 'find my phone' feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one deletes a contact, it is deleted on the other phone, add or change a contact it is done to both phones.</p>

            <p>I don't&nbsp;have a Nokia Music subscription,&nbsp;but I do subscribe to Xbox Music. My subscription allows me to&nbsp;use&nbsp;my subscription on a limited number of devices&nbsp;via the same Microsoft login. The subscription&nbsp;counts&nbsp;every phone as a separate device, so I have not&nbsp;connected
 all my Windows Phones up with my music subscription.&nbsp;If I don't renew my subscription, I won't be able to use my subscribed music on any device since my subscription is managed through the Microsoft login that is used on every approved device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine the&nbsp;Nokia Music subscription&nbsp;works in a similar fashion. </p>

    <title>Call forwarding to cell phone never goes to voicemail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> misterstegs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call forwarding to cell phone never goes to voicemail</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a simple scenario I'm trying to implement, yet I can't seem to make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dedicated Skype number. When someone dials that number, I want it to ring Skype on my Windows 10 PC a few times, and if I don't answer, I want it to forward to my cell phone. If I don't answer on my cell phone, I want it to go to voicemail. I don't
 care whether the voicemail greeting is one I have to set specifically for Skype, or the one I already have on my cell phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all works, unless I don't answer on my cell phone. It just rings and rings and rings, never going to voicemail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I don't see anywhere in Skype where you record a voicemail greeting, assuming I had to set one up through Skype for this to work. Also, there are no support options on the Skype site except posting in the community forum, even though I'm a paying
 customer. Overall, very irritating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I figured it out on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mobile was set to play my phone number as the voicemail greeting ("Please leave a message for XXX-XXX-XXXX"). I changed that to have it actually say my recorded name, and that did the trick -- it now picks up on the mobile properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A side annoyance is that you can only choose to forward Skype calls to your mobile after 5 or 10 rings, and there's no in-between setting. If I set it to 5 rings, I only have a window of about 3 seconds to answer on Skype before it forwards. 10 rings gives
 me more time, but when combined with the rings on the mobile end, that's a long window for the caller to wait without giving up.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>A billion Windows upgrades, a billion update failures&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjgt  say:</h3>
<h2>            A billion Windows upgrades, a billion update failures&#63;</h2>
                    Okay, so maybe it won't be a billion upgrade failures after Windows 10 launches -- just 500 million or so. But after the apparent disaster for so many insiders in trying to update to builds 10159 and 10158, the howls from the innocent millions who have
 naively signed up for the July 29 free upgrade can almost be heard already. Things are supposed to be getting better as it approaches release date but it feels more and more like watching a train wreck in slow motion. Fixing 300 bugs in build 10159 is great
 but when the install fails on as big a percentage of insiders as it obviously has based on the comments on this site, can Microsoft pull a rabbit out of their hat and be successful July 29 or will they have to announce an embarrassing delay or suffer an even
 worse disaster by sticking with the launch date when things aren't ready.

            <p>the upgrade problem is as old as windows itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if there is anything not correct in the os that gets upgraded, the upgrade just takes all the flaws over into the new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and there is Always something flawed in a windows&nbsp;OS that has been running substantial time without getting the good old format c: every few months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is a problem that needs to be adressed by microsoft once and for good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the upgrade path needs to be more like a clean install path. omitting <strong>
all the flaws present</strong> and correcting them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>like it is now there is no advantage in&nbsp;having all those flaws transfered just to keep some old software. better to reinstall everything anew.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So did I (and each build before that too); but apparently others are having trouble, and this should be a major concern to Microsoft.&nbsp; If this problem occurs for any significant percentage of users upgrading, the publicity for Microsoft will be bad,
 especially if there are machines that Setup can't revert to previous functioning state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d11b8999-0828-4773-970a-2c0e5a6c5400" title="RJGT">RJGT</a>: I have several machines running Windows 10 TP, and I have never had a problem with the upgrade process itself.&nbsp; I wonder if these people
 experiencing upgrade problems have a failing HDD in their system.&nbsp; Many people are using computers with failing HDDs, and random computer issues can sometimes be traced to something as unexpected as that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who have had an upgrade fail due with an error, I suggest that you check your HDD's health with
 but its installer sometimes tries to trick people into installing other (sometimes bad) stuff, so read carefully each time before clicking [Next].&nbsp; CrystalDiskInfo will rate your HDD's health as
 other S.M.A.R.T. software, I find it to be very accurate.&nbsp; "Caution" means that your HDD is failing (you would have to know how to interpret the diagnostic values to know how serious it really is), and "Bad" means that it has already failed for sure (whether
 it appears to be working or not).</p>

            <p>There are a number of factors at play here:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>People are often updating systems that have been through a number of previews that were clearly not ready for the market - some instability will come from here. Yes, it could be argued that MS should have corrected for early preview errors still on non-clean
 systems, but this is a problem for us and not the "mainstream early adopters" who jump on release 1.0,&nbsp;not the "wait a while and see" people and not the "I will get it when I replace my computer" people.
</li><li>People may be using test environments - older, less needed and often less&nbsp;capable/reliable computers or loading in&nbsp;to a VM. A number of times I have read&nbsp;threads where&nbsp;the solution is install it on an actual machine instead.</li><li>EVERY&nbsp;PC OS upgrade I have experienced (DOS, OS/2, various Linux distros, System and OSX) or know of has had a period where we had to wait&nbsp;for&nbsp;programs, utilities, drivers and alike that needed time AFTER official release to catch up and be corrected, replaced
 or&nbsp;optimised for the new OS. Win7 had less problems than some&nbsp;purely because it was really Vista SP3.</li><li>People only discuss the problems. They may have been quickly fixed as nothing but a pre-release bug. They may have been&nbsp;caused by that&nbsp;person being&nbsp;a tweaker, like the rest of us,&nbsp;but unlucky in this instance. There is no reason to assume all Insiders are
 experiencing the same problems and especially not that all 500m to 1b users will experience these issues in the release products.</li><li>Some of the "haters be haters" are simply not telling the truth and have a long history of complaining for the sake of complaining, jumping on any issue or imagined issue and blowing them all out of proportion.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Having said this - Yes, MS needs to improve the upgrade process to reduce the issues and this will be more and more important if there is to be a change to more rapid and less optional updates.</p>

            <p>I too was one of the many who had problems upgrading from build 10130, to firstly build 10158, then 10159.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three desktop type PC's and a Laptop that I've been using to try Windows 10 Preview and never had any problems when a new update has come along, up until recently that is,&nbsp;so I would agree with the original poster and others, that at this late stage
 to have so many experiencing difficulties upgrading, should be a concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I tried many of the suggested fixes for the recent problems (there were lots of possible solutions on offer) and eventually gave up and grabbed an ISO that someone had uploaded of build 10158 and did a clean install in a virtual machine and that
 worked fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, at first, I was unable to upgrade to build 10159 but with some suggestions from an article at Neowin, I did manage to force one of my machines to upgrade to 10159, but I'm not totally convinced that it was anything I was trying in the way of fixes
 or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem now is that although a lot of people are finally managing to upgrade to the latest build, that there's no definitive answer to why it is there were so many issues this time around for the upgrade... of course I understand that there will
 likely be lots of different reasons for people not being able to upgrade, but given the seemingly large numbers of people who have struggled to upgrade this time around, that pinning down the real cause(s) would be important but even at this stage, I've not
 seen Microsoft even acknowledge an issue with regards the recent upgrades?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't understand why Microsoft wont give ISO's for each build, so that those of us who prefer to do a clean install, rather than go down the upgrade route, have the option. If the main reason is that Microsoft want to ensure that the upgrade route
 is rock solid for each new build, then again I'd suggest that the issues over the last few days should be ringing alarm bells.</p>

            <p>no failing HDD, a failing HDD controler driver most likely. &nbsp; As in a default MS driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>other options are a non customized MS chipsetdriver on motherboards that need a customized one because the manufacturer did some things their own way, deviating from standard.</p>

            Blocking any calls or SMS via phone's settings is not related to carriers... If your phone is unable to block calls or SMS, use TrueCaller app instead.

<h2>            Can you make a duration dependent on when one task starts and another finishes</h2>
                    Hi, I'm using MS Project 2010.&nbsp; I'm trying to schedule a monitoring program to run over the duration of 8 surveys.&nbsp; Therefore I want the monitoring program to start when the first survey starts and finish a month after the 8th survey.&nbsp; When I enter the
 SS predecessor&nbsp;as the first survey it starts on the same day with an estimated duration of 1 day.&nbsp; When I enter the FF predecessor as the 8th survey with a month lag, it moves the start date to a month after the 8th survey and the duration is still estimated
 at 1 day.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to make MS Project calculate the duration based on 2 other tasks?&nbsp; Thanks!

<h2>            Update &#38; System Error 0xc06d007e</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Six days ago I turned off and installed new updates on my windows 10 pc (I have an Office 365 University).</p>
<p>The update took around 4 days.</p>
<p>Once the updates were over, a message along these lines appeared &nbsp;"it is impossible to complete the operation because another programme is busy. I need to choose "pass to" in order to activat the busy programme and solve the issue"&nbsp;</p>
<p>This window kept popping and after one day I was able to visualise my desktop but I couldn't open any program or file. And the computer kept crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At day 6 &nbsp;from the update (today) I can finally use my browser and all the program except Office ones (Word, Excel, etc.)</p>
<p>Whenever I try to star the programme, I am requested &nbsp;to access to my microsoft account, I type my credentials as usual and this message appears:</p>
<p>"sorry we ran into a problem while trying to install the product keys. If this keeps happening you should try reparing your office product. (system error: 0xc06d007e)"</p>
<p>Following this, I have tried to enter my product keys, I tried to start word in safe mode, I tried to start as administration...all these attempts failed.</p>
<p>When I log in to my Microsoft one drive from other pcs everything is fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very very frustrated... I need my pc! I hope you can give me some guidance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<br />
<br />
I thank you all in advance for any help you can provide me, I am looking to perform a mail merge from access to Publisher. I have linked everything together and got everything looking the way that I want it to look however...
<br />
<br />
What I want to do is when I perform the mail merge I would like publisher to save a copy of each individual record from the database as a specific file based on one field of the mail merge.
<br />
<br />
I will try to clarify... <br />
<br />
One of the mail merge fields is ClientAccountNumber I would like the merge to save a copy of the publisher file into c:\mailmerge as a PDF including the year 2014.<br />
<br />
So this file(s)for example would look like <br />
<br />
<br />
C:\mailmerge\123456 - 2014.pdf<br />
C:\mailmerge\123457 - 2014.pdf etc... <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if this is possible and if so how I would go about it? </font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#808080"><font color="#808080"><font color="#808080">I am at a loss!

            <p>Syed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; The syncing issue is resolved.&nbsp; I did some testing last night and I am able to see contacts on all versions of Outlook that I use.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for LinkedIn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The LinkedIn icon does not appear anywhere in my Outlook for web.</p>
<p>I am able to access the LinkedIn settings via Manage - Connect to Social Networks.&nbsp; I had previously tried doing what you indicated above and it does not work.&nbsp; I keep getting a message that says its having trouble connecting my Microsoft account to this
 service.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two LinkedIn folders and a Facebook folder (also cannot remove) under my contacts.&nbsp; Facebook and one of the LinkedIn folder are empty.&nbsp; One LinkedIn folder has one contact.&nbsp; If I right click the folders and click on manage, it prompts me to connect
 to LinkedIn but the displays the message, "Failed to compare two elements in the array".&nbsp;&nbsp; Below is a screenshot.&nbsp; I get the same error with both linkedIn folders and the Facebook folder.

<p>I have exactly same issue only difference is that FB and linkedin contacts are still on my contact list. I want to remove them. I cannot see FB integration anymore ind perhaps i need some tech specialist to help me remove contacts. As for linkedin, i get
 same error "failed to complile two arrays' when i try to right click and manage linkedin contacts. When i go your suggestd path, i cannot see linkedin being connected to my account. it's only gmail (which is ok for me). i have seen on forums suggesting to
 re-add and then remove again, but it did not help. Instead i now have 2 linkedin contacts for every person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please help me to solve it. It generates too much contact in my contact list and i am frustrated.</p>

    <title>My case against &#39;&#39;Lumia&#39;&#39; software branding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tula, the quang  say:</h3>
<h2>            My case against &#39;&#39;Lumia&#39;&#39; software branding</h2>
                    
<p>For a while now Microsoft has replaced the name "Nokia" from their Lumia exclusive mobile applications the last Nokia-branded app to be under Microsoft was the Nokia Conference Beta that was recently rebranded as the Join Conference Beta, in some cases "Nokia"
 got replaced by ''Microsoft'' but unfortunately in most cases they were replaced with ''Lumia'', as much as I can understand this rebranding
<strong>Lumia</strong> should <em>not</em> be a software brand, in fact when someone buys a new phone they'll see ''Microsoft'' written on it, the Microsoft brand carries 40 years of trustworthiness and is universally seen as a beacon of quality, ''Lumia''
 is merely a hardware series, the Nokia Lumia Series/Nokia LSeries, and having Lumia exclusives hurts other people that love Microsoft, and also love other hardware partners. So here are my cases...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against "Lumia" apps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My case is that if Microsoft wants to sell more <em>Microsoft</em> mobile phones their applications suites should have the flexibility of these applications, if Microsoft ever decides to rebrand Lumia phones to ''Surface'' it'll require renaming all of them,
 if Microsoft ever decides to release another brand of phones these ''Lumia'' apps will need to be renamed, anyhow Microsoft must also work on bringing the Microsoft name more into the mobile space, by renaming the appliactions to ''Microsoft'', this will have
 2 positive effects, first of all it would make it easier to bring them to other Windows Phones as Lumia exclusives hurt the overall platform, and 2nd of all it will make the Microsoft brand stronger among consumers/end-users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against the "Microsoft Mobile" publisher:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the problem with the continued existence of Lumia exclusives, if I ever decide to replace my Nokia Lumia 1520 with a Samsung ATIV SE I don't want to miss ½ of my Microsoft applications on
<u><em>a Microsoft phone</em></u> (as it also runs Windows Phone). It's not just the imaging applications that are exclusives, I can understand that it takes Lumia firmware to run some applications which are mostly the ''Lumia'' branded applications, some others
 such as the Microsoft Pocket Magnifyer, Microsoft Modern Mayor, Transfer my Data (which is<em><strong> super-handy</strong>
</em>for first time smartphone-/Windows Phone-owners), the Movie Creator Beta, Microsoft Flashcards, and MANY, MAAAAANY others, these applications can help make Windows Phone stronger, these will also give hardware partners the assurance that the software comes
 first, and Microsoft's own hardware comes 2nd to Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also re-assures non-Lumia Windows Phone-users that they are not 2nd class citizens in Microsoft's app world, so please re-publish all ''Microsoft Mobile'' applications under the ''Microsoft Corporation'' and just keep a handful of exclusives (only the
 ones that can <em>only</em> be used with Lumia firmware) and please merge all Lumia ''Extra'' settings with regular settings for all users, merge the Lumia Car App with Driving mode, and the Lumia Beamer with Windows' built-in settings as well, Microsoft Lumia
 should become ''Windows vanilla'' (as in no added extras, no exclusives, let the hardware sell the software, Micro<strong>soft</strong> is first and foremost a software corporation, it has proven that it will provide for its users, even if they are on Google
 Android and iO.S. and even BlackBerry,) yet other Windows Phone devices don't have essential features Microsoft should be offering, I'm glad that #TileArt is available for all Windows Phones, now please do this with all Microsoft-owned applications.</p>

    <title>Generic webcam not working in Camera app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Generic webcam not working in Camera app</h2>
                    <p>I have this absolutely generic chinese 0.3 MP camera that I use to skype, but it's not being detected by skype or the Camera app.</p>
<p>In skype the camera list is empty, and the camera app shows something like "make sure your camera is connected and not being used by other app"</p>
<p>Privacy settings are OK, everything is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f948d367-1822-4e77-a9c5-3352bd869eb6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can actually use it in other normal windows desktop apps:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb1fc944-0d22-4d41-939e-5b0787516888" /></p>
<p>Both VFW and DirectShow&nbsp;are working&nbsp;OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a clue!, maybe there's some setting or something to configure but I can't figure &nbsp;out.</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>Yes! I tried the desktop version and works OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways I'd like to know about those 'requirements' for cameras to work on store apps. Why can't I use
<strong>any </strong>camera?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of different ways that a manufacturer can write drivers for their cameras. One (based on streams.sys) is pretty old and Microsoft has been discouraging the use of this driver model for a while in favor of the more recent model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem... The older streams.sys model can't be bridged into the new "modern" application&nbsp;model, so "modern" apps can't connect to those cameras. We did our best to not *break* what was already there, which is why desktop apps still work with
 these cameras.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t sign in in Skype - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in in Skype</h2>
                    I am trying to access my Skype account that I had initiated from my tablet from my home pc. It keeps stating that it is unable to sign me in. I logged off my tablet to make sure that because it was signed in with another device, that would not be the issue.
 Before doing so, I had changed my password in case I would have issues regarding that too, I wouldn't have to play the guessing game. Tried to log in on the home computer, it again stated that it was unable to sign in without further explanations. I then tried
 to log in with my tablet and it also state that it was unable to sign me in. Is there a customer support number I can call to help problem solve? I am new to this Skype app/program.

    <title>Recover previous version of a OneNote 2013 notebook synced to OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recover previous version of a OneNote 2013 notebook synced to OneDrive</h2>
                    I tried to move a section from a OneDrive synced notebook to a notebook on my PC. &nbsp;OneNote crashed. &nbsp;Now the section appears in the PC notebook but the pages can't be opened. &nbsp;They say they are not synced and can't be opened "This page isn't available
 yet". &nbsp;The section is gone from the OneDrive synced notebook. &nbsp;Can I recover a previous version of the notebook which is synced to OneDrive? &nbsp;I can't find any file version information.<br />
<br />
Thanks and please help,<br />
<br />
Lee<br />

PS I checked the backups in %appdata% and the most recent copy of that section is missing a large amount of work I did on Friday.

            <p>You would not be able to recover the notebook locally.</p>
<p>Anyways it should not have been deleted from onenote online.</p>
<p>Check this and see if it is still present there:</p>
