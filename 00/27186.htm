    <title>3.00 month unlimited plan for US - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            3.00 month unlimited plan for US</h2>
                    With this plan do I still need to have a carrier like T-Mobil or how would I access service to make my calls? Seems like this would be a way to cut the cord with the major phone contracts but there must be some downside? With this plan would the person
 or business I want to call have to have skype? Thanks in advance

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/47ca8377-e637-47d5-9f72-373872a61085" title="edhiest">
<p>
</p><p>The US subscription Mobiles and landlines Unlimited mins*&nbsp;$2.99 per month is as good as substitute to your mobile calling carrier. Many of Skype users are using or have purchased&nbsp;calling&nbsp;subscriptions to make calls because it is cheap versus their mobile
 carrier rates. Also, aside from Skype&nbsp;lower rates, if you are outside the US (e.g.&nbsp;Europe)&nbsp;and you will call US numbers via Skype, you will only&nbsp;be charged for local calling&nbsp;rates and not international rates regardless of your location.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may still need your local carrier somehow especially when receiving text messages, since Skype is not possible to receive SMS from mobile numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make calls, you just need the Skype app on your device and must have a Microsoft account, if you don't have one, you may create a new Skype account through this FAQ link using any email address:
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12413/how-do-i-create-a-new-account-for-skype?q=create+new+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I create a new account for Skype?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Skype app, just access directly the dial pad and enter the US number you want to call. Select first the country code and proceed with the number. You may refer to the screenshots below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dial pad is on the red circle.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The person you are calling or business doesn't have to have a Skype app on their device, you will be calling their mobile / landline numbers directly through Skype. Please let me know if you still have questions.</p>

            Hey N80 is on the 3rd edition of Symbian OS 9.1.<br />
May be the softwares[=apps, games, themes etc] you downloaded are<br />
either<br />
1. not sisx or<br />
2. not signed sis.<br />
You can create and download themes from <a href="http://www.ownskin.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.ownskin.com</a><br />
you can download/buy various applications from Nokia Software Market.<br />
I dont know if there is still released any application that lets to make use of user defined operator logo.<br />
If you found some let me know.<br />
Coz I am kinda bored of my network's operator logo while I have beautiful wallpapers and themes and screensavers for my N91.

You can go to Nokia Software Market to buy or try diffrent kinds of softwares and applications.<br />
I think there you can find also softwares or stuffs for your media player.

            I don't think that you need software for the media player, I think want you need is media - video clips, music etc. These you can get all over t'internet, the only prob is getting things that are compatible with the Nokia player. There you might need some
 Pc/Mac software in order to convert things.

            Hi Donkeymusic, move your cursor over "am" and press the "7" key to change it to "pm". Press the "2" key to change it back to "am".<br />
<br />
Or you can set your phone to use the 24 hour clock by running the Clock application then selecting Options then Settings then Time Format.

Its been a few months and no one has answered this yet.
<div><br />
<div>We have on our android devices a z7Logs folder with 3-4 zip files per in it. It eats our device storage up and we want to know 2 things:</div>
<div>Why is it there?</div>
<div>Can we delete them?</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>A third, can we turn that feature off.</div>

            They certainly accumulate, but I am not sure what they are for. Use the Dumpster app on the Google Play store to get rid of them

            Im very surprised that no one from ms has responded to so many users asking the same question.
<div><br />
<div>Doesnt microsoft care about its customers any more?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have the same question and an answer would be a nice gesture to say the least.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I trusted my mobile device with a new email and email app. That is outlook (on android).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The thing is that users like to know whats on their phone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unknown folders like "z7logs" with unknown files in them, tend to make a user unhappy if not suspicious.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you not at least give us an explanation if not an update that removes this old-style unnecessary usage of device memory without serious cause?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>And a personal opinion...&nbsp;</div>
<div>the future is looking pretty &nbsp;mobile....</div>
<div>MS has to finally see that. And winning can only come via multi-platform presentation of MS products of high-quality.</div>

            Ha-ha! wow, I as well have been waiting for a response to the original question about the files. Well microsoft representative... I certainty dont have the time to just sit and wait for your earliest convenience when theres 20 other better email browsers
 to choose from. So tbe anser is quite simple. Bye bye files, and bye bye outlook ;)

            Hi.<br />
<br />
I found the same thing, and I notice I could disable that behavior.
<div><br />
<div>Configuration (or settings) --&gt; General ("Basic Account Settings" in the description) --&gt; Technical Assistance information tools (Under "Change PIN") --&gt; Debug Level --&gt; Choose "Disabled" instead of "Warning" and&nbsp;it will delete everything within "z7logs"
 folder and will not create it again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry if the description is not accurate, as I'm translating it from the spanish text, so it might not<br />
match perfectly, but if you search it, you will eventually find it.<br />

<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your solution.<br />
I tried to check the options mentioned from Zephyr but wasnt sure because it didnt mention "technical assistance" in the menu but ok I supposed it was "support tools" but it didnt also say "debug level" in there, but said "Log level" just like you mentioned.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway,</div>
<div>I havent disabled this option yet although I believe you are not mistaking but</div>
<div>Im used to knowing what it is that I disable before I do it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you by any chance know what is this Log Level that we are disabling?</div>
<div>I cant help think that it is there for a reason and disabling might affect something with the performance of the app.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any clues?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanx</div>

            <p>Yes that is definitely true,but it has to come up with a platform as good or better than Symbian.I have never had a phone other than Nokia,Lumia or now Microsoft and I never will.Unlike i-phone ,Nokia(now Lumia or Microsoft) have always been for leaders,not

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But the features that most people "need" are pretty much perfected, even many of the not so "needed" features are wanted by most and those too are perfected. the only way you grow or in this case capture market is to offer new features that you probably
 don't think are "needed". Samsung captured market not by perfecting currently needed features but by adding new features. they set themselves apart from the rest of the Android market and attracted iPhone news</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along those lines...</p>
<p>
</p><p>what features do you think are needed and need to be perfected? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I figure the majority of smartphone users iPhone, Android, Windows heck throw in blackberry.... the main needed features probably in this order are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Text Messaging</p>
<p>Phone Calling</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I know more used than phone calling these next two but we are talking about phones</p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Games</p>
<p>Social media</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current handheld device has been defined and now they're all me too with slight new "features" to attract or to hold customers; but nothing earth shattering</p>
<p>
</p><p>To become #2 would be TOUGH just sticking to what we already have with mobile devices. Microsoft would need to either capture developer attention to get apps which is coming far too slowly and some important apps may never come. If they don't come neither
 will the users. Microsoft could add support for Android directly to a Windows Phone and that would be a start, but then they need to build better devices that people want to hold in their hands and have features above and beyond what we see today. I think
 they could gain considerable market share by doing this but don't see them moving into #2. I believe they could gain a solid 10%+ by doing that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>People are using their PCs and Laptops less and using their phones more to do things.&nbsp; Capturing market and expanding it will come in this area. I believe. they will need the previous items I mentioned but they need to develop new features to "redefine"
 the mobile device. The early Windows Mobile devices and blackberry devices redefined the use of a phone and helped create a new market that Apple and now Samsung capitalized on. Sorry to be Long-winded but... to become #2 or #1 will take years... We're talking&nbsp;~
 5-year plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really needs to be in a general section...</p>

            <p>Multi-tasking is actually one of the areas that Windows Phone exceeds the other two platforms in. In fact I believe based on my own experience with Android and iOS that underneath Windows Phone is without question the superior OS when you look at everything
 the OS is supposed to do, manage and of course STABILITY! And environment... again I think that is one of the STRONG points for Windows 10 Mobile. From the environment on the mobile device to the environment that encompasses tablets, notebooks, PCs. That environment
 is already strong and it is getting stronger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>its when you get up to the upper layer of the mobile experience with the applications where things hit the road blocks. Missing some key applications; and having some of the key applications that do exist on all platforms to be behind on the Windows Phone
 and soon to be Windows 10 Mobile systems. My 4-children, all young adults... I could never convince to jump off Android to Windows 10 Mobile until some of those major applications are available. It doesn't matter if they are a native Windows Phone application
 or an Android application running on the Windows 10 Mobile device. I'm positive that there are a large number of users in the Android or iOS "environment" that are the same way. There are a few of those social applications that have hooked those users. They
 don't stick around because of the quality of the OS they are running on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I said, to get to the top of this heap is going to take another shift in technology like we saw with Windows Mobile, BlackBerry, Palm... someone will set the new paradigm and then someone will capture that market like&nbsp;Apple and Samsung.&nbsp;did.</p>

    <title>RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rocko barker  say:</h3>
<h2>            RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR</h2>
                    
<p>Every year at our work we run what is called a "reverse raffle" whereby the last number drawn is deemed the winner. Every employee is allocated a number of tickets based on the number of years employed with our company. If someone has worked with us for
 2 years they receive 2 tickets, if they've been with us 11 years they receive&nbsp;11 tickets etc. With close to 200 employees this has become quite a laborious process allocating tickets. If we have a list of employee start dates available, I&nbsp;would like to know
 how we can easily generate a list of unique numbers for each employee relative to their years of service.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>So Larry will have three tickets numbered 1 thru 3</p>

I would advice not to use this program.<br />

            <span>This happened because the application was still running in the background. Poor installation steps implemented in the application often results in such cases. The application is perfectly fine but not the
 installtion/uninstallation procedure implemented. One needs to stop that process/application before uninstalling it.
<br />
<br />
Has the application made a shortcut in \windows\startup ? If yes, delete its shortcut, soft reset and then try uninstalling it.
<br />
Also, open the application and see if there is a way to exit it. Generally, it is found in it's menus. If yes, exit it and then do the uninstallation procedure.

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know have you installed any anti-spam apps on your mobile? If so, please temporarily close it and then see if it can help for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, please update the version of your Android OS and then reinstall the Outlook for Android to see if the issue disappears.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, Iâ€™d like to collect some more information for the further investigation:</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When the app crashed, did you receive any error messages? If so, please take a screenshot about it to me.</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What types account you are using in the Outlook for Android? Office 365 account or some other types accounts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know if you have the same problem as the thread owner ( Outlook for Android crash on start up)?&nbsp; If so, first please clean all the cache date from the App on your mobile, and then uninstall the app. After that please restart your
 mobile phone and re-install the Outlook for Android to see if it can make any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another hand, if the issue persists, as one thread focus on one person( problem), to avoid confusion, please post a new thread in this forum on Outlook/Android/Office 365 for Business category. Our dedicated engineers will give you
 more assistance regarding to your problem, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding and patience will be highly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            outlook live spell check missing</h2>
                    Last night my pc updated to IE 10.0.9200.16576 &nbsp; 10.0.5 (KB2829530)
<div><br />
<div>I'm running Win7 Home premium service pack 1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I composed a message in Outlook Live using hotmail account today. &nbsp;It has the auto spell check going but I didn't have time to go through what I was writing and saved it as a draft. &nbsp;When I went back to edit the draft, the only part that was spell
 checking was the newly entered stuff. &nbsp;When I went to use the MANUAL spell check selection it was GONE. &nbsp;I cannot find it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Where is it and how do I get the manual spell check back?</div>
<div>It is very necessary to me because I save drafts many times and do not have time to bother will spell check corrections until I am done with the email and ready to send it!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hate auto-updates and am probably going to turn them off after this issue!</div>

            <p>Internet Explorer 10 comes with Spell Checker build into it and by default when you type something in IE10 it will check for spelling automatically. For this reason when you open Outlook.com in IE10 there is no spell check because IE10 will check for spelling
 errors automatically.</p>
<p>You could test this by write some incorrect&nbsp;words in Outlook email and you will see it will underline and right click on it gives you option to do correction.</p>

You may be able to fool Outlook.com into thinking that the saved draft is in fact new content requiring a spell check. E.g:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're composing in plain text, select <em>Options &gt; Rich text</em>, then <em>
Options &gt; Plain text</em>. The wavy lines may come back.</li><li>If you're composing in plain text or rich text, select <em>Options &gt; Edit in HTML</em>, then
<em>Options &gt; Rich text</em>. The wavy lines may come back.</li></ul>
<p>Experiment a bit to find which sequence works best and most consistently for you.</p>

<br />
<br />Can you be a bit more specific about is meant by "it got hung up" and "never opened my account"?
<br />
<br />Specifically, are you saying that Outlook doesn't start and if so, what error message(s) (if any) are you encountering (in full exactly as displayed).
<br />
<br />In the interests of time, in case it's relevant,
<br />
<br />1) what type (POP, Imap etc) of email account is the original account and 
<br />2) what type of account was configured for the 2nd account and finally
<br />3) who is the email service provider for the 2nd email account

<p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your fast response.&nbsp; Sorry for not being more specific.&nbsp; With 'hung-up' I meant that Outlook freezes during the opening process.&nbsp; There is no error message, other than the MS Office message saying 'Outlook Not Responding'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, this only happens when I choose the first of the two accounts that I can choose from when starting Outlook, while the second one opens just fine.&nbsp; However, the second one should be the newly added account but once Outlook opens (when choosing the
 second option), the original/first account opens (which is based on a pst file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for the type of email account, I'm not sure what it is, so I sent an e-mail to the help desk to inquire about that.&nbsp; I configured the new Outlook account as a POP3 account.&nbsp; And the e-mail provider is a research institute in Taiwan (where I used to
 work).</p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />You have me slightly confused here. Can you confirm that you configured the 2nd email account in a new Outlook profile since you can't select an email account within a given profile.
<br />
<br />Also, when you configured the POP3 account, did you use an existing PST file or did you let Outlook create a new one for the account? If you selected an existing PST file, is it contained on a local hard drive or on a networked shared drive?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;And as for the type of email account, I'm not sure what it is, so I sent an e-mail to the help desk to inquire about that
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />The type of any email account can be easily determined by opening the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app and select the corresponding profile. The list of email accounts (and email protocol (otherwise referred to as "type") used to configure the account) can be found under the &lt;Email&gt; tab.
<br />
<br />Before going into a dissertation about possible options, will leave that for when  it's clearer in regards to # of profiles etc as per above questions

<p>Yes, I configured it in a new profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the old/first profile, I used an existing PST file (accessed from my hard drive).<br />
For the new one, I didn't have a PST file yet, so I didn't choose anything (and I guess Outlook created one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the original email account is web-based, I'm not sure how I can see the type/protocol in the Control Panel 'Mail' app.</p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />So you're not using Outlook desktop for the first email account? Specifically, you're using your web browser? If you're using Outlook desktop for the first email account, then it will be listed but if not, this isn't a case of "configuring a 2nd email account in Outlook" but rather, it's the first and only account as far as Outlook desktop is concerned.
<br />
<br />Regarding the problem you're encountering, to eliminate as many things as possible as quickly as possible, suggest you create a new Outlook profile using the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app and configure the email account again. Once that's done, be sure to set the new Outlook profile just created as the default for when Outlook is opened.

<br />Who is the email service provider for this account? 
<br />
<br />In any case, without knowing anything else about this account, still suggest creating a new Outlook profile. Just to be clear about everything, since you state that this is a POP3 account, you manually configured the account correct? If you just entered the email address/password, it would have defaulted to an IMAP account.

</p><p>Yes, I did the set-up manually.&nbsp; So, I deleted that newly created profile, and was going to create a new profile from scratch, using the auto/default configuration this time.&nbsp; However, now I can't even open the other profile -- the screen freezes once I

            Am starting to get lost a little with this so to summarize things just to make sure we're on the same page
<br />
<br />#1 - You have 2 profiles in Outlook (one for just viewing your PST file) and the other for the account you're trying to configure - that correct?
<br />#2 - Your 2nd profile is the one set as the default and that's the one you're having problems opening Outlook - that correct?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;o, I deleted that newly created profile, and was going to create a new profile from scratch, using the auto/default configuration this time.
<br />
<br />Just so that you're aware, using &lt;auto-discover&gt; will result in Outlook attempting to configure the account using IMAP.
<br />
<br />Lastly, there is a reason for asking who the email service provider is - to continue on with this without some relevant info would be simply guessing as to what all is going on. Any major email service provider would have their email account settings documented on their website. Minor players could have all kinds of limitations.
<br />
<br />As for not being able to open Outlook anymore, make sure that the correct profile has been selected and if that still doesn't work, then you'll need to create a new profile for that which would require creating a profile without using an email account (not entirely clear as to why you have these separated into different profiles)

<p>Thanks for your efforts, Karl, and sorry for not being more clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, your first summary point is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second point was correct, but not anymore, as I'm able to open the new profile and access my mails in that account now, after I deleted and set up the profile again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now the issue is with the profile that I use to view the mails in my PST file.&nbsp; When I open Outlook and choose that profile, it will show the folder list for a second but then freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I see your point about the provider.&nbsp; In my case, it's a research institute in Taiwan (where I used to work), so I can't even read most of their info (as it's in Chinese), although I could search for some info in English, but I guess that it may not
 be critical anymore at this point, as I'm able to access the account now (after I reestablished that profile).</p>

</p><p>As for your last comment, don't I need two profiles if I have two e-mail providers (i.e., the active account and the PST file)?</p>

    <title>Office will not run - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devonredekopp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office will not run</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched high and low for any answers that can help me with this problem and I have come up empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I installed Windows 10 fresh on my desktop computer. I cannot get Office 365 Home to run no matter what I do. The install proceeds fine, but when I try to actually open any of the programs afterwards, nothing happens. And by nothing, I mean I get
 a brief loading cursor image, and then nothing. No error messages, no programs opening and then crashing, nothing. This is all the software installed, be it Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. The exception is OneNote, which is installed on the computer
 separately from the rest of Office (I am assuming that it just comes with Windows 10 now). I cannot uninstall OneNote from the PC Settings menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>-Multiple installs of both 32 bit and 64 bit versions.</p>
<p>-Installing with the standard download tool and with the full disk image available from the Office website.*</p>
<p>-Clean boot and then installing.</p>
<p>-Fixit tool to completely wipe out all traces of Office and then reinstall.</p>
<p>-Changing the registry settings for the default program files location from "D:\Program Files" back to "C:\Program Files" and reinstalling.</p>
<p>-Creating directory junction from "D:\Program Files\Microsoft Office" to "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office" and vice versa, combined with both possible default program files directories as mentioned in the previous point.</p>
<p>-Uninstalling antivirus software and reinstalling Office.</p>
<p>-"SFC /scannow" which reports that bad files were found and repaired, and then reinstalling Office.</p>
<p>-Running setup.exe and/or the Office programs regularly and as an administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**In the case of my using the disk image from Microsoft, I did get an error message when trying to run Office programs. "The application failed to start. Click OK to close the application. Error 0xc0000143"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>System Information:</p>
<p>-Same PC I had running Windows 7 Ultimate a few days ago. 1 of 3 hard drives was completely wiped and reformatted prior to installing Windows 10. The other 2 drives were left as is.</p>
<p>-Windows 10 x64 Education</p>
<p>-Office 365 Home Premium subscription, shared to me by another user. I had this installed on this PC on Windows 7 and it worked perfectly. I deactivated that install from the same page I downloaded the installer from, before the first time I tried to install
 it on the Windows 10 version of this PC. I also have this subscription activated on my Windows 10 x64 Home laptop, which is still working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Somebody please come up with some crazy idea that actually works, cause I am at a complete loss here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Devon</p>

            <p>Hi Devon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate this concern, we suggest that you perform an Online Repair via Control Panel. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on Windows button &gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>From <strong>Control Panel</strong> navigate to <strong>Programs and Features</strong> and right-click on
<strong>Office</strong> <strong>365</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Change </strong>and then select <strong>Online Repair</strong>.</li><li>These steps will repair/reinstall Office 365.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once completed, make sure to restart the computer.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thanks for the stock reply that is the same as every other reply on this site. That did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually solved this with the help of a friend shortly after posting here. For anyone else having this issue, I will detail what the issue was below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have a small SSD for boot, I keep everything except the OS on a second drive. To that end, I modified the program files folders in the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, Software, Microsoft, Windows, Current Version). I did not leave x86 and x64 directories
 separate, but instead set them both to "D:\Program Files"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where my issue arose. If anyone else is taking this step to move the program files directory, take note that there MUST be separate folders for x86 and x64 programs, or you will run into issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started experiencing the same issue with Excel crashing while loading files on my iPad last week. I noticed this morning that there was a new update pending for Excel for the iPad that was posted October 13 (to version 2.6.1). After installing the update
 I have noticed that the problem was resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>

<h2>            OneDrive disappeared from system tray, not syncing</h2>
                    <p>This seems to be a common problem that I can't find a definitive answer to. Over the last few weeks I've lost the OneDrive icon from my system tray a few times - Windows has repaired it (after much jiggery pokery) by redirecting to another location on my
 computer. However it's now gone again and I can't get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions on David Oliviera's thread and got this message:</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you very mcuh, Cliff. I had already tried the first steps you mention from another article on the forum. It didn't work on the first step (task kill) - OneDrive couldn't be found by it - it had disappeared from
<span>C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Local\Microsoft\</span>. I have however got it going again via another thread suggestion here:</p>

</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-onedrive-sync-problems-83ab0d8a-8400-45b0-8dcf-dc8aa8a6bcf8</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I think I've used this one before and it worked for a couple of days then disappeared again. If this happens again I will follow your protocol and send you all the information you ask for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very many thanks for your help and support - fingers crossed I won't be coming back, but on past performance, expect to hear from me in a couple of days! And I apologise for my lack of computer savviness - you must feel like you're dealing with idiots sometimes!</p>
<p>

            1. First try to repair your installation - First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<br />
<br />2. You may have 2 MS Offices installed on your system out of which one may be either unlicensed or not activated
<br />A. Run Easy Fix tool to remove previous version - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>

<br />
<br />3. Try Activation Troubleshooter and other troubleshooting steps
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Unlicensed-Product-and-activation-errors-in-Office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Unlice...</a>

            Sorry, Office Home and Business 2016 does not include Access, only: 
<br />Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/d/office-home-business-2016-for-pc/cfq7ttc0k5ff?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/d/office-...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you need Access now you have a few options:
<br />1. Buy standalone Access:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/access-2016/cfq7ttc0k5dn?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/access-...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Buy Office 2016 Professional
<br />
<br />3. Buy Office 365 Personal 
<br />
<br />4. If this is work related you will have to buy one of the Office 365 business licenses.
<br />
<br />5. If your need is short term you could install a 30 day free trial version of Office 365

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>Rodney</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sites will be locked and have the home page removed while the process wait to confirm that the Group is cleaned up. The site will typically be removed anywhere from 5 min to a few hours.</p>
<p>If 24 hours have passed then the site will be orphaned. Based on the lock state, a 404 would be expected if the Group was deleted and site locked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>That's the reason why deleted site not
</span><span>disappeared</span><span> from SharePoint homepage
</span><span>immediately</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a workaround:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Run Set-SPOSite on your site to set the lockstate to "unlock". (</span><span> set-sposite -identity "</span><span>site
 URL</span><span>" -lockstate "unlock"</span><span>)</span></li><li><span>Run
</span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/remove-spodeletedsite?view=sharepoint-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Remove-SPOsite</span></a><span> to delete the site.
</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For your reference:
</span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161372.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>C</span><span>onnect to SharePoint Online PowerShell</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please have a try and share with me your result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still can see your site in SharePoint homepage, please share with me more info as below:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Detailed steps about how you create this site and how you deleted it.</span></li><li><span>How long since you deleted this site?</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>@</span><span>webbrewers3</span><span> thanks for your reply and you can also have a try.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Users don&#39;t get notice of password expiry</h2>
                    
<p>We have five Office365 users which we only use for email. None of them&nbsp;ever sign into the web portal or web email. They either use their mobile phone to Sync or they use their Desktop Outlook application.</p>
<p>They never get anything to indicate that the password is about to expire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is this supposed to work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi svend,</p>
<p>i would explain that, the password expiry notification in office 365 works as showing a pop-up message after users sign into office 365 portal, instead of sending an emial notification.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6f5be605-a883-4e4e-aeb5-fdd5e63aabfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6f5be605-a883-4e4e-aeb5-fdd5e63aabfb" /></a></p>
<p>the message shows the number of days left before the password expires and gives a link to the change password page.</p>
<p>for the better practice in this situation, you may set passwords to never expire, and encourage your users to often change their password.</p>
<p>regarding this topic, i'd like to invite you directly share the thoughts with our related team at our

            <p>Are you actually using PowerPoint 2016 for Mac? If so, "missing" tools most commonly are
<em>hidden</em> due to the document window being to narrow to display the full content of the Ribbon. Try widening the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in this version of the program there is no "Editing portion" on the Home tab, nor is Find &amp; Replace available on any Ribbon tab. I have a feeling you may be trying to find something that is a part of a
<em>Windows</em> version of the program... There are significant differences. The Ribbon in PowerPoint for Windows does have an Editing group at its right end which Mac PowerPoint does not have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're really that desperate :-) you should access <strong>Find &amp; Replace</strong> from its true home, which is in the
<strong>Edit</strong> menu... for now, at least, the button on the Ribbon simply is a "convenience". Other ways to access Find &amp; Replace include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the built-in keyboard shortcuts: <strong>Command+F</strong> or <strong>
Control+H</strong>, <em>or</em></li><li>Clicking the <strong>Magnifying Glass </strong>tool in the <em><strong>Search in Presentation</strong></em> field</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have a problem first make sure that your software is fully updated. For assistance beyond that please indicate your present version update level for both Office &amp; OS X as well as any other descriptive details you can provide.</p>

<p>All due respect, but what Charles suggested only toggles display of Field Codes in the document when viewed on screen. Even when the codes are toggled on the actual page numbers print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Word&gt; Preferences&gt; Prin</strong>t then clear the check on field Codes. You also can get there from the
<strong>Print</strong> dialog by opening the <strong>Copies &amp; Pages</strong> dropdown, selecting
<strong>Microsoft Word</strong>, then clicking the <strong>Word Options...</strong> button.</p>

<p>
</p><p>At first, the "MATH" button on the "draw" section sometimes disappeared, then i found out, that it reappeared if i DISCONNECTED my internet on the surface, and restarted onenote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>and it would disappear as soon as i connected to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas how to fix this problem?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you are only seeing the <strong>Ink to Math </strong>
feature in OneNote when your Surface Pro 4 is not connected to the internet. To provide you the best steps to resolve the issue, we need to know if there are any changes made to your computer settings or updates installed prior to the issue.</p>

<p>Well, since i've bought the surface, i've updated windows as soon as it offered me to.</p>
<p>

<p>This curious effect results from Onenote's intention to test whether you have a valid Office 365 license.</p>
<p>For using the Math features you need one. Without connection the test is impossible. So Onenote cautiously assumes you have a license. Now you know the trick ðŸ˜‰</p>

            I found that blocking the internet connection using the windows firewall works as well. Just Unblock it, when you want to sync your notebooks.
