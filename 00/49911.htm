    <title>Another Windows Update error code 80072F8F problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Another Windows Update error code 80072F8F problem</h2>
                    <p>I'd greatly welcome and appreciate any help with diagnosing and resolving my problem with Windows Update [Error code 80072F8F appears within a couple of seconds of initiating "Check for updates"].</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started, on my Win7x64 SP1 desktop, within a day or two after installing (without issues) MS's November 2014 monthly collection of 20 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus far, at various times since then I have:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Run the Windows Update "automated troubleshooter" routine, which purported to fix a couple of Registry issues but had no effect on receiving the error message.<br />
2)&nbsp; Resynced my system clock (although it appeared to be correct to begin with).<br />
3)&nbsp; Run the MS Fixits 50123 and 50362 without success.<br />
4)&nbsp; Followed the lengthy instructions to manually reset the Windows Update components.<br />
5)&nbsp; Checked for malware using thorough scans by Norton and Malwarebytes.&nbsp; I remember also doing a Rootkit scan back during my early investigations in December.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to do a clean boot to see whether that would help me diagnose, but have been unsuccessful in my attempts.&nbsp; That is probably an independent issue, but just in case it could be relevant, let me summarize it here.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A possible digression:&nbsp; Problem with trying to do a clean boot</span></em><em>.</em><em><br />
</em><em>When I open msconfig as Administrator, the system hangs when I specify to disable all non-MS services.&nbsp; I can close the configuration program using Task Manager, but then the system is unresponsive when I try to launch new programs.&nbsp; When I specify
 a system "Restart," it hangs indefinitely during "Logging out," and I need to disconnect the power lead manually to reboot.</em><br />
</p>
<hr />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<p>Since WU ceased to work, I've handled MS updates each month by a laborious manual visit to each relevant KB, MS14-xxx, or MS15-xxx website.&nbsp; My "Update history" in WU no longer shows any entries prior to encountering this issue, but just the updates that
 I have made manually since then.<br />
<br />
Here are my answers to some of the questions I've seen posed to others struggling with this problem:<br />
1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?&nbsp; </em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">October 2011.</span><br />
1b. Did Win7 64-bit come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7,
<em>or did you upgrade the computer to Win7?&nbsp; </em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Preinstalled, if I remember correctly.</span><br />
2a. What anti-virus&nbsp;&amp; anti-spyware applications are currently installed?&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
Norton and Malwarebytes (free version).</span><br />
4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)&nbsp;
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I believe a McAfee free trial may have been preinstalled, but if so, I "removed" it many years ago.</span><br />
5. Is KB2976627, KB2976897, KB2918614, KB2978668, KB2937610, and/or KB2943357 listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong>(<em>not</em><strong><em>Update History</em></strong>)?&nbsp;
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">All are there.</span><br />
6. <em>Assuming Java is installed =&gt; </em>Is <strong><em>Java Version 7 Update 65</em></strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp</a><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">V8, U40</span><br />
7. Is Adobe Flash Player <strong>v14.0.0.176</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</span></a><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">V17.0.0.134</span><br />
8a. Is Internet Explorer&nbsp;9 (IE9), IE10 or IE11 installed?&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
IE11</span><br />
8b. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in Internet Explorer's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: XX.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
11.0.17 (KB3032359)</span><br />
8c. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
Both Firefox and Chrome.&nbsp; Firefox has been my default browser for many years.</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; I rarely use IE, and it throws up lots of "This page can't be displayed" screens for many websites these days.</span><br />
9. Have you ever had occasion to do a Repair Install and/or a clean install of Windows since you purchased the computer?&nbsp;
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Not to my memory.</span><br />
10. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; Glary Utilities; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC;
 PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner's
<em>Registry Cleaner </em>component)?&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Yes, I have been "in the habit" of using Auslogics Registry Cleaner, and occasionally CCleaner's Registry Cleaner, without any obvious problems for several years, long before this problem arose.&nbsp;
 I also do so on my Win7x64 laptop, where I haven't had the same problem that has arisen with WU on my desktop computer.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Thorgils,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for providing a detailed information on your issue. I appreciate the step-by-step troubleshooting and the pains you took to resolve your issue. However, there are a few more steps that we
 can try to diagnose the root cause of the issue permanently.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding the <strong>error code 80072f8f </strong>while installing Windows Updates, it means “ERROR_INTERNET_DECODING_FAILED” which caused by the Internet Time could not be synchronized with global Update Server. The valid date and time are on the
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that the Windows Update website uses. In this scenario, the Windows Update scan operation is unable to scan the computer for updates successfully.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click the “Start” button, type “Date and Time” in the Search bar, and then click “Date and Time” in the Programs list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the “Date and Time Settings” dialog box, please perform the following task and see if it helps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Check the time and date on system:</span></li><li><span>In the “Date and Time” dialog box, click “Change date and time”, configure the correct date and time and click OK.</span></li><li><span>Ensure the Time zone setting is correct.</span></li><li><span>Configure Internet Time Setting:</span></li><li><span>Switch to the “Internet Time” tab and then click Change settings. </span>
</li><li><span>Select the check box next to “Synchronize with an Internet time server”, select the time server “time.windows.com”, and then click "Update now".</span></li><li><span>Then Click OK to apply the settings.</span></li></ol>
<p>For more clarification you can refer to the thread mentioned below which deals with the same issue and concern.</p>

</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue persists, I would suggest you to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool.</span></p>
<p><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

</p><p>I did do another manual resync of my system clock.&nbsp; I had problems connecting to the server that my system had been using (time-nw.nist.gov), but I updated instead from the time.nist.gov server, and then rebooted.&nbsp; However, no joy with the WU problem.</p>

            <p>Thanks again for your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen shot of the error message, along with today's event logs (after trying the items listed below), is available at http://1drv.ms/1CBmDB2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>I deleted all the "not found" items identified by Autoruns.</li><li>I've not used MS Flight Simulator for several years, but it appears to open and run fine (albeit with 1990s graphics quality) in Win7.&nbsp; Given that (i) it's not loading in startup, and (ii) it's coexisted for many years with a healthy WU function, I decided
 to leave it as is for now.</li><li>The Dragon Visual C file is a bit of a mystery to me, given that I can't see a 64-bit version of the software in the 64-bit "Program Files" folder (nor any standalone Visual C listing there).&nbsp; Nonetheless, I do see it listed in the Control Panel listing
 of programs.&nbsp; As a first step, in Autoruns I disabled the only mention of a Nuance product (Naturally Speaking service routine, or some such name).&nbsp; Again, this is something that has coexisted peacefully with WU for years.</li><li>Dinosaur that I am, Lotus 1-2-3 is closer to my heart than the other two pieces of software; I still use it a lot as my primary spreadsheet software.&nbsp; My version of SmartSuite is the very last that IBM/Lotus produced for Windows.&nbsp; I'm not seeing the connection
 that you are seeing between pmemnt.sys (authored, it appears, by MS) and SmartSuite, but I take your word for it.&nbsp; Since pmemnt.sys apparently isn't loading, it can't be crucial to my use of 1-2-3, so I've renamed that file for now.</li><li>I also ran Fixit 50688, and rebooted.</li></ul>
<p>Yes, the Win7 Upgrade Advisor download link does appear to be working again today, but yesterday the download button was taking me to a "page no longer available" message on several tries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the proximity of the start of my WU problem and my installation of the November updates, and because I've once before had a negative outcome from a MS update, I'm tempted to try uninstalling each of the ~20 November updates one by one.&nbsp; They no
 longer show in my "Updates history," but I should be able to identify them from the installation history on my Win7x64 laptop.&nbsp; Do you have any advice for how I might prioritize the list?&nbsp; I presume I should try Windows updates ahead of MS Office updates?&nbsp;
 And are there any indications of more problems with some on the list than for others, do you know?&nbsp; Do you see this approach as a relatively good use or a waste of my time?</p>

            <p>Hi John, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened about 2 weeks ago immediately after (in fact, during) the latest large update to Windows 10.&nbsp; That was a big update. It included, for example,&nbsp;extension of Cortana for users here in Australia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the fault is mostly related to the speakers since even without any microphone connected (no external mic and inbuilt one disabled) I get a constant humming/fuzzy sound.&nbsp; When enabled, the inbuilt mic will pickup this fuzz, and any other noise played
 through the speakers and then play that sound though the speakers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, either the in-built mic, or the speakers must be turned off&nbsp;or a constant feedback loop&nbsp;exists.&nbsp; Talking to the device creates a echo that makes it unusable. If&nbsp;I attach
<strong>an external&nbsp;mic,</strong>&nbsp;and place it close enough to pick up the device's speakers, the same situation will result and can create the classic feedback screech.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spoken (at great length) to my local Microsoft Surface support team about this issue and they are unable to resolve. They did give me a case number but I seem to have lost it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have your attention... that update also created a <strong>problem </strong>
<strong>with the rear facing camera.</strong>&nbsp; It is no longer able to focus properly up close.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;can send you an example picture if you like.&nbsp; It was working fine - no discernible difference between the photos it took and those&nbsp;taken with my iPhone.</p>

            <p>John I've done some more digging in the Event log for the Device Manager - RealTek High Definition Audio and it looks like it wasn't installed properly back on Nov 13th when the big Windows 10 update come through.&nbsp; Device needs 'further installation'.&nbsp; Can
 you assist with this somehow? I'd really like to avoid reinstalling Windows 10 since I always loose so much when I do this - especially on Outlook.</p>

<p>hi aravil,</p>
<p>until now, there is still no exact timeline about when pstn calling/conferencing will be generally available. you can closely monitor the
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/international-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">international availability</a>&nbsp;article. once these features are released to a new region, it will be added to there. for your reference:</p>

<h2>            Video Controller &#40;VGA Compadible&#41; &#38; SM Bus Controller error&#58; __&#34;The drivers for this device are not installed. &#40;Code 28&#41;__To reinstall the drivers for this device, click Reinstall Driver.&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Okay, I am about to lose my mind! This problem popped up about a week or two ago and ever since, I haven't been able to play games like Flight Simulator X. I would launch the game and it would give me and error stating simply that the game isn't working
 with my video card and that it will now terminate. Curious, I went into <strong>
Device Manager</strong> and I found that there was no longer a <strong>Display Adapters</strong>section. Instead, there was a section called<strong>Other Devices</strong>.</p>
<p>In that section there were two things called <strong>SM Bus Controller </strong>
and <strong>Video Controller (VGA Compadible)</strong>. They both had a yellow question mark icon next to them. In their properties settings, their Status says this:</p>
<p>"The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</p>
<p>To reinstall the drivers for this device, click Reinstall Driver."</p>
<p>Since I know my video card is embedded and it is an Intel 82945G and that the 3D Accelerater is an Intel 950, I went to Intel's website to find a solution but they only offer an update to my driver. I can't even update with their EXE file because I get a
 missing file error. Some Temporary File for Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>I also downloaded and installer Microsoft's new little Fix It thing but there were no answers in that either. I also used the Recover CD that came with my computer to completely wipe it clean and reinstall the stock drivers. That didn't work either.</p>
<p>In the past, I attempted configuring my computer to dual boot with Windows 98 Second Editon but it ended in failure. Before I attempted it, I had a drive labelled "D: RECOVERY" but after the failed attempt, that driver disappeared and ALL of the 149 GB of
 memory my computer has is now all on one partition, drive C:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>And clicking "Reinstall Driver" DOES NOT work at all. It fails every time, saying that it can't find the installation software for the drivers it needs.</strong></span></p>
<p>It'd be great if there was a solution to this problem because it seems kinda severe.</p>
<p>OS: Windows XP Home Edition Version 2002 Service Pack 3</p>
<p>RAM: 2.00 GB</p>
<p>Hard Drive: 149 GB</p>
<p>Video Card: Intel 82945G Controller 0 (Embedded)</p>
<p>3D Accelerator: Intel 950 GMA</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Celeron 440 @ 2.00 GHz 2.00 GHz</p>
<p>Also, would it be a valid solution just to buy a new video card or is the video card not the problem?</p>

<p>Different computer makers provide different recovery provivions for cases like yours. Some provide a recovery partition on the hard drive. This is used by pressing a certain keyboard key combination as the computer starts up. That places the machine in recovery
 mode. One then just follows the on-screen prompts and ends up with a system that is the same as when it was set up after purchase.</p>
<p>Some provide a backup system on the computer. The purchaser must set the system up as instructed and trhen make a backup disk set. That disk set is then used if the system ever needs recovery.</p>
<p>And, there are other variations.</p>
<p>I see that you did locate and use the recovery disks that came with the machine. It woul be useful if you could provide some details of how you used these and what the result was - in particular, any system messages.</p>
<p>Also, it would help us if we&nbsp;knew the make and model of your computer and year you got it.</p>
<p>You could also check in the documentation that came with the machine for instructions or a help/customer support phone number or web site and check that out.</p>
<p>Do get back to us with any additional questions. There are many here who can help.</p>

    <title>Flight Unlimited 2K16 and Logic3 PC Pro Flight 2 JS282 Joy stick. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john m mills  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flight Unlimited 2K16 and Logic3 PC Pro Flight 2 JS282 Joy stick.</h2>
                    <p>On June 14th (2018), I purchased Flight Unlimited 2K16 working in a Windows 10 environment, via a&nbsp; direct electronic download via Store. First and foremost, I do not feel comfortable about the way this package was downloaded, and installed with neither traces
 of the said file in 'Download', nor sub directory files structure. Furthermore the file does not appear in Control Panel 'Programs &amp; Features'. The only feature that is available to operate the package is 'THE KEYBOARD', when have you ever seen a plane directly
 operated via a keyboard, other than an experimental hanger rig or commissioning of a remote target aircraft? No facility is provided to the user to utilise a Joystick, in my case a&nbsp;Logic3 PC Pro Flight 2 JS282, as a 'joystick.xml' file is missing, and even
 if I build one I have no sub directory to place it in.</p>
<p>The sale of this product is not fit for purpose, and bordering on fraud. I require a response by return or I shall be requiring a 'refund' as the product is not only not usable, but apparently not supported. Respectfully John Mills.</p>

<p>From what I can see, driver support for this flight stick ended with Win7. Looks like they may</p>
<p>be out of business as well. All their products are labelled as Sold Out on the web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver may still work on Win10 though. Have you downloaded and installed the driver from&nbsp; the mfg's site ?</p>
<p>I assume, due to the age of the stick that it uses the old D-Input vs X-Input .</p>
<p>X-Input does not require any drivers on Win10 as Win10 comes with X-Input (XBOX controller) drivers.</p>
<p>D-Input is more versatile as it works with old games as well, but does require drivers to program the buttons</p>
<p>on controllers to suit the games.</p>

<p>Thank you for your prompt reply, it would appear that I am between a rock and a hard place, going no-where. I will attempt to answer your comments in order; my system is Windows 10:</p>
<p>1. I have got a 'USB Games Controller', which I can open via 'joy.cpl' and then 'Properties. A purpose built screen appears and all the functions of the JS282 Joystick are spot on, and working well, and the said screen was shown on one of the JS282 web sites,
 probably for Windows 7.</p>
<p>2. When 'Flight Unlimited 2K16' was purchased and downloaded on the 14th June, installation was automatic, and I have no idea how it is structured within my machine, if at all. It certainly does not appear in 'Programs and Features'. There is neither an
 'ini', nor 'cfg' file for it. All there is, and I have never used it before is a presence in 'My Store'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The simulator is working perfectly, but via a preset use of the keyboard, and there is nothing to advise the user, I.e. A menu under 'Accelerometer? What Joystick can be used from some listing, as one would select a specific printer manually. I assume
 a suitable Joystick would load automatically, if compatible, but it would be nice to know what, so as to get one.</p>
<p>4. Can I set my Dell Windows 10 system to run dual systems? If so, I do have a Windows 7 OS disc, and do you think I could run the system then?</p>
<p>Once again, many thanks for taking the time to respond, and if the dual system approach will still not work, I shall be going back, via PayPal for a refund from Windows Store.</p>
<p>Regards. John Mills.</p>

<p>Thank you for your concern, but as I said in my last response, both items (the joystick and the simulator) are working well independently, but it would appear even if I got a dual OS going&nbsp; (I.e. Windows 10 and Windows 7) to enable both to be loaded in Win
 7, they are incompatible anyway and still would not work. I have therefore decided to put the Joystick in the charity shop and get a refund on the simulator. Very disappointed in the lack of information on the simulator, it really was a waste of time.</p>

I am sorry, but you do not understand. This is NOT a domain issue. I need to know which ports to block on a central firewall (physical device in the network).

            Windows Update agent uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS to obtain updates. When there is a firewall between the Windows Update agent and the Internet, the firewall might need to be configured to allow communication for the HTTP and HTTPS ports
 used for Windows Update.<br />

<p>Dear Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt P2P communication ("delivery optimization") goes on standard 80 a 443 ports, that is very unlikely. I might start Wireshark and capturing packets and trying to figure out myself, but that is both time consuming for me (more than asking Microsoft)
 and does not provide complete answer, because ports might change (and they do often change in P2P connections like torrents).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the link provided there is nothing about Windows 10 and delivery optimization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, could you pass on this ticket to somebody else? I need a network specialist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the Technet Forum link, though. Thanks</p>

    <title>how to run only one application in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to run only one application in windows 10</h2>
                    Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was trying to run an application( non windows app ) in my system such that the user cant access anything but the application I selected.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried to change explorer.exe in shell with the application, also created a .bat file script and used that to replace explorer.exe . but both of them option gave me blank screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any another options? or am I missing anything?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any comment from you will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you all in advance :)<br />

            I tried Kiosk mode , but since I have to use non windows application I ran into problem since im not good with scripting and I belive non windowd application needs some power shell scripting to change to shell.

            Well, you can always just end the explorer task - that shuts the taskbar and Start menu down.&nbsp; Pretty clumsy, though.

<p>
</p><p>On computers that do not have a TPM version 1.2 or later, you can still use BitLocker to encrypt the Windows operating system drive. However, this implementation will require the user to insert a USB startup key to start the computer or resume from hibernation.
 Starting with Windows 8, you can use an operating system volume password to protect the operating system volume on a computer without TPM. Both options do not provide the pre-startup system integrity verification offered by BitLocker with a TPM.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does this issue occurs when you use On screen keyboard?</p>
2. Does the issue occur only while using 2d 3d software?
<div>3. Who is the vendor of software you are using?</div>
<div>4. Is the software comptible with windows 10?</div>

            <p>Same issue here. This is a feature within windows (since at least 7) and so far no solution I've found works for windows 10. Wacom drivers come with an option to "Disable Windows Ink" which prevents this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's hard to convey from a picture just how compromising this is to the Surfaces capability with graphics applications like ZBrush. The view of the stroke feels very obstructed when going downwards.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for update and reply.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Have you tried the troubleshooting steps from the link suggested on<strong> February 5, 2016.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue occurs if you use Onscreen keyboard.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also update the display drivers and check if that helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to <strong>update graphics drivers.</strong><br />
a.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Device Manager.</strong><br />
b. Search for <strong>Display Adapters </strong>and expand it.<br />
c.&nbsp;Right click on the graphics driver and select <strong>Update driver software.</strong><br />
d.<strong>&nbsp;Restart </strong>the System and check.<br />
</p>
<p>

            Driver has been updated to the latest.<br />
Still have the same problem.<br />
This problem is not drivers.<br />
Please provide a valid reason in addition to the program.

            <p>Thanks for your continued assistance, however this is also using the latest driver version. The problem persists with On Screen Keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>a few other things i tried...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>programmatically sending keys to the application process</li><li>killing explorer.exe</li><li>stopping tablet input service</li><li>unticking various settings relating to the pen input
<ul>
<li>show visual effects</li><li>show cursor</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>it appears as though previous versions of windows had an option to 'disable pen feedback' which does not seem to be included in 10.</p>

            <p>Entirely different computers, with different keyboards, including the ms typecover... our problem lies in the OS. I feel the only solution is to find out how to disable the feedback from what Wacom refers to as 'Windows Ink'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wacoms driver option to bypass Windows Ink fixes the problem on all computers when testing with one. This is unfortunately not a solution for us due to using a Microsoft pen input device. (surface pro 4)</p>

<br />
Why do you need Microsoft's help?&nbsp; Is it a Microsoft Surface or other Microsoft hardware?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If it is not - simply figure out the make &amp; model of the system, visit the manufacturer's web page (on another system) and download the Windows 8 supported drivers for the network devices in your machine.&nbsp; Save them to USB drive or CD or DVD or whatever the
 Windows 8 machine can read and install them.&nbsp; You should get things fixed up fairly quickly.

            <p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see this is an old thread so I thought I'd let you know the problems a lot of people are facing at the moment.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Example:&nbsp; I've been to the manufacturers website and they only have a driver detector program that needs to be connected to the internet to scan for your drivers.&nbsp; In fact most websites now have these programs which you then have to register with before
 they will give you the driver's you need.&nbsp; I'm looking for a Conexant PCI Simple Communications driver so that I can update all the drivers on a computer that I had to upgrade from XP to Vista.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Ange</p>

            <p>Yet, here you are - posting on a public forum found exclusively on the Internet? &nbsp;*grin*</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to figure out the make and model of whatever it is you are looking for the device drivers for... Visit the manufacturers web page (make) for said device, locate their drivers &amp; downloads section of their web page, download the drivers and hook something
 into the offline machine to copy it over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is known, humorously, as sneakerNet. &nbsp;You download what you need on some other device (your phone, your iPad, your laptop, your friend's computer, at the library, on your family's computer, etc.) and you find a way of getting it to the offline computer.
 &nbsp;Diskette, Zip drive, cd, DVD, USB stick, SD card, external hard drive, connecting your device to the computer in question via USB cable, etc. &nbsp;yes - you should have more than enough space on even the most anemic smart phones, tablet, etc. to grab a single
 device driver like a network card (yep, you can save things on your smart phone, tablet, etc. - at least the majority of them - and then connect them via cable to a computer to access like an external hard drive.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the way it is. &nbsp;If you want to pay someone else to do it, feel free. &nbsp;They will do the same. &nbsp;Most people who come looking on these self-help volunteer based web forums are just looking for ways to fix things themselves, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logical thinking and step by step problem solving. &nbsp;If you cannot get from A to B by the normal method, what is method two... three... &nbsp;sixteen...? &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next you might say, "Fine, but I am no computer geek, how do I find the make and model?!" - well, the computer itself likely has a make and model stamped on it (makes: Dell, Lenovo, HP, Compaq, ASuS, etc.) and you could then visit the site for the make and
 figure out the model you need to specifically look for and they probably have data sheets that tell you individual component make and models or, at best, have downloads right there for that particular model of their system. &nbsp;Download away, sneaker net, install,
 get connected on that computer, get the rest of the drivers for the system in question in a more direct (on the machine itself) fashion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as indicated by the start of my reply, if - as you say - you don't have another device to get on the Internet... How did you post that response?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Media Center Extenders</h2>
                    Does Microsoft have any plans to develop it's own dedicated Windows Media Center extender (not XBox 360)? Or better yet, a television with WMC built in? It seems like a shame that Apple is already selling Apple TV, when WMC has been around and under-utlilized
 for years.

    <title>Font size of Outlook too small when accessing via remote session - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oraclecb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Font size of Outlook too small when accessing via remote session</h2>
                    <p>When I remote in to my work computer desktop on my Surface 3 (not Pro), specifically to access Outlook, the font is so small, it's almost impossible to work in it.&nbsp; I have tried adjusting the display on my work computer, but to no avail.&nbsp; This problem only
 affects Outlook.&nbsp; My work computer has a 24" monitor, and I see everything on my Surface screen that I see on my work computer monitor, so you can imagine how tiny everything is.&nbsp; I've checked with our IT department, but no one can seem to figure out how I
 can adjust my Surface so it's easier to read.</p>
<p>

            <p>The driver does not exist in any page they only say "it is included in windows" and the hp page instructions are to disconnect and reconnect the printer so that windows is supposed to install the driver automatically but it does not do that. Please give
 a real solution to that problem either hp or windows.</p>

<h2>            Black Screen&#47;Won&#39;t Start AT ALL after turning off due to hours of Windows 8.1 updates hangup</h2>
                    <p>Ran Windows Update yesterday on an HP Pavilion dv6-2066dx, Windows 8.1 (Pro???), confirmed restart and it went right to a black screen w/ no messages. After several hours of the black screen and zero change, I made the mistake of powering off thinking it
 was just hung up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Powered on &amp; got the same black screen w/ no other response than the power/audio/wifi lights being lit (but red/not functioning) and 2 flashing white lights (to the left of the cap locks button and above the number pad/keyboard).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried doing a hard restart per the "special alert" on HP's support page, but absolutely no change. They're next "suggestion" is to connect another monitor, but I don't have one. Since I don't have the monitor option they say it's a hardware problem. I recognize
 it could be a driver/bios update error, but otherwise, it's too coincidental that I'd have a hardware failure at the same time as an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Came to this site and see other people having similar problems, but they've either not powered off and have options to try OR they've powered off/on and have had some response/reaction. I haven't found any other threads with a power off/on &amp; basically ZERO
 reaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the Windows/B/Power buttons suggestion.&nbsp; Tried restarting using a flash drive w/ Windows 8 recovery files and even tried using my Windows 7 recovery cd that came with the laptop, but no change other than hearing the cd drive initially run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I borrowed another laptop for a few hours, but my remote connection settings are turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p><span>Hello Sharv,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand the inconvenience caused to you after installing Windows update. This issue might occurs due to external device conflicts, Windows services are not running or due to driver corruption. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you able to move the mouse cursor on the black screen?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a work around, you may try to restart the computer after disconnecting all the external devices connected except mouse and keyboard. Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, lets try these methods below and check if that helps:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try to <strong>launch Task Manager </strong>by pressing <strong>CTRL + ALT + DEL
</strong>keys sequence.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are able to launch Task Manager, then click on <strong>File menu </strong>
of Task Manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click on <strong>Run New Task</strong> and type <strong>explorer.exe</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you able to boot the computer to the desktop, then check what update pending or failed to install.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply with the KB number of the failed update and error code details.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer the link: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Windows Update: Frequently Asked Questions</span></a></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then try next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not able to boot the computer to the desktop, then refer the suggestion provided by
<strong>Rajesh Govind </strong>replied on March 19, 2013. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/windows-8-wont-boot-after-installing-updates-error/4c5f4089-6cd5-4dc5-8087-66445bce1480"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/windows-8-wont-boot-after-installing-updates-error/4c5f4089-6cd5-4dc5-8087-66445bce1480</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Important Notes:</em></strong><em> </em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>1. After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>2. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></em></p>
<p>

            <p>When hitting the power button to turn on, I get a black screen only. No cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to requesting help, I tried restarting with all devices/battery disconnected. Tried turning on with USB mouse &amp; keyboard attached that I've used in the past. Tried ctrl-alt-delete. Tried hitting the power button 3 times in a row. Tried turning on with
 the USB flash drive that has the Windows 8 system setup &amp; restore files on it. Even tried turning on with the original Windows 7 system cd that came with the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than the lights turning on, as originally mentioned, and the black screen there's absolutely no reaction to powering on. I believe that I tried all your suggestions with no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that a driver or bios&nbsp;update/change during the most recent Windows Update (or updates that ran on Wednesday, 3/11) are the cause since I can't advance past the black screen at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 2.5" SATA &amp; IDE Combo Enclosure with a USB connector and I'm going to try to connect it to another laptop and see if I can re-install Windows 8 using my USB install/restore flash drive and w/ my hard drive&nbsp;in the enclosure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think that may work or have any other ideas since I can do NOTHING from my black screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>I'm sorry if i haven't been very clear about this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Iget a black screen ONLY. No bios, no HP or Windows logo, no cursor, NOTHING. Only a black screen and the lights above and to the side of &nbsp;my keyboard. There is NO cursor and NO reaction to using the keyboard. There is NO reaction to the Windows recovery
 or setup USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is ONLY a black screen. It doesn't advance or react in ANY WAY and it happened on the restart then power on during the Windows 8.1 Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every suggestion made by both you and HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid my only solution might be to buy a new hard drive and start from scratch. &nbsp;That seems such a waste to me since I know the existing hard drive is fine and that something that updated is the source of the problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sounds like getting a second monitor is an option.&nbsp; Then you could have two monitors which is a good thing to have anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>But let's try looking at the specifications of your &nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/hp-pavilion-dv6-2066dx/specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="specs">HP Pavilion dv6-2066dx</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have HDMI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have a television with HDMI?&nbsp; Perhaps you could set up a wired connection
 with it.&nbsp; Then all you would need would be the connector.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even better but probably not in the state it is in now would be seeing if Miracast (aka Wi-Di) could be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that you can't see anything at all, e.g. no Logo especially, makes it look like a hardware problem IMO.&nbsp; That's why a second monitor is the tack that I would try, in case it is just the screen that is the problem.&nbsp; FWIW I had a TouchSmart which
 did this and it was diagnosed as a mainboard problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

    <title>Cannot Switch User Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melys001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Switch User Accounts</h2>
                    I have two user accounts on my Windows Vista Home Premium system. Both were set up as administrators, but one account was changed to "Standard" user. Once this change was made I could no longer switch users or make any other changes to the users. Since
 the current account is only a Standard user it can only perform basic functions so&nbsp;I cannot try to restore the system before the change. If I try to switch users the only prompt I'm given is from the ASP.NET Admin account asking for a password, which I do
 not have. Through Explore I can see the users, but cannot access them as&nbsp;I see the ASP.NET prompt.&nbsp; How can I switch back to my admin account?

    <title>Microsoft 3600 Bluetooth Mobile Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacob foster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft 3600 Bluetooth Mobile Mouse</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Microsoft 3600 Bluetooth mouse. &nbsp;It doesn't pair with my computer. &nbsp;I have Windows 10 and my computer has bluetooth. &nbsp;I have also tried pairing the mouse with a mac and it doesn't work. &nbsp;The mouse shows up in the list of available devices
 but will not pair with either computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried downloading the mouse and keyboard center from Microsoft. &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the bluetooth driver. &nbsp;I have phoned Microsoft support (who were completely useless). &nbsp;This seems like a common issue with this mouse. &nbsp;Just
 hoping there is a fix out there and that I don't have to take it back since the store is a bit out of my way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for putting this in the Surface category. &nbsp;Microsoft doesn't have a problem category for their mouses because I guess they assume they actually work.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey there, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/862fa029-3728-4e32-9f34-6b8b66025f04" title="Jacob Foster">
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft community forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have moved this thread over to the Windows forum, in the Windows 10 sub forum where this question best fits.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also the first time I have come across the Microsoft wireless mouse. So I did have to do a little digging about the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that the Bluetooth it supports is 4.0. Which should be on new devices. However, it also depends on how old your device is. Here is a support article that will talk you though setting up the mouse.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how this works out for you, </p>
<p>Regards</p>
