<p>DarkRaider777,</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is no way to delete a gamer tag. You can pay to have it changed, but deleting the Microsoft Account will not &nbsp;delete the associated gamer tag and will only make that gamer tag inaccessible since there will no longer be a supporting Microsoft account.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am using windows 10 Pro 64 bit. I regularly use the Windows 10 Photos app which I have downloaded from the Windows store. Its working perfectly well except that some photos are not showing up inside the app even though they have been shot by the
 same camera as the others and are stored in the exact same folder as the other images. If its required, they all are in .jpg format.</p>

            <p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model.</li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>In addition to System Imaging, you can backup just your personal files using Backup and Restore, to do that, check out the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/</a><br />

</p>
<p>If you want to backup themes, wallpapers and other minor features, Windows Easy Transfer is another option, you can learn more about it
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade.</li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed.</li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications).</li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing.</li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Type: MSCONFIG.</li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</li><li>Click OK.</li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart.</li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>If you have compatible hardware and your computer still stops responding, disable any unnecessary hardware. Remove universal serial bus (USB) devices; remove or disable network adapters, sound cards, and serial cards; and then restart the installation.</p>
<p>Also try creating a bootable DVD and use that to install Windows 8:</p>
<p>Clicking "Download Pro" installs and runs the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, which lets you know if your PC can upgrade to Windows 8 Pro, provides you with a compatibility report, and then walks you through the steps to purchase, download, and install.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>Run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant
</u></a>to make sure your PC can upgrade to Windows 8 Pro before purchase—you can run it without purchasing. Upgrade Assistant will collect certain information about your potential upgrade experience.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-assistant-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>Learn more about privacy and the Upgrade Assistant.</u></a></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Step 1: Use the Upgrade Assistant to qualify the PC and pay the $40 (US)</p>
<p>Step 2: When the "Install Windows 8" message appears, select "Install by creating media" to create a bootable USB flash drive or an .iso (a disk image) file.
</p>
<p>Step 3: Wait for the Assistant to download the Windows 8 Pro installation package and create the bootable media or .iso file. The flash drive must be have 3GB or more of free space available.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Burn the .iso file, if that's the path you chose, to a blank DVD. </p>

            Thanks, Mark. I already tried that hotfix several times before. At first it seemed like the phantom touches had stopped or improved but they would always come back. It also says that hotfix is for the Surface Pro 4 and Surface book. It was listed incorrectly
 as a hotfix for the Surface Pro 3. Officially it doesn't look like there is one for the Surface Pro 3 which is quite odd. Maybe the phantom touches come back when I've been using it for a while and it becomes hot in the back. In the same area where the phantom
 touches occur, if I was to draw lines with my finger or Surface pen the lines become distorted or there's a blank spot. Microsoft should offer a free exchange for out of warranty devices with this issue because many others are having the exact same problem.
 This is not what I paid a lot of money for. I expect much better from a company like Microsoft. Anyway, I tried that hotfix again and so far I don't notice any phantom touches but I'll see how long it lasts this time.&nbsp;

            Well the phantom touches seemed to have disappeared for a little while but they're back yet again. So very bizarre. I disabled the Windows logo button and when I apply a bit of pressure there the phantom touches stop long enough for me to disable the touch
 screen. Microsoft should recall these defective units. It's not fair that I spent a lot of money only to be stuck with a defective and poorly manufactured tablet that I can't fully use. If I had Bill Gates's email address I would tell him about my ongoing
 negative experience. This isn't right. Regardless of it being out of warranty Microsoft should do something about these defective units at no further cost to the purchaser. It's not my fault they manufactured a defective product.

            My Surface Pro 3 came with Windows 8 Pro. I'm wondering if Windows 10 Pro might have something to do with the constant phantom touches. I think I might try a clean install of Windows 8.1 to see if that makes any difference. After the numerous things I've
 tried, it may be worth a shot.

            Too late. I already installed Windows 8.1 Pro but not the version for Surface Pro. They don't have that available for download anymore so I installed the version for PC. I forgot what a disaster that operating system was. It's weird. When I initially installed
 it before downloading and installing all the updates there were no phantom touches but as soon as I installed all the updates they came back. I don't know if that was a coincidence or what. I think there are major issues with some of the drivers. No one at
 Microsoft can seem to figure this issue out. Maybe it is hardware related but I would think it would happen all the time if that were the case. Dunno. I'm near the end of my tether with this.

            I've already tried that several times but I still have phantom touches and voided areas on a certain part of the touch screen. Calibrating does nothing. Wiping and reinstalling Windows 10 Pro does nothing. This is a common defect for many Surface Pro 3
 and other Surface models. Shocking that Microsoft would manufacture such a defective product. I guess they want to send more sales over to Apple. You never hear of issues like this with any of their touch screen devices.

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After downloading the file, it needs to be installed in the correct library. Here's what you need to do next:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>Windows icon</strong> on your home screen (<strong>Windows key</strong> +
<strong>X</strong>).</li><li>Choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes </strong>if you're prompted for access.</li><li>Type <strong>DISM /Online /Add-Package /PackagePath:"Full path of .cab file"</strong>. (Substitute "Full path of .cab file" with the full path of the .cab file.)</li><li>Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>if you are asked to restart the computer, type <strong>Y</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the steps still do not resolve the problem, it's best you take the device to a Microsoft Store for further assistance. You can find the nearest Microsoft Store through
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            W10 USB devices not working, stuck on login screen after start from zero</h2>
                    <p>I've decided to reboot the system using the start from zero option, because it needed some cleaning. After the process was done i realised mouse and keyboard aren't working, so i'm stuck on the login screen with absolutely nothing to do. Also, i don't have
 a w10 installation disk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting the computer, maybe the usb devices started working, but they still don't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />From here go to startup settings and then go to safe mode.
<br />See if the keyboard and mouse works in safe mode.

            Hi Gabriel,
<br />
<br />Your device is a desktop PC? If that's so, you only need to connect a wired keyboard and mouse PS/2, not usb, to have a system response.
<br />If your device is a laptop, you can try to open bios on startup and verify that the keyboard works.

            I don't have ps/2 peripherals, but i do have a usb to ps/2 adaptor. I thought about this at first but i only get signal for a second, then it cuts out. I'll try the crashing method right now.&nbsp;

Inside of the advanced options again i reinstalled windows hoping that it would fix it (it was also my plan from the beginning). Now i'm stuck on the region select menu, still no keyboard or mouse. But they are powered since the lights turn on when plugged

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Error</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Windows 10 Home Edition after upgrading from a genuine copy of Windows 7 Home Premium and am having issues activating my software. Before anyone says anything, I called my computer manufacturer (Sager Notebooks) and confirmed with them that
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the Windows 7 key I purchased with my laptop was genuine</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've also tried that DID NOT WORK:</p>
<ul>
<li>using a keyfinder, finding my Windows 10 Product key, and tried changing my product key to the key found</li><li>using my old Windows 7 product key to activate the product</li><li>using the following process:</li></ul>
<p>1.Open cmd(command prompt) with administrator rights<br />
2.Type slmgr.vbs –ipk xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx (x should be replaced by your 25 digit product key)<br />
3.Hit enter<br />
4.Type slmgr.vbs –ato (This will change the product key)<br />
5.Hit enter. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>(EDIT: When I use the key from the Microsoft sticker that came with my laptop, I get the message "Error: 0xC004F050 The Software Licensing Service reported that the product key is invalid").</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code: 0xC004C003</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why my code would be blocked; I did everything I was supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been looking into this for two days and have yet to even figure out why this is happening. I know that everything I have is legal and should be entirely genuine (I have receipts and a shipping invoice that proves it), and I'm not about to pay $120 just
 to get the same service I was promised for free. I know this may sound a little pretentious, but I'm very frustrated with this whole process and the lack of response from tech support. Can anyone help me?</p>

            I have had exactly the same problem (except my laptop is a HP) and also tried the same steps with no avail. I did speak to someone from Microsoft who logged in to my system and updated my product key and now I'm getting a new error&nbsp;0xC004F074 and that
 lady admitted she had no idea what was going on and that I should wait a couple of days to see if it gets fixed in the next update. It's still not working :( I will monitor this page for any useful updates.

            <p>You say you updated from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; How did you do that?</p>
<p>If you used the two ways I know of to do that you should have not been prompted for your product key.</p>
<p>The first way to do it would be to wait for the "Get Windows 10" to prompt you to do the update.</p>
<p>The second way is to use this MediaCreation tool and use the "Update This PC" option.<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The first upgrade has to be done while running from the old operating system.</p>
<p>What is happening is that during this update the update software is checking that your license is valid, and then it is also going to register your device with the Microsoft register server (I believe it is done when you first log in using your Microsoft
 Online account on that device).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is what makes your Windows 7/8/8.1 product key valid in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you on the other hand tried to just start by doing a clean install of Windows 10 using the software above and using your old Windows product code I think it will not be valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update from your old operating system to your new one is registered then you can actually then use the above software to do a clean install on that machine and skip entering the product Id and when you get to the point where it asks for your Microsoft
 Online account name/password it will automatically activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did use one of the two processes I mentioned to update then the other possibility is Microsoft's register servers.&nbsp; On July 29th and maybe for few days they were having problems with it where for some people it wouldn't register/activate, and that
 is where the advice to wait a few days came in, as in they would fix the problems with their servers, and it would automatically activate.&nbsp; I don't see people complaining about that now so I got the impression that it has been fixed, but I certainly have no
 real insight into that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this might be that thread it looks like from that thread it worked for these people by July 30th.</p>

            <p>Transcription of my tech support chat today:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">11:33 am</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have a HP Compaq Presario CQ60 laptop which was upgraded years ago from Vista to Windows 7. I got the notifications about the
 free windows 10 upgrade and a few days ago I used the media creation tool to run an upgrade from a USB stick which seemed to go fine. Unfortunately I have been unable to activate the new version of windows, I think the error I received at the time was 0xc004f034.
 I came on to tech support and spoke with another lady who logged in to my computer and I think she updated my product key. Since then I have been receiving the error 0xC004F074 when I try to activate. She said to leave it a day or so and it should all sort
 itself out but three days later I still cannot activate. Any ideas how I can get windows activated?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">11:34 am</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">okay I'm sorry for the inconvenience but as of this moment, we are still working on the resolution for windows10 activation and
 we are advising customers to wait for the activation notification . we can't say how long it will takes but we are now working on that</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">11:36 am</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">That is ok, as long as a fix is on the way!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">11:37 am</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">we are asking for your patience and understanding with this matter. Thank you so much</span></p>

You will need the 7.0 key. Download Belarc Advisor and run it on 10. Your 7.0 key will show up under Software licenses-- MS Internet Explorer

            <p>So after my last post I got another Microsoft tech who said I should just go back to Windows 7 and try to upgrade again. Ok, a pain, but fine.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember how your last tech changed my product key? </li><li>Yes, this was a to a 'trial' key.</li><li>Well, where do I find my old Windows 7 key?</li><li>It is on the original DVD.</li><li>Long lost, I have moved country twice and house about a million times.</li><li>Oh well, bad luck buddy.</li><li>So even though your last tech saw me on a validated Windows 7 and changed out my product key without consulting me or checking that I had my existing key recorded somewhere you're not prepared to either give me a Windows 10 (or 7 for the sake of argument)
 key?</li><li>No. Find your product key.</li></ul>
<p>I was SO mad. It was terrible customer service. I have the whole conversation recorded and will flick it on to Microsoft for comment when I am less busy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently job hunting and need a fully-functional PC and no further stress about this so I bought an OEM Windows 7 key from MMOGA for about $25 (arrived in about 2 minutes!) and did a clean install with that, activated by phone, before going through
 the upgrade again finally with no problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still super mad, but what can I say? I need something to run Office on so I can find a job.</p>

            Thank you for the recommendation. All of your information was good. I was able to find the original Product Key but when I went to roll back to Windows 8.1 I discovered that I can't because all of the files were deleted somehow. This is very frustrating.
 I really don't know what to do now. I have had two conversations with Microsoft with no resolution. 30 days is quickly approaching. I am going to be very upset if they tell me I have to buy Windows 10.

    <title>Was told by MS Answer Tech that I had an error code for Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xajamykil55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Was told by MS Answer Tech that I had an error code for Win 10 activation.</h2>
                    <p>i contacted MS Answer Desk because Windows Update was not installing updates. &nbsp;in the course of fixing this problem i was told there was an error notification regarding Windows Activation. &nbsp;apparently my version of windows 10, that i got from the mass update
 download in August, is not registered.</p>
<p>I was given a link, this page, to use to restart in safe mode and fix the error. &nbsp;after reading this page i am wondering if the fix the vista will work to fix windows 10 activation problem. &nbsp;i see only one mention of windows 10 on this page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have an Acer Laptop with Intel Celeron CPU N2840 @ 2.16 gHz, 400 G RAM, 64 bit OS. &nbsp;No CD/DVD drive, no pen or touch display. &nbsp;I am running Windows 10 Product ID # 00326-10000-00000-AA532.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I have a Product ID # if this version of windows is not activated? &nbsp;This is my only link to the outside world for now. &nbsp;I cannot be fiddling with my system with the possibility of it crashing. &nbsp;I have Win 8.1 on a flash drive from Acer. &nbsp;Would it
 be better if I backup my HD on a memory stick and then insert the flash drive and go back to Win 8.1? &nbsp;i never had a problem with win 8.1 and i like the log on better than win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly welcomed.</p>

    <title>XP Boots in Safe Mode but not Normal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beckerbill  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP Boots in Safe Mode but not Normal</h2>
                    I have searched many previous posts and cannot find a solution that works.<br />
I can start my computer in safe mode but it will not boot in normal mode.<br />
I was running CA Anti Virus and got a message that a file (Unfortunately, I didn't write it down) may be corrupt.&nbsp; I restarted in Safe Mode with networking, updated definitions on Malwarebytes and SuperAntiSpyWare and ran scans which failed to turn up any problems.&nbsp;
 When I tried to re-start in Normal mode, the computer went into an endless loop that got to the windows start-up screen, then went black, flashed the bios set up screen and starts all over.&nbsp; I've tried restarting with last configuration and have tried several
 previous restore dates and have not been able to fix the problem.&nbsp; I have also tried to re-start in a "clean boot" state and can still only re-start in Safe Mode.&nbsp; When I selected the option that allows me to see the BSOD with the error message I get:<br />
stop: c000021a {fatal system error}<br />
The windows logon process system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc0000022 (0x00000000 0x00000000).<br />
The system has been shut down<br />
I have been able to find many similar c000021a discussions but NOT with the 0xc0000022 secondary.<br />
I had both of my computers go down with the same problem this morning.<br />

            Have I tried to uninstall the antivirus???<br />
<br />
Silly me!!!&nbsp; No I didn't and that FIXED the problem!&nbsp; For some reason I thought the "Clean Boot" would disable the CA software and any problems it may have been causing.&nbsp; Uninstalling the CA Software fixed the problem.&nbsp; Now to find a new Anti-virus software.&nbsp;
 AVAST 2014 Free maybe???<br />
Thank you SO much for this suggestion - have been working non-stop for seven hours trying to fix!<br />

            <div>Its all good bro</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have had problems like this when i was newish to computhas</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>basically i had 2 antiviruses installed, thought it would have improved safty but all it did was freeze the comptuer, i guess 1 was scanning a file and the other was scanning that antivirus scanning the file which made it scan the antivirus that was scanning
 it which made that scan that one balh blah , made them go round and round in circles, lol</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>but yea umm try the Microsoft antivirus</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Its called Microsoft Security Essentials (In your windows update software section)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It should show up in your windows update,&nbsp; if u have not done windows update i strongly reccomend it, but make sure u have your system restore turned on</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I like it as oviousally its made by microsoft, and u are using microsoft windows,, so it makes sence to use their own antivirus,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>and it is free</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>hay vote my comment helpfull so when others have the same problem they can find the answer easy,, thanks bro</div>

<h2>            HP printer &#34;fatal installation error&#34; was noted during the &#34;configuring the product&#34; phase of the installation</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: window 7 upgrade, HP printer installation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a HP desktop and a HP all-in-one printer J4550 connected by USB, both worked fine under the VISTA OS for about year and a half.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I finally get around to upgrade to Window 7 couple weeks ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Everything worked according to the upgrade package provided by HP, except the reinstallation of the printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I followed instructions to download a full version of the Windows 7 driver/software for the J4500 series printer, but a "fatal installation error" was noted during the "configuring the product" phase of the installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried the diagnostics procedures provided by HP as well as contacted HP tech support , but
<span>&nbsp;</span>no success of solving the problem.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>Here is description of the problem other pertinent info:</p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>After the installation failure, I was not able to get into the HP solution center, but I was able to print certain data, mainly jpg files as well as some pdf files, but definitely I was not able to print from
 Microsoft Office or directly print from a web page.<span>&nbsp; </span>Print jobs would show up at the print queue status, but just disappears
<span>&nbsp;</span>without printing <span>&nbsp;</span>anything.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>without printing <span>&nbsp;</span>anything.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>After playing with the problem awhile, I am able to find a work around to print any job.<span>&nbsp;
</span>mainly I have to first print to the Microsoft XPS Document Writer, and then print the saved XPS file to the J4500 printer, using this two step procedure I was able to print everything.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted that the printer icon on the "Devices and Printer"<span>&nbsp;
</span>page is labeled as "HP Officejet J4500 series (XPS)".<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Checking the Device Manager I ntice that teh following software/drivers are installed:</p>
<p>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HP Officejet J4500 (DOT4PRINT), by HP, location IEEE 1284.4 compatible printer</p>

<p>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>USB Printing support, by MS, location USB1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that on the Devices AND Printers page only show the printer icon labeled as
<span>&nbsp;</span>"HP Officejet J4500 series (XPS)".<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>"HP Officejet J4500 series (XPS)".<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sure looks a very specific problem that is fixable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please help.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the exact error code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>Uninstall the HP printer software from programs and features.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>Download and install the latest drivers for your printer from HP website.
</p>
<p><b><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lang=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=3645097&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lang=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=3645097&amp;</a></b></p>

<h2>            windows 8.1 randomly logs out</h2>
                    <p>I could be sitting there all day/anytime of the day and then suddenly I will get the pop up bubble from action centre saying I am logged out of my microsoft account and to log back in. it happens about twice a day&nbsp;and now i'm&nbsp;getting fed up of logging in
 seeing as I log in when I turn my pc on too.</p>
<p>any ideas why this is happening?</p>
<p>I have a alienware x51 i5 windows 7. I had the upgrade disc for windows 8 but did a full custom install about a week ago but this started happening about 3 days ago.</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>Sure it will not get printed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not had an xbox for 2 years or there abouts, after major operation two years ago, loss of right arm then parkinsons to boot playing games was the last thing i thought about.&nbsp; Just started to get using a pc again and my good lady says to me what is this £4.99
 we are being charged everry month for the last few years.&nbsp; Well it turns out to be my xbox gold account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike any other company it turnsd out good old microsoft are able to continue charging you even when you card number changes.&nbsp; Do not care if you have not logged in for over two years quoting some guff in the contract so accept when setting up the account,
 which nobody reads and they rely on that fact.&nbsp; Turns out if I died which I nearly did they would have carried on charging my wife until she died or we no longer had an account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now they have stopped taking the money but will not refund what they in effect legaly stole from us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be warned these perople are bullys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wonder is this will get posted but no worry plenty of othert sites.</p>

<p>As a banker, I see this sort of thing all of the time. The largest issue here is that regardless of your situation, you should have been checking bank statements on a monthly basis. We are blamed regularly for our customers inability to balance checkbooks
 or keep track of charges. However, most processes, including fraudulent charges, have to be filed within 60 calendar days in order to attempt a return or refund of those charges. It's not Microsoft's fault that you neglected your finances, or neglected to
 appoint someone as a power of attorney to handle your affairs during your surgery and recovery. Your story may pull some strings that may get you your money back, or you can attempt your own bullying by contacting media outlets and see if someone will back
 your story (MS may cave to the bad publicity and refund your charges), but it ultimately is your fault. A few years without checking statements is extremely irresponsible and dangerous.</p>
<p>Also, Microsoft has no way of obtaining the correct information to bill you unless it is provided. There is no database available that just provides them with your credit card number.

 and logical, &nbsp;in my opinion its wrong, Scan please contact me, I am filing a class action FCC complaint, and if afterwards i am not satisfied with the outcome, i wish to file a class action lawsuit, I am a disabled vet, I will find a good laywer, pls contact

<p>nope good luck with that</p>
<p>all cancelations are recorded on your service request number (notes on the case)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you MUST complete the call for an account to be canceled also PENDING balances are not refunded and can prevent cancelations&nbsp;and the call MUST be made before the renewal period not after</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as stated before the only sure way to cancel an account with 90% of services is call support for your service</p>
<p>doing it via a 3rd party site like ebay for paypal does not cancel it due to the terms of use of xbox live</p>

<p>No disrespect intended, but you have no clue of what you speak of, you can cancel your recurring gold subscription via the xbox live website, you do not have to call, this is not a 3rd party website, its their website, when your done cancelling, your account
 now reads that it has no recurring billing attached, and when the gold subscription will run out.</p>
<p>However they still charge, and let me be more detailed, I had a recurring subscription that went from the 4th of the month to the next 4th of the month, when these guys ripped me off, I canceled my gold account (On the 15th of the month) on the 16th one
 day after i canceled, they charged me again, when i called customer support to find out whats up, they told me " Oh your bank made a mistake this was the charge that was supposed to go through on the 4th, but they held it back until the 16th", So I call my
 bank, ask then to research this, they gave me paperwork proving that on the 4th i paid the Gold Subscription, and then on the 16th they tried to charge me again, I have all the documentation i need to prove that xbox steals from their customers, so to be a
 fan boy on this subject is just defending a group of people whos only desire is to take and keep your money by whatever means they can, you wish me good luck with that ? heh dude, you have no clue, I do not need luck I have more than enough proof to prove
 my case, however monetarily its very low with just my complaint, hence the desire to add more disgruntled &nbsp;customers to my case, so that a lawsuit will be lucrative.</p>

<p>I know it is deemed to be my fault, and I even accept by the letter of there contract which 99.9%of people do not read it is my fault. &nbsp;My other half runs our account and was not aware what the payment was for and she assumed it was okay. &nbsp;It was sheer luck
 she asked me. &nbsp;The reason's I am truly upset about are,</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Microsoft must know the account has not been logged in to for over 2 years. &nbsp;Why no contact from them to see why?</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;My card expired and a new one was issued, this caused a lot of &nbsp;pain with direct debits which I had to resolve but not with this account it magicaly transfered to the new card number. &nbsp;I dont doubt there is some text in the initial sign up that covers
 this.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;If I had died they would be stealing from my wife now who is not computer savy.</p>
<p>All I am asking is be fair, why no notification from them to say why are you not using accout? &nbsp;easy to set up to be automated. &nbsp;I feel they are taking advantage of ignorance, they are trading unfairly and again if I died why should my partner continue to
 be screwed. &nbsp;The helpdesk said " Yes my wife would continue to be charged even though she has no conecction or ability to resolve this.</p>
<p>Surely they have a duty of care/consideration to the Customer, surely it would be simple enough for them to set there charging system to flag idle accounts?</p>
<p>Dcosper I am UK based so not sure if I can help you but willing if I can.</p>

    <title>Windows not recognizing DVD-R Content - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows not recognizing DVD-R Content</h2>
                    <p>I have several DVDs of old home movies that I was hoping to transfer onto my computer. Whenever I try to run them windows doesn't seem to recognize any content. When I have hidden files viewable I see a config file desktop ini under "Files Ready to be Written
 to the Disk" but I don't see any other content nor does the computer prompt me to run the disk through my dvd program. I've tried two different windows 10 laptops (both upgraded from previous versions) as well as an external drive and the built in drive. I
 know in the past when I had Windows 7 or 8 (can't remember which) I was able to run them just fine on the computer. The disks work on my dvd player just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a dvd movie disk as well as another burned DVD-R (from a different unrelated source) and they both worked fine. What could be causing this and is there a way to fix it? Thanks!</p>

 of winning in fighting games especially in street fighter and mortal kombat. BUT have you considered that spamming could also come in advantage for you and in the end maybe,who knows you may even win the whole match!!!! My point is that since you know your
 opponent's moves,why not respond and STOP ACTING LIKE A CHILD by facing the fact that if someone wants to be good in this game NOTHING will stop him unless YOU start fighting back. ^_^</span></p>

<p>It does seem that the fighting game community is the most vocal when they find someone spamming moves. Speaking as someone who doesn't really play fighting games, if someone is constantly spamming a move, wouldn't that mean they are exposing themselves to
 a form of attack via defending and then striking? If not you can really see my fighting game knowledge shining through.</p>

<p>Well, since I already posted I might as well respond to the topic of this thread. Playing against someone in a fighting game who wins matches by spamming "light punch" the whole time, is boring. I don't care about winning or losing. What I want is a good
 fight. I want to smack someone down with my most powerful technique. I want to survive your most powerful technique. But if your most powerful technique is "light punch" that's pretty frickin lame. Because instead of enjoying the game the way it was intended,
 you act like winning means something and that ruins the fun for everyone else.</p>

<p>I hate "spamming" in fighting games. </p>
<p>I personally refuse to use such tactics. Yes, my win ratio would probably increase using spam tactics, but I guess I am a little old fashioned and still prefer sportsmanship and tact over shameless repetition.
</p>
<p>If other gamers hold winning in virtual contests in such high regards as to dismiss sportsmanship, that is on them. Spamming in games, in my opinion, is the equivalent of throwing dirt in the eyes and kicking the groin.

<p>Well, since I already posted I might as well respond to the topic of this thread. Playing against someone in a fighting game who wins matches by spamming "light punch" the whole time, is boring. I don't care about winning or losing. What I want is a good
 fight. I want to smack someone down with my most powerful technique. I want to survive your most powerful technique. But if your most powerful technique is "light punch" that's pretty frickin lame.
<i><b>Because instead of enjoying the game the way it was intended, you act like winning means something and that ruins the fun for everyone else.</b></i></p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Sorry but this is the "scrub" mantra in Fighting Games. If all someone has to do is use a "Light Punch" (or whatever Move) over and over against you and still will, you are the one that needs to "get better". I have played SFII
 since the Arcades and I would tell "scrubs" in advance (in part to make them upset and in part to humiliate them), "I'm only going to use a Roundhouse Kick against you and still win".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">There is no "intended way" to play other then simply beating your Opponent. Sorry but I don't need a "Holy-Grail" of Gaming Guidelines to play how I want. A solid built Fighting Game has Counters, if that Players lacks the experience
 or is just too stupid tp use them properly, that's their fault, not mine.<br />
</span></p>
<p>[quote user="Johnny Sinister"]</p>
<p>I hate "spamming" in fighting games. </p>
<p>I personally refuse to use such tactics. Yes, my win ratio would probably increase using spam tactics, but I guess I am a little old fashioned and still prefer sportsmanship and tact over shameless repetition.
</p>
<p>If other gamers hold winning in virtual contests in such high regards as to dismiss sportsmanship, that is on them. Spamming in games, in my opinion, is the equivalent of throwing dirt in the eyes and kicking the groin.
</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">The same here, I'm really "old fashion" when it comes to Video Games and there is nothing wrong with Spamming the same Move against someone over and over (if it works against them).
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Again referring back to SFII in the Arcades, there was always two class of Players. Those that refused to win employing all of the Tactics in the Game and then called everyone else who did "cheap" and those who would learn all
 the "cheap" Moves and how to Counter them putting someone who used them against themselves in an advantaged position and wining the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">There is no "honor" in a fight or even closer a Fighting Game. It's win or not. "Sportsmanship" is for Sports, not fighting, they are two different things all together. Someone can either be a Scrub or decide to play and win.<br />

            before turning on your xbox one, hold down the sync, eject and power button.<br />
<br />
You will hear the standard power on beep, but keep holding the buttons untill you hear a second beep.<br />
<br />
Now release the buttons and watch your xbox getting started in the lowest resolution possible.<br />
<br />
From here you can go to the settings to change them back to correct values.
