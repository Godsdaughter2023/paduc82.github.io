    <title>Windows 7 C&#58; Drive Space Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 C&#58; Drive Space Error</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 7 C drive is uselessly eating up space. I've checked all the hidden folders, used the disk cleanup, deleted restore files from the cleanup 'more options' tab too. But still I'm facing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of 19.5 GB it shows only 1.53 of free disk space. Only 1.6 GB is used by the program files folder. But the 'Windows' folder is using 15 GB of space uselessly when the OS is only of 5 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to see what is using my disk space? And how should I delete all these useless files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've scanned my computer with avg and no infections were detected. Can anyone help?</p>

            <p>19.5 GB is nothing like sufficient&nbsp;for a practical installation of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's spec requires 20GB (64bit) or 16GB (32bit) but these are a minimum for Windows itself and makes no allowance for additional programs or data files (because that is an unmeasurable value). Windows is not 5GB, a base install with no drivers, updates,
 service packs or programs finishes at 10GB but that does not include any temporary files used during the setup process itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Disk Cleanup utility to find what files can be removed, a more aggressive scan is done if you use the Clean System files option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Treesize free gives a graphical display of disk usage.</p>

            <p>I don't know much about the tech stuff of OS's. If you mean the total storage then it's about 75 GB. And about partition, I have 4 drives C, D, E and F.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C: 19.5 GB</p>
<p>D: 19.5 GB</p>
<p>E: 19.5 GB</p>
<p>F: 15.9 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this what is called partition?</p>

            <p>From your description of your level of techiness, I suggest you are going to need some hands-on technical assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whomever set up your computer should not have created those partitions.&nbsp; You should have only one logical partition and that should use the entire drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to get technical assistance, you may be forced to re-install Windows.&nbsp; If that happens, consider replacing the drive with one that is much bigger.&nbsp; Replacement drives are not very expensive.</p>

            <p>Actually I'm trying to download Windows 10 but the low disk space in the C drive is causing error. As Windows 10 is reserved to my desktop I don't think it will be wise to reinstall windows 7 now. I may lose my reservation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that I can transfer free space from other drives to the C drive. My D drive is empty. I just formatted it. Can I move the free space from D to C. If yes, then how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you help me with another issue? Everytime I turn on my PC the Boot menu pops up where I've to enter the date and time everytime. There are these options F11, F2, etc. I think there problem is with the startup config.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click the F2 setup tab then provide the time and date everyday and everytime. My Windows 7 aero theme doesn't load up and I've to manually set it and other options like captions button size and all. What is causing the error.</p>

            <p>The reservation is to a certain extent irrelevant, you can upgrade without the Get Windows 10 App so that in itself is not a reason to avoid a&nbsp;reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would agree with Canadian Tech's logic, even if you removed the other partitions altogether and made one partition 80GB would be on the small side, if nothing else a new drive is going to have a longer life, quieter and possibly faster. If the budget would
 stretch to it an SSD definitely would be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of tools to allow you to clone the installation from your old disk to a new one but a new clean O/S as a starting point on a new disk would be the best of all worlds. Easy to say when you know how but that would be my strongest recommendation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are determined to stay with the current drive then you need to check the drive layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open disk manager and in the lower pane you can see how the partitions are configured. There may be a small (100MB) unlettered partition as the 1st one, if so leave that alone. Then hopefully the four main partitions are in order as you listed. Back up any
 files you need to keep ideally from all three D, E, and F but at least the1st one to the right of C in the disk manager view. Then right click and delete the volume(s). Once there is free space to the right of C the right click Context Menu should have the
 option to extend the drive to use the free space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Messing around with partitions has some risk so if you are not sure get somebody who does know to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The date being lost indicates the CMOS battery on the motherboard is flat. Most common is a CR2032 and requires the case to be opened to be replaced, look for a 20mm silver penny cell in a holder, they are normally clipped in and are good for about 5 years.
 It does therefore bring up the question of the value of a relatively old&nbsp;computer.</p>

            <p>First off, I never allow client computers to have more than on main partition C:.&nbsp; The strategy of having two partitions c and d is an old one designed for the day when operating systems could not see a very big logical drive.&nbsp; Continuing that strategy leads
 to many problems and no real benefits.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, when and if you replace that very old 80 gigabyte hard drive with a larger one -- probably 500, set up only C:.&nbsp; If you do buy a new hard drive, make certain it is a 7200rpm one, and definitely buy and OEM product because it will cost less and it actually
 the same drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am presuming this is an elderly desktop computer.&nbsp; If you will tell us exactly what make, model, and age, I can probably give you more advice.&nbsp; I have re-furbished and upgraded many an older computer.</p>

    <title>After upgrading from windows 7 to windows 10, Computer keeps crashing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After upgrading from windows 7 to windows 10, Computer keeps crashing on startup&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading from windows 7 to windows 10, everything seemed OK and working until the second or third start up.</p>
<p>Now it stops loading anywhere from the first screen with spinning dots up to the login screen. When I turn it off and restart I get a screen that says :-</p>
<p>"Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info and then we'll restart for you. (0% complete)".</p>
<p>It also says "If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: &nbsp;MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION". &nbsp;Computer then freezes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop was working fine before upgrade! Have tried most options but can't get any further. Is there a copy of Windows 10 for download that I can reinstall with? Or where on the hard drive can I access the downloaded upgrade? As I can get full access to my
 Hard Disk when it's removed and hooked up to another computer.</p>
<p>I haven't tried the reinstall options on the recovery screen as No: 1 I don't want to loose everything or No: 2 I don't want to loose my programs.</p>

            <p>Hi Sahil Bali,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You suggested that I should check out the system requirements before installing. It appears that you did not read my question properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already done the upgrade and since the upgrade my laptop keeps freezing/crashing before it boots up (anywhere from the first screen through to the login screen) so I can no longer access it. The laptop in question is a 64-bit one</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did all the checks before upgrading including the Get Windows 10 upgrade tool, which told me that everything was OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try reinstalling with the download version (When I get the media setup and ready) that you kindly gave me the link to. The machine that I will try to get this on is a 32-bit one, hopefully I can do it for the previously mentioned laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Chris_K918,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sorted out everything by reverting to Windows 7,</p>
<p>Downloading a copy of Windows 10 via the link posted by sahil Bali,</p>
<p>You have a choice of the 32 Bit 64 Bit or a combined both 32 &amp; 64 Bit, the first 2 should fit on a regular 4.7Gb DVD the combined one needs a DL DVD which holds up to 8.5Gb as it is 5.8Gb,</p>
<p>Made sure I had every possible update and all the latest drivers for everything,</p>
<p>Burnt a copy of the downloaded Windows 10 to DVD (you can also do this from USB according to the download pages - there are also some instructions there),</p>
<p>Ran setup from the DVD from Windows 7, followed the process until I got to where you had a choice and chose upgrade. It went a lot better than via the internet. &nbsp;It still took a fair while to do it, but didn't have any glitches and the laptop is still working
 well running Windows 10 with no apparent issues at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best</p>

 the games, then try toggling the windows using Alt and Tab keys. You can also try one workaround and see if that helps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The workaround is to close Windows Explorer process while you are playing game. This will allow you to play the game uninterruptedly. However, when you End the Windows
 Explorer process, all the windows that are running in the background will be closed, which allow you to play the game without any interruption of the Taskbar. When you want all the windows back, you can restart the Windows Explorer process.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please follow the steps mentioned below to do the same:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc key while playing game, this will open Task Manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Look for Windows Explorer process, right click on it and select End Task.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When you want the windows back, open Task Manager by following Step 1, and click on File.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on Run new task, type explorer.exe and click on OK. Windows Explorer will be restarted and you will have all the windows back again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,
</span></span></p>

            Problem still not solved. Windows Store is supposed to be a gaming platform and we dont have a real fullscreen. This is not working properly because of that. I contacted some streamers and they suffer from this problem to. The game is out for more than
 one year. Nobody at Microsoft think a gaming platform should be real fullscreen, seriously??? When can we expect a patch?

            Hello Microsoft? My game not working properly because of Microsoft Store. SOD Support answer: There isn't really a solution. This is how Windows Play Anywhere games function. The game not working like it should because the lack of a real fullscreen that
 is crucial for real gaming. Nobody want to fix that and make it work correctly? Still no patch or answer from Microsoft... As i understand, my mistake was to buy something on Microsoft Store and Microsoft dont want to make it work like it should.
<span><span>Really responsible as support behavior Microsoft thank you.
</span></span><span><span>Never buy anything else on this platform that is not trustworthy. I have 200 games on Steam and all working good and fullscreen. I buy 1 on MS Store and no Fullscreen and
 no support!!!! Gamers be warned: Stay away from this! </span></span><span><span>Microsoft does not deserve your money or your trust! Microsoft= Worst company i had to deal with!</span></span>

<p>Just ran into this problem too. It seems like an oversight instead of bug. When your cursor hits the window bar at the top or the taskbar at the bottom your cursor loses focus in the game and you lose control. This is a huge detriment
 to playing games with a lot of apm and action focus. It's difficult to work with for Xbox Play Anywhere and Windows and just makes it unplayable on PC.</p>
<p>And the support response, from Microsoft themselves, just say to kill off windows explorer as a fix? And to just turn it back on when finished gaming?</p>
<p>I don't know if it's specific for the developers or it physically won't work for some games, but just somehow fix it or make it a global setting on the Windows settings or that weird xbox companion app.</p>

<p>Hello Peckos, I've found a fix for this problem, and as far as I'm concerned it works with all windows store games. It's almost the same as the fix the windows agent mentioned before but helps eliminate the problem you had before where the task manager would
 minimise State of Decay 2. Heres how you do it;</p>
<p>
</p><p>open task manager (CTRL + SHIFT + ESC)</p>
<p>up the top press "options"</p>
<p>check "always on top"</p>
<p>now go to "details"</p>
<p>again, find "explorer.exe"</p>
<p>make sure SOD 2 is in fullscreen (press Alt + Enter while it's open and selected)</p>
<p>end the explorer task</p>
<p>your game should be in fullscreen without any taskbar or "top-bar" showing up</p>
<p>when you want your windows back, press CTRL + Shift + ESC again</p>
<p>press "file"</p>
<p>"run new task"</p>
<p>type in "explorer.exe"</p>
<p>and you're done, hope this helped</p>

    <title>Surface Laptop 2 Click noise whenever picked up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackread1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Laptop 2 Click noise whenever picked up</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently purchased a surface laptop 2 and received it in the middle of Jan. After having it for a few weeks I began to realize that every time I pick it up it makes a subtle click sound, which sounds like it's coming from the aluminum body. I'm not
 sure if it is this or if it's any internal bits making the noise, but it's incredibly frustrating as I feel it takes away from the feeling of a sturdy, structurally sound laptop and I'm worried it may be something more serious. The sound happens mostly when
 I pick it up with one hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone who has a go at helping me out!</p>

<h2>            Updates stuck installing for over 24 hrs. Computer does not boot.</h2>
                    Window update screen come on after trying to shut down my computer, it then stays on forever, eventually after 24 hours. I have to remove power source, also several times it tells me solution center needs disc , I am not sure if this accidently somehow
 got deleted, or if the problems are connected. If I only put computer to sleep, this does not happen. Some times it works fine after shutting down. This time,it has been over 24 hours, and it still says updates 2 of 7 do not power off. Can you help me?

<p><span>Hi miss hazel,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the Operating System installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>Check if you can boot in safe mode. To do so,
 follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 the arrow keys to choose Safe Mode in the Windows Advanced Boot Menu Options and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>If you are able to boot in safe mode, perform
 a system restore and try to get the computer to a bootable state.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start.<span>&nbsp;</span>In the search box, type System Restore, and then, in the list of results, click System Restore.‌ If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the window that appears, click Next and select the date and time on which the computer booted successfully and click Next. Wait for the process to complete.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 asked questions</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>If you are unable to boot to the safe mode or
 if system restore does not help then you can try performing a startup repair from the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRe).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 Repair: frequently asked questions</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: You can also perform system restore from this mode
 if startup repair does not work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>If the system boots back to the desktop, then
 check update history to know the failed error. Also, check for the updates and try installing one update at a time in case of multiple updates.

<h2>            AFTER UPGRADE, BEING LOGGED INTO TEMPORARY PROFILE</h2>
                    <p>After the latest upgrade, when logging in, I am logged into a temporary profile.&nbsp; I'm choosing the same login, entering password, but profile is TEMP.&nbsp; How do I fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked online - tried copy/pasting my old profile in the new new TEMP folder, but it doesn't allow me (says I'm not admin - even though I am) &amp; each time I log in, it appears to be creating&nbsp;a NEW temporary profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried several times to do a system restore, found a restore point before the issue &amp; it STILL does not work!&nbsp; I can't even boot in safe mode!</p>

Try creating a new user account by doing this:

<div>Windows Key+x</div>
<div>Cmd Prompt (admin)</div>
<div>net user administrator /active:yes</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Copying software program cd to hard drive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackidevaney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying software program cd to hard drive.</h2>
                    Another question would be:&nbsp; Is it possible to copy the entire software cd to my hard drive.&nbsp; And then be able to go to that file and actually use it the same as I would use the program CD.&nbsp; That is, use the video tutorial from my hard drive instead of
 the original program cd.

            The best answer I can give is to try it and see.&nbsp; It will probably work, but some programs are designed to run only from the CD.

    <title>The minimize, maximize and close buttons, as well as the edges of any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fsxpilot93  say:</h3>
<h2>            The minimize, maximize and close buttons, as well as the edges of any window have started to randomly disappear. Screenshots included.</h2>
                    The minimize, maximize and close buttons, as well as the edges of any window have started to randomly disappear. By "randomly" I mean that they exist on system startup and then disappear at a later and inconsistent time. Other times the background will
 resemble a multicolored glitch but-- and this is important-- whenever proceed to the ctrl-alt-del screen from this point, the following dialogue screen appears with no glitch. This leads me to believe it's not a hardware problem but a software problem. I have
 attempted to rectify this problem by changing my display settings, resolution and color theme, but nothing works. My only recourse thus far has been to log out of my account and then log back in. When I do this, the buttons and window edges are all present
 and functioning normally.<br />
<br />
All of my programs that utilize my graphics card have no display problems. My graphics card is a ATI Radeon HD 5700 and its drivers are up to date.<br />
<br />
This is what the screen looks like during a major glitch episode:<br />

            &nbsp; It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into Safe Mode.&nbsp; Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in Safe Mode.&nbsp; To
 get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode.&nbsp; Then run a full system scan.<br />

&nbsp;If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem.&nbsp; To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore.&nbsp; Click the box that says Show more restore points.
<br />
- <br />
&nbsp;You can check for corrupted system files.&nbsp; Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type CMD in the search box, right-click CMD.EXE and click Run as administrator. Then from the command prompt type sfc /scannow.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log.&nbsp; To do so click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer.&nbsp; Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.<br />
&nbsp; `<br />
&nbsp;When you get your system back in good working order, I urge you to back your system up to an external hard drive and make regular periodic updates to it.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;Know what?&nbsp; This can happen if you press the F11 key.&nbsp; Sorry I didn't think about that before.&nbsp; Maybe you have a sticky F11 key on your keyboard.&nbsp; Take a postit and clean under that key with the sticky side under the key.&nbsp; It will pick up a lot of lint
 and crud under that key and hopefully help.</p>

            Since you gave two answers, I'm replying to the first one you provided. <br />
<br />
I left the computer on while I was at work. Nothing happened to the buttons and the display did not glitch.
<br />
<br />
I cleaned my entire keyboard and while that was helpful in getting dirt out from under the "D" key, the F11 key had no dirt under it.<br />
<br />
I'm currently running a battery of malware and virus scanners to check for anything, but as of now they haven't found anything outside of a few tracking cookies. I imagine I'll be running HiJackThis before the end of all of this, so I may post the logfile from
 that program. <br />
<br />
I'll check through most of the usual programs I run to double check if any of them are causing this interference.<br />
<br />
Thanks so far!<br />

            Well, I've completed the battery of anti-virus and anti-malware programs and they all came up clean (less some tracking cookies that do not have anything to do with the display) so the virus theory is out.<br />
<br />
I have also noted some off-color glitches appearing momentarily in random spots all over the screen; unfortunately, I am unable to get screenshots of these because they only appear for a half a second, but appear as small off-color squares.
<br />
<br />
I haven't had any problems with the minimize, maximize and close buttons again. <br />
<br />
If it's not a virus or malware and my display drivers are all up-to-date, what's going on?<br />

            Hi,
<div>
<p><span>This seems like the user profile that you are using is corrupted and that is why it started working after you have logged out and logged in back. I would suggest you to
 please try the below steps.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><br />
Creating User Account</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>Try creating a new user account and check whether you have the same issue.<br />
<br />
To create a user account <br />
1. To open User Accounts, click the Start button, click Control Panel, click User Accounts and Family Safety, and then click User Accounts.<br />
2. Click Manage another account. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3. Click Create a new account.<br />
4. Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.<br />
<br />
For more information follow the link below:</span></p>

<br />
If it works in the new user account, then the user account may be corrupted.<br />
<br />
To fix the corrupted user profile you may refer the link below:</span></p>

            I've finally properly migrated the old user profile to the new user profile. I'm typing this in a new user profile right now and I can safely say that the display glitch is happening here too. In fact, it happened quicker with the new profile than the
 old one.<br />
<br />
Also, there must be a simpler solution than migrating a 96 gigabyte user account from an old one to a new one, even though that wasn't the solution.<br />

            <p>The bug is with Windows Update.&nbsp; I made the mistake of selecting to update my Windows 7 x64 AMD 7500G driver with Windows Update.&nbsp; It 'updates' to a very old version of the AMD driver (8.x from 2012 - current version in 2015 is 14.x), which causes various
 crashes in ntdll.dll, notably when trying to view a picture or video, or accessing System in Control Panel - however you can still get to Device Manager by typing Device Manager in the search box on the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve the problem, go to <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>, hover over Drivers+Support at the top right, select your operating system, then download and install the Catalyst Control Center, which during install will also detect your hardware and download and install the latest
 drivers for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid similar problems in future, never update drivers with Windows Update.&nbsp; Always go to the manufacturer's website for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please remove outdated drivers from Windows Update!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update Freezing &#40;Solved&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-may-freeze-after-installing-the/5a60d75d-120a-4502-873c-8bfec65c82d0" title="Windows 10 may freeze after installing the Anniversary Update - Updated 8-31-16">
main thread</a> about this issue has been locked, I figured I would create a new thread with a solution that worked for me in the hopes that it will help others still plagued by this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a custom rig I built April of 2015.</p>
<p>-Asus X99 Deluxe</p>
<p>-i7 5930k OC'd@4.6GHz</p>
<p>-EVGA GTX 970 SSC</p>
<p>-16GBs HyperX Predator DDR4 (15.9 usable)</p>
<p>-120GB Corsair SSD (boot drive)</p>
<p>-2TB WD Black Drive (storage)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It originally had Windows 8/8.1 and updating to Windows 10 was a bit of a headache, but it worked out. Everything was fine until the Anniversary Update rolled in. Like many others, the update was automatic and began installing when I booted up my computer
 one morning. <strong>After logging in I found that that the Taskbar and Windows Explorer in general would freeze after about 10-20 seconds and become completely unresponsive forcing a hard restart.</strong> At the time there was very little (if any) information
 about what can be done, other than revert back to a previous version and wait for Microsoft to acknowledge the issue. So I reverted to the 1511 update and the freezing issue disappeared.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I decided to try the Anniversary Update again (using the <strong>Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant</strong> tool) since Microsoft officially acknowledged the issue and said that the newest update should resolve the freezing. Well, it didn't. Spent hours
 waiting for a strong wind to blow the smoke signals my direction (2.2mbps down) only to find the issue has not been resolved. No errors other than
<strong>The program has become unresponsive...</strong> with the only option being to hard restart. After numerous ninja restarts I managed to remove the
<strong>Intel Rapid Storage Technology</strong> software at the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-may-freeze-after-installing-the/5a60d75d-120a-4502-873c-8bfec65c82d0?page=3" title="Boot in Safe Mode and uninstall the Intel Rapid Storage technology software.">
suggestion</a>&nbsp;of the main thread (I was not able to remove the software in Safe Mode). My hopes were shot down when the computer booted up and immediately began freezing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only time the computer wouldn't freeze was on the login screen after a hard restart. So I would let it sit on the login screen while I searched the issue on my phone in the hopes that a definitive solution would eventually slap me in the face. &nbsp;No single
 fix stood out and it seemed like I was resigned to revert back to 1511 again. I ended up falling asleep while trudging through the comments of the
<strong>small number of users</strong> who are experiencing this problem. The computer sat on the login screen all night (I turned off Sleep a while back because of the
<a href="http://www.windows10forums.com/threads/unable-to-wake-up-from-sleep-mode.849/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Unable to wake up from sleep mode">
waking from sleep</a> issues, so I normally just shut it down).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I woke up this morning, I decided to deal with reverting back to the previous version later and went to shut down the computer. Upon clicking the power button on the login screen, I noticed that the options were
<strong>Update and Restart</strong> and <strong>Update and Shut Down</strong>. I clicked
<strong>Update and Restart</strong> and fell asleep again while waiting for the update to complete. When I woke up again, the login screen was waiting for me like an ominous presence. I prepared myself to be disappointed and slowly put in my password. My desktop
 popped up with the quickness an SSD should provide and I noticed most of my startup programs were populating quicker than normal in the Taskbar tray. Hesitant to click on anything, I opened the Task Manager to watch the performance tab and see if I could catch
 where the system hangs (Last night the system would freeze a few moments after opening the Task Manager. The graph summaries would continue to animate but the system became unresponsive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I watched the CPU usage rise for a few moments as further startup programs completed loading and then it dropped to nearly nil. I hovered my mouse over the Start button, ready to disturb my neighbors with obscenities, and clicked. The Start Menu appeared
 and live tiles began flicking away. <strong>A glimmer of hope</strong>. I clicked on the desktop and the Start Menu disappeared as it should. I right clicked on the Taskbar and the menu appeared. I right clicked on the desktop and that menu appeared. I pinched
 myself to make sure I was awake and not dreaming. <strong>Is it actually working?</strong> I walked away for a little while and came back to my screensaver. I shook the mouse and my desktop appeared. I opened Chrome, found something on YouTube to give the
 computer a simple task to handle in case it wanted to act up again and noticed the internet was really slow. Ended up that update KB3194496 was downloading in Windows Update. The update downloaded fine
<del>but I have yet to install it and restart the computer</del>. As of now the computer is working flawlessly and I will check back here after installing the update. (KB3194496 installed just fine and the computer is running great!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what caused the computer to start working properly, but I would guess that it has something to do with the updates not being able to go through while signed in. I'm not really sure that uninstalling the Intel Rapid Storage Technology software
 had anything to do with it, even though I'm not sure I will be reinstalling it any time soon as I do not have a RAID setup. This was one of two computers that had problems updating to the Anniversary Update (the laptop BSOD'd and ended up having too many bad
 sectors on the HDD), but this computer has impeccable hardware having dug through the deepest ditches and burned through the most fearsome witches. The best piece of advice I can give is to
<strong>wait on the login screen</strong> and <strong>have patience</strong> until
<strong>Update and Restart</strong> appears when you click the <strong>power button</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone out there!&nbsp;</p>

            I also have the same problem now even when Norton updates it goes to restart now when it restarts the loading just goes around and around finally I shut down the pc later when I restart the pc all is normal. I heard Microsoft is working on a fix not sure
 if this for us or not. called windows 10 1607 ( anniversary addition) RS1 script to fix unblock update for insider users, which I am not involved in at all. I tried looking this up in windows update but could not find anything. I'm wondering if this is also
 our problem. all my updates say I'm up to date. this only happens when I have to restart my pc after any updates to window's or Norton.

            <p>Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try disabling <strong>Norton</strong> entirely and restarting the computer. It may be interfering with
<strong>Windows Defender</strong> and blocking updates from even showing they are available. You could also check the
<strong>Resource Monitor</strong> and see what processes are using the network. (Right click the Taskbar, click Task Manager, click on Performance tab, click Open Resource Monitor on the bottom left, click the Network tab.) If you see
<strong>svchost.exe (netsvcs)</strong> is receiving any data then there is an update of some sort still being downloaded. On my laptop it currently shows
<strong>Cumulative Update KB3193494</strong> is downloading but it's been at 100% for the past hour or so. Checking the Resource Monitor shows that it's consuming data. The other day I had an issue with another Win10AU computer that had nothing showing up as
 updating or downloading, but that <strong>svchost.exe (netsvcs)</strong> process was using data. Ended up that Windows Defender was updating definitions although it didn't show it the few times I checked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if nothing is using data in the Resource Monitor and with Norton off, there may still be an update trying to push through that can't make it. If that's the case, just let your computer sit on the login screen overnight and then restart it from the power
 button on the login screen. My theory is that it allows just the base processes to work without the bloat of startup programs and loading the desktop. It worked for me so you never know. :P</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if that helps any.</p>

<p>Hello everyone</p>
<p><br />
I've tried to find something about it but nothing, so i'm posting a message here :</p>
<p>Because i'm a noob, i have 2 xbox live account, one with a gmail adress and another with a hotmail adress. The hotmail one is useless but ! I've bought Dark Soul on steam and i had to add the serial number to my account when prompted by windows game live...and
 i failed, i've selected the hotmail one. Is there any way to "transfer" the ownership of the game to the right account please?</p>
<p><br />
Bonus : is there a way to "link" the gmail account to the hotmail one? Because now i have windows 8 and i must connect with a hotmail adress...</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>

<p>P.S : if you look my account, you'll see "dark soul", but it's an "old play" with the game of a friend...</p>

<p>once a game is purchased with a gamertag it can not be removed or transfered to a different Profile.</p>
<p>for your Windows 8, you can use a gmail there, but you have to Register it on <a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.live.com</a> beforehand, then it will be a valid Microsoft account and can be used for any Microsoft Service.</p>
<p>as you already have a gamertag here, you actually did this sometime ago, so you already should be able to use it as Login for your Windows 8</p>

<h3> dfrancisco  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#40;Virus or maleware&#41; Windows installer utility&#58; Unload</h2>
                    Recently my anti virus software detected and removed several viruses from my PC. Now, at each start up, Windows installer utility begins to configure a program called 'Unload'.
<br />
<br />
First a screen comes up that says that feature attempting to be installed is not available. After several attempts to press cancel and error message then comes up: Error 1706, 'No valid source'. Afterward, I can use the computer normally.
<br />
<br />
Anyone familiar with this problem and how I can fix it? Is it harmful in anyway if I run Windows Installer Cleanup utility?

            Start by being more thorough with your malware removal. Go through these general malware removal steps systematically:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
That may solve the problem for you. If it doesn't, then something is left from the infection that is trying to install/load at Startup. Manage your Startup to remove this:<br />
<br />
<span>Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
Important - Do not use the System Configuration Utility to stop processes. Instead, use Start&gt;Run&gt;services.msc [enter]
</span><span>and do not stop any services unless you really, really know what you're doing.</span>

            I have used several different scans including: Windows Defender, Ad-Aware and my regular anti virus program (Norman) but so far nothing has solved my problem. When I first noticed the Windows installer maleware, it came right after my anti virus software
 had detected several threats but since then, nothing more has been detected.

            Well, I don't care for any of those programs but if we assume that your computer is clean (not an assumption I'd make, but it's your machine and your call), then try
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Autoruns</a> to see what is starting with Windows. After all,
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">something</span> </em>is and unless it's a rootkit (hidden from Windows), you can find it and stop it.

            Hi Nomvula999 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Reset your password (on another device) and if you login using Safe mode, make sure to use Safe mode with networking.
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE USING MICROSOFT ACCOUNT
<br />You will have to reset your Microsoft account password. To reset your password, click on the below link and follow online directions
<br /><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />
<br />If you have security info on your account, Microsoft will send a one-time code to the alternate phone number or email address you gave to Microsoft. After you enter the code on the next screen, you'll be able to make a new password.
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE USING LOCAL ACCOUNT
<br />Reset your Windows 10 local account password - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4028457/windows-10-reset-your-local-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402845...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

====================================================<br />
Your actual movie files would be archived somewhere on your hard drive...<br />
I would suspect in your "My Videos" folder. Try importing into Movie Maker <br />
from there.<br />

    <title>scroll arrows on laptop too tiny... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sundognl  say:</h3>
<h2>            scroll arrows on laptop too tiny...</h2>
                    <p>...scroll arrows on laptop ideapad Lenovo with windows 10 too tiny.&nbsp; Neither Microsoft nor Lenovo tech support had a clue what I was referring to or outright didn't know what to do;&nbsp; my question&nbsp;isn't about the scroll bar (I've seen those types of questions)
 and I've attempted to seek self-remedy by going to settings and advanced setting; even typing in the problem on my browser.&nbsp; And, we're not talking about simply zooming-up everything (to which&nbsp;even that doesn't change the size of the scroll arrows).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say again, the up and down scroll arrows are as tiny as pen dots. As&nbsp;on my search engine screens or any window&nbsp;where scroll arrows are displayed.&nbsp; And so think about it, the arrows are so tiny, that if I don't make a concerted, focused effort to
 cursor directly over the up/down dots each and every&nbsp;time, the&nbsp;whole screen jumps up or down in huge increments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don't guess, if you don't know, or that you've never heard of such a problem.</p>

            <p>How do we reply to the email that says some person has a solution?????&nbsp; Where is it stated on that email to&nbsp;merely or directly&nbsp;reply and not have to search around esoterically&nbsp; to click on a reply.&nbsp; FFS's!&nbsp;This morning had to search all over **** and guess
 clicking everywhere to reply to Ocra (what ever her foreign name was) and still don't know if, as with here, if it was the correct medium for responding!&nbsp; The latest guy, Marmaduke, says to put it on a screenshot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What part of the scrolling arrows (anywhere, on any window, on anyplace where there are up and down scrolling arrows on the computer) can't you computer geeks grasp?!&nbsp; People wonder why I constantly berate millennials and any age woman. Computer savvy doesn't
 mean intelligence; and women, you can take the woman out of the house, but you can't take the brain out of the woman.&nbsp; Neither one of the "tech support" persons that I've contacted at &nbsp;F------g Microsoft and Lenovo by phone had any clue, &nbsp;even in getting past
 those infuriating corporate&nbsp;push-button options with answers to questions we don't have, might as well give us the weather too!&nbsp;Some of us are having to waste our mere 15 minute work break to hear, 'one moment please' for an hour!&nbsp; Additionally, many of us
 don't have unlimited cell phone calling plans!&nbsp; Worse part is, Americans are not&nbsp;conditioned to push-back in society least be recriminated against for (finally) saying other than vote for someone different next time or vent to your spouse like good Americans.&nbsp;
 Big believer that computers cause more aggravation than they fix! Fed the f###-up! Have some gumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Push back-up, not down!&nbsp; Those **** centers tell me she's sorry!&nbsp; Sorry means telling someone in her chain of command that cares about customer feedback;
 yeah good luck with that in this country.</p>

<p>My name is not Marmaduke! I suggested posting a screenshot because no one here can see your screen, you said you do not want guesses. you keep repeating "the up and down scroll arrows are as tiny as pen dots" but are not being clear as to where you are seeing
 these pen dots, although you have said its not the scroll bar, so where are they? is it some Lenovo bloatware that is producing them, mouse software or some error in windows? I don't have them on any of my windows 10 machines.</p>
<p>anybody trying to help HAS to guess at the problem let alone the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the rest of your post - are you deliberately trying to offend and alienate anybody that might be willing to give up their time (for free) to offer YOU some help with YOUR problem?</p>
<p>the people here volunteer to help, they have nothing to do with call centres that you may or may not have spoken with.</p>

                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire with Windows 7.&nbsp; My pc powered down unexpectedly and when we rebooted our LAC was missing and we can only connect to the internet with wireless.&nbsp; It does not recognize the ethernet or modem at all.&nbsp; The non wireless adapter does not
 show up in the Device manager.&nbsp; I know the modem and ethernet cord are good because when I reconnected my wireless modem it works fine.&nbsp; I have tried downloading and repairing the adapter but keep getting an error "The Realtek Network Controller was not found.&nbsp;
 If Deep Sleep Mode is enabled Please Plug the Cable.&nbsp; I then tried reconnecting the ethernet to modem and pc then rebooted both and received the same error.&nbsp; What am I missing?</p>
