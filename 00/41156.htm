<h2>            MTU Fehler&#47;Verbindung zu Xbox Live unm&#38;&#35;246&#59;glich</h2>
                    
<p>Nabend leute,</p>
<p>Ich bekomme bald die kriese !</p>
<p><br />
Ich habe mir seit gestern wieder eine Xbox 360 gekauft und nun kann ich nichtmehr mit Xbox LIVE verbinden.</p>
<p>Wenn ich eine Internet Test mache kommt eine fehler meldung das mein MTU zu niedrig sei.</p>
<p>Obwohl ich vor 2 stunden noch ohne probleme online gespielt habe.</p>
<p>Ich sollte doch mal MTU auf 1364 oder automatisch stellen.</p>
<p>Nur kann ich das nicht machen, weil ich mit meinem Router niegendwo die Option finde !</p>

<p>Ich habe eine Speedport W 921V von der Telekom.</p>

<p>Wenn die Xbox keine Verbindung zum Internet aufbauen kann, aber es funktioniert nicht, und die Xbox hat keinen blassen Schimmer warum, dann wirft sie immer den MTU Fehler.</p>
<p>Du kannst selber prüfen, ob es an der MTU liegt oder nicht. Öffne auf Deinem PC eine Eingabeaufforderung (Windowstaste+R dann "cmd" eingeben), und in dem schwarzen Fenster gibst Du ein:</p>
<p>ping -f -l 1364 www.google.com</p>
<p>Kommt eine Fehlermeldung, dass das Paket fragmentiert werden müsste, aber das "nicht fragmentieren"-Flag gesetzt ist, hast Du wirklich ein MTU Problem und solltest beim Telekom Support nachfragen.</p>
<p>Ansonsten kann es sein, dass durch das gerade laufende Update, die Xbox Live Server arg im Stress sind, und die Verbindung nicht korrekt funktioniert. Einfach ein wenig Geduld haben, und vielleicht morgen nochmal probieren.

<p>Oder wiedermal MTU.....</p>
<p>Ich habe auch beim Telekom Support angerufen und die haben mir gesagt das ich am Router garnicht MTu einstellungen vormnehmen kann.</p>
<p>und beim Start -&gt; Ausführen -&gt; cmd "ping -f -i 1364" eingebe passiert garnicht.....</p>

<p>Für MTU gibts doch sicher Programe (Google müsste da was hergeben).</p>
<p>Ich hatte, als es über den Pc lief, auch Verbindungsprobleme.</p>
<p>Bei mir war damals TuneUp schuld bzw. die optimierte Einstellungen und den geänderten MTU Wert.</p>
<p>Wenn du über den Pc rein gehst, wäre es ne Idee falls du sowas nutzt.</p>
<p>Falls du mit der Box direkt an den Router gehst, zudem UPnP noch an hast, dann vergiss mein post. Da bin ich dann etwas überfragt.

<p>Sorry, dann hast Du (wegen dem blöden Schriftsatz) den Befehl falsch gelesen. Der Befehl sollte (gesprochen) so lauten:</p>
<p>ping minus EFF minus ELL 1364 www.google.com</p>
<p>Du hast versehentlich ein "minus i" geschrieben. Außerdem muss noch eine Internet-Adresse angegeben werden, wohin mit einem 1364byte großen Paket gepingt werden soll.

    <title>New partition created after windows update 1803 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New partition created after windows update 1803</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>So after I updated my PC to the spring update 1803, a new partition appeared and windows kept prompting me that "partition G:\" is full.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its a 450 mb with 400 mb in use. If I go inside of it it shows me its empty. I ran disk clean up from bitdeffender, and saw that theres G:\Recovery\WindowsRE\Winre.wim inside. So it is the recovery partition that is supposed to be hidden right? Any way of
 putting it back into hidding? Or removing it? Or something to stop windows to keep on spaming me that this drive is full?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi  Adonikh, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC

    <title>Why Microsoft imposes Skype updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viktorkvs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Microsoft imposes Skype updates</h2>
                    Previously, in the settings of Skype was the ability to opt out of automatic updates. Now there is no such opportunity! With a weak Internet, I can not use the program and have to wait until it is updated, sometimes 20-30 minutes sometimes. Moreover, they
 specifically made it so that it was impossible to refuse to update! If you click "Cancel", Skype stops running and you need to restart the system to use it again! But that’s not all, the non-working versions are forcibly installed, as it was yesterday, when
 version 8.33 did not work (no calls were made), and version 8.32 worked fine! But this is not all, microsoft makes specially incompatible versions, so from the old versions you cannot call new ones and vice versa (I often came across this, the call is on,
 but the interlocutor does not have an incoming call!). Updates come out every week (what nonsense?), And each new one is worse and worse than the previous one, for example, now you cannot display contacts, instant messenger and keep call in one window! Now
 you have to choose, either watch contacts, or use an instant messenger. When will it stop ?!<br />
I apologize for bad english, I used a translator.

            I often use file transfer, messenger and calls. Web form is not convenient. I also know that support for classic Skype will be discontinued ... I use Windows 7 x64. And I have only one request - stop frequent and meaningless program updates, no other software
 is updated as often as Skype ... But these updates actually make the program worse. And allow users to disable auto-updates. Because of the difference in versions, for example, I cannot call people with an older version, they do not see the incoming call,
 but I can accept the call from them ... Also, the ability to transfer files larger than 20 Mb has disappeared, as if now the beginning of 2000 year, not the end of 2018 ... I can't choose a video camera ... I can't see contacts and instant messenger at the
 same time and make a call ... And this is sad

<p>It has been noticed that users running extremely outdated versions of Windows 7 (like missing Service pack 1 and 8+ years of OS updates) are having audio/video detection issues with Skype 8.33. To attempt to avoid this problem it would be best to keep your
 OS up to date. I have no idea if they will revert recent changes in 8.33 to increase compatibility with non-updated machines. I have no idea if they will ever offer an option to disable updates. There are unofficial workarounds to block updates, that I have
 covered in several of my previous posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only aware of the file uploads being restricted to 300 MB as they are now actually stored in the cloud instead of being sent from machine to machine. Since they are making major changes to Skype 8.x to add features back in, I do not foresee them slowing
 their current schedule. There are network programs that produce far more updates than Skype on a regular basis as well as restrict access using any outdated versions. One program that I use that has been doing this, for as long as I can recall, is Steam.</p>

<p>Well, my automatic updates are turned off, and these forced updates, are bullcrap.</p>
<p>

            I do not understand at all what is the connection between the version of the operating system and the imposition of constant, continuous updates! And what does the operating system have to do with the fact that it is impossible to interrupt the update
 by pressing the "Cancel" button, since after this event the program stops working altogether and needs to be reinstalled? please do not take the question away! As for the inoperability of new versions that are forced to install, even without testing before
 imposing on users: it is completely unrelated to the version of the operating system https://support.skype.com/en/statusarchive/89314322! The new unchecked version 8.33 was imposed on users and the support service recommended installing the old version 8.32.
 The question is, why did you force everyone to install an unverified version? Please stop useless and merciless updates almost every week! Stop it! A normal program cannot update so often!

<p><span><span>Hello mcfinnie,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should check the following two things to check if you get an option to select the Time zone.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the default location set on your computer is United States from Regional and Language settings:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 Regional and Language Options by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Clock, Language, and Region, and then clicking Regional and Language Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on the Location Tab and check if the location is set to United States.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You can change the default time server and update the time:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>You
 can change the default time server by right-clicking on the clock from the taskbar, and then choose Adjust Date/Time from the menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on the Internet Time tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the Internet Time Settings dialog, you can change the default server by choosing an item from the drop-down. Change the server and update the
 time.</span></span></p>

            I finally had to do an upgrade reinstall of the windows 7 files to allow me to chose my proper time zone, after trying your suggestions... don't know why this happened, but with as many questions as I'm sure you get every day, thank you for taking the

<p>
</p><p>The ESP drive has always been there, the change is that it now has a drive letter so becomes visible. Yours is not the only thread reporting this and is not related to any form of hacking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;partition is required on UEFI motherboards and is very small (the size is reported in MB not GB). Use Disk Manager to remove the drive letter and it will no longer show.</p>

    <title>When reimaging a computer, can you save the microsoft updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            When reimaging a computer, can you save the microsoft updates</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I frequently borrow a netbook computer from the public library for 3 weeks.&nbsp; Each time I receive the computer the library reimages the computer.&nbsp; When they do this reimaging it completely removes all updates and leaves only the windows operating system in
 tact.&nbsp; I have to turn on the automatic updates for a specific time and date, and then begin the updates.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many times it takes from 5 to 12 hours to search,&nbsp;download and then install these updates.&nbsp; This last time, 181 updates were installed and it took over
 12 hours to complete subsequently wasting valuable time.&nbsp; Over 4 days another 26 updates were necessary to download.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there&nbsp;a way for the Public Library to reimage the computer without removing all the updates? as too much time is wasted reintroducing the updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer removes all the&nbsp;updates does this mean that the computer is more vulnerable&nbsp;to intrusions that may be harmful to the computer or my privacy?&nbsp;

            Have you discussed this with the people at the library?&nbsp; In order for an image to have all of the updates, a new image would have to be created every time new updates are available.&nbsp; What the library is doing is making sure that the system is clean after
 it's been used.&nbsp; There's no telling what someone might have downloaded.&nbsp; It's a small price to pay for three weeks of use of the computer.<br />

    <title>Faulty Xbox One replacements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kleinkills  say:</h3>
<h2>            Faulty Xbox One replacements</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I received an xbox one that was faulty from the store. I contacted xbox support via chat and they were helpful and were able to send me another Xbox one by UPS. I had to wait almost a week to receive the replacement but when I did, it was faulty as well.
 The optical audio jack was not functioning nor would the cable plug in properly. I checked the other xbox one to make sure the audio cable was not faulty and it plugged in just fine. I had to contact xbox support again to wait for more instructions to get
 another replacement. It has taken much longer and I am not happy with the unfortunate circumstances. Not only have I been a customer since the original xbox, I have also had many problems with our family xbox 360. Albeit they had not been registered under
 my name, between my two brothers, we have had 6 xbox 360 replacements. I am not sure why this is the case but I can't say I'm thrilled that there have been constant issues for me as well as my family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been very loyal to the company and the xbox brand. Every representative I have talked to has been very helpful and done the best they can. What has been a major inconvenience for me is the fact that I am an independent video game reviewer and have
 not been able to complete the work on the review of the product, as the console has had multiple issues and problems with getting a functioning replacement. Not only is this a major problem for business, this also has left me very dissatisfied as a customer.
 What can the company do for me in regards to this? I feel that I deserve better and that the company should go out of their way to resolve the situation. Many customers received free xbox ones as a random pick of the draw, but customers like myself, who have
 experienced so many problems, what have we received? In the letter I got with my faulty xbox one replacement, I was promised a 30 day live gold card, when I only received 14 days. So not only is the xbox live service card not adequate as it would seem fit
 in this situation, it also didnt even deliver up to the promise that the company made in response. Please picture yourself in my shoes, as a customer. I know you have been in that situation and how did it feel when the other company tried to skimp out on you,
 when you had been so loyal to their brand for so many years? I can tell you that we have had an xbox console within the family since 2003! That's a long time! I hope to hear back quickly in response to the present situation. As it stands, the company is still
 working to get me a functioning replacement xbox one, but my question is, what else can be done for my troubles? Thank you for reading</p>

<h2>            Driver not downloaded</h2>
                    <p>I'm running W7 Home Premium, high speed cable, ACER laptop, Norton Premium virus, etc.</p>
<p>I have a HP 4630 All-In-One printer that used to work very well, but now has limited functionality.</p>
<p>My laptop keeps trying to download a new driver for this device (14 times now) with the result being "Failed".</p>
<p>In troubleshooting the problem, my laptop is now calling my printer an "Unknown Device", and the only</p>
<p>suggestion is to try to download the driver again, which again, is not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the problem is the ACER laptop, the drivers or what.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did speak with HP Tech, their suggestion, tried to sell me a new, up-to-date All-In-One printer.</p>
<p>The printer is some 2 &amp; 1/2 years old., overall, small amount of usage.</p>
<p>That is treating the symptom &amp; not the problem as I see it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the automatic device driver update does not work correctly there are ways that we can manually update the driver of a specific device which is connected to
 your laptop. To resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>How are you attempting to download the new printer driver, is it through the Windows update or through a third party application?</span></li><li><span>Have you attempted to manually download the device driver from the manufacturer's website and install it?</span></li><li><span>Have you tried to connect the printer to a different device and verify if the same issue occurs?</span></li><li><span>What other troubleshooting steps have you attempted?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We look forward to your response to our queries.</span></p>

<p>It is a bad idea to accept for download or attempt to download any hardware drivers offered by Microsoft or Windows Update.&nbsp; If those hardware drivers updates are failing you should rejoice that they are failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware driver updates would be for things like video, audio, network, printer, etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you ever see such updates offered in Windows Update you should right click it, Hide the update and hope you never see it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does not know what the best drivers are for your system so if you think your system needs drivers you should only get them from the manufacturers WWW site and for your HP4630 that would be here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-officejet-4630-e-all-in-one-printer-series/5305049/model/5305050/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-officejet-4630-e-all-in-one-printer-series/5305049/model/5305050/drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You did not describe any error message displayed when the driver update fails so here are some generic instructions about how to handle such things:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If your system is working and you want it to keep working never accept hardware driver (chipset, video, audio, network, printer) updates from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That message is telling you that the driver update offered from Windows Update is an older or lesser version than the currently installed driver or has a lower compatibility rating than the installed driver.&nbsp; That means you probably don't want that update
 and you should be glad the installation is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (video, audio, network, printer) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware
 manufacturers WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft offers you a driver update does not mean you have an out of date or afflicted driver and it certainly doesn't mean you have to install the driver updates MS offers - it is generally best NOT to install hardware driver updates offered
 by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accepting hardware driver updates from Microsoft is one reason there are so many topics in the community that start with "Windows update broke my computer...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me assure you with 100% certainty that these ideas for things to try that are usually suggested by the Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" will not help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode</p>
<p>Clean Boot</p>
<p>DISM</p>
<p>SFC&nbsp; (System File Checker)</p>
<p>Windows update Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>One rule of thumb (especially for hardware drivers) is "if it ain't broke don't fix it" so if you are not having a problem with hardware devices (video, audio, network, printer) don't accept or install those driver updates offered from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you
 are having a problem like that you should only get driver updates from the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see and can recognize those hardware driver updates offered you should right click and hide them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac1f86e4-1fca-471b-a37b-14ae2736c025" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pretty soon you might have quite a few hidden hardware updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3b09b-cddc-49aa-8381-d29660edc24a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3b09b-cddc-49aa-8381-d29660edc24a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a way built in to not allow these kinds of updates and I'm not 100% sure it works as advertised but this is a safe adjustment that may prevent a whoops event in the future and how you might undo them if they happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has built in ways to disable driver updates from Windows Update that you can read about here:</p>

<p>Just the error message that the update failed.</p>
<p>Please see my response to ElderN as well, in which</p>
<p>I also ran an SFC SCANNOW which showed nothing amiss.</p>
<p>The update comes through the Windows update and NOT</p>
<p>HP, which I thought was very odd. It's hidden now.</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling all of the 4630's files (hope I got them all)</p>
<p>&amp; then tried a new install which did not work. ARGGGGG !!</p>
<p>Could this HP update from 2013 coming through Windows</p>
<p>update be the cause for all this aggravation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try again to do a new install from the HP website</p>
<p>and see what happens. I'll let you know. Thanks again !!</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing the results of the troubleshooting steps that you have completed. Since you're going to attempt to download and reinstall the device driver for the printer that you have, kindly check also if there is an uninstall utility for the software
 that was installed along with the printer. Doing so will assist in minimizing any errors in the installation of the device driver.</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote>I tried uninstalling all of the 4630's files (hope I got them all)<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Manually deleting files in an attempt to uninstall anything is asking for problems.&nbsp; Many of the HP printer files have names that have nothing to do with the printer model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't get things working again by reinstalling from a freshly-downloaded installer file from HP, post back and explain in detail what happened and including the complete text of any error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take ElderN's advice to heart:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (video, audio, network, printer) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware

<p>Thanks again LemP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I would give this "aggravation" known as (HP 4630 All-In-One)&nbsp;</p>
<p>one more shot before giving up. And to my amazement, everything downloaded</p>
<p>&amp; installed direct from HP. This unit is supposed to Print, Scan, Copy &amp; Fax.</p>
<p>I do not need a fax, so far it Prints &amp; Scans with no problems. Tomorrow&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll try the Copy function and hope for the best, however I now assume that'</p>
<p>it will work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all you that responded to my question, and for all the excellent</p>
<p>advice on what works &amp; what does not. Thanks to you all, as the phase goes:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 parental control - web browsing activity</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Apologies for posting yet another question re Windows 10 parental controls and web browsing activity.</p>
<p>I've followed all of the various instructions - created an outlook.com account, added&nbsp;the child under family, etc.</p>
<p>However, when I go under <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a>&nbsp;and review recent activity under web browsing, nothing shows up, either under this week or prior.</p>
<p>Anyone else having this issue and been able to solve?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Using ASUS Vulcan ANC as headset&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey, I just recently got the ASUS Vulcan ANC headset for my computer and I was wondering if I could use it on my Xbox 360. I've tried going with a 3.5mm to 2.5mm converter and plugging&nbsp; it into the Xbox controller but I get no voice when trying to record
 a message. Is there anything I can do to make it work or is it hopeless?</p>

<p>Yeah it's not that simple. The mic 3.5mm connector on the headset only has one channel while the 2.5mm jack on the controller is two channels. When you plug the mic connector into the converter it shorts the voice and speaker channels together so the controller
 will not know what to do. It will try sending a speaker signal out only to have it shorted into the mic and then grounded so nothing gets through.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You can find adapter designed to plug into the 360 controller and support 3.5mm headset. Look on amazon for 360 controller PC headset adapter or similar and you should find it. It separates the two channels into two 3.5mm inputs one for speaker out and one
 for mic in. I would save your money and buy a headset designed for the 360 that is meant to integrate Live chat.</p>

<p><span>You will need to use either Windows XP startup disk using the floppy disk drive or Windows XP installation CD to fix the issue on the

            Your problem is that your System Registry file is corrupt.<br />
<br />
Picking up where Halima S left off, since you can't boot from your CD, you need to create another boot CD so that you can copy the backed-up copies of your System Registry files from the System Restore area of your disk and place them in the proper place.&nbsp;
 My preferred way of doing this is to create a free "Live Linux" boot disk such as Knoppix or Ubuntu.&nbsp; Linux disks have the advantage that the "super protection" placed on the "System Volume Information" folder by Windows is not an issue for Linux disks.&nbsp; It
 also gets you past a rather risky Part 1 of KB307545.&nbsp; You create the boot disk by downloading a .iso file and use any computers "Burn Image" feature of its CD-burning program to create a bootable disk from the .iso file.&nbsp; If you use Ubuntu, take care not
 to install it but follow the "Try Me" instructions instead.<br />

            You can also make a bootable XP Recovery Console and first run chkdsk /r, and if that doesn't work out, then consider KB307545.<br />
<br />
Whenever you see that message, always start with chkdsk /r from the XP Recovery Console first.&nbsp; I have never had to use KB307545 for this issue.<br />

            If you have never actually fixed the problem before or if you only do Intenet searches, the results might lead you to believe that there is a registry problem and then the result will point you to use KB307545 (like the Microsoft Support Engineers always
 suggest), but I have never used KB307545 to fix this problem and I will never suggest it - because I actually have fixed it before.<br />
<br />
To me it means that XP can't find the file to load it.<br />
<br />
The reason XP can't find the file is usually due to file system corruption.<br />
<br />
You need to boot on something to run chkdsk /r on your HDD first, but we don't know anything about your system (thanks to MS Answers).<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Answer the questions, then we'll see what to do next<br />

<h2>            Playing games - Monitor -OUT OF RANGE</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Windows Vista Home Premium, and when I try to play some games that I had not problem with on XP, my monitor goes black and the message OUT OF RANGE comes up.<br />
<br />
I can't get my screen back, and I am forced to shut down and start up again to regain access to my computer.<br />
<br />
I can hear the game running in the background, so the game is working.&nbsp; The monitor does not I guess.<br />
<br />
I did look this up in the database, but I couldn't find the proper way to fix it on Vista.</p>

<p>Hi Sandie,</p>
<p>We have a Microsoft KB article below that may help you in resolving your issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315614#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB: 315614</a>: “<b>Error messages when you start a Microsoft game: ‘Signal out of range’ or ‘Out of scan range’"</b></p>
<p>We see that you stated that you have tried Shantanu’s and Mark’s suggestions, stating that you have tried changing the resolution and messing with compatibility mode. However, you did not mention if you checked
 for an updated driver for your video card. We would like you to go ahead and do this if not so already. To do this, follow the steps listed below taken from the Microsoft KB article “<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315614#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">315614</a>”,
 also listed above:</p>
<p><i>Contact your video hardware manufacturer to obtain and install the latest version of the driver for your video adapter. To see whether applicable driver updates are available, visit the following Microsoft
 Windows Update Web site: </i></p>
<p><i><a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a></i></p>
<p><i>To determine the name and manufacturer of your video adapter:
</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Click
<b>Start</b> </li><li>Type <b>dxdiag</b> in the <b>
Start Search</b> box, and then press ENTER. </li></ol>
<p><i>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<b>Continue</b>. </i></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <b>Display</b> tab.
</li><li>Under <b>Device</b>, look for
<b>Name</b> and <b>Manufacturer</b>. </li><li>Click <b>Exit</b>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another possibility is that you may need to change the refresh rate for your video adapter. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Open Display Settings by clicking the <b>Start</b> button, clicking
<b>Control Panel</b>, clicking <b>Appearance and Personalization</b>, clicking <b>
Personalization</b>, and then clicking <b>Display Settings</b>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click<b> Advanced Settings</b>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click the <b>Monitor</b> tab, and then select a new refresh rate. The monitor will take a moment to adjust. If you want to keep the changes, click
<b>Apply</b>. If you don't apply the changes within fifteen seconds, the refresh rate will revert back to your original setting.</p>
<p>For more information about this refer to
<b><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/52f7448b-d524-44e4-b43d-15b5a29685371033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Correct monitor flicker (refresh rate)</a></b>;<b>
</b>and for information about choosing the best refresh rate for your monitor, see<b>
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/617624ee-08f3-4aff-9713-5e84a9674a261033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Getting the best display on your monitor</a>.</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>We hope that you are able to find a solution in one of these steps, please let us know how it goes. If you have any further questions don’t hesitate to ask.</p>

            <p>My clean install was over and done in 22 minutes. After that I had to install drivers, because my computer's hardware is OEM and 7 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what really took a long time was Windows Update. That took about 2 hours, all told.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other people may disagree, but I sat in front of my monitor for that whole friggin' time, because if anything went wrong or there were any error messages, I wanted to be able to write down the details so I could search the web for answers. Fortunately for
 me, there were no problems.</p>

    <title>Missing soapisap.dll after cleaning out browser hijacking virus. Where - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing soapisap.dll after cleaning out browser hijacking virus. Where to download new DLL &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is a brand new dell m6700 running Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; Somehow it got infected with a browser hijacking virus from a company called Conduit Software.&nbsp; The uninstall function would not work and when I tried to uninstall I would get a message
 that I need to be an Administrator. I am the Administrator and tried everything. After trying many different programs I was able to rid my laptop of this virus but doing so some of ml dll's are missing. I need to know where I can download what I need. My most
 urgent requirement is the soapisap.dll&nbsp; which I need in order to install Citadon client. The recovery disk from dell is useless and will not do a repair. I really do not want to reload windows since I have a bunch of licensed engineering software, PLC Software,
 solid&nbsp;edge plus a mix of programing software&nbsp;on this machine so it would be a nightmare to have to reload windows.&nbsp; If anyone can help please let me know.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            Hello Mark,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forums. We will be happy to assist you.</div>
<div><br />
What I understand from the description above that your computer was infected by virus and after cleaning the virus, soapisap.dll file is missing from the computer.</div>
<div><br />
It might be due to corruption caused by virus in computer system files or registry.</div>
<div><br />
We will try to follow the steps given for fixing the issue:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1: Run system File Checker Tool</strong><br />
Here is the link for running System File Checker tool:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: <em>System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the
 file from the cache folder (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a
 member of the Administrators group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the sfc /scannow, the sfc /scanonce, or the sfc /scanboot commands to repair its contents.</em></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2: Perform Clean Boot and check.<br />
</strong>If there is confliction with any application, it will let us know that.<br />
Here is the link for performing clean boot:<br />

<strong>Note:</strong> <em>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</em></div>

<p>Windows 7 has the .NET Framework 3.5 and earlier (2.0) redistributables already installed however some application installers are looking for very specific .NET 2.0 files and or registry entires that may not be in the ?Windows 7 versaion of .NET 3.5 (which
 included .NET 2.0) which can cause error messages:</p>
<p>Example:<br />
TurboTax 2009 can fail to install because it thinks the .NET Framework is not installed, even when it is<br />

<p>How to check to see if .NET Framework is enabled:<br />
Click Start and in the search enter (without the quotes): "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
Next click on the + sign next to the "Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1" list of features.<br />
With "Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1" expanded place a check mark in both options.<br />
Exit the "Feature" window and reboot your PC.</p>
