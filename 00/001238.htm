            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Do you experience the same issue when you use the default SMS app? Bear in mind that HTC Sense takes up a lot of resources and thus slows down the device. I prefer to disable HTC sense on my devices; they are much faster.</div>

    <title>How to scale horizontal &#38; vertical axes equally in an Excel Chart. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to scale horizontal &#38; vertical axes equally in an Excel Chart.</h2>
                    <p>I want to graph the catenary function in Excel, y=a*sinh(x/a).<span>&nbsp; </span>Where a is a constant.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The X axis is in feet and the y axis is in feet.<span>&nbsp; </span>They should be scaled equally.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, the help section on graphs indicates that I can only label the X axis as date or text and I can’t scale it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That’s no good.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since this is a geometric issue, both axes are in feet and should be scaled equally.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, a line from (0,0) to (1,1) should display at a 45 degree angle.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is there a way to do this?</p>

<p>Hi Berry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We could also use Chart Tool to edit Axis Options to modify the value of Horizontal Axis or Vertical Axis in Excel to see if it can meet your requirement as shown in the following figure.</p>

<h3> kermit---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            OVI Map Routes &#40;not Places&#41; do not auto correct due to detours</h2>
                    
<p>OK I've got latest OVI Maps (I think) installed on my 5800 - according to OVI Suite - &amp; recently I needed to use the navigation to get somewhere so used OVI Maps (online via PC) to create a 'Route' (not a 'Place') - This I synched with my phone favorites
 &amp; everything was just fine&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT when I started the journey, I had to make a small detour (early in the route) because of a car accident in the street 'maps' told me to go down... since I knew THAT part of the route I went down another street instead to bypass it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway - MAPS started to insist that I had to do a U-Turn to go BACK to where I detoured &amp; it wouldn't auto-correct even after travelling for ~ 3 miles off the 'route' that I had programmed in.So I had to switch off 'Maps'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course when I REALLY needed the navigation (near the end of the journey) I had to pull over &amp; then restart Maps to select the 'Place' I needed to go to (not the 'Route' - I tried that &amp; it once again it seemed to insist I do a U-Turn) so I could actually
 find the place</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[I didn't originally use favorite 'Place' for navigation because the calculated route shown seemed 'over complicated' for what I needed to do (it had a LOT of twists and turns - I prefer 'straight runs')]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway - back to the query.....</p>
<p>1) Why didn't 'maps' autocorrect when it discovered I made a detour ?</p>
<p>2) Why did it keep insisting I do u-turns BACK ?</p>
<p>3) How could I 'plan new route' based on current position ?</p>
<p>4) how could I 'skip that part of the 'route' &amp; recalculate ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(IIRC I did tried the 'Diff route' option while navigating but it didn't seem to work it still wanted me to do U-turns)</p>

<p>It didn't correct because you didn't ask the software to choose your route, you asked it to follow a pre-set route.</p>

    <title>QAT macro icons produce&#58; &#34;Sorry, Excel can&#39;t open two - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william martz  say:</h3>
<h2>            QAT macro icons produce&#58; &#34;Sorry, Excel can&#39;t open two workbooks with the same name at the same time.&#34;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I am setting up a new computer and am running into this error message when I click on icons in the Quick Access Toolbar: "Sorry, Excel can't open two workbooks with the same name at the same time." I think I know why.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>In setting Excel up, I exported my customizations from my old computer and imported them into my new. Because I read that Personal.xlsb was stored in a new location, and because I wanted to tweak it a bit, I created a new one and put my macros into it and
 let Excel save it in the location where it wanted. That location is different than on my old computer:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>C:\Users\username_NEW_computer\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Office.Desktop_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.XLSB.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>In Excel Options/Quick Access Toolbar/Customize the Quick Access Toolbar I see that my macros come from the new Personal.xlsb; however, the icons for my macros in the list on the right side of that dialog box point to the old Personal.xlsb:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>C:\Users\ username_OLD_computer\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.xlsb.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>When I click on one of the icons on the QAT for one of my macros, that is when I get the error message. So it looks like I have to change the pointer for all my macro icons. The brute force method is to delete each of those icons and then re-add the macros
 from the left side of the customization dialog box.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>My two questions are: one, am I correct in my analysis of the cause of the problem, and two, is there a simpler way, maybe via a macro, to change the pointers for my current macro icons?</p>

<p>Hello Scott,<br />
<br />
There are a few ways on how to search for emails. For us to provide an accurate resolution for the issue that you are experiencing, kindly elaborate the issue by answering the questions listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How are you accessing your emails? Is it through a web browser or an email application?</li><li>If you're using a web browser, which web browser are you using?</li><li>If you're using an email application, which email application are you using?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, here's an <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Search-Mail-and-People-in-Outlook-com-88108edf-028e-4306-b87e-7400bbb40aa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Sorry Paolo, I forgot the Outlook forums applied to more than the application.&nbsp; I'm using the Outlook application as part of Office 365 ProPlus package version 1705.</p>
<p>To elaborate on my question, I'm looking for a way to create a Search Folder which only contains emails which someone has forwarded to me (either automatically or manually). When I right-click on Search Folders on the left panel and click "New Search Folder",
 I don't see this option on the list of predefined types. I also poked around the dialog box which appears when I choose "Create a custom Search Folder", and then the "Criteria..." button. Perhaps I missed it, but I cannot find a way to accomplish my goal.&nbsp;
 Under the "Advanced" tab, I see that one could create a criteria with a filter for emails which have been AUTO forwarded, but not one concerning emails which have been forwarded in general.</p>
<p>I realize that most forwarded emails contain the string "fwd:" in the subject line, but I am hoping for a more thorough way to find forwarded emails than searching the subject line for that string because I know that the "fwd:" string can be deleted while
 composing an email forward.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I hope my question is clear.</p>

            Normally you could get the latest version of Internet Explorer by updating your Windows.

<h2>            International Calls</h2>
                    <p>I need to make international phone calls to Latin America countries, only a couple at this time, but in the near future for at least 5-6 in total. I'm trying to subscribe to a plan but not sure if I have to to do it by country (which elevates my cost) or
 what do I have a better choice. Also, when trying to reach the subscription screen it appears the Skype Credit window as a choice, is that the regular credit of the app or is totally different choice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll appreciate your support.</p>

<p>Hi, Luis</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not have a calling plan that covers all countries in the Latin America. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The best choice you can take&nbsp;if you need to call multiple countries which doesn't have a calling plan that covers them all is to purchase Skype Credits. Skype Credits is an effective way to make calls

<p>
</p><p>I do not have my phone number attached to the account, and because I had it for a long time the other email I used i already threw away, so there is no other way to identify myself other than the questionnaire to fill out- which did not pass evry single
 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any customer service I can contact? Any real person I can talk to regarding my issue?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get Publisher 2013 to output a PDF with crop marks and bleed</h2>
                    Hi all
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Testing out Publisher 2013 and I can't seem to get it to output a PDF with crop marks and bleed. I create an A4 (297x210mm) document, add something to the page and then go to File&gt;Save As, choose PDF as the "Save as type:". I press the Options button,
 then Print Options and choose a Custom paper size 5cm larger all round and tick on "Crop marks" and "Allow bleeds". It says "Publisher cannot save the file", with no further explanation. I have tried saving teh file locally and on the server, no change. If
 I untick crop marks it works.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I do the same in Publisher 2010 I get a PDF out with crop marks and bleeds. Not sure what I'm doing wrong - I have tried selecting a much bigger paper size but that doesn't make any difference. Can anyone help. I want to "Save As" a PDF rather than
 print.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks</div>

            No-one got any ideas on this one?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I found that I can work around the problem by&nbsp;not ticking the 'Crop Marks' checkbox. Just leaving 'Allow Bleeds' ticked and adding 3mm (1⁄8”) to the paper size works. This creates a PDF 3mm larger than your trimmed size, the outer 3mm of which will be
 trimmed off as bleed.</div>

            Thanks for your reply Marcus. I have CutePDF installed but whenever you print to PDF (rather than 'Save As') you have to print colours as Composite RGB and I need to be able to maintain CMYK and spot colours. Also, you don't get the option (as far as I
 can see) to add crop marks if you print.

            <blockquote>Hi all
<div><br />
<div>Testing out Publisher 2013 and I can't seem to get it to output a PDF with crop marks and bleed. I create an A4 (297x210mm) document, add something to the page and then go to File&gt;Save As, choose PDF as the "Save as type:". I press the Options button,
 then Print Options and choose a Custom paper size 5cm larger all round and tick on "Crop marks" and "Allow bleeds". It says "Publisher cannot save the file", with no further explanation. I have tried saving teh file locally and on the server, no change. If
 I untick crop marks it works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I do the same in Publisher 2010 I get a PDF out with crop marks and bleeds. Not sure what I'm doing wrong - I have tried selecting a much bigger paper size but that doesn't make any difference. Can anyone help. I want to "Save As" a PDF rather than
 print.</div>
<div><br />
<div>thanks</div>

I had no problem producing a pdf using your test in either Publisher 2010 or 2013. Perhaps you have a corrupt or oversized picture? I would try compressing all images and/or removing all images and testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><font>Here are two threads that discuss various reasons why you cannot save as a pdf.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It sounds like you are just testing out Pub 2013 and may have the option to keep using Pub 2010. If that is the case I would suggest you consider staying with Pub 2010. Besides a number of bugs in Pub 2013, MS has removed the s<font>eperations
 tab under Advanced Printer Output&nbsp;from Pub 2013, along with the ability to produce Composite CMYK.

            Wow, I&nbsp;never would have thought of that!&nbsp;If you have CutePDF (or PDFCreator) as your currently selected printer when you save as .pdf or export for commercial printing&nbsp;this bug also occurs.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't know why publisher would be checking&nbsp;what crappy&nbsp;printer
 I have selected when I am exporting a&nbsp;document&nbsp;for commercial printing.&nbsp; I've been having this problem intermittently with pub '13 for some time with both save as and export for commercial printing with crop marks checked, now I know why, thanks so much!&nbsp;

<h2>            Report Formula - datediff weekdays</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;=(DateDiff("d",[datesubmitted],[datecompleted])) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only want this to calculate the actual difference between&nbsp;weekdays, I am not concerned with working days ie public holidays.&nbsp; I have tried using "w" and "ww" and these only count the number of weeks.&nbsp; Is it possible to only count only the weekdays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like this should be a simple request, however I have just about been on every forum and help site and there does not seem to be such a simple solution!&nbsp; Any assistance would be much appreciated.</p>

            Things can be as simple as possible, but no more so.&nbsp; Take a look at the file Workdays.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912%21169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
This includes a number of functions for returning the difference in 'working days' between two dates, giving the option of allowing for public holidays or not.&nbsp; You'll probably want the WorkDaysDiff_SingleCountry function<br />
<br />
Another simple way is to create an auxiliary calendar table of working days.&nbsp; You'll find the means of doing so in Calendar.zip in the same SkyDrive folder.&nbsp; It's then just a case of counting the days between the two dates, which you can do by calling the DCount
 function.<br />

            Ken's function will do the job, but I just wanted to deal with your complaint. While Excel does have a built in NetWorkDays function, Access doesn't. What you need to remember is that Access is much more of a development platform than any other Office
 app. So, there are numerous common functions and processes that there are no built in functions or commands for. But one can easily add those functions. I am a bit surprised that you were unable to find a NetWorkDays function as there are numerous examples
 of them on the Web.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>My point is to not expect Access to do everything for you. Some things need to be done by yourself or with the help of many others who have gone before you and already created these functions.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>There is nothing stopping you from using Excel functions in Access.&nbsp; Here is an example for calling the Excel NetWorkDays function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public Function ExcelNetWorkDays(dFirstDate As Date, dSecondDate As Date)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo Err_Proc</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oApp.Quit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oApp = Nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function</p>
<p>Err_Proc:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Err.Number = 429 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "MS Excel not found...aborting!", vbInformation, "Error"<br />

<h2>            adding logo to signature in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Getting extremely frustrated. My signature in outlook.com was perfectly fine until a few days ago when I had to change my password because of an infiltration into my address book. Now the signature is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem and frustration is that now I cannot get the app to allow the logos to be added to the signature. I keep getting the message that the signature is too long. The logos are taken from active web pages, so that is not the problem. I've saved the
 logos on my OneDrive, but don't know how to insert them from there. I've seen references to right clicking and selecting "view original," but that option is not present when I right click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I supposed to do?</p>

            <p>To create a personal e-mail signature with image in your account, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Sign in to your account at <a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.com</a><br />
2. In the upper-right corner of your account, click&nbsp;the Gear icon&nbsp;and then click “More mail settings.”<br />
3. Under “Customize your mail,” click “Message font and signature.”<br />
4. Ensure that “Rich text” is selected on the dropdown menu displayed beside the “Insert Emoticon” icon.<br />
5. Open a new browser, then go to the website where the image that you’d like to include in your e-mail signature is located.<br />
6. Right click the image then "Copy."<br />
7. Go back to the browser where you've opened your account and paste the image in the “Personal e-mail signature” box by pressing "Ctrl" and "v." Create your e-mail signature.<br />
8. Click “Save.”</p>
<p><em><strong>FYI: </strong></em>You can only add an image/ picture in your e-mail signature that’s Web based (picture that is available in existing websites or stored in an online storage). This is the reason why on step 5, I’ve asked you to open a new browser
 where the image is located.</p>

                    How does one get the Favourites address while trying to write or forward any mail in the To/Cc/Bcc. Earlier in the hot mail there used to be 3 choices. All, frequent and Favourites. Now you can get only 2. All &amp; frequent. The choice of Favourites seem
 to have disappeared in the Outlook format

<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think for the purposes of calculation the 15 minutes isn't relevant, you just want to average (say) 1/1/2011, 2/1/2011 etc. Here i've assumed the date the reading was taken is in col A and the temp in column B</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put this in a cell and it does 1/1/2011. Drag dowm so you have 365 rows and it does every day of the year</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IFERROR(AVERAGEIF(A:A,DATE(2011,1,1)+ROW(A1)-1,B:B),"")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT....If the date cell has a time in the taht won't work so what you could do is create a helper column that is just the date using</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INT(A1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>drag down and use this helper column as the date column</p>

            Unfortunately, the forum software removed your address so I will guess as what you mean:
<br />You need to retrieve an old outlook.com account but forget the email address? 
<br />
<br />If that is correct,  unfortunately, unless you have the address written down somewhere or once sent yourself a message from that account and still have old mail, you wont be able to recover it. 
<br />
<br />Also note, If you don't log in at least once a year, the account is inactive and the only way to recover it is if you have the password - resetting the password wont work.  If you haven't accessed the account in 5 years it will be deleted.

    <title>Randbetween in Conditional Rule&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bevintx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Randbetween in Conditional Rule&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am just learning Excel and I am now studying Conditional Formatting in Excel for Mac 2011.&nbsp; Based on my example below, I think that there is something that I'm not understanding about Conditional Formatting.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Randbetween(1,2) is supposed to return an integer between 1 and 2.&nbsp; It works correctly when I use it in cells.&nbsp; However, when I use that same formula in Conditional Formatting, the cell is not formatted correctly.&nbsp; For example, I ...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) Selected a cell</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) Added a Conditional Formatting rule for each possible value returned by randbetween(1,2):</p>
<p>a) Rule for =1</p>
<p>--- Style: Classic</p>
<p>--- Use a formula to determine which cells to format</p>
<p>--- =randbetween(1,2)=1</p>
<p>--- Format with: light red fill with dark red text</p>
<p>b) Rule for =2</p>
<p>--- Style: Classic</p>
<p>--- Use a formula to determine which cells to format</p>
<p>--- =randbetween(1,2)=2</p>
<p>--- Format with: yellow fill with dark dark yellow text</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3) Repeatedly clicked the cells surrounding the conditionally formatted cell, which updated it numerous times.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since the above randbetween calls can only generate a 1 or 2, then I thought that the cell should always be either light red or yellow; however, the cell fill sometimes ends up as white.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>* Why is the cell's fill color sometimes white?</p>
<p>* Why does the cell's fill color change when I click onto or away from one of that cell's surrounding eight (8) cells, all of which do not contain any formulas?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am running Excel for Mac 14.3.4 (130416) on a MBP with OS X version 10.8.3.</p>

            Your formula is referring to the active cell. That's why clicking around causes the cell with the condition to change. So, The conditional formula is working correctly, but the condition refers to the active cell, NOT the cell with the conditional formula.
 It is white, because the active cell is not 1 or 2.<br />

            Bob,
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I "think" that I understand what you are saying (at least a glimmer of it), but I'm still puzzled for the following reasons:
<div>
<ul>
<li>The formula does not place a value in any cell, at least no value shows up in any of them, including the cell that has the conditional formatting. &nbsp;If the active cell has to contain 1 or 2 for the condition to work, why does any color show up in the conditionally
 formatted cell?</li><li>If none of the surrounding cells contain a 1 or 2, then why does clicking them often make the conditionally formatted the cell colored? &nbsp;That is, the conditionally formatted cell is not always white, just sometimes.</li><li>If I continuously click on just the conditionally formatted cell, then it is still sometimes white; it doesn't just occur when clicking the surrounding cells.</li><li>If I click outside the surrounding eight (8) cells, then the color changes very seldom. &nbsp;Does this have something to do with when/how things are being recalculated (which I don't understand at all)?</li></ul>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I've been thinking about this some more. &nbsp;Since I call randbetween(1,2) in both rules, doesn't it actually run twice? &nbsp;That is, this acts like:
<div>if function() == x, then ...</div>
<div>if function() == y, then ...</div>
<div>when I actually need:</div>
<div>result = function()</div>
<div>if result == x, then</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>else</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>It would get even worse when using more colors than two (2). &nbsp;So, for my purposes, I think it would be best to place the randbetween(1,2) function call in the cell and then conditionally format the cell based on the value in that cell, as both rules would
 apply to the same value. &nbsp;In this case, I would need to change the text color to the same color as the fill color, to hide the function's result.
<div><br />
<div>I would still like to understand what was happening with randbetween(1,2) in the rules, as it would give me a greater insight into how Excel works.&nbsp;</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            It is always better to use a specific value or a relationship for the conditional format. The conditioin formula usually looks something like: =A1=1.<br />
Yes the randbetween function is volatile. that is, it gets recalcualted on every calculation. I agree that it is probably being called twice,<br />

<h2>            Will Microsoft be joining Movies Anywhere anytime soon&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is especially important, since Microsoft did work with Disney Anywhwere, which is going away soon. Also, since Microsoft is discontinuing Windows Mobile, the customers that purchased movies from the Microsoft Store have no way to watch these movies
 on their new Android or iPhone devices.&nbsp;</p>

            I agree, this is important if Microsoft wants to keep Windows 10 relevant.&nbsp; It was working well as a unified media platform for me, but they killed off Windows mobile, so I just went to an android phone for the first time since I got rid of my Droid X2
 (circa 2012).&nbsp; They also just scrapped their music sales, and if they aren't going to participate in Movies Anywhere other than to have a VUDU app, their prospects are awfully dismal as a media platform.

            Disney movies anywhere became Movies Anywhere. &nbsp;Microsoft used to be a part of that, but shortly before the rebranding and adding of movie studios Disney Movies Anywhere dropped support of Microsoft Movies &amp; TV. &nbsp; I'm not sure who the holdout is for this,
 but it would be nice if MS supported this since a ton of movie studios joined when it was rebranded Movies Anywhere.

            I'd guess that Microsoft will discontinue "Movies &amp; TV" soon, just as they did with Groove. I wouldn't' recommend buying from the Movies &amp; TV app, unless you want a movie that can't be watched anywhere. The fact that they are no longer a partner with Disney
 is a step back, and Groove, Windows Mobile, and Microsoft Health all took step backs just before they were discontinued.&nbsp;

<p>while true they did discontinue those services, &nbsp;Movies &amp; TV is a selling point for their new Xbox One X hardware, its one of the few services that do 4k 10-bit HDR. &nbsp;Vudu has said for a while they would offer 10-bit HDR in addition to dolby vision, but
 so far they only have dolby vision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>it would be a nightmare if they did discontinue the service, its not as easy as switching a music service like they are doing from Groove to Spotify. &nbsp;Vudu you also can't download your content for offline viewing to my knowledge.</p>

<p>The movie service is a better sustaining conent than music. My opinion... since Microsoft has left this feature I have discontinued purchasing from Movies &amp; TV.</p>
<p>Plus video files are much larger than music right... &nbsp;takes up more space...</p>
<p>Think...</p>
<p>If they discontinue, downloading many movies would suck... in the hundreds... I am sure there is a percent in the thousand movie library.</p>

</p><p>I'd have to agree in some respects, but i think their bigger push for cloud and services is really important in the corporate sector.&nbsp; But i do agree if you forget about the consumer market (thankfully they still have xbox) you are forgetting a lot of the
 younger audiences who will soon be in the professional workforce and making decisions.&nbsp; Having that personal impression makes a difference not only in the consumer market, but in the future the corporate market.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish they would make more of a statement about Movies &amp; TV as a service.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apple has started upgrading those who bought HD movies for UHD for free.&nbsp; &nbsp;Right now i can't even rebuy an HD movie i purchased from Microsoft in UHD.&nbsp; &nbsp;They should at the least
 have a small upgrade fee if not for free like Apple.&nbsp; Also to update my earlier post, this week VUDU finally pushed out HDR10 support which Microsoft tweeted about.&nbsp; &nbsp;I really hope they upgrade and make their own service better, right now you still can't download
 your movies and TV from Vudu which is a big drawback and differentiator Microsoft has with Their Movies &amp; TV service.</p>

            Microsoft also is free uhd upgrade if you have Xbox s or Xbox x. I hope they join movie anywhere soon. I hate being discriminate by other but consumer is not complain when it relate to mobile. Remember the 90s all the anti monopoly law suit. When can company
 can pick a choose what customer to provide services&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to change a skype number?&nbsp; I have purchased a US number a few months ago and, although I haven't yet dialed out or shared it with anyone, I receive an inordinate amount of cold calls and fake IRS bots.&nbsp; This has reached an absurd intolerable
 level of several spam calls per day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still interested in owning a skype number, but not this damaged one I was given.&nbsp; I have tried to ask this directly to skype, however, the only option offered was to post this as a question in the discussion board (tip top customer service, very pleased).</p>
<p>
