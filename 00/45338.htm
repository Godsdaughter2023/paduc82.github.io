<h2>            Customer service</h2>
                    I just contacted customer service regarding the automatic upgrade to my system from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;I told him that Windows 10 removed my antivirus software so I performed a factory restore on my laptop. &nbsp;I told him my laptop now does not have
 an operating system because Windows 10 removed Windows 7. He told me I need to take my computer to a local technician to pay to have it fixed, even though Microsoft performed the update without my consent. &nbsp;When I asked for a phone number to contact Microsoft
 about this issue, he hung up on me. Bottom line...Microsoft and their customer service sucks.&nbsp;

    <title>Unable to recover Skype account using the Auto submit form - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to recover Skype account using the Auto submit form</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to recover my skype account using the auto recovery form. The issue is that I have changed my phone number but did not change it on my hotmail or skype account otherwise I could have used the phone option to get a code and reset my password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeatedly when I fill out the auto recovery form of microsoft, it's sending me the message shown below and I'm just not able to get into my skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><em>We recently received a request to recover your Microsoft account XXXXXXX</em></span><em>@hotmail.com<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">.
 Unfortunately, our automated system has determined that the information you provided was not sufficient for us to validate your account ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em><span><em>Microsoft takes the security and privacy of our customers
 very seriously, and our commitment to protecting your personal information requires that we take the utmost care in ensuring that you are the account owner.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can someone advise what can be done in such a case to recover the Skype account? I tried looking for a number on which I can call Skype support and speak to a person to recover my account but I haven't found any skype
 support numbers online? Please help.</span></p>

</p><p>Currently, Skype does not offer support through phone. Skype is offering support for free through live chat and here in the Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to account recovery, Microsoft takes account very seriously. I understand that it might be frustrating to fill&nbsp;out the form multiple times and still cannot recover the account, but please be reminded that such form is established in the interest
 of data and account security. The only way we can regain access to the account is to pass the recovery and verification process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide the exact error message you are getting when you try to log in? Also, please try to access this
<strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Accounts Diagnostics link</a></strong> and follow these steps to recover your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>After opening the link, enter your Skype name/Microsoft account on the field and click Continue.&nbsp;</li><li>You'll be directed to another page, choose your account and click Reset password.&nbsp;</li><li>Another page will be opened, choose I forgot my password on the reasons for password reset then click Next.&nbsp;</li><li>Enter the captcha code and then click Next.&nbsp;</li><li>You will be directed to your account's security info, choose one and then proceed with resetting your password.&nbsp;</li></ul>

            Hi Edward,<br />
<p>
</p><p>The boot issue that you are experiencing can occur due to several reasons such as a bad sector on your hard disk, corrupted system files, etc. Since you are unable to boot your computer, we recommend that you perform a startup repair on your computer. To
 do so, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start your system.</li><li>After your computer shows its original equipment manufacturer's logo, perform a hard shut down by pressing and holding the power button until your computer shuts down.</li><li>Repeat steps 1 and 2.</li><li>Start your system again. This time, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once the process is done, check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to reach out to us if you need further assistance with your concern.</p>

            Visa Gift Cards act just like a Credit Card so they will work.&nbsp; When you use them in a store, they are just considered credit when you cash out.&nbsp; So they will act just as needed to do what you want.&nbsp;

<h2>            Lost serial number sticker, shop refuses to fix damaged controller</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p><p>So a year and 2 months ago i bought a xbox 360 controller to play fifa and sadly like 3 months ago the cable of the controller was acting weird, constantly disconnecting and so on. I decided to contact with the store finally like a month ago and today I've received a photo with my controller and lack of the sticker that was necessary for them and they told me that the product won't be fix due to lack of this sticker with serial number. I wonder if the manufacturer haven't thought about it - while using the controller often hands get sweaty and simply the sticker fell off and it couldn't stick back. Also letters were so blurred that the number was literally impossible to read. I am aware that I should have thought about it but is there any way to fix it and get my controller fixed? I live in Poland, on the store I can see THE ONLY order I have ever taken in this store and there is my real name, how much money I've paid but store is like "whatever" and will not fix the produc

<h3> leedawes  say:</h3>
<h2>            printui not working win 7 32bit</h2>
                    <p>so a while ago i brought a new wireless printer to replace the shared on that was on my main pc.</p>
<p>i uninstalled the drivers for the old one but something went wrong as when i click 'add new printer i get an error 'windows can't open add printer operation could not be completed error 0x000000c1'</p>
<p>this is driving me crazy.</p>
<p>ive done everything suggested by epson to completely remove the old drivers, but still the problem persists.</p>
<p>i even used the install cd for the new printer (also an epson) to install it which i thought it had done only to find that its only the scanner thats active, the printer side doesnt exist even though is all installed ok. i can scan from the printer so its
 not a connection issue. i have tried using the printui.exe and dll from another computer to see if replacing my files did anything but still nothing.</p>
<p>some one please help</p>

                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>Forced to upgrade to Skype 8 today and of course one of the many issues is that iTunes is not paused during calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find a setting to change this? Where is this function?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Skype 7, iTunes would pause when a Skype call was picked up and then resume playing once the call was ended. Why is this no longer working?</p>
<p>

    <title>Trackpad scroll doesn&#39;t work in Outlook Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scbunker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trackpad scroll doesn&#39;t work in Outlook Calendar</h2>
                    <p>On my Surface Pro 4, two-finger trackpad scroll will not work on the Outlook 2016 calendar. The scroll bar on the right will move, but the calendar doesn't budge. Scroll works in other areas of Outlook and on all other apps. Calendar will scroll when dragging
 on screen, when clicking the scroll bar, and when using a mouse wheel. This is quite annoying. I have found this problem mentioned in other places on the web, but with no solutions. One person suggested that iCloud sync may be the issue, but I don't have iCloud
 sync installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried starting in Safe Mode and creating a new Profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

                    Yesterday this problem with my PC started happening. So after a couple of hours of having my PC on my screens just turn black( i have 2 screens so its not the cable) but the pc is still on and working, because i can still talk and hear my friends through
 Skype although the screens are black. I run windows 10 and have set everything to never when it comes to putting my pc in sleep mode etc.

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to remove any non essential USB devices, projector etc. from the computer and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the post below on how to fix the black screen</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/black-screen-after-upgrading-to-windows-10/cf3b4559-67d8-40e0-9cf2-ebf4528e1e78">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/black-screen-after-upgrading-to-windows-10/cf3b4559-67d8-40e0-9cf2-ebf4528e1e78</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also let's check if the issue is with the power settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Method 1: Run the Power Troubleshooter
</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “<strong><em>Power</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It could be a compatibility issue with the new
<strong>Fast Startup component</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Try the below steps and check:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open
<strong>Control Panel</strong> / <strong>Power&nbsp;Options</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the Left side menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<strong>Change settings&nbsp;that are currently unavailable</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Scroll down to the
<strong>Shutdown&nbsp;settings</strong> section. </span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span>Remove</span></strong><span> the check mark from the
<strong>Turn&nbsp;on Fast Startup</strong> option. </span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the
<strong>Save Changes</strong>&nbsp;Button.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Shut Down</span></strong><span> the computer, wait a couple of minutes
 and then use the <strong>Power Button</strong> to start the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to restore default settings of power plan and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on the
<strong>Power Options</strong> icon.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<strong>Change advanced power settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the option “<strong>Restore default settings for this plan</strong>”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us posted if you face any issues on Windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Photo Gallery.  How do I change the settings in Windows Photo Gallery to automatically open the image without going to the index first&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Windows Photo Gallery.&nbsp; How do I change the settings in Windows Photo Gallery to automatically open the image without going to the index first?</p>
<p>Further Information:&nbsp; There are are 2 computers that I use on the first one Windows Photo Gallery will open the image and will allow me to use the Left and Right buttons to scroll through the rest of the photos in the folder, that is what I want it to do.</p>
<p>On the 2nd computer when I open an image it will open Windows Photo Gallery in an index with the thumbnails of the folder being displayed.&nbsp; How can I change it so it opens the same as the first computer?</p>
<p>I have done the following on both computers; Right Click on image and select Open With... --&gt; Choose Default Program --&gt; Browse --&gt; Program Files, Windows Photo Gallery but it will still open differently on the 2nd computer.</p>
<p>Both computers are using Windows Vista, 32-bit.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            You have to create those then.
<br />If you are uncomfortable doing this then I would recommend doing a repair upgrade.

    <title>FIFA 14 Origin Account Error message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helmutjr14  say:</h3>
<h2>            FIFA 14 Origin Account Error message</h2>
                    
<p>I have an active XBOX Gold pass. &nbsp;I am connected to the internet. &nbsp;I can sign in but I cannot connect to the EA Servers directly or try to connect through playing seasons. &nbsp;I get the following error message:</p>
<p>You will not be able to use the online features in FIFA 14 unless you create an Origin Account (EA). Go to any online area of the title to try again.</p>
<p>I don't know where to go to fix this. &nbsp;I go to Customize tab to online settings and click on Origin Account, it tries to log in to EA Servers and can't and brings up this same message.</p>
<p>HELP PLEASE!!</p>

<p>If power cycling the console doesn't fix the issue, reset the password to you origins account. The message is telling you that you need to sign into an origins account, but after you reset and launch the game again it will tell you that your password is
 too weak and prompt you to reset it. Issue has been made aware of by EA</p>

<h2>            windows repair tool</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately a little red icon appears on the task bar which is something like Tweaking-windows repair tool. It does a scan for corrupt files and then says I need to have the latest version. It takes me to a Tweaking.com website.</p>
<p>Is this a Microsoft product and would it be related to that since I have had a win 10 upgrade my PC does not always automatically shut down.</p>

<h2>            DirectX not showing the version and getting SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION error on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:Windows 10 and Direct X</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello all, please check your direct x and see if you have the same issues. It appears that there is no actual direct x installed in the direct x diagnostics. Here are 2 Images of what I see on my system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 is no actual Direct X version the other is no Driver or Video Card Information. Why is this happening in this latest 10 Build I get this other error when enabling 3D Vision too. Really making me want to revert back to Windows 7, at least it works and runs
 right.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you see here lots of messy things for Windows 10. Why is this? Here I updated thinking would have a wonderful, as advertised working OS that would make my Gaming better. Yet with these issues it appears Windows 10 is not Game Ready at all.</p>

            Hi until this is rectified I have re installed windows 7 and do not want Windows 10 on this system again. I have fixed all the issues by reverting back to 7 and direct x runs fine as well as the very same version&nbsp; of nVidia drivers only for windows 7 not
 10.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated on this query. We are sorry to know you had to downgrade to Windows 7 to get your system up and running without displaying any errors.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might have faced the above issue due to the incompatible
<strong>DirectX </strong>product with Windows 10 operating system. Incompatible products and drivers sometimes cause performance issues on the PC resulting the drivers to crash and display Blue screen errors.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to install and upgrade to Windows 10 by downloading the
<strong>ISO file</strong> from </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Media Creation Tool</span></strong></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After upgrading to Windows 10, download and install the latest and most compatible
<strong>DirectX</strong> application on your PC from the manufacturer’s website and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Below is a link where you can download the latest version of
<strong>DirectX </strong>product.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 - yellow screen never goes away on startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 - yellow screen never goes away on startup</h2>
                    I have an HP notebook on which I recently upgraded to Windows 10. Everything ran fine for about a week. Four days ago I started the notebook, got the blue screen which turned into the password prompt, then blue again for a few moments, then the screen
 turned yellow.&nbsp; It stays yellow with a message which says "Please wait" and the little circle of rotating dots.&nbsp;The machine seems to get stuck here. I have tried rebooting and restarting the machine, but to no avail. I even left it up "waiting" to see how
 long this might take, but after 24 hours plus shut it down again. Virus scan is automatic, up to date,&nbsp;and there were no issues as far as I know. The machine has not been damaged in any way.&nbsp;This is my wife's notebook and needless to say she is not happy.
 Help !!!

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker- 64-bit Vista</h2>
                    I used a Dazzle DVC100 to copy from VHS to my computer's hard drive &amp; from there i imported the TS/AVI/IFO/BUP files to Windows Movie Maker. Suddenly Movie Maker is not able to import these files as they aren't compatible. I tried to convert to wmv (media
 player) &amp; still no luck. Was there an update in the last 3 months that may have caused this. ANy suggestions as to a solution? I would greatly appreciate any help:)

<p><span><span>You may want to make sure that the files have not been corrupted during the rip from VHS and then transferring to the computer. Can you try
 to load the files in another computer to determine if it is the file itself or if it is the computer that is not recognizing the file? Also, make sure that the programs you are using to rip video are completely compatible with Vista 64bit by visiting the manufacturer’s
 website to check their support for the product.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If this process has worked for you before you can always try to use the system restore feature to take your computer back to a point before
 the issue occurred. I have included the instruction below for system restore.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>The System Restore tool</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Other troubleshooting methods, such as using the System File Checker tool, may not resolve the issue. If they do not resolve
 the issue, and the issue that you are experiencing started occurring recently, you can use the System Restore tool. By using this tool, you can restore the computer to an earlier point in time.
<br />
<br />
Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in
 which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.
<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>, type
<strong>system restore</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click
<strong>System Restore</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>System Restore</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Finish</strong>.<br />
<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.
</span></span></p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm making a video with Windows Movie Maker and I added some clips to it. I trimmed some of them but the problem is, when I trim them, the sound disappears. What should I do to fix this problem?</p>

remove the unwanted portion from the timeline.<br />

            Hi, Geir
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />First you need to open the Disk Management tool.
<br />
<br />Press Windows + R on the keyboard to start the Run dialog box. Type "diskmgmt.msc" and press Enter.
<br />
<br />Although the task we are going to carry out is very simple and easy to carry out, there is a possibility that you will do erroneous tasks with this tool, something that can make you have a bad time. Check each step carefully. Make sure you are selecting the correct disk, or else you may lose a large amount of data.
<br />
<br />Next, in Disk Management, scroll down through the list of disks in the lower pane. These discs will be labeled "Disc 1". Windows assigns a number to all hard disks, solid state disks, USB drives and card readers, so do not be surprised if you have to scroll down a bit.
<br />
<br />There are some data here. First, the disk is marked as "Unknown" and "Not initialized" on the left. Second, the size of the installed unit is observed, and the unit is marked as "Not assigned", which means that none of the spaces on the hard disk have been formatted or assigned to a partition.
<br />
<br />Right click on the name of the disk and select "Initialize Disk" from the context menu of the right button.
<br />
<br />In the first step of the initialization process, you are asked to choose if you want to use a Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID partition table (GPT) partition style for the disc. In summary, unless there is a compelling reason to use MBR, using GPT is newer, more efficient, and offers more robust protection against boot record corruption.
<br />
<br />Click on "Accept" and you will return to the main Disk Management window. There you will find that your disc now has the label "Basic" and "On screen" on the left, but the content is still "Not assigned". Right click on the striped box of the unassigned disk. Select "New Simple Volume".
<br />
<br />This will start the New Simple Volume Wizard to guide you through the disk configuration process. In the first step, select the amount of space you want to include in the volume. By default, the number is the total amount of disk space available, unless you are thinking of reserving a space for additional partitions, there is no reason to change this. Click on "Next".
<br />
<br />In the second step, assign a unit letter. The default value is probably fine.
<br />
<br />Finally, format the volume. If you are using the volume for routine tasks (storing photos, video games, etc.) there is no real need to deviate from the default NTFS file system. Give the volume a name, click "Next" and wait for the process format to finish.
<br />
<br />When the process is complete, you will see your new disk assigned, formatted and ready to start being used in the Disk Management list
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Hi Geir 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Attach this drive in another computer and verify whether the drive is working or not. Also try putting in different USB ports. 
<br />
<br />Assuming that there is no hardware problem with your drive - 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Click the topmost entry i.e. your device &gt; Click Action in Menu &gt; Click Scan for hardware changes
<br />Now you should be able to see your USB drive
<br />
<br />2, Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Disk Drive &gt; Locate the Drive &gt; Right click on this &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Now it should be detected
<br />
<br />3. Whether the Drive is assigned a Drive Letter or not
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Click Disk Management &gt; If you see your Drive is listed there but there is no Drive Letter &gt; Right Click it &gt; Click Change Drive Letter and Paths &gt; Add &gt; Click Assign the following drive Letter &gt; Click in the Drive Letter List Box &gt; Choose an appropriate Drive Letter &gt; OK &gt; OK
<br />
<br />4. Fix USB Root Hub
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers &gt; Right-click USB Root Hub option and click Properties &gt; Go to Power Management tab and uncheck the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power. Click OK. &gt; If you have more than one USB Root Hub, repeat this step for all
<br />
<br />5. Update / Reinstall Generic USB Hub
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers &gt; Right click on USB Hub &gt; Select Update Driver Software &gt; Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Click on Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer &gt; From the list, select Generic USB Hub &gt; Next and follow onscreen instructions &gt; Reboot your Computer
<br />
<br />If problem not solved, right-click USB Hub of your USB drive and select Uninstall
<br />Reboot your Computer to install driver automatically
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            <p>I have Minecraft on my iPad. When I go to the servers section it tells me I have to enter my Xbox account. So I put it in, then it tells me I can’t access it cause I have to change my privacy and online safety settings. Only problem is i can’t find it.</p>
