<h2>            My Outlook 2013 does not save SENT messages&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have exactly the same problem, i am fighting with my outlook 2013 for 2 days.<br />
My email hosting is godaddy, using imap sync.<br />
First of all i have 2 folders: "sent item" and folder "sent" ,which is already confusing.<br />
Second, when i send an email , it does not appear in none of those folder, but <br />
if i take my windows phone NOKIA, i can see them in "Sent" folder,as well as in<br />
web based godaddy email client interface. But NOTHING in outlook 2013.<br />
I have around 6 email in outlook 2013, and no problem with others. <br />
Its so annoying that i cant access to my sent messages in outlook, they just do not stay there.<br />
I think i tried everything.<br />
Never ever had this problem in Thunderbird, please help<br />

<p>Hi Hoang Bao Phu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the screenshot you provided, the List Name dropdown list doesn't display the list you have in SharePoint site.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on our test, when you insert Site Address, there will be a dropdown list for you to choose which site you want to connect. Then in List Name, you can choose the list as the screenshot shown
 below. We suggest you choose the site address in the dropdown menu first then check whether the list name display normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74b4132f-51aa-4bf5-880c-5410ee3e5e28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74b4132f-51aa-4bf5-880c-5410ee3e5e28" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, you can refer to this thread
</span><a href="https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Connecting-To-Data/Sharepoint-List-Missing-From-List/m-p/21684#M740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Sharepoint List Missing From List</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In addition, s</span><span>ince the problem you have is related to Flow. We suggest you post a thread on
</span><a href="https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/General-Flow-Discussion/bd-p/FlowForum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Flow community</span></a><span> for dedicated support.</span><span>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I delete multiple emails EASILY&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As typical, this product is loaded with holes....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have dozens and dozens of JUNK MAIL, and I want to delete them.&nbsp; but I don't want to delete the two or three important emails that are not junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's virtually impossible with this stupid interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can "sweep" which appears to trash EVERYTHING, or at least not let you "deselect" some of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down, monotonously clicking every individual email, except the UI doesn't have ALL the email in the scrolled portion... Even after deleting all of them, there are still dozens that are on the "Next" screen, and I have to repeat the process again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, targeting that little check box is annoying too.&nbsp; Miss it just a little when try to click, and you just un-selected EVERY EMAIL that you spend 2 minutes selecting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The check box next to "Inbox" does nothing. Mostly.&nbsp; On the 20 % of the time it does something, it only selects to top 3 or 4. Not everything.&nbsp; What good is that???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Real development shops do usability tests.&nbsp; And are not amateurs.&nbsp; (Yes, I've been in this for 30+ years...&nbsp; I know what real usability is about)&nbsp;</p>

<br />It sounds like you are still on the classic interface - it selects the visible messages. There should be a link in the reading pane to select all (and to delete, move etc.)
<br />
<br />In the new "Beta" interface, ticking the option should select all. The reading pane will show how many are ticked (either all or a count if you untick some items) and give you options such as delete, move etc.

    <title>One way to reduce getting so much Junk email in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerrettboehning  say:</h3>
<h2>            One way to reduce getting so much Junk email in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>First, I was reporting junk emails as phishing to Microsoft and then blocking the email address... I don't know what Microsoft does about "phish" but they seem to be ineffective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read another thread from a fellow frustrated hotmail user and all the hooty tooty Microsoft tech replies were like "what's your OS version?" "What version of Outlook do you use?" etc. That hits me as odd, since it sort of "blames the victim"... I don't
 know, I'm using the latest version that the web provides! My hotmail Outlook has different "Settings" than my work Outlook 360 account... What difference does it make anyway? I report the phish, Microsoft does nothing... so, whatever... I'll figure something
 out on my own... so here are a few things I found</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Subscriptions: this is an option in Settings that I found only on my personal account. Its actually a "good" attempt at helping. But Microsoft falls considerably short of a home run. Subscriptions shows a record of various "subscriptions" to which your
 email is linked. A legit one might be if you signed up for a notification from a shopping site for deals. I found numerous (&gt;100) subscriptions that my email seems to have been linked without my knowledge. Now, I don't know when you sign up for a legit one,
 if they then sell your email address to unsavory characters or something, but I don't know where these came from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the plus side, Microsoft provides the email address to the "subscription" and an "Unsubscribe" button. The Unsubscribe button seemed to work for legitimate subscriptions to which I no longer want, but the unsavory ones send me to a link that is unsavory,
 I think... I didn't go to them since the subscription in and of itself is something I don't want to know about (e.g. CBD Oil) and going to the link may cause more problems. OK, I did it a couple times then realized the potential badness, so that stopped. When
 you would be redirected a link is shown in a window and you have the option to unsubscribe or cancel</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the down side, many of the auto responses I got for my unsubscribe attempt is "Sorry, we are unable to unsubscribe you from...." shucks... well, so there's this email address right? Maybe, what if, I copy this email address, open another browser tab,
 open another session of settings, then add this email to my junk list? Yeah!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; NO. It's like a picture of the email address... can't copy it! WTH!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my workaround: (I am on a Mac (hah hah)) you can press Shift+Command+4 to get a "+" cursor to drag a screenshot of a specific part of the display. So, I can open the screenshot and that other tab in the browser and at least I can fat finger the email
 address (I just entered the domain to get any one from hoobiedoobie.deals (a random example that is not one of the real ones)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short answer, If I couldn't unsubscribe I added them to my blocked list, so hopefully that keeps some out my junk</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. (Sorry so long, but really I hope it helps more people than just me) A couple hours after I finished the above I had three junks... I don't know if that's an improvement... Russia is sleeping, NIgeria is awake... the junks seem to come in some sort of
 timezone wave. I don't have the time to figure out when it's better or worse. Anyway, If you split your email screen so there's a list and preview of the email.
</p>
<p>-Click on the email in the list</p>
<p>-Go to the top of the Preview and click on the ellipsis "..." button (More actions)</p>
<p>-Select the "View message source" option (close to the bottom of course, thanks for that MS)</p>
<p>-It opens a window that shows information about how the email traveled from the hacker to you. You get a bit of a window into how MS is figuring out this email not for the inbox.</p>
<p>-The first and easiest things to look for are the From and Reply-To lines (I think usually they match, in junk, they don't)</p>
<p>Remember above when I wrote that I wanted to copy and paste emails/domain in another session of Outlook? Well, hooray, you can do it from here. Copy the From (and then Reply-To, if its different) email (or just the domain (that's the part after the @ symbol))
 and paste that into your blocked email/domain list in the other session.</p>
<p>-Have a look around at the process outlook went through to identify the mail as junk. If you see anything different from the email addresses above then paste that into the blocked list too</p>
<p>-Last, for old times sake, mark the email as Phishing, then Block it (the options under the "Not Junk" menu... who thought that was a good idea MS? And MS, how about just give us ONE button called Mark as Phish and Block? Like, who's thinking "I think this
 is a Phishing email, but maybe later I want to see if they have a good deal on Canadian pharmacy, so I'll give it that chance". Who's side are you on anyway?</p>

<p>We are using Sage 50 Premium accounting 2018 and Office 365 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unable to export reports from Sage into MS Excel.&nbsp; Sage tells me it is a compatibility issue.&nbsp; Can you please tell me how to correct this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello Sam, </p>
<p>
</p><p>For me to better assist you with your concern, I recommend that you contact the Sage 50 Premium support. And yes, it may be caused by the compatibility between the application and Sage. You can ask the Sage support for the correct settings for you to be
 able to export the file. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response. </p>

<p>I have to write a couple of documents where occasionally it would be very helpful to be able to insert references like "see &lt;other document's name&gt; chapter &lt;other document's heading nr.&gt;"</p>

            <div>Now that you've got to the bottom of that, my previous message starting&nbsp;</div>
<div>
"Things can be confusing..."</div>
<div>
may make a bit more sense!</div>
<div>
&nbsp;But just to try to fill in a few gaps for you...</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. The whole business of "properties" in Office documents etc. is historically, a mess.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. At least some of the built-in properties can indeed be inserted in several ways, e.g.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>a. { AUTHOR }</div>
<div>b. { INFO AUTHOR }</div>
<div>c. { DOCPROPERTY AUTHOR }</div>
<div>d. The "Content control" version of { AUTHOR }, which is inserted via Insert-&gt;Quickparts-&gt;Document properties.</div>
<div>e. A custom content control, that points to the same XML content item as (d)</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>3. For 5 of the built-in properties, AUTHOR, COMMENTS, KEYWORDS, SUBJECT, and TITLE (I think!) you can also set a new value using the type (a) field or the type (b) field, e.g.</div>
<div><br />
<div>{ AUTHOR "new author" }</div>
<div><br />
<div>These 5 are special because</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. they were there in the original versions of Word for Windows (whereas, for example "Category" was not)</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. their values are not intended to be maintained by Word (cf. { NUMWORDS }) and therefor read-only.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. INFO is, I suspect, little used, as all its values can be inserted using other field types. Further, it has been "deprecated" in the ISO standard for the OOXML format. I wouldn't use it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. I wouldn't personally choose to use DOCPROPERTY to insert the value of { AUTHOR } because</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. the built-in property value would be overridden if you created a document property called AUTHOR, at which point things may become very confusing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. the user-created properties that you can display using DOCPROPERTY (previously known as "Custom Document Properties," and now as "Advanced Properties", are also arguably in decline, because there is a new type of property called a "Custom Property"
 that is defined as part of a "Content Type" on a Sharepoint server. You can set the values of such properties independently of the document, and when you retrieve the document from Sharepoint, it creates custom XML containing the property definitions and values.
 Such properties can only be inserted as Content Controls. These are now the only type of user-defined properties that&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;- are connected to a custom data store in the document</div>
<div>&nbsp;- appear automatically in the list in Insert-&gt;Quick Parts-&gt;Document Properties.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The other properties in that list are all content controls, and include</div>
<div>&nbsp;- some of the built-in properties that can also be inserted as fields, e.g. AUTHOR</div>
<div>&nbsp;- one or two of the older properties that never had a field version, e.g. CATEGORY</div>
<div>&nbsp;- a set of new "built-in" properties called Cover Page Properties (Company Fax etc.) that have no field version. The Custom XML for Cover Page properties is created as required (i.e. as soon as you insert the property), but this handy mechanism is reserved
 for Word - you can't set up your own properties that work in this way.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another significant difference between the "Advanced Properties" (DOCPROPERTY properties) and all the other property types, is that you cannot connect a content control to the value of a custom-defined "Advanced Property" in the XML store.</div>
<div><br />

<p>An embedded subform control is a special type of control that can be used to display a form object. One of the properties of the subform control is the SourceObject property. This property controls what form is displayed in the Control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can do is use the After Update event of your combobox to run a SELECT CASE statement, like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Case Me.cboTestname</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Case "Urea"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Me.sfrmTests.SourceObject = "frmUrea"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>End Select</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, I'm just using this as an example. Your Testname combo should actually use an autonumber to identify a test instead of the name. And, of course you need to use your own object names.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This might be caused due to profile corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to create a new user account and&nbsp;check if it helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the desktop press Windows flag key +R.</li><li>Type netplwiz and click ok.</li><li>This will create user account window, now select add and then select sign in with out Microsoft account.</li><li>Type the account name and password and create.</li></ul>
<p>This will create a new local account, now check if it works with new local account and keep us updated.</p>

<p>Hi, today is your first day&nbsp;of windows 10 upgrade days, but I don't received any notification from your company. I just look at news there say "Once the upgrade is ready for your PC, we’ll send you a notification and you can upgrade right away or pick a
 time that’s good for you", when I can received your upgrade notification I really don't know, I used your build 10162 after the setting page cannot found, what I can do right now????</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Streaming video online is a compressed form content sent over the internet and displayed by the viewer in real time. Thus the playback speed depends on the receiver's internet connection speed. We suggest that you check the speed of your internet connection.
 You may also use other browsers to replicate the concern. Here are some articles as well that may help you regarding internet connection:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The nudge tools are still here: Choose File, Options, Quick Access Toolbar and from the top left dropdown "Choose commands from" pick Commands Not in the Ribbon.&nbsp; Scroll down until you find Nudge Down, Nudge Left, Nudge Right and Nudge Up.&nbsp; Double-click
 each one to add it.</p>
<p>Regarding the keyboard ways, in addition to those mentioned by Echo you can press Alt+Left or Alt+Right&nbsp; to rotate your object.&nbsp; To rotate it slowly you can press Alt+Ctrl+Left or Alt+Ctr+Right.</p>
<p>You can also use Shift+Left, Right, Up and Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease the size and Ctrl+Shift+Left, Right, Up or Down Arrow to size in smaller increments.</p>

            It's just your arrow keys on your keyboard. If you have Snap to Grid turned on, the nudges might be pretty big; you can press CTRL while pressing the arrow to make the nudges smaller if you need to.

<h2>            Missing My Templates folder in Word 2010 in the save as box</h2>
                    I installed a trial version for Word 2010 on a Windows 7 operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am taking a class to be a MOS.&nbsp; I am trying to follow the book and my application seems to have let out my "My Templates" folder in the save as box???<br />
<br />
I need to know what I can do to have the "My Templates" folder appear under the Microsoft logo in Word 2010 when I am saving templates.&nbsp; These templates are then supposed to be opened in New -&gt; My Templates.<br />
<br />
I can't put them in there because the application seems to install without the folder.&nbsp; What should I do to fix this?<br />

<p><br />
Word never shows a "My Templates" folder in the File Save As dialog and it is an error in the text of the book if it tells you to do that.</p>
<p>However, if you save a template into the following folder </p>
<p>C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates</p>
<p>then when you use File&gt;New and click on the My Templates folder, that is where you will find the template.</p>

<h2>            Deleted recurring calendar items keep returning</h2>
                    
<p>I am writing about the exact same question as in this thread. Note that the thread was started in October of 2013 and users are still without an answer. In November 2013 Henry Huang marked his answer, which involved
 an admin running a PowerShell command, as a suggested answer. Apparently, this means Microsoft techs stop monitoring the thread to see if users still have a problem.</p>
<p>Having to run PowerShell is unacceptable. There needs to be an answer to this question, which has been a problem for at least two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To quote user Esther1972:</p>
<p>Using the desktop client version of Outlook 2013 in Office365 on Windows 7. Several months back I was invited to a recurring meeting. The meeting organizer recently left the company and the meeting is no longer being held, but he
 did not actually cancel the meeting before leaving. I've deleted the series of appointments numerous times, but it keeps coming back. Am I not deleting it correctly, or is it impossible for me to ever get rid of the meeting because it's still living on the
 server somewhere</p>
<p>Can you provide a solution?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mary</p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87717bde-12df-4ff4-8e86-5af27e31e5bd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87717bde-12df-4ff4-8e86-5af27e31e5bd" /></a></p>
<p>then i would appreciate it if you could share with us the following information as it’s important for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;regarding “<em>having to run powershell is unacceptable</em>”, i would like to know whether you have tried to check this issue via powershell syntax? if not, please try it at your convenience to check this issue.<br />
2.&nbsp;does this issue happen to any other users in organization?<br />
3.&nbsp;is the meeting organizer’s mailbox still active?<br />

<p>I do apologize, my users were offsite on Friday and so I could not give the details that Brook asked for. Your request was posted at 4:20am on Saturday morning; our business hours are Monday - Friday, 8:30am to 5:00pm EST. I will follow up during those hours.</p>

<p><span>Thanks for your patience. I'm still trying to pin down my users, but here are the answers I have:</span></p>
<p><span>I'll have to get the original item from the user to give you a screenshot; all I have is the item she forwarded to me which might not be representative. But it looks like she receives a regular
 calendar item with the following text added:&nbsp;</span><em>Exchange Server re-created a meeting that was missing from your calendar.</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em>Answers to the numbered questions:</p>
<p><span>1. I do not use PowerShell. We have a hybrid environment and I use Active Directory version 6.3 on Server 2012 and Office365..</span></p>
<p><span>2. I've not heard any other reports</span></p>
<p><span>3. Yes</span></p>
<p><span>4. The user was deleting it from Outlook 2013.</span></p>
<p><span>5. The user was just deleting her own calendar item, not that for the entire group (I don't think she can even do that, only the meeting organizer, right?)</span></p>
<p><span>6. When you say create a new Outlook profile, do you mean have her log on to another computer and use Outlook there? Or delete her Outlook profile on her computer and re-create
 it? The latter is a fairly disruptive procedure since she has a lot of emails and so it takes time for the mailbox to sync. That said, if it turns out to be the answer I'll certainly do it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'll add some information, and some steps that we are taking:</span></p>
<p><span>1. I asked the meeting organizer if she created the meeting as a new item or if the duplicated or altered a different one. Maybe that one had a different (and departed)
 creator.</span></p>
<p><span>2. The user with the problem also checks her email in her Android phone. I asked her to delete the Exchange account from the phone, remove the meeting from Outlook, wait
 90 minutes or so, then re-add the Android account. Maybe Android isn't receiving the delete command and is re-sending the item.</span></p>
<p><span>3. The user tried accepting the meeting invite rather than deleting it but (I believe) the problem persisted.</span></p>
<p>I will continue to work with the user and update you with the results of our tests. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>I have reviewed all the posts in this thread and the previous thread you mentioned. Thanks for your time and patience so far, and for such detailed feedback you provided.</p>
<p>While waiting for your further updates, I’d like to share my thoughts&nbsp;about identifying&nbsp;the root cause of the issue. It is important to identify whether the issue is related to
<strong>Outlook Web App</strong> (which represents the <strong>Exchange Online server</strong>),
<strong>Outlook PC client</strong> or <strong>Outlook for Android mobile client</strong>. Regarding this, my suggestion is that you block all the client connections and try using OWA (Outlook Web App) alone first.</p>
<p>About blocking all the client connections, we generally do it by using PowerShell. Since you don’t want to involve PowerShell, you can also do it by accessing
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center </a>-&gt; <strong>
recipients</strong> -&gt; <strong>mailboxes</strong>, double-click the affected mailbox and select
<strong>mailbox features </strong>in the pop-up window. Then, you can just directly click the following buttons:<br />
<strong>Disable Exchange ActiveSync</strong> under <strong>Mobile Devices</strong><br />
<strong>Disable OWA for Devices</strong> under <strong>Mobile Devices</strong><br />
<strong>Disable</strong> under <strong>IMAP</strong>, <strong>POP3</strong> and <strong>
MAPI</strong><br />
<em><strong>(Please remove all the configured mailbox account on every mail client before disabling these services.)</strong></em></p>
<p>After disabling those services and saving the changes, the user should be able to use OWA only. Please then check if the recurring meeting issue can be reproduced on OWA.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t occur to OWA, we can determine that the root cause is not with OWA or Exchange Online server. Please then enable
<strong>IMAP</strong>, <strong>POP3</strong> and <strong>MAPI</strong> and try to reproduce the issue on
<strong>Outlook PC client</strong>. And if it doesn’t occur to Outlook client either, please then enable
<strong>Exchange ActiveSync</strong> and <strong>OWA for Devices</strong>, and try the mobile client at last. Thus we can narrow it down to see which exact part causes the problem.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your updates.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allen</p>

    <title>Mac Word 2016 update - fonts missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> genniferlevey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mac Word 2016 update - fonts missing</h2>
                    <p>Last night (5/15/18) I updated to Office for Mac 2016 version 16.13 (180513). I was using a recent previous version earlier in the day. Right after I updated, many fonts were missing in Word. The most important ones are Times New Roman and Georgia. When
 I click on the font menu and I go to Font Collections / Web, Times New Roman is missing. Many other fonts are missing.&nbsp;I tried restarting my computer and Word a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This comes at a really bad time. Can I fix this quickly, or I can I revert back to the version I had yesterday morning? I even have a backup from early yesterday morning with the previous version of Word on it. Maybe I could use that. Thanks for any help
 you can give.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Some users have reported problems with version 16.9 and higher of Office. Office for the Mac has undergone dramatic changes in Office 2016/365. Developers are trying hard to make the Mac and Windows versions have the same or equivalent features. They are making real progress. However, fixing one thing sometimes breaks others.
<br />
<br />You can use the User Feedback feature to let them know if they've broken something. There may be a fix coming soon. I’d suggest checking for updates - it may take several tries for Office to recognize that there is an update, so try checking a few times.
<br />
<br />In the meantime, I suggest using a previous version or update until it is fixed.
<br />
<br />To do that, you’ll need to uninstall the current version, download the old version, and install it.
<br />
<br />Here are the instructions on how to uninstall for Mac:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-2016-for-mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>.
<br />
<br />Here is the link to install the latest stable version:

                    I purchased a font which supports OpenType features. MicroSoft Office for Mac products seem to display by default the font with Contextual Alternates (CALT feature in OpenType). I would like to de-activate Contextual Alternates in PowerPoint, Word and
 Excel. How can I do that and access the OpenType palette in Office 2004, 2008 and 2011?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Remark: In Word for Mac Contextual Alternates seem to be de-activated by default and I have found an option how to (de)activate it. For PowerPoint for Mac it seems to be vice versa and I haven't found an option to deactivate it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thank you! That's exactly what I have also found out. For Word for Mac 2011 it's working absolutely fine. I'm looking for a similar option in PowerPoint and eventually Excel. Maybe the feature doesn't exist at all in the latter two programs.</div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Hi<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are having an issue with Outlook 2013 on Exchange 2013, where we need to save emails on a regular basis and it loses attachments and often the email cannot be responded to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emails when we attempt to save them are in html format – but when they save they auto change to Rich Text and as such they lose the attachment.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We found another guy who has the same issue </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/392648-outlook-items-converting-to-rich-text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/392648-outlook-items-converting-to-rich-text</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and there seems to be no solution – drama is I really need one !!!!! HELP!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have so far: -</p>
<p>Tried a ‘save as’ to outlook msg with and without uni code.</p>
<p>When saved email is opened, it is in ‘Rich Text’ format</p>
<p>Attachments are missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also when responding to emails that are received from clients outside of the organisation, it converts the email to rich text and if sent, do not get past the exchange and remain in the ‘submission queue’ with “a storage transient failure”
 error for 3 days before bouncing back as undeliverable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TNEF was enabled which gave a whole lot of other errors so was disabled again</p>

    <title>Recovering from a failed firmware update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psychomania---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovering from a failed firmware update.</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />
<br /><b>Details</b><br />
<p>Occasionally things go wrong when using the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/softwareupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Software Updater (NSU)</a>. The exact cause is often unknown but it can be caused by the NSU, the phone or even the computer itself.<br />
<br />
The aim of this guide is to offer users a few tips and tricks that may aid recovery. The guide applies to most nokia phones, except the hard reset which only applies to S60 smartphones.<br />
<br />
<strong>So how do you know if an update has failed?</strong><br />
<br />
A failure can show itself in a number of ways, the most common one is where the NSU freezes. If it does this during the first part of the process where it downloads the firmware from nokia your phone will be ok. You will see that your phone is still switched
 on so it's safe to cancel the process or just remove the cable from the phone.<br />
<br />
If it freezes during the second phase when the computer is transferring the firmware to the phone this can be much more serious. When this happens leave your phone for at least 15 minutes before taking any further action. If after that time nothing has happened
 all you can do is pull the cable.<br />
<br />
Another failure is where your computer crashes during the second phase. This is usually the worst type of failure and often leaves the phone unrecoverable, but still it's worth trying.<br />
<br />
<strong>What can I do to recover from this failure?</strong><br />
<br />
The first thing to try is to remove the phones battery and leave it out for at least five minutes. Whilst doing this take the opportunity to reboot your computer in case you need it to help with recovery.<br />
<br />
Now re-insert the battery and try to switch your phone back on. If it works then all is good but before trying to update again there is a few things you need to check. Make sure that your computer is fully up to date including the latest service pack and disable
 all non-essential programs that are running. Also disable any anti virus and anti spyware software that you may have, now try again.<br />
<br />
If removing the battery failed to make it work then prepare your computer as mentioned above and run the NSU again. Follow all instructions and prompts that it gives you carefully as it may offer to recover your phone. If it doesn't try various combinations
 of connecting your phone whilst it's switched on, off and also try removing and reinserting the battery whilst it's connected. Make sure you wait in between each attempt to give the NSU time to detect the phone. This

classic thread is a good example of someone who succeeded in recovering their phone. It's a good idea to keep trying and trying.<br />
<br />
<strong>What if that method doesn't work?</strong><br />
<br />
The next thing to try is a hard reset. This method only applies to S60 smartphones with keypads (not touchscreens):<br />
<br />
1. Switch off the phone.<br />
<br />
2. Hold down the following three buttons: Green (the call answer button), * button, and '3' button.<br />
<br />
3. While holding these buttons, hold the power button for a second to switch on the phone.<br />
<br />
4. Release when the phone shows the nokia hands logo or shows other signs of life like the language selection screen.<br />
<br />
It may take a few attempts and very flexible fingers.<br />
<br />
Notes: On the N78 use the silver multimedia key instead of the green call key. On the 5800XpressMusic (also for the X6 &amp; 5230/5233/5235) see

this post for instructions on how to hard reset it. &nbsp;For an N97/mini see&nbsp;<a href="http://mynokiablog.com/2009/07/18/how-to-hard-reset-your-nokia-n97/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link.</a><br />
<br />
<strong>So none of that worked, what happens next?</strong><br />
<br />
Unfortunately you have now tried everything possible to recover from the failure yourself. The last thing for you to do now is to contact a nokia care point in your country for help. If your phone is under warranty they will repair it for free, possibly while
 you wait.<br />
<br />
You can find your nearest care point by using these links:<br />

            <p>Hello.&nbsp;Is it possible that your Internet Option settings automatically delete browsing&nbsp;history on&nbsp;exit?&nbsp; , Every time we delete our browsing history,&nbsp;cookies are deleted, including&nbsp;all opt out cookies, requiring us&nbsp;to redo opt out settings all over again.&nbsp;That's
 what they tell us.&nbsp;If you uncheck the cookie box the preferences should remain the same, but you still have all the cookies.&nbsp;Deleting cookies one by one is also too much trouble.&nbsp;Advertisers don't tell us which cookie it is we need to keep anyhow.&nbsp;It may be&nbsp;easier
 to give up&nbsp; privacy.than to fight for it.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Alarm app crashes on Windows 10 mobile</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi community, I ugraded my Lumia 640 to Windows 10&nbsp;mobile build 10.0.10586.164 yesterday and the alarm + clock app is not opening. I have many active alarms and when its time for them to activate, they just dont stop as much as try to deactivate and I need
 to wait for one to two minutes for each one to turn off. Is anyone having the same problems? Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>Also my Store region is set to US but I live in Brazil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alarm app just got updated now on March 25 but still with the same problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's April 14th and Windows 10 just updated to build 10.0.10586.218 and the app still not working and when my alarms are activated is desperate click the "ignore" option and each alarm back to play at least 5 times in a row, annoying every morning on my
 life...</p>
<p>And I still have no solution.</p>
<p>I am seriously considering to downgrade it to any backup before the upgrade to windows 10, I have been waiting this month for any update to fix it or any solution.</p>
<p>Now on Windows 10 there are many apps that cannot be uninstalled, we need at least a repair/reinstall option, I guess...</p>

            <p>Alarm stopped working at all so I transferred my stuff to my SD card, restored the phone factory settings without formatting the SD card and not restoring my previous backup. It could came with the same problems.
</p>
<p>For my happiness, the 'factory settings' came with Windows 10 Mobile 10.0.10586.318 (latest version at the moment, June 14/2016) already installed, so I didn't have to downgrade to Windows 8/8.1 Mobile and update to 10 again, and it took only 20 minutes
 to finish the installation, and in 1 hour I had all my stuff back and all my apps and emails synchronized again on my phone.
</p>
<p>That's it, months of suffering solved in 20 minutes with all my files saved on OneDrive and SD card.</p>

<h3> microinquirer00  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can move emails from a gmail or yahoo account to an outlook or hotmail account with iphone.</h2>
                    I can't move emails from a gmail or yahoo account to an outlook or hotmail account on my iphone.&nbsp; The ability to move emails from other accounts into gmail or yahoo email accounts is readily available.&nbsp; How can I become able to drop emails from a gmail
 or yahoo inbox to folders in my outlook account? I would like to use the outlook account as my main account, but I cannot drop important emails into the account with my iphone.<br />
<br />
for example:&nbsp; gmail email.&nbsp; hit edit, move, select accounts, pick the account you want to drop the email into and it moves.&nbsp; This can be done with gmail and yahoo, but not with outlook or hotmail.<br />
<br />
Hopefully there is a way to fix this.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Sorry to inform you but you cannot move emails from one Hotmail/Outlook.com account to another account via a mobile device. You can however do this on a computer. Should you decide to do so, then contact the Hotmail support team for proper assistance. Here
 is the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail">
link</a> to the forum.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you!</p>
