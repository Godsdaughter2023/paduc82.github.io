            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for trying Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in the development stage and it uses your feedback greatly for the first question about WDNISSvc and MsMpEng.exe you can provide your feedback.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To answer your second question:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows Defender cannot&nbsp;be uninstalled, it can be turned off, because it is merged with the Operating system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To turn it off follow the below suggestions:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Open Windows Defender.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select settings tab.</span></span><span>&nbsp; </span></li><li><span><span>Uncheck Turn on real time protection.</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>Note: This will only disable Windows Defender.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>When you disable Antivirus:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information helps, for further assistance please reply.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;

            Let's share our experiences:<br />
<br />
After upgrading 2.0 I am finally able to connect from Nokia 616 to iPhone, but the other end cannot hear me.<br />
<br />
I can hear him/her, managed to download contacts, dialing/answering is working but other end cannot hear me.<br />
<br />
Tried to reset both devices with the same results.

            I got mine working tonight by reloading the software on my phone and resetting the 616 to defaults. I can make calls and sync my phonebook properly. The only problem I can find is that there is no sim access profile on the iPhone. :(

            Do you have an original or 3G iPhone?<br />
<br />
Mine is an original now with firmware 2.0.1, and it's the same. After iPhone full erase and restore, and Nokia 616 factory settings reset.<br />
<br />
When I call someone he/she cannot hear me.<br />
<br />
I have just no idea what can be wrong.

    <title>Hotmail Sweep Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hotmail Sweep Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 'sweep and block any future messages' functionality has ceased to work in my hotmail - something that I require to manage and prevent junk mail. I receive the following message each time: 'something went wrong and we could not create the rule'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried manually blocking these to mitigate the problem but I'm spending 15 minutes each day going through this manually, most of the times it doesn't work anyway as the junk randomly generates domains and finds a way back the next day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've decided that if I can't get the sweep functionality back I'll be changing email providers. Please let me know if you can fix this.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Kane</p>

The thread you sent me merely tells me that the sweep function exists. Please read my question.</p>

            I too am having this same issue. &nbsp;My inbox is being flooded with spam that sweep no longer protects me from, and the rules i do set dont seem to be working properly either. &nbsp;It is a pain to change my main email address but i will should this spam continue.
 &nbsp;I would appreciate a fix to this issue on either front. &nbsp;Blocking a domain doesnt work because it's different everytime and the things i mark as safe aren't redirected to my inbox either. &nbsp;You guys need to get your stuff together.

            <p>I've had the same issue, I don't know what is so hard for a major company like Microsoft to get their sh*t together. I have both Hotmail and Gmail. Gmail is maintained much better with Google and has features to filter and block emails within the email window
 itself. Currently in Hotmail you have to save the sender's address and then go to separate menu for filters and add their domain to the blocked sender list, there's several new spam emails each day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere that Hotmail's user email list was hacked and sold to all of these email spammers. I actually looked up what marking an email as spam does and I don't even believe that it works. From Microsoft:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>We offer a number of steps to minimize the negative impact junk email
 has on our users' email experience. For example, we've implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce the burden of junk email which currently prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day!"</span></p>
<p>I have had numerous email from the same type of sender selling the
 same scam, I mark as junk/phishing scam and then two weeks later I get the same thing over again. Pretty typical here for Microsoft to send out a useless email referring to another post that doesn't actually solve or answer the original question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any solutions or ideas as to how to block/prevent spam in Hotmail please post here!</p>

            <p>The only thing i have found to work, is to click sweep, then view rules, and go down to my rule regarding subject contains words, and to use the common phrases and words that those spam emails send, like new york times, trump, fat loss, direct auto, refinance,
 one simple trick, natural, etc... While this is starting to work to an extent it doesn't solve the greater issue of increased spam and junk mail, and leads to potential future incidents where you actually wanted mail about those subject lines. &nbsp;i have tried
 using the mark as junk and phishing scam buttons for the past several months with literally no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Blocking domains is a slow process and doesn't even work because every one they send is different, even when its the exact same message their domain is different. &nbsp;Creating rules for "people" or "contacts" doesn't work either, because they just make slight
 variations or the rule doesn't seem to catch same sender emails.</p>

            Same problem for me.&nbsp; I don't understand, this feature used to work.&nbsp; I have found that if I reboot and log into Hotmail, I am able to setup 1 sweep.&nbsp; After that I receive &nbsp;'something went wrong and we could not create the rule' bull**it.&nbsp; I had read something
 about an upgrade was causing the problem.&nbsp; This sucks.

            <p>Hi zaiedalnaaemi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. I understand you would like to change the language on your phone to Arabic. As you may have already discovered, the Arabic language is currently&nbsp;not available on the phone. There is a list available for feature
 and service ability covering all the supported languages and countries for certain features on the phone. This list can be found at
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/feature-and-service-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/feature-and-service-availability</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't heard any updates on expanding the number of supported languages and countries, though you may be able to install an Arabic language keyboard app from the Marketplace that will allow you to type in Arabic on the phone. There are a few Arabic keyboard
 apps available at <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/search?q=arabic+keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/search?q=arabic+keyboard</a>&nbsp;that you can research and see if one is able to work for you.
</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for replying. I do not get an error message. Whenever I open excel, word etc I get the list of latest update come up. If I try to either update the whole suite or just one of the products then it will download but then fails at installation. However,
 today has confused me as I was able update outlook on my MacBook. Hence I am definitely confused. Maybe I should try the individual updates again before I bother you or waste your time. Do you agree.</p>

            <p>Dear Jim,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I checked/tried all your suggestions but still did not get any success. however the good news is I have now got everything updated. How you may ask. Previously at home I have had both complete downloads with failed installation as
 well as failed downloads with both error messages or just the update screen shutting down. The macbook is working perfectly so that was not the problem.I have a BT landline &amp; a BT broadband router changed from SKY about 9 months ago. I did think it was a bit
 slow &amp; I have talked to BT technical who have tested the line &amp; told there was nothing wrong. I did wonder if it was my internal wiring, although the Router is plugged in at the first entry point to the house.So supposedly no problem there.</p>
<p>Today I went to a friends house to try and install the updates via his sky router. I am pleased to say this worked but not without excel &amp; word taking 4 attempts. his download is much faster than mine. I can only put it down to my inward signal suffering
 download interruptions a lot more than my friend's system.</p>
<p>Do you or anyone else have any suggestions to alleviate these interruptions allowing for the fact that BT states I have no line problem &amp; the cable in from the exchange/junction box, I believe, is still the old style copper cable. apologies for it being
 such a wordy reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neil</p>

    <title>Formatting Error When Creating a Automatic Table of Contents on Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Formatting Error When Creating a Automatic Table of Contents on Word 2007 - Help Needed</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have been given some documents that already have an automated TOC insterted. However, all of the numbering of headings and subheadings is wrong and no matter what I do, I can't fix it!</p>
<p>I have checked the usage of the Headings to create the auto TOC and all seems to be ok, main headings have used&nbsp; 'heading 1', sub headings have used 'heading 2' and sub sub headings have used 'heading 3'. However, the display of numbers&nbsp;are wrong in the
 contents page itself and throughout the whole of the document&nbsp;e.g. Section one has list of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc. which is correct but then on Section 2 and so forth, the sub headings are still 1.9, 1.10 instead of a new set of sub headings e.g. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
 and so one. </p>
<p>Please can you help?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Place the insertion point in the first Heading 1 paragraph, and then&nbsp;click Home tab | Multilevel List | Define New Multilevel List. Verify that the numbering is correct.
<br />
<br />
In particular, make sure that level 2 is set to restart after level 1 and that the format includes level 1. You may have to recreate the number formats (in the "Enter formatting for number" box). Use the "Number style for this level" box to add the current
 number, and use "Include level number from" to add any previous level(s). See also

<br />
When you are done, update the TOC. Right-click it, select Update Field,&nbsp;and, when prompted, choose to update the whole table.</p>

            <p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I've tried that but still experiencing the same issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You say to make sure that level 2 is set to restart after level 1 but I cant see on that menu where I check that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I be deleting the current TOC before making these ammendments? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also keen to undertand how this issue has come about. It was sent to me from someone with a MAC. Would this cause this formatting issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for your help. </p>

            To see all options in the dialog box, you have to click the More button (easy enough to miss it).<br />
<br />
No, deleting the TOC is not necessary. Once the formatting is correct in the document, just update the TOC, as I wrote in my previous message.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the conversion from MacWord makes a difference; I never work with MacWord myself. What happens if you select a problem paragraph and press Ctrl+Q (to reset paragraph formatting, including numbering, to style)? Does that improve the situation?
 Of course, you'd have to update the TOC again.

<p>Hello Tricia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The application may not be updated that is why you're unable to successfully use it. We'd like to know the OS build currently installed on your phone for us to replicate the issue. To check this information, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>
More</strong> <strong>info</strong>. Have you tried checking the Store for any pending app update? Does reinstalling the app make a difference? Can you access the internet using your cellular data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if your device is running older Windows version, this app will no longer work. The only way to access their services would be using your phone browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

<p>My phone updated last night and failed to restart, so I needed to use the Device Recovery Tool to reflash it. Facebook reinstalled automatically along with the Facebook official app (labeled as a beta) that had been previously installed. If you go to Store
 app and select My Library, all apps you had previously installed will be listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Facebook Help, the Facebook app should be available via the Phone Store app:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/277242742632461?helpref=search&amp;sr=2&amp;query=windows%2010%20phone%20app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/help/277242742632461?helpref=search&amp;sr=2&amp;query=windows%2010%20phone%20app</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the Store on the PC, I see both apps listed and both show available for PC and Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is currently updating itself again (the DRT apparently presents a fairly old image for my 950XL), so I can't check the store on my phone.</p>

<p>Hi, tricia520.</p>
<p>I just edited my reply above that was marked as Answer. You can unmark it if you wish.</p>
<p>In my case, the MS developed Facebook app stopped working the same day as the June update, before the update was installed on my phone. I tried both wifi and 4G. The official app continued to work. When I restored my phone after the failed update -- complete
 reset -- both versions installed and the MS version still did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't believe that Microsoft discontinued the app, I suspect that Facebook made a change that prevents the app from working properly.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 - Customize Ribbon - Commands Missing</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to add the Publish PDF button to the ribbon in Office 365 Word and Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigating to Options-&gt;Customize Ribbon</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the &nbsp;"Choose commands from:" field is set to "Popular Commands" or "File Tab" the list is empty. Selecting "All Commands" does not have the commands I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the case on at least two computers that are up to date. On a computer that does not have an up to date version of Office 365, the commands are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance if anyone can help with this issue</p>

<p>The loss of the commands that you show started recently with an Office update. A fix is expected soon.</p>
<p>I am surprised the MSFT replier did not know this - people have been complaining for about 10 days</p>

<p>Hi All,<br />
<br />
This issue has been fixed. If you still encounter any issue, you're welcome to post a new thread for assistance. To help other's easily see this information, this thread will be locked.
</p>
<p>You may find the summary of the issue below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Issue</span></strong><br />
<br />
After updating Office, if you launch the Ribbon or the Quick Access Toolbar customization dialogs, the dialog might not show any commands available. For example, the list of “Popular Commands” or “Commands Not in the Ribbon” may be empty.<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue is fixed in Version 1706 (Build 8229.2103) for production customers. To update Office, open any Office 2016 app and choose
<strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Account </strong>&gt; <strong>Update Options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update</strong>.<br />
<br />
The previous workaround for this issue for the Quick Access Toolbar (or if the fix hasn't rolled out to your Insider ring yet): type the name of the command in the Tell Me box (keyboard shortcut Alt+Q), then right-click the command and select “Add to Quick
 Access Toolbar”.<br />

<h2>            Excel 2016 - locking the row height to prevent auto row height activation</h2>
                    <p>I am using Excel 2016 on Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I have a document in two languages laid out in two columns.</p>
<p>Because of the language differences the amount of text can be very much smaller/larger when translated.</p>
<p>I also want to print two sided so that it ends up like a little book.</p>
<p>If I take the text on the first page in column 2 and insert it into column 1 the auto row height kicks in and throws everything out.</p>
<p>I have tried searching the help files and have got nowhere.</p>
<p>I have tried exporting it into Word, as a word table but still get the same results.</p>
<p>I did think I had succeeded at one point by manually resetting the row heights but when I tried to print it adjusted the height of the cell to the contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can lock up the row heights ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated and I give my thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sean</p>

<p>If I try to connect the Word document to the query via OLE DB for mail merge the required query is not shown in the list of tables/views.</p>
<p>If I choose another available query then immediately Word shows the message "Word could not open the data source".</p>

                    <p>I was working on a PPT, saved it, everything was fine. The next day I opened it, made a little change, and when I went to save I saw a popup telling me that it couldn't be saved with that name. I changed the name, tried to save as or save, tried different
 names and kept receiving the same message. I closed it unsaved and when I reopened the same PPT I had just finished the night before, it was empty. The file size is "zero bytes." One empty slide appears when I open it, but the other 36 slides and all the content
 are gone. I looked for it in auto recovery and couldn't find it. I took my laptop to tech support and they couldn't recover it. They also ran a virus scan and found nothing and couldn't explain what happened with PPT but said it was a fluke. But now when I
 open a new PPT most of the features/tools are gone (individual tools are shaded in grey and nothing happens when you click them). A lot of the features are gone: from the Home and Animation toolbars about 90% of the tools are inaccessible; from Insert, Design,
 Transitions, and Review toolbars about 50% of the tools are inaccessible; from the Slide Show and View toolbars, almost all of the tools are still available.</p>

<p>Hi Kas21SC,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear what happened to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the issue that the features in PowerPoint are inaccessible, it sounds like PowerPoint is not activated correctly. Click PowerPoint on the top menu bar and select About PowerPoint to check whether it is licensed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, you can use the license removal tool in the following article to remove the related files and try to activate again.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-remove-office-license-files-on-a-mac-b032c0f6-a431-4dad-83a9-6b727c03b193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to remove Office license files on a Mac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, could you please let me know if the issue only happens to PowerPoint app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ran</p>

</p><p>I bought the license for Office 365 at the store when I bought the new mac. In the About PowerPoint dialog box it reads "License: Retail License 2016." So the issue is that I'm still using the one-time purchase license and not the subscription license? I'll
 try removing this license and reinstalling. Thank you for your help! If it doesn't work, I'll respond on this thread.&nbsp;</p>

                    In Word 2011, when entering equations (new equation editor) on multiple lines, I'd like to align them on the equals sign.&nbsp; Descriptions of doing this are readily available: I right-click on the equals sign and select "Align at this character".&nbsp; A thin
 alignment bar appears in the equation.&nbsp; However, each equation continues to start at the left margin.<br />
<br />
In other words, everything seems to go fine, but the alignment doesn't occur.<br />
<br />
Am I missing some step?<br />

<p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using Nokia Mail for sometime now and unfortunately i've forgotten my password! (Old age for you!) I remember putting in my phone number whilst registering but have tried to send a link to my phone via text but i've recieved nothing, any other
 links basically lead to nowhere. &nbsp;I am in desperate need of my email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can help!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the proper way and some tips to retrieve your account's password:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If you have forgotten your password, you can&nbsp;</span>go to Nokia Account web page:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://account.nokia.com/acct/account/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.nokia.com/acct/account/index.html</a><span>&nbsp;and click on&nbsp;</span><strong>"Forgot
 your password?".</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that you are typing the correct (Registered) email address, mobile number or Nokia Account username. After a short while you will receive a link to reset your password.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In case you did not receive the e-mail, make sure that your email inbox is not full i.e. you can receive emails normally from other parties.</span><br />
<br />
In case you did not receive the link via SMS, make sure that your phone number must be preceded by "+" sign and the country code.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, try to perform the previous steps using a different internet browser, computer or the internet provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the result once done.&nbsp;</p>

            The fact that the last post on this entire forum was more than 13 hours ago speaks volumes for the popularity and future of the Windows Phone Marketplace.<br />
<br />
Attention, Microsoft: That thundering noise is the sound of your remaining customers running to other platforms.

I find myself doing a daily check to see how many apps there are in the UK store (today, I see 179). &nbsp;I'm certainly keen to see an increase in that number. &nbsp;However, not having either an Android or iPhone to compare with, I'm not quite sure whether I'd know
 what to do with a choice of 10k or 100k+ apps.
<div><br />
<div>Isn't there a danger of there being too many apps out there? &nbsp;With 100k on offer on the iPhone, isn't there just a lot of duplication and, not to put too fine a point on it, rubbish? &nbsp;Doesn't it get quite hard to find anything other than the most popular
 app of the moment?</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I say, I'm certainly looking for more Apps in the WM marketplace, but I'm yet to be convinced that a choice of 10K apps in the store would be that much better to me than, say 1k.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Personally, what I would like to see are few specific items (of, admittedly UK interest). &nbsp;For example:</div>
<div><br />
<div>- &nbsp;National Rail enquiries&nbsp;</div>
<div>- &nbsp;Ocado</div>
<div><br />
<div>Both of these have good apps on the iPhone and I'd love to see them ported to WM.</div>
<div><br />
<div>FWIW - I also don't see the App store as <em>the </em>only selling point of a smartphone. &nbsp;For me, good integration with our corporate exchange server, plus a good range of decent hardware has kept me with WM for many years). &nbsp;Having an app store is fun
 (and I've certainly made more impulse purchases of apps than I would have otherwise) but it's not the most important thing.</div>

Well, the more apps the bigger chance to find something for everybody. right?&nbsp;Windows Marketplace is one of the major topics in the PR for 6.5.<br />
<br />
RoadSync client and others work well for the most companies.<br />
<br />
I'll also would like to see more localized apps, but with that kind of fees for developers I will never see that......

<p>I have tried to find a market place on the web, but there doesn't seem to be any good once out there. Happy when I say the Market Place, but unfortunately I only have WM 6.1. I thought&nbsp;thats why I only had 80 apps. But now I can see, you haven't much more.
 All people wants good, simple working apps, and fun is success today, whether we like it or not. So Microsoft, run run run. I think you should try to deploy at least 100 apps a week, or you will loose. Well, I understand you don't make all the apps yourselves,
 but I don't think Apple does either...<br />
<br />
On the second hand, why does all smart phone manufactures (and Microsoft), creates slow, buggy items? And if they find out to be, why do they sell/release them?!?! Apples creates their first (almost) phone, and immediately become a success.&nbsp;Do they have so
 many more clever&nbsp;employees, or what?!?!<br />
<br />
The Apple home market increases so much. I was on a party yesterday. We were 7 guys (the girls was in another room). I was the only white collar worker. We were three guys not having iphones. Everyone but me taked about buying an Apple computer the next time
 (well, two already have). I think this is a side effect of bad experience from phones, and the iphone hype (excepts that XP and Vista is bad experience).
<br />
<br />
So I really wonder what Microsoft WM guys are doing/have done the last 10 years (or how old is Windows CE)?<br />
<br />
I must also say that I have no Apple products at all, and is a advanced user of Windows, and I somehow like Microsoft, and dislike Apple, but for how long time... we'll see.<br />

            It's a shame how few people seem to know about the hundreds of thousands of Windows Mobile Apps out there. The platform has been around longer than this marketplace, and none of the programs I use really are in the marketplace. If Microsoft keeps charging
 for the pleasure of having your app in the store, there won't be many decent programs in the marketplace.<br />
<br />
But the Marketplace itself is just one program. It's a stupid program. On my HTC Snap it only worked once, but it is just a program. If you really flew to another OS just because of one program, you're loosing out.<br />
<br />
There's Mobhand, Handango, Pocketgear - and better than any of those are the individual developer sites. WebIS has Pocketinformant, SBSH and SPB have great apps, Lakeridge software was making Windows Mobile worth using back in its PocketPC days and is still
 offering the most customization available that you could never ever ever ever do on an iPhone or Android or S60 device.<br />
<br />
And you wouldn't know of any of these developers if you lived only through the Mobile Marketplace.
<br />
<br />
It's an antiquated idea and MS needs to up their game, but try the shareware sites. Read reviews like at Pocketpcthoughts, Mobilitysite, Pocketnow, etc., you'll find there's lots out there.

<p>Cyberg00se is right of course. This is really the LAST place anyone with a Windows Mobile phone should come to for apps. Thanks for absolutely nothing Microsoft. I got an HTC Touch Pro 2 a couple of months ago. Awesome phone with great build quality. WinMo
 is a bit sluggish at times if I forget to close out other programs but not bad. However, Microsoft knows as well as anyone that the apps are what appeals to people who buy large touch screen phones yet what do they do ? Charge developers for hosting the programs
 and alienate the end user..... <br />
<br />
I'll be switching to Andoid within a couple of months and buying a 500 dollar phone outright to do it....</p>

[Off Topic]<br />
As I told you on another post you are right but from my own developer experience those websites also let users posting comments without being able to explain them. I published one of my apps on one of the website you list, the application was banned after a
 user "warning" and other users comments that my application was dangerous and blabla without any proof or any tests......I tried to contact website owners/admins/moderators without success : my application was simply banned without telling me (I learned this
 by a friend trying to get it there!)... I which the marketplace&nbsp;to be "the place to be" because of validation stuff and potential users (every winmo 6.5 have the marketplace pre-installed).<br />
So yes there are many non-microsoft websites providing freeware, shareware, ... but the applications are "to be tested" on your device and should get bad comments because no-one guarantee that your application is ok or not...<br />
[/Off Topic]<br />
<br />
Back to the topic of this post @andersgreen : you don't find more applications because of geographic rules on the marketplace, search this forum for "geographic discrimination" and you will have your answer :o))

<p>I for one have had no issues with build 11082.</p>

            In my original post, I did not include the detail that my last four installations were of Windows 10 Education version, build &nbsp;10586.36 Version 1511, i.e., not the more frequently installed "Enterprise" edition. &nbsp; Does this make a difference? &nbsp; All my
 machines report "You are all set to receive Insider Preview Builds" and the slider is to the far right in the "Fast" position. &nbsp; But I just checked this morning and one of the four machines was rebuilt on December 25 so it has now been waiting for some 10
 days with no builds available.

            My guess is your on the slow ring with those copy's of insider. You can go into the settings under System Update - Advanced and change to the fast ring. There is a waiting period for the slow ring whereas the fast ring is day one. It's basically for people
 that don't want to risk a bug in a new version update to bork up their systems.<br />

            Nope ... I'm on the Fast ring. &nbsp;This is handled as of 10586 with a slider at the bottom of the "Advanced Options" page. &nbsp;Formerly, it was just a button click. &nbsp;My machine confirms that I am on the Fast ring.

            <p>You could share them online from one account to the other, but since they are probably replicated on the hard disk, you could just copy them to a common disk folder, login with your own account on the PC and then move them into your own local OneDrive folder.
 They will then be replicated to your online OneDrive storage as well. If you don't have your own Windows account on that PC, this wouldn't work, but you could still download them from her shared online folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If she doesn't want your photos, you could then delete from her local and online OneDrive folders once you have them safely stored.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here is another option.&nbsp; Just use your daughter's signin to her Onedrive and download to your PC.&nbsp; Pretty sure you can download a complete folder so just a couple of clicks.</p>

<p>Thanks Mel. I must admit I am very confused about the cloud! I have logged in to my daughter's account and can see all the folders of photos that I want, but can see no way to download them to my PC.</p>

<p>Ok, any question about Onedrive is a good question.&nbsp; Onedrive and I are pretty thick, we have been going together for some time - lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One drive is fairly simple with a few simple steps.&nbsp; I just did a little test here and I was about to get bombarded with my pictures from my Onedrive to my PC-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign into your daughter's Onedrive account.&nbsp; You should see all the folders or files on that Onedrive.&nbsp; I saw a ton of folders on my Onedrive</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw my folder called Pictures which has several subfolders reporting to the main Picture folder.&nbsp; This might be called Trip #1, Trip #2, etc.</p>
<p>3&nbsp; I just clicked on the main Picture folder to highlight it.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Directly above in a little Menu I saw the option to Download</p>
<p>5&nbsp; I hit Download and I was hit with the option to Download or Save the File on my PC.</p>
<p>6&nbsp; I would have chosen SAVE and this will start&nbsp; the process of download from your daughter's PC to your PC and Saves the download.&nbsp; The download option just downloads the file for a 1 shot use.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp; In your default Download folder, you should see the download of the pictures of your choice.</p>
<p>8&nbsp; You now have what you want on your PC, just might not be in the final resting place</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp; On a rainy day, you may want to set up or use your existing Onedrive.&nbsp; You can select the pictures of your choice and place on your Onedrive as you wish.&nbsp; The pictures of your choice can then be stored in your Onedrive folder on your PC or just stored
 in your Cloud.&nbsp; Keep in mind that you get 5 GB of space free on your Cloud.&nbsp; If you have a ton of pictures, then you might choose between important and not so important.&nbsp; Lots of options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See how you make out.&nbsp; I can shoot you some photos of my Onedrive but not as complicated as you might first think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to help.</p>
<p>

<p>If the pictures are on your daughter's Onedrive, it matters not if the pictures are on her PC or just in the Cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just go to onedrive.com and sign in as your daughter.&nbsp; You should then see the pictures of interest.&nbsp; Select the desired pictures and download to your default download folder saving the file.&nbsp; You will now have the pictures on your PC in your download folder.&nbsp;
 It is all downhill from there as you do with the pictures as you choose.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just keep in mind that with your own Onedrive setup and working like your daughter's, you should have a folder on your Onedrive appropriately called perhaps "Pictures".&nbsp; Under that main folder, you can have sub/folders containing albums or whatever.&nbsp; You
 will be in full control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also keep in mind that it is an option whether you keep your "Onedrive" pictures on both your PC and Onedrive.&nbsp; I keep most of my Onedrive items on both the PC and Onedrive.&nbsp; I have several PCs tied to the same Onedrive so if I have a very large file of
 low usage, I can choose to just have a copy on Onedrive cloud to avoid loading the very large file to about 5 other PCs.&nbsp; You are in control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Hi YG017583,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know more about this issue to help you effectively. Are these computers connected to a domain network? Are you experiencing the same issue when using a different web browsers? This might be resolved, by using&nbsp;<strong>Compatibility
 View</strong> on Internet Explorer. To do so, click on <strong>Tools</strong> (gear icon) on the upper-right corner of the Internet Explorer window, and select&nbsp;<strong>Compatibility View settings</strong>. Then, simply add the affected website by typing and
 clickin <strong>Add</strong>.</p>

<p>We have the same problem, Instagram shows a blank page with Internet Explorer 11. I tried with InPrivate Navigation, with compatibility settings and played with some settings (changing IE version and compatibility) in the Developer Tools, but all with no
 results... The only thing I see are 2 error messages in the Developer Tools:</p>
<p>Syntax error: babbacb474c5.js (1,138863)</p>
<p>Syntax error:&nbsp;217e5f16d754.js (1,2836)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have no problems with other browsers like Chrome and Mozilla.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas to get Instagram back working on IE11?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab, Trusted sites icon, Sites button,</p>
<p>
</p><p>remove any public websites from your trusted sites list. eg. facebook.com, Instagram.com, twits.com or even google.com or Microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE has a security zone setting "Prevent navigation into a zone of lower integrity"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>some public websites like Instagram, facebook, google, Microsoft etc use a validation service to validate your user credentials when you revisit websites...</p>
<p>
</p><p>eg. google.com uses myaccount.google.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have google.com in your IE's trusted sites list, but not myaccount.google.com then IE will spit the dummy and won't allow navigation to myaccount.google.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trusted sites zone has a default security level of Medium, while the Internet zone has a security level of Medium High... viz: the Trusted sites zone is ACTUALLY&nbsp; less secure than the internet zone....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The https protocol works in any IE security zone, so you can safely remove any public websites from your IE Trusted sites list, without loosing https security.... you should however make sure that the Lock icon appears in the IE address bar and that there
 are no certificate errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a work computer, you should in the first instance contact your IT department or Help desk.... Some companies may have strict rules on the personal use&nbsp;of their computers. Use your smart phone instead to access your personal websites at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your company IT department, may also have implemented security features in IE that is preventing sites like Instagram or facebook from being accessed from their computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
