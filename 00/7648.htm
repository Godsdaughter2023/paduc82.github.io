            I don't think that anything is possible.<br />
<br />
If somebody at Nokia is listening, please don't protect 3rd party apps and let the users delete them :(

            Srikanth mate.. This does not work for protected apps. Option to select app access isn't available.<br />
<br />
That's why I'm fed up of this useless app protection by Nokia. I don't know why this is being done :/

                    <p>I am sure most of the people would try to answer without reading the full question I am going to ask, so please I would request you to kindly read it before answering. I will try to provide maximum details for you to answer.</p>
<p>So, the error is mentioned in the title i.e. "SystemSettingsBroker.exe -Application Error".
<strong>Every time I shut down my system a dialog box comes showing this title for around 3-4 seconds and the PC shut downs after that.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full message under the dialog box is :</p>

</p><p><em>"The instruction at 0x00007FFC34D6071E referenced memory at 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. The memory could not be read. Click on OK to terminate the program. Click on CANCEL to debug the program"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled about this but I couldn't get a direct answer to this particular error. I tried SFC SCAN and I got an error there at 70%. It was written (on Command Prompt screen):
<em>"Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation"</em></p>
<p>

<h2>            IE&#40;11&#41; favorites don&#39;t sync &#40;anymore&#41; between Windows 8.x &#47; Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>At some point, creating a new favorite on my main (Windows 8.1) machine has stopped propagating the favorite on my other (Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 10 TP) devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following some advice found on the forums, I have made sure I don't have any favorites with long filenames or long absolute pathnames:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(98, 98, 98, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(98, 98, 98, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(98, 98, 98, 1)">File count: 2719</span></span></span></p>
<span style="color: rgba(98, 98, 98, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(98, 98, 98, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(98, 98, 98, 1)">
<p>Directory count: 105</p>
<p>Max abs path length: 134</p>
<p>Max filename length: 50</p>
<p>Max abs dir path length: 83</p>
<p>Max dirname length: 51 </p>
</span></span></span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This still doesn't fit the bill: my favorites don't get sync'ed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I go from here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I probably need:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) to have the data in (some hidden directory on) OneDrive cleaned up</p>
<p>2) to purge the favorites on my Windows Phone 8.1 device</p>
<p>
</p><p>but how can I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really getting annoying, for instance 'cos I cannot find my recent favorites on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: if that's really related to filenames and directory names, Microsoft <strong>
has to</strong> do something so that IE <strong>cannot create non-sync-able favorites in the first place!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a means (even if writing code is needed) to access the OneDrive copy of the favorites?</p>

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're having problems syncing your favorites, you can try running the Microsoft Accounts troubleshooter. It's an automated tool that can find and automatically fix some syncing problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the sync settings are fine then run the Microsoft accounts troubleshooter on the desktop computer and check the status.</p>

            <p>Hi Arvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't mention that in my OP, but I have (of course) run the MSA troubleshooter quite a number of times, to no avail--it does find that I haven't enabled syncing
<em>all </em>settings, but that's intentional (for instance, syncing the language settings is a bad thing, because it will force a US keyboard on machines with a French keyboard as soon as one of your machines has a US keyboard). Of course, syncing favorites
 is enabled on all my devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today the troubleshooter found something new: "you have reached the daily sync quota." I'm not sure why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about my question on accessing / clearing the OneDrive copy of the favorites? (I'm a Professional software engineer, I can write some code if needs be.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S. My name's Stéphane, not Tim :-)</p>

            <p>So? Most of my (recent) favorites still don't show up everywhere...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be willing to start afresh, but for this I would need to know:</p>
<p>- how to delete all favorites from my phone (without deleting everything else, reconfiguring the phone from scratch just for a favorites issue would be a major waste of time)</p>
<p>- how to delete all favorites from the "hidden&nbsp;OneDrive folder"</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue. I have 3 computers I am trying to sync: Home (8.1), Work (10 Enterprise), and my Windows Phone (8.1.1). I had been syncing before by relocating the favorites folder location to my OneDrive folder. This worked well, except that
 I could not access my favorites from IE on&nbsp;my Phone. It seemed to load an old list of favorites that I could not modify nor could I&nbsp;locate the specific folders/links.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I installed Windows 10 Enterprise preview, it automatically populated with my favorites from my MS account (yay!). So I had hope that the process was now more automated and would no longer require the manual relocation of the favorites folder to my
 OneDrive. This would be both simpler, and mean that my phone should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At home, I reset the favorites folder back to the default location under my user folder (synced). The favorites that automatically&nbsp;populated was again, the old list I saw on my phone. I deleted this list from my home PC. The favorites deleted on my phone.
 I manually copied the favorites from my OneDrive to the default favorites folder.&nbsp;The&nbsp;favorites&nbsp;will not sync&nbsp;up to my account now. I have no favorites on my phone. The only thing that works, is bookmarking a favorite on my phone will populate down to both
 PCs. Any new favorites bookmarked on either PC will not upload to my account. They remain local.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I returned to work, and I see that my favorites here have not changed, only the phone bookmarks have been added. I ran the Microsoft Accounts troubleshooter, but it found no issues. All machines have full syncing enabled in "Sync your settings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the only thing I can think of, is what was mentioned above about long file names&nbsp;and long file paths. This may be the issue, but I'm unsure of how to search for these (how long is too long?).&nbsp;The universal experience still has work left to be done
 if it can be&nbsp;so easily&nbsp;disabled.</p>

            <p>So I have been trying to troubleshoot this all day. I wiped all my favorites from the default folder. I checked, and my phone was wiped as well. I tested a couple of favorites, and they sync correctly from my work PC to my phone and&nbsp;vice-versa from the phone
 if I add more there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that as a basis, I began repopulating my online favorites by dragging folders or even individual links one at a time. Most of them went across without a hitch, and I see them on my phone in a minute or less. I've truncated a lot of links to make sure
 the names aren't too long, as often is the case when using, "Add current tabs to favorites..." which assigns names automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I seem to get stuck around 1MB of total size for favorites. At that point the bookmarks stop syncing. I have added nearly 1.5MB at one point, but eventually things stop working and the bookmarks become local-only if you change anything. I am uncertain
 if that is the limiting factor though. What is the upper limit on favorites?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just ran my CleanupFavoritesForSync.ps1 script, that renames files with "too long" names or paths, on my main machine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It seems that when you start with a fresh computer, such as testing Windows 10, it will bring down whatever was last&nbsp;successfully loaded up to your Microsoft account, once you log in with that. At this point, the computer is syncing your favorites for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish it was possible to access the folders and links themselves in the cloud (much as you can under your user folder &gt; favorites locally) but as of yet, I have not found anyone who can tell me where these are stored. The next best option is to copy your
 list of favorites somewhere safe first (be advised that they will automatically be alphabetized within folders&nbsp;when you move them, so you will lose any custom order, but you can redo it again later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your favorites are backed up, turn off favorite&nbsp;syncing on all other devices except your phone and that PC. Delete all your local favorites (but not the favorites star folder) on your computer. This will sync up to your phone shortly, and there will
 be no favorites there either. You are now starting from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to rebuild your favorites by dragging links or even whole folders into the local&nbsp;favorites on your PC. These should sync to your phone in 60 seconds or less. If it fails to do so, something in that selection is likely causing an issue. Try shortening
 names, look for abnormally large file sizes, or whatever mystery pet peeve seems to be preventing proper syncing. As long as you don't trigger this conflict, things should remain synchronized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you succeed, on the original PC from above, back up your new,&nbsp;currently working/syncing list of favorites to be safe first.&nbsp;Then, I suggest moving all favorites on the non-syncing devices somewhere safe. Make sure the local&nbsp;favorites folder&nbsp;on those machines
 is empty.&nbsp;Enable syncing on these other&nbsp;computers and it should pull down the new, improved&nbsp;favorites for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The part I am stuck on is how to&nbsp;add back&nbsp;my favorites one at a time without tripping the angry gremlins which halt syncing. I can get most, but not all to populate back down to my phone. When I run into a problem, I go back and try to focus only on what
 is successfully syncing by removing what refuses to upload.</p>

            <p>Hmm. I would double-check that all syncing is turned on for browser settings as well as for OneDrive settings. You are logging in to Windows&nbsp;using your&nbsp;Microsoft account, correct?&nbsp;Also, restart both devices and give it 24 hours to see if syncing catches
 up. You can also manually force syncing by right clicking the OneDrive icon in the system tray, and on your phone under Settings &gt; email+accounts &gt; hold down on "Microsoft account" &gt; sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that fails, you may have to try downloading a trial of Windows 10 to get a fresh start with your account and synced settings. This happened unexpectedly for me, which is what began my quest to get favorites syncing properly. Windows 10 has more granular
 control of OneDrive, but less so when it comes to what prefs are synced. If you have a spare machine, or can create a VM install, that would probably work.</p>

<p><br />
I'm not sure what sync manager is Elyseelie.&nbsp; Is it a specific program on your PC or was it on your device.</p>
<p>Transfering (syncing) music files and photos for your device to your PC is done via the Zune software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Look at this to sync music, pictures and videos:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-US/howto/wp7/music/sync-files-with-my-phone.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-US/howto/wp7/music/sync-files-with-my-phone.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your device not being recognized, look at this online tool:</p>

            Step 1 is to install <a href="http://www.zune.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Zune</a>. After installing Zune, connect your phone to your PC using the USB cable that came with your phone. If the phone still isn't recognized, try different USB ports on your PC.

            It isn't clear what you're actually asking for... It could be <i>either</i> or
<i>both</i> of two possibilities :-)<br />
<br />
The first is that you want the User Interface -- Menus, Help, dialogs, etc. -- to display in English rather than Finnish. Mac Office is language specific, so you cannot change how your version displays. If you would prefer to work in the English release rather
 than the Finnish release, see the pinned ANSWERS thread on that subject:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macstart/how-can-i-install-office-for-mac-2011-in-a/90616a51-7956-4d42-a972-23df47b7ff5a">How
 can I install Office for Mac 2011 in a different language?</a><br />
<br />
<br />
The other possibility is that you're referring only to the language of the content you enter into your document. This can be a little confusing because
<i>language formatting</i> can be applied just like Bold or Italic, but it isn't visible.<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether your version is Finnish, Spanish, English, etc., for Spell/Grammar checking purposes you can format your content as whatever language it should be -- in fact, you can have some content formatted as one language &amp; other content in the same
 document formatted as another. Select the content &amp; go to <b>Tools&gt; Language</b>. Assuming they're installed, the Proofing Tools for that language will be used by the Spelling &amp; Grammar checking regardless of what your 'default' language or Language version
 is. If the proper Proofing Tools aren't installed the content simply isn't checked. [Yes, you can even format text as language (e.g., Korean, Ukrainian) for which Proofing Tools are not available.]<br />
<br />
Only Word has an option to set the default Language for new documents... The other apps default to the language of the version, but that can be changed by creating templates formatted for the preferred language.<br />

            One of your fields is an equation and the input values for at least one record is creating a division by zero as the error message states. &nbsp;You'll need to review your data and adjust your equation to avoid the issue altogether and then your export should

            Print orientation is a sheet level property, so you could use a macro to set the print range for each of the orientations, set the orientation in the setup, and then print.&nbsp;

            True, but once this becomes a workbook with a few hundred worksheets, I'd have to run the macro on each worksheet several hundred times.&nbsp; Alternatively I could write a macro that would print all the portrait portions then all the landscape portions but
 I'd have to go back after printing and pair them up.&nbsp;&nbsp; That a step I'm hoping avoid for time sake and because its prone to&nbsp;errors.&nbsp;

<h2>            Typing lag and flickering &#39;repeat typing&#39; arrow in MS Word</h2>
                    <p>I have a new laptop with MS Office and it recently upgraded to Word 2016. When I open a new document all is well for about 5 minutes and then I start to get a serious lag when I'm typing, and it seems to coincide with the 'repeat typing / can't undo' arrow
 flickering between greyed out and white. &nbsp;I'm an author in the middle of writing a book and I'm a fast typist, when the lag happens it makes Word unusable. The only solution is to save and exit Word, reopen it, have five minutes of typing bliss, then exit
 again when it annoys me too much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for the answer and see that others are experiencing typing lag. I haven't been able to find a fix. Typing is fine in all other programs. It's a Word issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help? I'm normally a Mac user and I bought this laptop specifically to write this book on, thinking Office would be fine and I'm finding it incredibly frustrating to say the least.</p>
<p>

            I found out what it was - it was my grammarly&nbsp;add-in. Even though I had disabled it, it was still making things slow down. Once I unchecked the add-in in options everything was fine again.

    <title>Excel 201 macro broken in Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bithead223  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 201 macro broken in Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have a macro written in Excel 2010 which works fine in Excel 2010.&nbsp; When I open the same workbook in Excel 2016 and run the same macro, it throws the MS Visual Basic error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run-time error '-2147352560 (80020010)';</p>
<p>Method 'Sort' of object '_Worksheet' failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching for the "Method..." line of the error turns up 0 hits containing the word 'Sort'.&nbsp; Searching the numeric codes turns up a number of things that don't seem to be related to the issue at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is where the code crashes:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveSheet.Sort.SortFields.Clear</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.Sort.SortFields.Clear</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.Sort.SortFields.Add Key:=Selection, _</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SortOn:=xlSortOnValues, Order:=xlDescending, DataOption:=xlSortNormal</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; With ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.Sort</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .SetRange Range(Cells(2, HeaderCol), Cells(NumCells + 1, CountCol))</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Header = xlNo</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .MatchCase = False</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Orientation = xlTopToBottom</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .SortMethod = xlPinYin</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Apply</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; End With</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Since I wasn't able to find any fixes, I tried a basic recording of the sort steps in 2016 so I could see the differences in the code - this is the recorded code:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("I1:J28").Select</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">r&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveSheet.("Network-Allowed_Sessions-bd-01.")..SetFirstPriority.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">r&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveSheet.(<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">"Network-Allowed_Sessions-bd-01</span>.")..SetFirstPriority.Add&nbsp; := Range _</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ("J2:J28"), Value := xlSortOnValues, Query := xlDescending,&nbsp; := xlSortNormal</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">r&nbsp; &nbsp; With ActiveSheet.("Network-Allowed_Sessions-bd-01.").</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .SetLastPriority Range("I1:J28")</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .StopIfTrue = xlYes</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Type = False</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">r&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . = xlTopToBottom</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .ScopeType = xlPinYin</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Delete</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; End With</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<p>I can't seem to change the text color here, but the lines beginning with 'r' all appear as red text in the vba editor.&nbsp; So I tried running the original code again until the crash point, then branched to the above code instead of running the original code.&nbsp;
 This resulted in a compile error at the first 'r' (red) line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So not only is the code from 2010 incompatible with 2016, but it seems that 2016 can't even do a decent job of recording its own code.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can make some sense of this 'cause right now it looks like an ugly, time consuming nightmare...</p>

<p>Further research indicates that the Sort method is somehow missing from my 2016 VBA installation.&nbsp; I just installed all available updates for Office 2016 - it didn't help.&nbsp; I recorded the sort procedure again and got the same results.&nbsp; Here is what Tools
 -&gt; References shows:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I see the same in Excel 2010 where the code works, except the Office version is 14.0 instead of 16.0.&nbsp; If anyone knows how to obtain and install whatever I am missing, please let me know.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

            The code works on a different machine with Office 2016.&nbsp; On the PC where it works, Office was upgraded from 2010 to 2016.&nbsp; On the PC where it doesn't work, Office 2016 is the only Office installation on the machine.&nbsp; So how do I get the missing piece for
 Office 2016 without installing 2010 on it?

<p>Having 2010 previously installed is NOT the solution.&nbsp; I downloaded the MS Windows 10 version 1809 installation media and installed Win10 Pro on a new virtual machine, then installed all Windows updates to bring it as close as possible to my problem PC.&nbsp;
 Then I installed Office 2016 and the macro works fine.&nbsp; Since then I have compared...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Installed apps - the VM has a bunch of bloatware games that the PC does not (thanks MS!).&nbsp; Other than that, nothing is on the VM that the PC does not have.</li><li>Installed Optional Features - if it's on the VM, its also on the PC.</li><li>The features installed for Office 2016 - they are identical</li><li>Via Control Panel -&gt; Programs and Features - again, if it's on the VM, it's on the PC.</li><li>Via Control Panel -&gt; Programs and Features -&gt; Turn Windows Features on and off - the VM did NOT have .NET Framework 3.5 enabled, so I enabled it, rebooted, and the macro still works.</li></ul>
<p>So the mystery lives on.&nbsp; The problem PC is a Dell machine with an OEM installed copy of Windows Home that I've upgraded to Pro.&nbsp; Next steps (unless someone has a solution before I get there) include finding a spare HD and doing a system restore to factory
 specs to see if the problem might be with the OEM Windows installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, it's been lovely talking with myself, but if someone else wants to join the conversation, you're certainly welcome to!</p>

            This is solved, although the solution remains a mystery.&nbsp; After several uninstallations/installations/repairs of office 2010 and 2016, culminating in running a .NET fix from MS, Excel 2016 macro sort operations are working now.&nbsp; I suspect the .NET fix
 (<span>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/repair) may have been the solution all along, although I didn't receive any errors indicating a need for it until deep into the un|install and repair operations.</span>

<h2>            phone woke me up at 02&#58;10am for no good reason</h2>
                    <p>It's quarter past two in the morning. A few minutes ago my phone woke me up with some alert sound. Not a call, so I rolled over and ignored it. Then it decided to wake me again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it turns out the first time it wanted me awake was because it needed a restart to install updates and the second time was to tell me i was low on storage and might like to move stuff to my SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, no. Not at quarter past two in the morning I don't. Who decided that was a good idea?</p>

            You can always disable system sounds or put your phone to silent mode at night. Alternatively if you are running windows 10, you can configure when your phone installs updates.&nbsp;

            You have to re-install them again to make them work. This is normal behaviour.<br />
<br />
For future reference it's always better to install programs and themes on the internal memory as this helps to improve the performance of the phone.<br />

<h2>            Going from Windows 7 SP1 to Windows 10 &#40;when released&#41;. Question about files being transferred&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">official Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 Laptop</span> (I checked) and when Windows 10 is released, and my computer "qualifies for the update" (according to Microsoft, though we are still left in the dark about this
 qualifying "process" if you will), and I am "supported for the full lifetime of my device", I'd like to update to it, supposedly for free; but my question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will all of my files, and music, programs (those compatible with Windows 10 I presume), pictures, documents... be "transferred" to my new Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>I understand if most of the programs don't but, surely my files, pictures, and most importantly, my music (from music that I've bought to the CD's that I have that are on my computer because I don't like to keep using the CD's to listen to the music on it
 because I don't like to scratch them) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>will</em> be transferred over into my Windows 10 from Windows 7 on my
<em>own</em> computer, right!?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>THANK YOU VERY MUCH!! A CLEAR RESPONSE FROM MICROSOFT ABOUT THIS CONFUSION WOULD BE NICE :)</p>

            <p><strong>How much will Windows 10 cost?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has not revealed all the details about pricing for Windows 10 yet, but they did announce that Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</em></span><span><em>–</em></span><span><em>at no additional charge. </em></span></p>

</p><p><strong>What are the official upgrade paths to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft revealed in a Channel 9 Video the official upgrade paths to Windows 10:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What does lifetime of the device mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>This is still being debated, but the logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, it will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available
 to it. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What does Windows as a Service entail?</strong></p>
<p>Since the introduction of Windows Update as part of Windows, Microsoft has delivered updates as way to keep Windows updated and secure. This has always been the way the company keeps commercial versions of Windows on the market current.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10, Microsoft is making significant changes to this model by delivering new methods of servicing Windows. Taking into account we now live in a mobile, constantly connected world, where threats happen all the time. Part of the solution to this
 is to keep users current by providing the latest updates&nbsp;as soon&nbsp;available in addition to delivering features as soon as they ready too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will do this using three types of service branches for Windows 10:</p>
<p>

                    hi,<br />
<br />
I want to know if I could have multiple email addresses assigned to one account. I want to have for example: matt@domain, sales@domain, info@domain<br />
<br />
I'll be the only person managing these emails, so I don't need office for more than just myself. However, I would like to be able to reply from each of the email addresses.<br />

            Yes, you can have up to 400 or so different aliases, for no charge. Replying from them is a different story however, as in Exchange you can only reply from the primary SMTP address by default. So you will have to use some of the workarounds, typically
 creating a DG or a shared mailbox with the desired alias and granting you Send AS permissions over it.

<h2>            Nokia X6 - Dead, not switching on at all, can I recover photos etc&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>6 months old now, been ok so far, plugged it into the charger overnight and this morning it's completely dead. Won't switch on at all, tried the red, green, camera and power button - no joy.</p>
<p>Installed the Nokia update software in case it would see the phone while it's dead - but no joy again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any way to get access the internal memory on a dead phone to get the photos off in case I need to send it back and it gets formatted or even replaced?</p>

<p>Aha, sussed it. The battery from the 5530 was same voltage and pins so I could power up the X6 that way. It looks like it's the charging socket on the phone is a bit iffy. We charged the X6 battery in the 5530 for a few mins then fired up the X6 and plugged
 in the charger, it's charging at the moment but if you wiggle the charger connection to the phone it's easy to lose the connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will see if we can live with it before sending it back for a fix.</p>

            Hi Pioneer, 
<br />Is the second address- the one you want to add - in the Outlook.com domain (includes hotmail, live, msn)? 
<br />
<br />Auto account setup needs to set exchange accounts up - you can't set it up manually.

<p>Good day Diane,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second email is what I am trying to access on my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be kind of weird that I cannot set it up the exchange server manually when it is giving me the option to do so.&nbsp; Why would Microsoft make a feature that the user is not able to perform?&nbsp; If that truly is the case then maybe doing the auto account
 setup is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I start the auto account setup if I already have the account setup, minus that exchange server prompt?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you for your response.</p>

            &gt;&gt; Why would Microsoft make a feature that the user is not able to perform? 
<br />If its an outlook.com, each account uses a unique "server" name (its actually an HTTPS url). Auto account setup needs to get the url using auto discovery - you want, you can try using outlook.office365.com. 
<br />
<br />If its not at outlook.com (or office 365), you'd need yo ask your email admin for the server name.

<p>Okie dokie Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using a 365 Microsoft account but I am using an @outlook.com.&nbsp; I called my admin and they said they cannot help unless I buy Office 365, which I am not willing to do, because I have been using this for years without problems.&nbsp; Then that person directed
 me here to ask the question that I highlighted in bold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do appreciate your response and the new knowledge bestowed upon me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy your day,</p>
<p>Nate~</p>

<br />You need to use auto account set up to set up Outlook.com accounts. 
<br />
<br />Honestly, buying office 365 isn't necessary.

<p>Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting me know that buying Office 365 is not necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching all over the web and within the Microsoft Office 2013 app; I have determined it difficult to find the auto account set up option.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used my email for the last 2 or 3 years and never needed the information below.&nbsp; I hope the image below helps anyone solve this issue for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Below the words Microsoft Exchange Server is where the information I am missing is needed to be placed in order to use my email on the Microsoft Office 2013 App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Nate</p>
