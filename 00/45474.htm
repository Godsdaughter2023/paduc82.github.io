            Do you mean you see a message something like this?<br />
<br />
STOP: c0000135 {Unable To Locate Component}<br />
This application has failed to start because winsrv.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
First impressions with that error is that some antivirus or antimalware program has quarantined (effectively deleted) a critical XP system file thinking the file was somehow afflicted (maybe it really is).<br />
<br />
You will not boot in any kind of mode until the missing file(s) is replaced.<br />
<br />
Answer these questions and then we can decide what to do next:<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system:<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and antimalware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<div>Would you say that the problem occurred after installing Trend Micro?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Assuming your XP is installed on the C drive, I suspect that the following file is missing or afflicted:</div>
<div><br />
<div>c:\windows\system32\winsrv.dll</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are "good" copies of most critical Windows XP files in this folder:</div>
<div><br />
<div>c:\windows\system32\dllcache</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need to boot into the XP Recovery Console and manually copy the winsrv.dll from the dllcache folder to the system32 folder and replace the missing or suspicious file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can do that after booting your system on an XP Recovery Console CD that you can make (no XP media required).</div>
<div><br />
<div>First you need to make the bootable CD following the directions below and run the chkdsk /r just to be sure your file system is not afflicted (it will not hurt anything to run chkdsk /r even if it finds nothing to do).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next you just need to replace the missing or suspicious file by copying in a replacement from another location on your hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From the Recovery Console C:\WINDOWS prompt enter the following command to copy the file:</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\winsrv.dll &nbsp; c:\windows\system32</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the existing file and then you should see a message that 1 file(s) was copied.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is possible (but unlikely) that the winsrv.dll file is also missing from the dllcache folder, but depending on your configuration&nbsp;there may also be a good copy of the winsrv.dll file in this folder:</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>So if the first copy command fails with some kind of a file not found message, enter this command:</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>copy c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386\winsrv.dll &nbsp; c:\windows\system32</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>Remove the Recovery Console CD and type 'exit' to restart your system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If that all goes well, you may want to reconsider your antimalware and antivirus products or supplement them with some other&nbsp;products.</div>
<div><br />
<div>One good thing is that you will now have a bootable XP Recovery Console CD for some other XP rainy day.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</div>
<div><br />
<div>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download the ISO file from here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Press any key to boot from CD...</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete, cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any problems on the afflicted drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</div>
<div><br />
<div>chkdsk C: /r</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount
 to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</div>

<h3> danielzeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update, taskbar issue Jan 2016</h2>
                    <p>The recent windows 10 update, has made my taskbar not work right. I can click the icons and most of them work. Except, the windows icon, Cortana, and the help/message icons. Even trying to press the windows key, it will not open my little n menu bar thing.
 I can't even right click any of my icons taskbar. But it's only on my primary user, the other users on this computer, the taskbar works just fine.&nbsp; I've shut down my computer several times, restarted it. Still nothing. What is going on here? I've looked in
 several places and it seems nobody else has this issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you though for the link, I probably wouldn't have found the other one otherwise. To answer your question though, the only changes that occurred was with the update, otherwise I did not have any changes done prior, or after. All the updates were already
 installed, basically my OS was up to date. I don't know why the task bar had issues, it was fine before the update. So maybe there's a problem somewhere that only effects some people. Perhaps it should be looked into, regardless thank you for answering.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 backup is not completing, gets stuck at 67&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I still have not been able to complete a successful backup in Windows 7 Backup Wizard.&nbsp; The current disk is now in the drive (started at about 8:30 pm), It's now 10:19 pm. The process is about "67% complete" and I have yet to see any messages telling me
 to insert another disk.&nbsp; Also, I have noticed that at about 40% I stop seeking the files to be added to the backup shown in the Windows Backup Percentage panel. It's almost the time where I'll likely the that the disk is full (the red bar will appear in the
 Computer View) I have done a drag and drop backup so that is not the issue.&nbsp; I am more interested and getting the Windows 7 Operating system to function properly.</p>
<p>I upgraded to the Windows 7 Professional platform and I have yet to fuly utilize this particular feature.&nbsp; Thursday evening&nbsp; I called tech support and was on the phone for
<strong>almost&nbsp;2 hours with technicians who said "I will be happy</strong> <strong>
to help you resolve your problem."&nbsp; It became downright infuriating to have to repeat my problem, over and over to each tech</strong>
<strong>I kept getting passed to while getting no where&nbsp; Each one kept asking me what I wanted them to do or if I wanted&nbsp;him to help me with a backup.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also had to keep saying:&nbsp; I HAVE A BACKUP.&nbsp;THERE IS SOME KIND&nbsp;OF GLITCH/DEFECT&nbsp;IN WINDOWS 7 THAT UNDERMINES
 THE</strong> <strong>COMPLETION OF A BACKUP.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;would like to be able to complete a&nbsp;successful backup in the Backup Wizard.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't want anything else.</strong>&nbsp;My call dropped off my cell hone and the final tech never bothered to call me back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that I have seen this same problem before no less than 3 times on this forum and I have followed all posted suggestions on this forum given me with the same result.&nbsp; I've done an advanced disk check of all my drives that took almost 3 hours, disabled
 my security software, set up the backup to only back up C drive, drag and drop.&nbsp;The only suggestion I did not take was to install some other program downloaded from the Internet since I'd just plunked down almost $650 for a brand new computer and that feedback
 did not make sense. &nbsp;Please help!!!</p>

<p>Thank you for the information. There is a possibility that the settings is not detecting the Outlook application that is why it is not showing as an option. We suggest performing a repair on your Outlook application. Kindly follow the steps on this<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>&nbsp;</span>article</a></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to
 perform a repair. After you perform the repair, kindly check the settings and see if you'll be able to set the Outlook app as your default program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the repair did not work, we recommend uninstalling your Office 365 then reinstall it back afterwards. This is to refresh the settings and make sure that the application doesn't encounter any corruption. Kindly follow the steps under<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>2016<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>category&nbsp;on
 this<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to uninstall it, it also has
 the steps on how to reinstall it back.&nbsp;</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level

                    <p>My mother-in-law is getting a blue band for 8.1 upgrade across her screen and is not able to do anything with her computer.&nbsp; She is in another city and I do not have 8 on any of my machines, so I am not sure how to help.&nbsp; She does not want to upgrade at
 this time, but she was not able to get rid of it.&nbsp; I had her shut down and restart and then it came up with a Remind Me Later option.&nbsp; How can we get rid of this for her?&nbsp; She is not real comfortable with computers and I am just not sure how to help her.&nbsp;

            <p>I would suggest starting with the Windows Eventviewer (but you'll have to know approximately the date/time the error occurred to find the exact error). If you are not sure, just check the log for Errors (ones with a red symbol).<br />
<br />

            <p>I tried updating to 8.1.&nbsp; There were a myriad of problems.&nbsp; The biggest one was that I was blocked from access via VPN Client&nbsp;to my computer at work, an essential feature since I work from home often.&nbsp; I ended up having to reload Windows 8 from scratch.&nbsp;
 It&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;took many hours of my time.&nbsp; The biggest mistake I made was purchasing a computer with Windows 8 in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Norton has a warning about this which I sadly didn't see until after the fiasco.&nbsp; I do not want to upgrade to 8.1.&nbsp; I need to know how to stop the infamous blue band giving no choice but to upgrade.</p>

<p>When two of us are playing Ryse: Son of Rome under different playlists, I cannot quit my session and turn the game over to another signed-in player unless I turn the console off and restart it with the other player logged in.&nbsp; Even if I sign out and the
 other player signs in, Ryse: Son of Rome caches my session and will not give a clean restart to the other player.&nbsp; I don't know if this behavior is unique to Ryse: Son of Rome or is a general Xbox One "feature."&nbsp; Please advise. Mrod</p>

    <title>Blank print pages when printing from Word 2007, WordPad and Notepad, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tncharlie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blank print pages when printing from Word 2007, WordPad and Notepad, prints fine from other programs </h2>
                    <strong>Weird printing problem</strong>
<p><br />
Okay, in Windows Vista and using an HP Deskjet 645c with up to date driver, here's the weirdness:</p>
<p>When printing from Word 2007, Wordpad and Notepad, the sheet goes through the printer appearing to print, but no printing actually takes place. Same for both existing documents and for newly created ones. On the other hand, everything prints normally from
 IE8, Firefox, and Adobe Reader. Reinstalled the printer driver and also deleted the Word data key in the registry. No love. Ran automated troubleshooting from MS, but still no love as it didn't find any problems. Anyone have any good idea? Seems it must be
 something in common between Word, Wordpad and Notepad, which I'm guessing are at least somewhat related in code, or perhaps in how they address the printer driver.</p>

<p><span>Hi TNCharlie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>I
 would like to clarify if you are</span><span>just trying to print text or inserting objects into Word and WordPad?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Damaged graphics and fonts can cause printing issues in Word/WordPad<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you using a wireless printer?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Check to see if it makes any difference if connected.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;Step 1:</span></strong><span>
 Test this in word &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.</span></span><span>Open a new blank document in Word.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.</span></span><span>On the first line of the document, type the following text:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=rand(10)</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.</span></span><span>Press ENTER. This inserts 10 paragraphs of sample text.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.</span></span><span>Try to print the document.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.</span></span><span>If the document prints successfully, change to a different font, or insert clip art,
 a table, or a drawing object</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Am not sure if you have tried
 this fixit, please run the fixit available in the link below and check if that makes any difference<br />

<h2>            Removing failed Windows 7 choice from boot screen</h2>
                    My attempts to do a clean install of Windows 7 on a neawly created partition on a 32 bit XP machine have failed. I have erased the partition, but when I restart, I still get a "choose which OS to boot into" screen, with Windows 7 or "earlier version of
 windows" as the two options. How do I removed the Windows 7 option, seeing as the partition I attempted to install it on is now blank?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            right click 'my computer' - select properties<br />
select the 'advanced' tab<br />
on the 'startup and recovery section (the bottom of the window) - select the 'settings' button<br />
Select the default operating system - in your case the 'earlier version of windows'<br />
untick the 'time to display list of operating systems' box.<br />
<br />
reboot the machine.<br />
<br />
The boot menu will still 'exist', however it will go straight to booting your earlier version of windows without giving you any options, or a 30 second count down etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this helps :)<br />

<h2>            OneDrive is destroying my new Windows10 Home 64bit system</h2>
                    <p>Today, I walked away from my computer for a rest. 4 hours later I'm back (didn't turn off) and my system is a mess. I have 21 'new' entries on my desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Among them are: dup's of software short-cuts, Double links to on-line games, double links to music folders (with actual music in them) on my hard-drive BUT the mp3's are NOT the same and many are not even currently on my hard-drive at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OneDrive system is all default settings as I never address it at all during system setup about a month ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I just delete all 21 new links and folders on my desktop and be done with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I need to delete the whole mess and reinstall windows as Microsoft often suggests to fix most any issue with Windows10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere it stated, I have nearly 2gb of data on OneDrive (oh my lord!) How to stop this and remove what is there now?</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Onedrive would not cause desktop duplicating, at least i hope not.
<br />I am thinking it might the issue of syncing with accounts.
<br />Try this.
<br />Go to start - settings - accounts - sync your settings and turn it off.

<p>Hi Valerie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a new device that was recently added to your computer system, it needs a driver update to let your peripherals run properly on your computer. If the plug and play feature doesn’t work, you will need to install it manually. In your case, this device may

            Thank you for responding. <br />
I have not been able to think of any changes that led to the appearance of the alert.<br />
I believe my computer is clean. I use Malewarebytes, I scan every couple of days. I use Microsoft firewall. And MicroSoft Security Essentials which I usually run every day and also Windows Defender. All security programs are up to date.&nbsp;Defender is the only
 thing that alerts me about Akamai netsession. Several times a day it alerts me to changes in the firewall configuration. Its the same alert every time. I have tried denying it and I have also allowed it to see if it made a difference in anything but I continue
 to get alerts either way. I also run Spyware Blaster. I just installed Prevx. I run Windows Live One Care safety scan about once a month. I am not finding any infections. I just don't know if this Akamai is an infection of some kind or a legitimate program.
 I am finding different answers online when I Google it.

            Well, Akamai is a distributed server network.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Akamai&amp;i=37635,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Akamai&amp;i=37635,00.asp</a>
<br />
<br />
By itself it's nothing bad and lots of companies use it for streaming web content and that sort of thing. What concerns me in your case is the attempt to change firewall settings. You certainly have done a lot of security scans and it would seem unlikely that
 your computer is infected. So what did you install just before this started happening? A new media-related program? Do you have any "media servers" running on the machine?<br />
<br />
You should try running the free TCPView utility to see where the Akamai server lives:<br />

<br />
<br />
If you can get a remote IP address, you can then do a Whois lookup on it.<br />

            I don't recall installing anything that would have anything to do with this. The only thing I've installed lately is SpyWare Blaster. I have downloaded games but that's nothing out of the ordinary.<br />
I don't really understand the TCPView but I did run it and since I don't really know what I was seeing I'm not sure of what I found. I found the Akamai listed and followed it to something called EGI Hosting, something to do with streaming media.<br />
I'm not very knowledgable about a lot to do with the computer. I run so much security because I'm paranoid of infections. I don't really seem to feel like I have picked up an infection though. Just concerned about what is happening with the firewall and how
 to stop the changes.

            Post the IP address for the Akamai server that TCPView shows, please. What games did you install? It's likely that one of them has a "phone home" component like Punkbuster.

            This stated happening to me too, and I run Photoshop Elements, which checks in with Adobe for license checks/spying/ whatever you want to call it... that may be the answer... it's the only new thing I loaded....

    <title>xbox 360 wireless controller burnt out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacksully1  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox 360 wireless controller burnt out</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 20/11/2017 I purchased xbox 360 for my son for Christmas. Last night while playing he came running down saying his controller was on fire. I could smell burning and see smoke coming out of controller. He was using a very reputable battery in controller
 at the time.</p>
<p>The controller stopped working. we brought it back to where it was purchased but as it was 1 month out of warranty they wouldn't even look at it. instead telling me email xbox. trying to find a valid mail address is like looking for water in the sahara desert.
 any help appreciated. this could have been very serious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hello Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that there was smoke emitting from your Xbox 360 controller, as you mentioned a reputable battery was in use as well as the controller itself being one month out of warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to discuss a few things:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Xbox accessories only contain 90 days of warranty, if there was a different warranty applied to the controller then it would be best to handle that with the point of purchase</li><li>Can you confirm which reputable battery was in use?</li><li>Did this happen wirelessly or wired directly into the console within the process of charging?</li><li>To check if assistance may be provided by our support team, it would be best to access our
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device support</a></strong> section on our website</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Clarify the information for us and we'll await your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p><span>Hi XBF Javier R,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your prompt reply. In answer to your questions</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My son was using Duracell AA batteries</span></p>
<p><span>He always plays wireless he never directly wires into console</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried to access Device support on your website however when I enter my country code and number for a call back it states that this is not possible. I am not on twitter so this is not an option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just to clarify my son came running down stairs to me telling me he could smell burning from the controller. I took it off him and I could see wispy acrid smoke coming out from the controller. I immediately took out the
 batteries and this stopped the smoking.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could have been very serious if my son had not noticed and fallen asleep with the controller on his bed we could have lost our home.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once again thank you for your reply </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hey Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. We do have certain procedures in place for situations like these if they meet certain criteria. The best course of action, would be to help you setup a call or live chat with one of our representatives through our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Support</a> site. Please provide a in detail a description of what happened with the controller and we will let you know what options if any we can help you out with. P.S. Depending
 on your country, you might have to use a phone number rather than our support site. Cheers! :D</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Duracell Rechargeable AA batteries in my controller so your post has caught my eye as it leaves me wondering if there is an issue with them that I need to keep an eye on as the risk of fire is indeed a serious concern. I'm glad that your family and
 home are safe following this experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your post doesn't include some relevant details so I'm wondering if maybe an incorrect insertion occurred that caused the batteries or the controller to overheat (eg one or both put in backwards) as I've never heard of a wireless controller developing a
 fault like this. Were the batteries hot when you removed them? Was the smoke coming from the controller itself or from the batteries and venting out of the top of the controller? Were they inserted into the controller correctly?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the smoke was coming from the batteries, have you considered contacting Duracell since this is a non-Microsoft sourced product?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the controller is the source of the smoke then I wish you well in contacting Microsoft Support to help you investigate and resolve this serious issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Disk Defragmenter not analyzing C-drive - Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've had my Gateway laptop running Windows 7 for approx 5 months and until a few weeks ago, had no problems.&nbsp; It has recently been running slow so I've done some system maintenance to it to try to help it along.</p>
<p>I've recently performed:</p>
<p>CCleaner- including all temp, downloads, recycle bin and unneccessary file deletion, Disk Cleanup(c-drive), Kaspersky Anti-Virus full scan, and attempted to defragment the c-drive.</p>
<p>Here's the problem.....it is analyzing the drive and stops at 89% every time.&nbsp; It will not move past this point, therefore will not begin to defragment.</p>
<p>HELP PLEASE!</p>

<p>Is the drive a solid state or conventional sata drive?</p>
<p><span>Select Start, Run, type cmd and press ENTER. Type "chkdsk c: /f /r" without the quotes and hit ENTER.&nbsp;Make sure you include the spaces indicated. Enter Y when asked
 whether you wish to run chkdsk on restarting the computer. Exit and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Marking off bad sectors on a hard drive takes time so be patient. Marking off does not repair a bad sector. It places pointers on the drive telling the system not
 to read or write to those sectors which have been damaged.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the number of bad sectors continues to increase after you have run the procedure above several times then you should replace the drive.
 If an important system file is written to a bad sector you can corrupt registry hives and lose the whole contents of the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand if having run chkdsk you see no more new bad sectors then the drive can work for you for years.</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            It could be that there is a lot to analyze.... <br />
<br />
You could try setting it to defrag and then leaving it on all night to see if it gets beyond 89%.
<br />
<br />
I heard of someone waiting 2 days before it finally went past the "89% barrier", so it may take a while. If it goes beyond a few days with no progress, it is hung up and something else is wrong.<br />
<br />
The procedure below has proven very effective at resolving the built-in defragmenter issues.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;There are several reasons why the built-in defragger may not work properly: <br />
<br />
0. There is malware on the system. Solution: Run an Anti-Virus check and also a Spyware check (you already did the AV check, but you might download Ad-Aware and see if it finds any Spyware or Adware).
<br />
<br />
1. The disk is too full (you need at least 15% free space, sometimes 20%). Solution: Delete unneeded files and programs till you have more than 20% free space.
<br />
<br />
2. The disk is damaged and needs to be repaired. Solution (this is the windows version of Gerry Cornell's command prompt directions -- skip if already done): &nbsp;<br />
<br />
a. Open "My Computer" and right click on the drive you want to check. &nbsp;<br />
b. Select "Properties" and click on the "Tools" tab. &nbsp;<br />
c. Select "Check now" to check the disk for errors. &nbsp;<br />
d. Select both options and click "start"; <br />
<br />
(It may take a while and the PC may re-start so it can do the check at boot time. Be patient and let it complete).
<br />
<br />
3. Disk Defragmenter may be corrupted, needing a System Restore to correct it. Solution: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
a. Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - System Restore (click&nbsp;to open);<br />
b. Select a restore point well before you started having problems with Disk Defragmenter;<br />
c. Start the restore process and let it complete (Name the restore operation something descriptive like "Defrag Repair").
<br />
<br />
4. There are other programs running that interrupt the built-in defragmenter. Solution:<br />
a. Close all running programs.<br />
b. If you suspect there may be some programs&nbsp;running in the background,<br />
c. Press&nbsp;Ctrl+Alt+Delete and<br />
d. Select "Start Task Manager"<br />
e. Under the "Applications" tab you will find a list of all running applications -- you can close these by selecting "End Task."
<br />
<br />
5. If still no luck, try disabling the screen saver when running Disk Defrag (you should pretty much leave the system alone when running the built-in defrag utility).
<br />
<br />
6. If still no go, try running the defragmenter in Safe Mode. If it runs, something is interfering with it and tracking the interference down may not be easy. Note: Some versions of Win 7 disable the ability to run the built in defragger in safe mode. If disabled,
 it will say so when trying to run it in safe mode. <br />
<br />
7. Disk Defragmenter may no longer be on the system or is so corrupted that it needs a re-install. Solution:&nbsp;Re-install the built-in.<br />
<br />
There are several methods to re-install the built-in defragger:<br />
<br />
A:<br />
a. Open the "Start" menu. <br />
b. Type "%Windir%\Inf" in the "Search" box and press "Enter". <br />
c. In the window that opens, find the file named "dfrg.inf". <br />
d. Right-click on "dfrg.inf" and "Install." <br />
<br />
B:<br />
a. Go to "Start &gt; Run" on your computer.<br />
b. Type "rundll32.exe setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 132 %windir%\inf\dfrg.inf" and press "Enter"<br />
3. Click "OK" to make the program automatically reinstall itself.<br />
<br />
C:<br />
a. Go to Start &gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;Right Click on Command Prompt&gt; select "Run As Administrator"<br />
b. At command prompt, type "regsvr32 dfrgsnap.dll" and hit "Enter."<br />
c. Type "regsvr32 dfrgui.dll" and hit "Enter." This will reinstall any missing defragger files.<br />
<br />
8. Most problems will resolve by #6 above, but if not&nbsp;and if your windows install is otherwise running fine, you should consider downloading a free trial of a commercial defrag tool as opposed to doing drastic actions to restore the built-in's functionality.
 Third party programs&nbsp; are more robust and many work in the background so you can use your PC while defragging.
<br />
<br />
Most third party programs offer a free, fully-functional trial (the better ones are for 30 days). Installing one of these will disable the built-in and if you decide to uninstall it, removal will replace the built-in, many times repairing it in the process
 -- it's worth a try. . ..<br />
<br />
Here is a recent Top 10 Reviews side-by-side comparison of the best&nbsp;defrag programs available:<br />
<br />
http://disk-defragmenter-software-review.toptenreviews.com/<br />
<br />
a. Select a program and install it. The better defrag programs are automatic and the top placers in the above review can defrag while using the PC. The top placer was the only
<a href="http://www.diskeeper.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">defrag</a> program&nbsp;that prevented fragmentation (see the review).
<br />
<br />
b. Defragment your disk drives.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you! <br />
<br />

<br />
PS: If still no go, repair may involve registry editing or repairing the windows installation and possibly re-installing windows itself. These are not simple solutions. If needed, state so and they can be provided.<br />

 I move it back and get it to work on the surface again?

<h2>            Multiple network connections - not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp;I am having issues with multiple connections. &nbsp;I travel daily and use WiFi for my internet connection. &nbsp;I also have a NAS (WD MyCloud) that I take with me and use for a media server. &nbsp;This is connected through a Belkin N300 router. &nbsp;I have tried
 multiple "fixes" on the internet to get the multiple networks to work simultaneously, but nothing seems to work. &nbsp;If I connect to the WiFi first and then plug in the ethernet cable, I can use both (surf the net and access the NAS) for about 10 minutes. &nbsp;Then
 the WiFi stops working, DNS errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to make this work? &nbsp;It would be really nice to watch some media on my NAS while downloading the materials I need for work and currently that is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I got it!&nbsp; I set my laptop NIC card to a static IP within my routers range, but I did not specify a default gateway.&nbsp; Anyone else with this problem, here is a fix for you.

<h2>            Move MS Office from Win7 to XP virtual machine</h2>
                    I just ran my first Windows 7 Pro 64bit install on a new system, and I set up XP mode.&nbsp; I installed MS Office 2003 (yes, we're still there) in Windows 7, not realizing it would not be available in XP mode.&nbsp; Can I migrate my Office 2003 from Win7 to the
 virtual XP machine without needing another CD key?

            <p>You would have to read the EULA for your version of Office 2003 and see what it says about multiple installs with the one Product Key.&nbsp; Some Licenses allow for multiple installs under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't qualify for extra installs then you would have to uninstall from Windows 7 and install in XP.&nbsp; If there are any Activation problems these should be easily fixed via a Phone Activation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When in Windows 7 you should be able to run Office (virtually) from XP (Mode) without starting the VM.</p>
