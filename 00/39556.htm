<h2>            Mouse pointer spazzing out &#40;moving wildly around the screen&#41;</h2>
                    So, I'm used in Visa Home Premium and a Microsoft Basic Optical Mouse, but this issue also pops up with any other mouse I use. Basically, whenever I can moving the mouse, it will randomly spaz out and jump to another part of the screen. I updated the drivers
 on all of the mice I've used, but it still does this. Any way to fix this? Not only is it plain annoying in general use, it makes playing games borderline impossible.

            Sadly, it did not. Neither did the other support topic that it linked to do anything for me.

            Hi, kk_581
<br />
<br /> I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />The following command will do a full scan of the protected system files on your computer and fix any file that are causing issues while Windows 10 is up and running. 
<br />1. Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select Command Prompt (Admin), as you will need administrator permissions to run SFC. 
<br />2. In the Command Prompt type the following command and press Enter: 
<br />sfc /scannow 
<br />1. Once the scan completes, you will see one of the following messages: 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations:This indicates that your system doesn't have any missing or corrupted files. 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation: This message means that there was a problem during the scan and an offline scan is required. 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: You will get this message when SFC was able to fix the problem. Now, you can move on or you can view the logs to get more details. 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: In this case, you'll need to repair the corrupted files manually. 
<br />Quick Tip: You may want to run the command around three times to fix all the problems. 
<br />
<br />Please see this great 3rd party link for a complete step-by-step guide

    <title>Skype Call Hacked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imlewis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Call Hacked</h2>
                    <p>I placed a call to a good and reliable landline number in Japan through Skype, and verified that I dialed the number correctly.&nbsp; Rather than being answered in Japanese by the woman who owns the number, it was answered by unfamiliar male voice in English.&nbsp;
 He identified himself as a Dr. Jiro, and made repeated fallacious statements that caused my distress.&nbsp; Through normal phone service to a party related to the woman, I verified that the person who answered was not at the woman's location where the landline
 terminates, and that the information he provided was completely inaccurate and nefarious.&nbsp; Not only do I need to receive credit for this call, but I am quite concerned about the security and reliability of my Skype account and the Skype calling service.&nbsp; Please
 let me know what can be done about this matter, and how I should proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 setup boot loader is stucking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slymaximus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 setup boot loader is stucking</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install Windows 10 on my <a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/support/model/NP-RC710-S01UK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Samsung RC710">
laptop</a>&nbsp;but, despite of Win 7 or Win 8.1 that are running fine, it stucks in the moment the setup is booting and after few seconds when the SSD is running it stops doing anything. This is happening if I'm trying the Win 7/8.1 upgrade to Win 10 or if I'm
 running the setup of a Win 10 x64 Enterprise or Pro on DVD (used to install Win10 successfully on a PC).<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a4bba4c-12c0-497b-88fd-b56e7ee74879" /><br />
That's all I get after the upgrade reboot or clean setup installation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both previous mentioned OS-es run perfect on my laptop.</p>
<p>Out of the standard configuration I'm using a Kingston V300 480GB SSD and a 4GB RAM extension but this doesn't change the situation cause I replaced that additional RAM memory and used the original laptop's HDD and RAM but I got no improvements.<br />
Any advice from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-a-list-of-things-to-do-if-windows-10-setup/eba3c864-d9fe-4f8e-9468-81b1f89473ed">
here</a> doesn't seems to add any improvement.<br />
<br />
Is it something else that I can do, out of buying other laptop or hoping that someday Microsoft will provide a better OS setup boot loader?</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;<br />
I am afraid I was not correctly understood.<br />
<p>
</p><p>Despite of any Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 with the Windows 10 setup after boot I get
<strong>only one step</strong> (what you see in my picture) and nothing more. So I cannot do any "Windows repair" or "Install Windows" phase. I don't know if it's possible to collect some logging data from that setup phase (during the boot phase). Let me know
 if I can collect some data for you (thinking to some kind of F8 or how to have access to some logging phase on that setup boot phase).<br />
<br />
Even if it's not my case, reading <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dn798755.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>&nbsp;where is specifying "<em>For 64-bit installations, a small number of older PCs may be blocked from installation because they do not support CMPXCHG16b, PrefetchW, and LAHF/SAHF</em>", I tried a x86 .ISO but I got the same situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imho, there is something wrong within the setup boot loader and this causes the setup to stuck.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
It seems it's a common issue for Samsung laptops and the problem is generated by the Wifi card. I already ordered a brand new Wifi card that should work and I will let you know if it works.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, having in consider that there were no issues with the original Wifi card within Windows XP/Vista/7/8.1 please take in consider a backward compatibility issue within Windows 10 boot loader.</p>

The conclusion is that that backward compatibility issue of Windows 10 really exists.

<h2>            Asus TF600T Not showing update 8.1 even after tutorials.</h2>
                    Hello!
<div>I own a Asus VivoTab TF600T and have Windows RT 8.1 Preview installed from a few months back.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I try to find a way to get the official 8.1 update but can't really get it to work.</div>
<div>What I did is using the Modern UI to find updates, no luck.</div>
<div>Then I tried the windows classic UI Windows Updates, activating "Search for other product drivers". No luck here aswel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried to find the update&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1); font-weight: bold">KB 2871389,</span>&nbsp;but doesn't appear in my Installed Updates list, and the device has no more updates to install.</div>
<div>I did the "run/wsreset.exe" and that did not show any results.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to have this update in order to get the tablet back in Italian, as I sold it to an Italian friend.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck after Lock Screen and take a huge time to get the password prompt</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I have upgraded my Lenovo Desktop with Windows 10 Aniversery Update. All went well except one issue I'm dealing with.</p>
<p>Actually on every boot my PC stuck just after clicking on lock screen and after that a circle of dots that keep rotating for a long time say almost 10-15 mins and after that long wait and putting my pasword, its works fine with no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone get me a workaround to get rid of this waiting time? Looking for quick fix for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro. x64 (Version 1607)</p>
<p>Machine Make: Lenovo&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Prem,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing while signing to Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue occurs in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>. Safe mode with Networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below link to Enable Safe Mode with Networking.</p>

<span>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please restart the computer to start in normal mode.</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<p>　</p>
</span></strong>
<p>If issue persists, try creating a <strong>new local administrator account </strong>
and check if you are able to sign in to Windows 10. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Press <strong>Windows logo</strong> key + <strong>R</strong>, type
<strong>ms-settings:</strong>, and then select <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Select <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Family &amp; other people
</strong>(or <strong>Other people </strong>, if you’re using Windows 10 Enterprise).</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Under <strong>Other people </strong>, select <strong>Add someone else to this PC</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>On Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Professional, provide a name for the user and a password, and
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then select <strong>Next</strong>. On Windows 10 Enterprise, select <strong>
I don’t have this person’s sign-in information</strong>, and </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then select <strong>Add a user without a Microsoft account</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Set a user name, password, and password hint. Then select <strong>
Next</strong> &gt; <strong>Finish</strong>. Sign in to the new account and </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; check if System Tray and Time appears on the Taskbar.</p>

<p><span>Dear Microsoft and it's Enforcement Team,</span></p>
<p><span>Please be put on notice that I have been in contact with Microsoft (MS) Customer services via telephone and will be making a formal complaint against MS (Xbox Support Management @ Thames Valley Park), and in particular the enforcement team, due to
 its complete lack of any support with an issue of my young son receiving offensive messages and as a parent I have no way of making contact to get the matter investigated.</span></p>
<p><span>I will also be getting my message across to any other MS related forums, rest assured a stink will be kicked up as I am furious about the lack of attention to a clear child safety issue.</span></p>
<p><span>MS Ambassador Chat, referred to MS Chat. MS Chat referred to Forums. Tried forum, no response. Phoned customer services, referred back to forums. Tried forum again, no response. Phoned again, referred back to forums. Elevated to supervisor at customer
 services, eventually told nothing can be done, have to use forums. BUT THEY DON@T RESPOND!!!!</span></p>
<p><span>I am sure this will disappear into the either the same way as other attempted posts.</span></p>

<p>If your son has been receiving offensive messages, the solution is to choose the "block communications" option , and mute the sender.Your issue is quite a common one, and nothing can be done &nbsp;, other than the options listed above. If you used family settings,
 this "stink' would not need to be kicked up. Using family settings, you can have it to where he can only hear and receive messages from people he adds.</p>

 its complete lack of any support with an issue of my young son receiving offensive messages and as a parent I have no way of making contact to get the matter investigated.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">The ONLY way to file a complaint against an offender is via the tools on your console. Select the gamer tag of the offender, view profile, file a complaint. Calling Phone Support will do nothing to help you since they are
 not the people who deal with policy enforcement. As for the lack of support, there are numerous tools and settings on your console and his account that can prevent just about anything. What he needs to do after filing the complaint on the console is he needs
 to MUTE, BLOCK COMMUNICATIONS and lastly adjust his online status to friends only. Now anyone on his friends list can not see when or where he is online.
</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I will also be getting my message across to any other MS related forums, rest assured a stink will be kicked up as I am furious about the lack of attention to a clear child safety issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">If you truly are fearful of his safety then you should remove his headset while he plays games, one isn't necessary for him to play a game. Also if you are truly fearful of his safety then perhaps you should be in the room
 when he is playing online. There are many things you can do to help protect him.
</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Use the tools/settings on your console and his account (since he is a child I will assume he has a child account? You did use his real age when he created his account? If so then there are extra settings that can be adjusted to
 protect him) and you won't have to worry anymore.</span> </p>

<p>Thank you people for the quick responses it is appreciated despite the perhaps patronising tinge to some (Temhotabot). However, whilst helpful the point is still missed to some extent. Thank you in particular WPAK, very helpful, I wish I had thought to try
 this forum in the first instance.</p>
<p>There were 2-3 text messages received, one of which was quite shocking in its content. It was received from one of his xbox gamer friends who is also at his school and is 12yrs old. I am suspecting/hoping that maybe an older sibling or friend may have “hijacked”
 his console and sent the message. My son knows he can only xbox friend people he knows personally. I have implemented various blocks on the account settings but none of this could have prevented the offending message. Despite the latter I do also want him
 to have some degree of trust and responsibility with his use on xbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, immediately upon seeing the offending message I had choice to delete or block, I chose block but didn't realise at the time that this also deletes the message, nothing warns you of this. I needed the message content to both contact MS but also importantly
 to contact the gamers parents as he is local. It is somewhat tricky to approach someone with a claim of something unpleasant but have no proof to back it up. If I was in their shoes I would want to know if such a message had been sent from my sons console,
 however it came about. There were other non-offensive messages and a voice messages from this gamer but as he was now blocked I could not access the voice message so I had to get my son to do a friend request to the gamer to get access to the voice message.
 Surely you can sympathise that this is not ideal.</p>
<p>After the above I then made extensive efforts in trying to get help and this is where the point is missed. Whilst there may be all sorts of bells and whistles and settings it can nonetheless get somewhat complicated, in particular for those not so young
 or gamer savvy. I have set certain restrictions on the account but it is not always that simple to navigate and indeed fully understand.
</p>
<p>As noted I followed the Xbox web site guidance on making contact, nobody produced a solution and I was simply directed into making contact to a specific forum (09 - Xbox 360 Account Suspensions &amp; Console Bans) and my 2no. posts never received the courtesy
 of any response other than an automated email to note receipt of the post.</p>
<p>It should not be that hard to get help and what is an important issue. If I chat, email or phone customer services in any other major business they will either deal with the matter or direct you to colleagues who can help. &nbsp;With MS Xbox I am eventually directed
 to a specific forum that doesn’t respond and am also told there is no other way either I or even MS customer services can contact them, how ridiculous is that! A senior supervisor at MS customer services sympathised with my view but nonetheless could not help
 and suggested I register a complaint which I am intending to do. </p>
<p>It’s v.poor customer service for me as a gamer/customer and parent whatever way you frame it.</p>

<p>If you report the offending gamertag via the console as has been mentioned in the previous responses, the enforcement team will investigate and take the appropriate actions. &nbsp;That is all you need to do other than blocking the gamertag. &nbsp;You don't need to
 be "archiving" any messages for this to be looked into. &nbsp;Just report and it will be looked into eventually. &nbsp;This is the only thing to do.</p>

<p>I agree this is how it should work unfortunately Microsoft seem to be hit and miss about who they punish, my son received a vile message from another player a few weeks ago threatening death and various other crimes, he reported it straight away yet the
 player is still active, it's time Microsoft tightened up on this and gave harsh punishment to these people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a copy of the message my son received if anyone at Microsoft is interested in doing something.</p>

            Hi Piotrek, 
<br />
<br />Skype Translator is based on the artificial intelligence and uses machine learning so it gets smarter when you use it. But the machine translation is not perfect and can make mistakes. 
<br />
<br />But if you don’t understand the language but want to express yourself in this language, the machine translation will help. Your contact who is a native speaker will understand what you are speaking about.
<br />
<br />Please, visit this link to get additional information:

</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to the missing/corrupted apps files &amp; folders present in the computer. Presence of corrupted and missing apps files &amp; folders will result in irregular performance of the computer.</span></p>

</p><p><span>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and
 the Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue persists, create another administrator user account by referring to

            ok ty I did the search to see if anything needed to be fixed but it was ok not had anymore problems with unwanted adds as of yet so I'm thinking it is and exploit that Microsoft is unaware of but ill keep monitoring this community site for any ideas but
 thinking Microsoft well find it now that some are finding it and because it is cookies most people might not know what is happening&nbsp;&nbsp; but the cookies can be used to avoid blockers and Microsoft needs to look at them to stop unwanted adds from being used to
 bother us but thank you for your advice &nbsp;LV &nbsp;

            OH ya look at the disclosure about cookies and adds and I think this is why Microsoft is not aware of the unwanted adds that are getting sent and they cant be opted out so as to tell add company's to not bother us that is my complaint also cookies can
 be used to spread viruses the virus protections don't see them till it is to late because the cookies can be seen at first as part of the&nbsp;OS till the virus is active then it is to late but even with the disclosure clause for cookies and adds the opt out should
 still stop unwanted adds but dose not work for windows 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

            ok cookies where slowing down web browsing i was getting more and more&nbsp; adds but i enabled privet web browsing and finally got the opt out to work so far so good the browser is working much faster and the web sites i visit have no adds any more it is the
 cookies so get kaspersky and use the privet web browsing get or find a free opt out and you should find that windows 10 much nicer to us now i hope it stays this way and i hope this helps others as well

                    For the last few days, Windows Live Mail pops open a few seconds after I close it. &nbsp;I'm on Windows 7 and have made no recent anti-virus software updates or changes.&nbsp; How can I keep it closed until I need it?

<span>Hi,<br />
<br />
That is odd. To remove the possibility of a&nbsp;corrupted&nbsp;program file in Windows Live Mail client is causing the issue,&nbsp;I suggest that you repair your mail client using the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Go to <b>Control Panel.<br />
</b>2. Under <b>Programs,</b> click <b>Uninstall a Program</b>.<br />
3. Locate<b> Windows Live Essential 2011</b>, then click <b>Uninstall/Change</b>.<br />
4. When a window appears, select <b>Repair all Windows Live programs</b>.<br />
5. Restart your computer after the repair.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</span></p>

<h2>            Will Windows 10 have DVD Maker that&#39;s included in Windows 7 Home Premium&#63;</h2>
                    I'm alright with still having Windows Media Player. My question is will we still have Windows DVD Maker? I know that Windows Essentials will still be on Windows 10 which includes Movie Maker and the Photo Gallery.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I use Windows DVD Maker a lot. I have Windows 7 Home Premium SP1, and I also use what is called VCR 2 PC. It's an actual VCR that has a USB plug in. I can save or record what ever I'm watching on the VHS tapes to my video file on my laptop. I then use Windows
 DVD Maker to burn a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm wanting to know if there will still be Windows DVD Maker with Windows 10 so I can continue to burn DVDs after I save videos to the video file.</p>

<h3> el  micro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Local account in windows 10 at login missing after changing the account type using netplwiz</h2>
                    Recently, a tech support&nbsp;from Microsoft changed the account type in my Windows 10 local account listed as (Other : Home Users, ?) to Administrator using the NETPLWIZ command. After he did some work on my computer, he changed the account type of the account
 back to (Other : Home Users). He was not able to change back to the original account type of the account (Other: Home Users, ?, I didn't remember the second item) because that was not listed there. Group user of Home Users is the closest match for the original
 Homes Users, ?. As the result, the local account icon is now missing on the screen when I boot up the computer and try to login in.&nbsp; I also checked the User Account using the Control Panel, the local account is not listed there either. What can cause this
 problem ? Can Anyone help me get my local account back when I try to login in and get the local account registered in User Account again ?&nbsp;

<p><span>Thank you for replying.</span></p>

<p><span>May I know, if you tried the command:
<strong>net user </strong><strong><span>"Local account's name"</span></strong><strong> /active:yes</strong> in CMD as Admin mode?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can try to check, if you are able to see the Local account on User Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<strong>Netplwiz </strong>in Windows search bar and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the window, check the section
<strong><span>Users for this computer</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the Local account in the list, you can try to change the
<strong><span>Group Membership</span></strong> of the account and check on the login screen.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the Local account and click on Properties.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Standard user, click on
<strong><span>Apply</span></strong> and
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In case you don't see the Local account, then we need to create a new user account and transfer all the Local account's data. Please refer the suggestion from my first post.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We await your response.</span></p>

            I have that very same command in my prompt right now the netplwiz (or whatever it is)...I had received a phone call from a "Microsoft Support" member claiming that they had seen some type of problems going on with my system which had me suspicious from
 the start, but as usual he sounded convincing but when he had me to open my command prompt and typed that command in and I asked a question about how would I know if he was leggit and he said he would send his ID number but instead continued to try to get
 me to continue with the commands and was doing it quickly, so I quickly shut him down by disconnecting the&nbsp; phone. He did have the nerve to call back and upon no answer I guess he'd figured out I had caught on and went on to the next victim. They are trying
 to gain access to your computer and using the command prompt they'll have total control to everything...you do know that your passwords are potentially saved in google.com right?

If you're on a test build, that does not always let users join games.

<h2>            Skype number receiving a slew of unfamiliar calls</h2>
                    <p>Hello, as soon as I signed up for the Skype number &nbsp;about two weeks ago &nbsp;I started receiving an alarming number of phone calls, at a rate of two per minute from strangers saying that they are returning my call. I did not respond to any of them because there
 was a technical problem with my Skype and I was not able to receive ANY phonecalls period. It was dropping calls. Now, two weeks after that, &nbsp;after I played with my Windows 10 a bit I and downloaded an old version of Skype I am finally able to receive phone
 calls. But the junk calls are still coming through at least one a day. &nbsp;I hope I am not being charged for them. &nbsp;How do I stop them from coming? I notice that all of the calls come from the same area code in Oklahoma as my number or from another Oklahoma area
 code. &nbsp; &nbsp; Was it someone else's phone number, someone very busy? Can I change the phone number?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am unable to call another associate's Skype phone, both mine and hers are US numbers.</p>

<h2>            Drafts in Windows live mail disappear</h2>
                    <p>In Windows Live Mail under Drafts and also the subfolders under drafts . . . they are disappearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;a new desktop Dell Windows 10 computer for about 5 weeks. The "Drafts" and subfolders underneath have disappeared 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to import them back from the exterior hard drive from the old computer back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I have added new ones since, of which I have lost entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the saved emails stored in the drafts disappearing?</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>The "Drafts" and subfolders underneath have disappeared 3 times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only think of one reason for this: the account(s) concerned are Microsoft Email accounts (e.g. @outlook, @hotmail, @msn, @live) set up to use HTTP, and your Windows Live Mail has been updated to build 16.4.3563.0918 or 16.4.3564.1216.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In these circumstances, the accounts will not have a drafts folder. This is because the update enables support for Exchange ActiveSync (EAS), and the version of EAS in use for some of these accounts does not allow for synchronization of the drafts folder.
 Saving a draft will now place the saved message in the <em>Drafts</em> folder under
<em>Storage folders</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check which build of the program you have by pressing Alt-F B when viewing your message list.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary&#58; Print to PDF not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_d0lph1n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary&#58; Print to PDF not working</h2>
                    <p>I recently found out that the Microsoft Print to PDF print queue no longer works on one of my computers. Several months ago, prior to the Anniversary Update, it worked fine, but today when I tried to print some text to PDF, the printer would not work. I
 did not discover this problem earlier since I didn't use that function for several months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem: no PDF file is generated. After entering a file name into the "Save As" dialog box and clicking Save, no file appears in the destination. Additionally, I cannot print a test page either. Printing the test page will always fail, but the troubleshooter
 cannot find any problems with the printer. Also, the "Send to OneNote" and "XPS Document Writer" print queues also fail to do anything, so all of the software-based print queues are broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting steps taken: I've already tried many things to solve this issue. I removed the Print to PDF printer, then added it back manually using the Add Printer wizard. This did not work. I disabled and reenabled the Print to PDF feature in Add/Remove
 Features, but that didn't work either. I removed the driver package using the Print Server Properties menu, then added it back, but that solved nothing. I've tried every standard technique to fix this problem and none of them have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current settings for the printer are as follows:</p>
<p>PrinterName:&nbsp;Microsoft Print To PDF<br />
ShareName:&nbsp;(null)<br />
PortName:&nbsp;PORTPROMPT:<br />
DriverName:&nbsp;Microsoft Print To PDF<br />
Comment:&nbsp;<br />
Location:&nbsp;<br />
SepFile:&nbsp;(null)<br />
PrintProcessor:&nbsp;winprint<br />
Datatype:&nbsp;RAW<br />
Parameters:&nbsp;(null)<br />
Attributes:&nbsp;&lt;Local|DoCompleteFirst|&gt;<br />
Priority:&nbsp;1<br />
DefaultPriority:&nbsp;0<br />
StartTime:&nbsp;0<br />
UntilTime:&nbsp;0<br />
Status:&nbsp;&lt;&gt;<br />
ClientSideRender:&nbsp;Enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that on my Surface Pro 3 running the exact same build (14393.105), the Print to PDF function works fine. I've compared the driver files for both machines and they are identical. I don't understand what configuration problem would cause
 the printer to work on my Surface and not on my desktop. Additionally, the printer provides no indication about what went wrong. I'm starting to think that a full Windows reinstall is the only way to fix this issue. Can anyone help?</p>
