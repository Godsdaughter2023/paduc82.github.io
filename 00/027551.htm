<h2>            WM5 on my Ipaq HX4700 </h2>
                    Can someone please help - I performed a ROM Update (from HP) on my Ipaq HX4700 and it terminated before completing. I now just have the "HP Invent" symbol in the centre of an my un-lit screen and "v1. 01" at the very bottom. If the devoice is in the desktop
 cradle it says "USB" but active sync or Device Centre cannot find the device (the double beep connection sound is present when you put the device into the cradle and when you take it out again). When the device is out of the cradle it replaces "USB" with "Serial".
 I have tried a soft reset as well as a hard reset but still nothing - just the HP Invent symbol and the v1. 01 etc. What can I do to restore my device to working order?

            Many Thanks Prof Julie - I re-ran it on an XP system and it all worked fine. Great relief!

<p>This wouldnt be something you install on your own. Language support would likely be added via a software update delivered to your phone either via the Zune Software or Over The Air.</p>
<p>If your phone does not currently support a specific language you would first have to wait for your carrier to decide to support it. Im sure more language support will be added but there have been no official announcements detailing exactly when.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 7 supports five languages: English, French, Italian, German and Spanish. Windows Phone Marketplace allows buying and selling applications in 17 countries and regions: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland,
 Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland,Puerto Rico, United Kingdom, and United States</p>

            I think, it is not carrier specific but OS or device specific. I am At&amp;T customer and was using iPhone4 before using WP7. iPhone4/safari displays it correctly and WP7 doesn't and I haven't changed the carrier. How is it carrier relared? WP7 should think
 it seriously if we want to compete in the market.

<p>This is SO not correct! I live in Taiwan, where the HTC HD7 is made and I just bought one. They handed it to me configured with English as the interface language. (That is what I actually wanted since I'm an American with very limited Chinese skills.)</p>
<p>This phone displays txt messages in perfect Taiwan Chinese. I have also purchased an app from the marketplace with my phone and just got the confirmation e-mail from Zune.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I have is that I'd like to configure a Chinese keyboard but the only keyboard choice I see is ENGLISH. I know my carrier supports Chinese because they are a Taiwan company and all of their customers are here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a minimum, Taiwan needs to be on your list because I know it all works here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no problem with displaying Chinese. It's only the input that I cannot do.</p>

<p>It's IMPOSSIBLE to believe a Taiwanese phone company would be selling phones here in Taiwan that cannot input Chinese. Who would buy them? Most everybody here writes only in Chinese!</p>

Theres not much to display there, there is partial completion of some of the functionality needed to display in those languages. Not supported doesn't translate into a complete lack of functionality; there are a lot of unsupported thins one can do on even the
 Windows desktop. But features that are not supported have no support pathway when the don't work or don't meet needs.

<p>I respectfully submit that you do not fully understand the technology of displaying languages that don't use the Roman alphabet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters do not just magically appear. 'partial completion of some of the functionality' is nonsense in this context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case I have a phone that was supplied by a Taiwanese Telephone Company for use in the Taiwan market and the lack of Taiwan Chinese would render the phone unsaleable here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure some setting is missing. It might be that the phone supports Chinese only if the interface language is set to Chinese. That, at least, would be believable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you seem to be just making up an answer. To say 'there's not much to display there' suggests you think single-byte and double-byte characters are more or less the same thing. The processing is very different and it doesn't happen by accident.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not making up an answer.</p>
<p>While the phone can consume single and double-byte characters internally characters are converted to double-byte. But the problem encountered here is not whether or not the phone can internally process those characters but how they are displayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had tried to use &nbsp;<span>日本語 on the phone while it was still a beta but I got mixed results. In some areas the text will display but not all across the phone. In other areas I got the little squares that the Windows operating systems normally display
 when a font is unavailable.</span></p>
<p><span>In not understanding why I got inconsistent results I had asked about this during the beta stage but at the time I couldn't get a direct answer (in retrospect since the supported languages and launch nations had not been made public at that
 time my question was in the realm of unannounced features; and Microsoft employees don't give details on features that haven't been announced). It was after the launch that I was finally able to get an answer that the language wasn't yet supported. Later in
 some other public presentations on the phone Microsoft representatives stated that more time was needed to complete changes that were needed for complex script languages including Arabic and many of the Asian languages.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It's worth exploring what is meant when a feature is "supported" by Microsoft. A common misinterpretation is that "supported" describes whether or not some functionality exists. But that interpretation doesn't match how Microsoft tends to use the word. For
 example, there were a lot of things that developers could do on Windows Mobile that were not supported such as OpenGL graphics, &nbsp;placing custom icons in the task tray or&nbsp;programmatically&nbsp;controlling the screen brightness. While they were not supported one
 could still encounter a great deal of success in working with the features. When things went wrong then that's when the meaning of supported (or unsupported) became more clear; when supported functionality failed one could request action from Microsoft to
 resolve the problem. But when unsupported functionality failed then there was no&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;of assistance; one was on their own. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now Windows Phone still doesn't have support for the Asian or Arabic languages. Support is coming, but it's not here yet. When Microsoft reaches the point of being prepared to support a language then the update will be made available to the phone manufacturer
 and the manufacturer and the carrier can decide what languages will be made available to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to be an uncommon&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;for these phones to be available in areas in which the language isn't yet supported. I can't say that I understand the&nbsp;incongruency&nbsp;between the supported languages and where one can get the phones though. From
 what I understand in one nation a carrier has added an additional application so one could send and receive messages in the country's language but those applications only provide language support within themselves and not in the rest of the phone.&nbsp;</p>

Do you mean the traffic going through web browser?? HTTPS and SSL? It's beyond the scope of an antimalware if it does not have firewall (internet security package)... Its kind of a packet filtering /infection function

            There isn't a set listing people you can find like Facebook. Unless you know their Skype ID, there is no way to truly tell who is or who is not on Skype.

<p>
</p><p>This has also happened to me. It appears that this is an error in the Shutdown trigger. I have simply ignored this, and let it appear, hitting the OK button, it shutting down normally. The cause of this error is most likely the Shutdown trigger attempting
 to terminate the Explorer.exe background process in an illegal manner. my advice is just ignore it, and it will most likely be fixed in the next build.</p>

<h2>            Word 15.18 No longer opens older Word Documents</h2>
                    <p>What's going on here? MS Word 15.18 just downloaded and updated to my Mac, now none of my documents created with older MS Word versions are opening. &nbsp;While exiting MS Word, software reported something about saving a global template, and while trying to open
 older files I get the message, &nbsp;"Document XXXXX could not be opened." &nbsp; &nbsp;This occurs when trying to open from within Word 15.18 or when I click the file directly. &nbsp;This is an Office 365 suite, hosted on a Mac running OS X 10.11.2. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I have been able to open with MS Word 14.6 (Using secondary menu Open With... feature). &nbsp;Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>The issue seems to have resolved itself. &nbsp;I just went back and opened a few older documents directly from my iCloud that were created using MS Word (15.18) on a Windows machine both by clicking the document itself and opening from the MS Word menu. &nbsp;Older
 documents created with Word 14.6 also opened. &nbsp;In all cases the documents now open, but in "Compatibility Mode," which was not happening before. &nbsp;For now the issues seems to be resolved. &nbsp;Thanks for your comments.</p>

    <title>Findings of Windows 10 Mobile&#40;v10.0.10586.164&#41;&#58; Please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abu saeed rony  say:</h3>
<h2>            Findings of Windows 10 Mobile&#40;v10.0.10586.164&#41;&#58; Please don&#8217;t avoid it Microsoft Community and Windows Phone lovers&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>We are all windows phone lovers waiting for windows 10 mobile for long time. At last Microsoft released the official version of windows 10 mobile for his customer but some issues has to solve for making perfect windows 10 mobile. Here is my postmortem of
 windows 10 (10.0.10586.164) compared with windows 8.1 mobile: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Slow Performance: WP10 little bit slower than WP8.1 incase of operation. Not so smooth like WP8.1.Apps are crashing more in WP10 than WP8.1. Double tapping for phone unlock feature is less responsive in WP10 than WP8.1. I have installed&nbsp; WP10 in my Lumia
 435DS,535DS,540DS,730DS and 640xl DS but response is same!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.Sunlight Readability: Worse and poor sunlight readability feature in WP10 than WP8.1. I can’t see anything without full black screen in this feature in WP10. But interestingly in same phone settings and customization in WP8.1 visibility is much better
 than WP10!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Keyboard: Though keyboard is updated with new features in WP10 but have some also irritating issue. Like keyboard language changing option is too much time consuming and irritating not smooth like WP8.1. Sometimes keyboard take wrong response and write
 wrong word in WP10.Also speech to text keyboard feature is not available for other regions except only USA!!!Another fun in WP10 Keyboard is that if you enter with another language keyboard in Store you can’t change the keyboard language into English. You
 have to set keyboard language in English before enter in Store than you can change keyboard language as per demand!! Also I can’t write “চঞ্চল” by Bangla keyboard in WP10!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.Battery: Charging is slow but Draining is fast for battery in WP10 than WP8.1.Also device over heating problem is more in WP10 than WP8.1<br />
5.Reset: It is so ridiculous feature of WP10.After resetting by hard/soft reset your phone will downgrade into lower version of WP10 from build version 10.0.10586.164 it will not happen in WP8.1!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.Navigation Bar: How funny to look&nbsp; navigation bar in WP10, did you see that how much is wider it is than WP8.1?World is now crazy for slim features but WP10 is crazy for fat features!!!!Please make it smart looking like WP8.1 Also in some apps navigation
 bar hiding option is not working properly e.g UC Browser. But in WP8.1 have not this types of problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.Store: Many Popular apps is absent in WP10 store than WP8.1 Also lots of error and apps installing problem exist in WP10 than WP8.1!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.Flip to Silence: You can’t do it in WP10 but WP8.1 has this advance feature!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>9.Message: After viewing text message from action center, when you going to delete that message by “Delete Conversation” option it become in blank screen sometimes. It is not happen in WP8.1!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>10.Text Scaling: When you scale text above 120% then the words become half in pop up windows e.g scaling text into 120% above&gt;go conversation &gt;delete conversation &gt;then you can feel the problem of text scaling!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found above these problem in WP10 after using a week. We Windows Phone lovers hoping that Microsoft will make perfect WP10 than WP8.1 as early as possible by releasing New update. Microsoft Community please don’t avoid these issue. Best of luck WP10.</p>

            <p>I think you should contact NVIDIA support through&nbsp;<a href="http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/graphics_card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/graphics_card/</a>&nbsp;to ask whether they have a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an NVIDIA graphics card, a GeForce 9800. There is no file on my computer named nView<strong>H</strong>64.dll; instead I have nView64.dll. The difference may be due to the different models of the cards or to the language difference, or something
 else. Probably only NVIDIA employees really know, and they can find out what's causing the crash.</p>

<p>Had same issue and initiated dialog with Nvidia support. They ended up in suggesting to run Windows Update despite everything was updated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What solved my problem was to uninstall Nvidia Nview Desktop Manager ver. 148.47.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; The solution fixed my issue.<br />
<br />
The Nvidia droids were reading off of a screen for help advice, and had no idea.&nbsp; Microsoft wanted $500 for one support case to figure this out.&nbsp; I laughed at them.<br />

Appreciate the advice.</p>

                    I have 2 outlook.com accounts.&nbsp; <br />
Is there a way to change one of the accounts so that will no longer be an individual account, but instead be an alias of the 1st account?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<p>Hi Mattaooi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the wrong info in my last post. You may check the step mentioned in <strong>
Extend your Mac desktop to the second monitor </strong>section from <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-presenter-view-in-powerpoint-2016-for-mac-e725986f-b5f8-41ca-b739-37ec0eb6d0be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. Check if it can meet your requirement. If not, as we discussed above, I suggest you contact Apple support for further confirmation about how to display different contents with two output ports.

Install the software first,I think you need to restart the<br />
computer if i am not wrong. Than connect the phone to the usb port. The PC will detect your phone. select PC-suite from you phone main screen. After the detection is finish, You can use the Nokia PC suite.<br />
Hope this help.<br />

Btw, where it says Dhaka or any other city is the location of the person (Where they live).<br />

Please don't confuse this with anything else as it just means the location of person who you are talking to or helping.

            I have purchased the 6120C just yesterday and have been battling with PC Suite on XP MCE since then. At the moment PC Suite works after a fashion. I can connect to the phone via Bluetooth, even if it claims that no phone is connected. I can access all
 the files, do backups and, up until re-install, I could also access the internet.<br />
<br />
Now after I removed ALL references to the PC suite (Connectivity drivers, modems, etc.) and did a complete reinstall, I no longer can connect to Internet using the One Touch. It just claims no modem found even if it clearly states "Connected to Nokia 6120 Classic"
 in the title bar and I can connect just fine using XP's own dialup.<br />
<br />
Using the bundled DKE-2 the One Touch works, but otherwise has the same problem.

            Hi All..<br />
<br />
I had the same problem. (Bought the phone, worked at the office, downloaded the 6.84 and .. bang .. the computer doesn't recognize the phone .. )<br />
<br />
Uninstall the PC suite !! (its a must)<br />
Reistall the version from the shipped CD<br />
DO NOT update from the web (at least not on ver 6.84)<br />
<br />
- I'm not sure if this is right only for Israel (language issue ? Cellular carrier ? - I'm with Orange) but .. these are the facts<br />
<br />
Enjoy your NokiA

            According to the Nokia site, PC Suite 6.84 is not compatible with the 6120. I used the installation CD: no problem.

            Well... It is Nokia's page that SPECIFICALLY tells us to download 6.84 for the 6120 Classic....<br />
<br />
Well never the less, remembering back to the days of 9300 and how I spent a day trying to get the version of Nokia PC **bleep** recommended at Nokia's page to work with the phone until I gave up and installed the version provided with the phone, I now uninstalled
 the 6.84. As completely as it's possible without scrubbing the whole registry. And installed 6.83 version provided with the phone and guess what? It works... NOT! The same symptoms are plaguing the .83 version. BT connection claims no phone connected. One
 Touch claims no modem. And yet I can connect to the Internet using XP's own dial-up and also can access all the files on the phone via BT.<br />
<br />
Nokia, your phones are great, but your PC Suite sucks donkey balls.

What bluetooth stack you are using?<br />
<br />
Could you also send PC Suite's system info (Nokia PC Suite &gt; Help &gt; About Nokia PC Suite &gt; System info)?

            I'm having exactly the same problems... "no phone connected" in PC Suite, but I can browse it in Explorer. I can back the phone up in PC Suite, and clicking on the "Get Connected" icon shows the phone connected via USB.... but will it sync?? Er, no. Transfer
 images? Nope. It always shows no phone connected<br />
<br />
I'm just in the process of uninstalling 6.84 and going back to 6.83, but the uninstall process won't continue because the phone is showing as connected!<br />
<br />
Oh the irony...<br />

I really doubt you can access it.&nbsp; But....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>why not use the cool feature in OneNote.&nbsp; You create a shopping list and store it on SkyDrive.&nbsp; You can share the OneNote list so family members can access it too.&nbsp; It was this OneNote list that was on the Windows Phone 7 TV commercial....check it out...</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion I consider OneNote.&nbsp; On checking this out, I discovered it does share between phones, but don't see a way to share it with my desktop PC since OneNote does not appear to be included in my MS Office Small Business Edition 2007 which
 was included in the original desktop purchase from HP.</p>

<p>If I don't use OneNote, any&nbsp;suggestions on how to share my phone's note with the PC?</p>

Yes, you can try Evernote (it is free for what you want to use it for), this has a web version, a Windows Phone app, a Mac app, an IOS app, Android app, etc. etc. Check out

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RE OneNote, no it wouldn't have come with 7 year old MS Office software. You'd need to either get Office 2012 or Office 365 (a few dollars a month). The latter provides web versions of OneNote, PowerPoint, Word and Excel, so sharing even documents with non-office
 users can be done via a URL. Perhaps worth investigating an update if you're set on sticking with Office and/or OneNote?

                    After the update all was good, but now, I'm disappointed.. The battery gets low very fast, there are some lags always in the games like Asphalt 8 and that makes me angry. I understand that's only a beta but Microsoft should fix it. Lumia 520.

            Microsoft are continuing to work on it. This preview is for developers, end users like yourself will experience a less than optimal experience until the official consumer release.<br />
<br />
You can give your feedback to Microsoft by posting on the MSDN Developers forums.

<h2>            How did scammers find out my personal information&#63;</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just got a phone call that was obviously a scam, but I was wondering how it would be possible for these people to get hold of my personal information in the first place? They called me on my German land line (although they spoke English with an (I think)
 Indian accent) and the thing is that that number is almost never used. Literally the only reason we have a landline is because the internet needs to be run over it, we did ask to have the internet set up without the phone but it wasn't possible, and I only
 ever use it to make the&nbsp;occasional&nbsp;phone call to my mum. As this number is so rarely used and definitely isn't floating around the internet somewhere, how could they have got hold of it? They also knew my name and I'm a bit worried that they might also have
 access to other personal information as well?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On another note the man was so insanely rude that it beggars belief. He started off by asking how old I was because apparently I don't sound old enough to answer the phone. When I assured him I was he asked me to start up my computer because it's apparently
 infected or something, and when I said (politely) that I didn't have time, he asked me what I was doing (which is frankly none of his business anyway). I told him I was working and he asked if I was actually making f*** with my boyfriend. I was so offended
 that I told him I was going to hang up and then did. I was just wondering if it's worth making a complaint to Microsoft? Obviously I know the call wasn't from then and I kind of doubt that there's anything that can be done.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case it sounds like they only had your name and phone number, which are easily collected even from the phone/cable or other listings either publicly or via theft from a tech support or other tele-marketing group which has access to the numbers via
 outsourcing.</p>

<h2>            Accessing Room resource&#47;team calendar on Apple iPhones and Android devices</h2>
                    
<p>Dear all</p>
<p>I have a client who has created a room as a resource that is used for their team calendar and is available for each acount.</p>
<p>This works well with Outlook 2013 when they are connected onsite using their Windows desktops, but they unable to access this when using their mobile devices (both Apple iPhones and Android devices) using either the Outlook or OWA app.</p>
<p>How we allow them to see this the team calendar? Also, is it possible to make this default calendar upon which bookings are made?</p>
<p>Any advice you can provide would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>Best regards and thanks</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>hi chris,</p>
<p>to allow owa for ios app show the room calendar, you need to open the room calendar in outlook web app (owa) (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</a>) on your computer first. to do this, please right click
<strong>my calendar</strong> &gt; <strong>open calendar</strong>, type in the email address of the room mailbox under the blank “from directory”, then click
<strong>open</strong>. please wait sometime for the changes to take effect, if the room calendar still doesn’t show up on the owa for ios app after waiting sometime, please try resetting the owa for ios app and entering the email address and password to see
 if the room calendar will show up on the owa for ios calendar.<br />
if the issue persists after performing the suggestion above, i’d like to know:<br />
1.&nbsp;how many users in your organization encounter the same issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;which office 365 plan you are using, business plan or enterprise plan?<br />
3.&nbsp;would you mind try setting up your office 365 account in to another workable user’s mobile phone to see if the same issue occurs?</p>
<p>regarding room calendar doesn’t show up on the outlook for ios app, we have a dedicated support where you can use the in-app support to report any questions or issues regarding this app.</p>
<p>*note when using the in app support.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; it can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. it is recommended that the user turn on notifications for outlook in order to know when the technician is available.<br />
2. if you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you should see a response from the technician.<br />
3. it is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/580a2de4-a86b-4e2d-819f-159e01b610b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/580a2de4-a86b-4e2d-819f-159e01b610b5" /></a></p>

    <title>MMS image size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imaginaryenemy  say:</h3>
<h2>            MMS image size</h2>
                    I currently have a c6-01. Prior to that I had a 5530. I love both devices, however, they share one (in my opinion) major issue: the size of images in MMS.<br />
Both phones have only a thumbnail image, nowhere near the size of the original image sent. In the settings for MMS, you can adjust the size of outgoing image size, but not incoming.<br />
This can't possibly be the case for everyone. I'm tired of not being able to see the pictures sent to me because my phone is shrinking them.<br />
Any help would be appreciated.

    <title>How is Remaining Availability Calculated&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tylercapps7  say:</h3>
<h2>            How is Remaining Availability Calculated&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
When producing a "Resource Work Summary Report," and looking at the "Resource Usage" tab, I assume that the Remaining Availability is calculated as follows:<br />
<br />
Work Availability - Work = Remaining Availability<br />
<br />
Is this correct? If so, could someone help explain why one of my resource's availability is 1782, is assigned 2383.65 for work, and there is still a positive remaining availability of 549.36?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Tyler.<br />

            <p>I think you need to zoom in and look at week by week or even day by day. If you look month by month, Then some days will have availability, hence the available value and some will be over-allocated, hence the other values. If they still don't add up on a
 day by day basis then let us know.</p>
<p>For a day,</p>
<p>Work&nbsp; Availability =&nbsp;Units Available * hours in calendar for day - work assigned for that day</p>

    <title>Distribution list inquiry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuannguyen3793  say:</h3>
<h2>            Distribution list inquiry</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently started managing the admin portal of my organization.&nbsp;I was wondering, Through making my organization's distribution lists, if you are an owner of the list but not a member does that mean you won't receive email messages directed towards
 the list? I just wanted to be able to manage the list as an owner and not be a member so that I don't receive messages from emails directed towards that group.</p>
<p><br />
Can anyone confirm this for me? Again I just want to be an owner and I don't want to receive emails directed towards the group.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Hi TuanNguyen3793,<br />
<br />
The answer of your question is yes.&nbsp;If you are just the owner and not a member of a distribution group in Office 365, you will not receive the emails sent to the distribution group.<br />
<br />

            In ActiveSync, you'd want to choose the option for PC sync if your contacts are in Outlook on the desktop. From there, it should sync your contacts from your outlook data file to your device. The steps required are roughly:<br />
<br />
1. Set up a new partnership between your phone and the computer (by plugging in the USB cable and walking through the wizard when your phone is detected).<br />
2. Check the box for "Contacts" during the partnership. Do not configure an exchange server.<br />
3. It may take 1-2 synchronization cycles to get everything sync'ed from the phone to the device.<br />
<br />
Jon.
