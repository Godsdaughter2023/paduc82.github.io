</blockquote>
<p>The "Leave copy of email on server" is an option for POP3 accounts. Once a message is downloaded from the server - there is no way to delete it from the server from within Outlook. The "Remove&nbsp;from server when deleted from&nbsp;"delete items" option would be
 a server side option which would apply to items deleted via Yahoo webmail - nothing to do with Outlook.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for writing on the Windows Phone 8 forum support. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could I ask you if you can check you have set up your Microsoft account properly? Here below I’ve attached a file with all the possible information and instructions to do it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last possibility could be reset the phone. In the last attached link there are some problem solving procedure you could try.</p>

<h2>            Sprint Treo 800w &#40;Windows Mobile 6.1 Pro&#41;. GPS Nearby Function does not sort correctly</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got my Sprint Treo 800w running Windows Mobile 6.1 Pro.&nbsp; So far it is really good.&nbsp; With Sprint having an unlocked GPS I have the function of the "Find Nearby" on the today screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example I put in "pizz" and choose "nearby (as my location)"&nbsp; The device first finds my location and then give me a list of 9 items per group with pizza places.&nbsp; But what it does not do is sort them by distance.&nbsp; It actually does not see
 to have ANY sort at all.&nbsp; On the list the first one is 4.6 miles away, I have to scroll through the list 3 pages to get to the pizza place that is .3 miles from me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am getting a list of Nearby locations, but I cannot understand why it will not sort them by Distance which you think that it would since it is working by GPS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called Sprint and they tried to help me but they stated that it is part of Windows and not their software.&nbsp; The sprint Navigation works like a charm.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has the same problem and fixed it, let me know.&nbsp; Maybe it is something that MS can patch.</p>

            This is not a part of Windows Mobile, it may be an addition that Palm added to the device.&nbsp; When you use this application does it show you the result in Sprint Navigation or anohter application?

<h2>            &#34;Sorry, we couldn&#39;t find XXX is it possible it was moved, renamed or deleted&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I try to open an Excel file from File&gt;Open&gt;Recent often times I will get the following error message: "Sorry, we couldn't find XXX is it possible it was moved, renamed or deleted?"<br />
</p>
<p>If I go to the actual folder it's stored, I see files that I did not create and are not associated with a program named "59AEA700" or "86A20700" for some of them, I can add a .xls extension to (works about 50% of the time) and I can open the file.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>What could be causing this? It's getting rather annoying losing my work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I copied the file in Explorer to a directory that had a short path (e.g., C:\Temp), Excel opened it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same here. Long path: nogo. Short path: opens. Even though I changed the registry settings for long filenames. VERY annoying. Windows 10 in 2018. And we can still not use long filenames. Oh yeah, for I forget: no Onedrive involved.<br />

<h2>            blocked pop3.live.com after AVG &#40;free&#41; update</h2>
                    <p>I run outlook 2007 and after allowing an update from AVG (free) a couple of days ago, my email is no longer sending or receiving emails. The AVG message that comes up is either "AVG has blocked access to pop3.live.com (POP) because the server certificate
 is invalid"</p>
<p>or "AVG has blocked access to smtp.live.com (SMTP) because the server certificate is invalid"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i turn AVG off then emails send and receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this happening (since i got a new computer a few months ago) whenever i open outlook 2007 i get a message</p>
<p>Internet security warning</p>
<p>The server you are connecting to is using a security certificate that cannot be verified.</p>
<p>The target principle name is incorrect.</p>
<p>"View certificate"</p>
<p>Do you want to continue using this server?</p>
<p>"yes"&nbsp; "no"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i select yes then it works fine but i am wondering if the 2 things are connected.&nbsp; I am a computer user with low level understanding of how things work so if anybody can give me a step-by-step on how to address this issue then i would be most grateful...</p>

<p>Hi Fiona,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several factors that can trigger the issue you are experiencing. Integration of security programs with Outlook is a known source of causing all sorts of sending and receiving issues. On the other hand, security certificate errors can indicate that
 the domain name you are using for the mail server does not correspond to the certificate it is offering. Another possible reason is old server names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate the issue, kindly confirm the following details:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the domain name of your email address?</li><li>Which server settings have you used to set up your email in Outlook?</li><li>Which version of Windows are you using?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will appreciate if you can add more details regarding your query so we can assist you further.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 Crashes on Startup&#59; Safe Mode also doesn&#39;t help</h2>
                    Microsoft support recently upgraded me from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate (Paid support through the Answer Desk).&nbsp; This only partially alleviated a problem I was having with a windows installer popup that appeared overnight for no apparent
 reason.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
They've made it so I can use Word 2007, Powerpoint 2007, and Excel&nbsp; 2007 (the installer message still pops up, but when I cancel out if it, the document opens).&nbsp; Unfortunately, neither Outlook 2007 nor One Note 2010 will open.<br />
<br />
I get the following message for Outlook:<br />
<br />

Does anyone have any idea what this means and whether it's something a non-technical person can correct?<br />
<br />
Any insights would be helpful, even if the answer is "tough luck".&nbsp; I just want some ideas before I consider trying to buy a new laptop.&nbsp; This one worked just fine until the morning of 2/5.2013.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Does Outlook work in Safe mode? To open Outlook in Safe mode: Close Outlook then hold Ctrl as you click on the Outlook icon. You'll get a message asking if you want to start in Safe mode. Click Ok.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installer cache is probably corrupt. What happens if you let the installer finish? That is the usual fix for this problem.&nbsp;Sometimes&nbsp;installing something else helps - it steals the installer away from the office apps. Both are lazy workarounds that get
 office working with little annoyance. The real fix would be to delete the corrupt installer cache.

            number screening works by recognising a preset number &amp; then the phone won't alert,(ring or light up)when that number calls your phone.<br />
even for messages, it will go to a designated inbox in the same manner<br />
the caller won't know that you've set their unmber, for them its a normal call/sms<br />
however, if you're trying to avoid someone, then you won't be bothered each time the person calls/sms...

            How do I CANCEL a screened call problem as my new Nokia 2310 will not ring or vibrate when I phone from my HOME land line and DISPLAYS the outline of an old handset AND a red circle with a white cross.<br />
If I press the green button,I can speak using the mobile so it is purely the audio and vibration which is not happening.<br />
I can ring the land line number, any other land line number, any ones mobile from this new mobile AND if any one else rings me, it works OK with audio and vibration.<br />
O2 could not help, my land line service provider was next to useless but the phone is no good as it is mainly for contact between me and the other half. HELP HELP

            Menu / Contacts / No.screening<br />
will bring you to the "Number screening" list. Scroll down to the number you wish to delete from that list, then press Options, and then Delete.

                    <p>My phone has started to remove apps from itself and it won't let me add the apps back on&nbsp;or add new apps.&nbsp; When I try to add an app, the program sends me to a screen that has my e-mail heading and requests my Microsoft account password.&nbsp; I could not remember
 the password so I changed it.&nbsp; Each time that I enter this new password into the box, I get sent back to the same page requesting my password.&nbsp; I have tried every old password that could be possible.&nbsp; No good.&nbsp; What I would like to do is completely wipe Windows

<h2>            Calendar Sync Problem</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until recently, when I wiped my laptop clean and reloaded all of the sw, my calendar was syncing from Outlook to my Treo 700w.&nbsp; Now my contacts are syncing but not the calendar.&nbsp; I have used and am continuing&nbsp;to use&nbsp;Goldmine as my primary contact manager
 and sync to Outlook.&nbsp; Prior to my re-load,&nbsp;I used&nbsp;recurring appointments with no trouble syncing the calendar to my Treo....so I don't think these are the problem.</p>

    <title>Lock Screen Freeze-Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lavintek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lock Screen Freeze-Up</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running PC build 10532 but have been experiencing this issue over the past few builds including Build 10240. The issue occurs when the laptop (hardware specs below) is allowed to turn the display off having locked the computer. No screen saver
 is enabled. Issue additionally occurs when the laptop is woken from sleep but not logged into. Computer is non-domain joined, login is typically through PIN and it is connected to an MSA. Only recourse to log into the computer is to hard-shutdown and power
 back on, and not allow the machine to go to the lock screen which is not an acceptable workaround. All other Windows functions appear to be working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms: Black screen sometimes with cursor visible and moving per the mouse but not always. Occurs after display shuts off with lock screen displayed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting attempted:</p>
<p>-Press CTRL or ESC then type in pin/password (have tried every combination of this workaround from an older build bug)</p>
<p>-Putting the computer to sleep and then waking it up, does not cause change though trying this is the only way I was able to get the cursor to show and react to my mouse</p>
<p>-Connecting computer to dock/external monitor via vga. I am unable to force the lock screen to appear through combinations of external monitor connections, FN keys.</p>
<p>-I have wiped the machine, installed Build 10240 and tested for 2 weeks. Issue still occurred. I then jumped the machine back onto the Insider program and updated to current build (10532) with no change.
</p>
<p>-I have confirmed that all drivers are fully up to date per the manufacturer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hardware: </p>
<p>HP EliteBook 8570p, 8GB RAM, x64 Core i7-3520M, AMD Radeon HD 7570M Graphics, Intel 82579LM Ethernet and Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 wireless</p>

            This seems to be related to the Power Feature on windows. Run the troubleshooter for Power Options and see if that takes care of it.

<p>Ran the power settings troubleshooter and the above is the only issue addressed. I went through the motions and I am still having the issue occur in every case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side Note: When the cursor does show up (not always the case) it can go off screen to the bottom and to the right but not the top or left. Not sure if that means anything but just wanted to mention it.

            Thanks for the direction. Just ran through the steps and so far so good. I have been unable to get it to black screen via the various steps I mentioned. I am slowly working through the process of testing and re-enabling things and will report back once
 I hit the issue again.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the laptop over the past few days without issue until today. Today my laptop was in sleep mode. I docked it, brought it up and was able to login without issue. I then locked it and walked away for a half-hour. On return, I was unable to
 get the lock screen to show. I attempted putting the computer to sleep and waking it back up with no change. I un-docked the laptop, no change. I put the un-docked laptop to sleep and brought it back up, no change. The laptop did "ding" multiple times registering
 that it had un-docked. I was additionally able to turn wifi on and off using the hard button indicating that the OS was responsive, just not showing. Using the Ctl tricks did not allow me to fake my way to logging in.</p>
<p>
I hard shutdown and brought the machine up. No new services are showing as active or installed. No new processes were showing BUT I did notice that Office 2016 had an update. I do not believe it is related but it could be?</p>

            Over the past week the issue has occurred twice with no discernible pattern outside of the laptop having been put to sleep between a full power-on and the lockscreen not working with a black screen.

<h2>            nokia e71 and outlook</h2>
                    Nokia E71. When i view my pop3 mailbox i can only see the sent folder. I cannot see the folders that i created in outlook. I have tried syncing in PC suite, but that has not worked. I assume i am doing something wrong?

<p>Well Nokia support....you were useless</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have sorted the problem, but it took several days and no help from the discussion group, Nokia, or Three mobile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem was this. I wanted to view sub folders in a mailbox (Email on 3) that was not hotmail. With an hotmail account you can see all the folders that you would see if you were to log onto hotmail.com on&nbsp; your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When setting up a pop3 account on the Nokia E71, you can only see one folder. Inbox. Not very useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve the problem i had to set up an email account with Fasthosts. This gave me microsoft exchange and a free version of Outlook 2007. Having set up Exchange Server in Outlook 2007 i was then able to sync my Nokia E71 with PC suite. Then when i set
 up the email acouunt using "Work" option in Email on 3, i was able to see all the folders visible in Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another quirk i discovered was that i could not delete any of my email mailboxes in Email on 3. The only way round this (advice given by three support) was to uninstall Email on 3 and then re-install and set up the email accounts again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there you have it. Problem solved.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Keeps asking for password</h2>
                    <p>I searched and found many threads on this subject. Clearly, there is a problem with OneDrive and various Windows OSes that needs to be fixed when so many people have this problem of having to re-enter credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device: Surface Pro 3</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Office 365 subscription</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive has been removed and re-installed multiple times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, again, it asked my enter my credentials multiple times, even after checking the "remember" box. There were no error messages saying authentication failed or anything like that. If I use Edge, I have no problems accessing files hosted at OneDrive (it
 knows who I am and does not request re-authentication). I am also logged into my Surface Pro with the exact same Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the credential manager and everything is good there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like automatic updates may be messing around with Office and OneDrive. I can go days/weeks without this login monkey business, then it comes up again like today where it asked my 4-5 times to enter credentials again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folks who work with Office, OneDrive, and Windows need to sit down and figure out what the problem is with credentials.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're seeing here that you're experiencing some concerns regarding OneDrive on your device. Did you change your Microsoft account password recently?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, let me suggest that you unlink then relink your account in the OneDrive application. Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the tray icon located at the lower right of your screen</li><li>Right-click <strong>OneDrive</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong></li><li>Under Account tab, click <strong>Unlink OneDrive</strong></li><li>Sign in your account</li><li>Reboot your computer</li></ol>

            <p>I unlinked the account, re-added it, and the problem persists (it asked 8 more times for my password today).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it stops asking, the OneDrive sync shows a few files still syncing with no indication why these are still syncing (some are from over a year ago that have not been touched).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is clearly some kind of instability in the communication between the OneDrive software and the server. Issues have been sporadic for the last couple of years, but have gotten more frequent lately.</p>

    <title>emails disappearing from my inbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaetanod  say:</h3>
<h2>            emails disappearing from my inbox</h2>
                    <p>My e-mails have disappeared from my local MS Outlook client for the 3rd time today. When I opened Outlook this morning, I was seeing 2500+ e-mails and seconds later, this had dropped to 2 e-mails. The e-mails are still there on the web though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had deactivated archiving after the first occurrence but this has nevertheless happened another two times. E-mails will eventually resync but this is a waste of time. Currently, only two e-mails are showing in my local inbox and they are dated Sat 22nd
 October, i.e. not even the most recent e-mails from today... this makes no sense to me. What else than the auto-archive settings could cause this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help resolve your concern, kindly answer this question. Have you set up a rule to your account?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A rule is an action that Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016 for Windows runs automatically on incoming or outgoing messages. You choose what triggers the rule as well as the actions the rule takes. For example, you can create a rule to move all messages from your
 manager to a folder or to delete all messages with <span>
"Buy now!"</span> in the subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, kindly follow the troubleshooting steps on the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Raymond, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked and I have no rules defined. Also, e-mails are not getting deleted but simply disappear through what I believe to be a sync process. E-mails are still not appearing in my Outlook client today but there is a synchronisation task under way,
 so they may come back after a while...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried following the repair steps but when I right-click on Office 365, the only options available are "change" and "uninstall". I selected "change" and did have the 2 repair options. I tried the Quick option but nothing changed. When I started Outlook,
 it initiated a send/receive and a sync task but both completed without any e-mails being downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also check my Outlook sync settings in the control panel and they are set to:</p>
<p>-download as items arrive (just changed it now from the original setting of based on usage)</p>
<p>-download e-mails from any time</p>
<p>- server is eas.outlook.com</p>
<p>-sync option is ON for e-mail, calendar and contacts</p>
<p>
</p><p>After making this change, e-mails are starting to appear in inbox (could be a coincidence - I have no idea...). Please let me know if the setting "based on usage" could have caused the missed syncs as I would rather not need to fix my expensive multiple-year
 license every other month...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Gaetano.</p>
        </p>

            <p>
</p><p>Well, I was too optimistic it seems - the sync process has stopped and only 55 e-mails have been downloaded out of 2600+, all of which are dated 22nd October or older date, so I still don;t have my most recent and most important e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another piece of information that might help to identify the issue is that the subfolders where I have stored previous e-mails are still there with their contents intact until I click on them. That is when a sync task is initiated and all e-mails disappear
 from that folder, they do however reappear shortly after in the one folder I tried to check out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, not sure if it matters but I have Outlook installed on 3 computers (tower, laptop and MAC). I would assume that these installations are fully autonomous and even if one client is set to only download one week worth of e-mails, the other clients
 can still have different settings and this should work seamlessly, right? please confirm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Gaetano.</p>

            now at 300+ e-mails, so it looks like over time, I will get all e-mails back. I still want to understand how this happens as 3 times in 4 months is really excessive. Any explanations or suggestions on how to avoid this problem would be appreciated.

            <p>i have similar issue with desktop outlook. all emails for several months of 2016 have disappeared, in all folders (for example, in inbox and sent).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is available on the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like some problem with backups during migration on MSFT servers. It seems that backups from previous months were sent to production server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, lot of emails are gone on desktop and I don't understand how to restore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use any rules, etc.</p>

<p>And when accessed via web browser access, does the menu bar show 'Outlook Mail' or 'Outlook Email'?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If the Type is EAS (Exchange Active Sync) and the web access shows as above, then the account has been migrated and requires adding back-in as a 'new' account

            <p>We appreciate your kind response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One factor that we can consider could be the setting of the Outlook from Control panel. We suggest you to always keep it updated and check the "sync settings".&nbsp; Did you receive an error message when updating the settings? Are all the emails appearing on
 the app right now?</p>

            Hi, I did not have to add it as a new account. It is an EAS server and all e-mail are back now. My account was indeed migrated as the interface has changed. Do I still need to remove and re-add the account to avoid future problems or can I assume that
 the fact that all e-mail being back in the inbox means that the issue is fixed?

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Desktop Alerts not working - even with a rule. No skype installed.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Office 2013 from Office 2010 yesterday.&nbsp; I get no desktop alert or sound when a new mail item arrives.</p>
<p>I have set up a rule to show a desktop alert and play a sound.&nbsp; I now get the sound, but still no desktop alert.</p>
<p>I'm on Windows 8.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;verified that all the settings for Win 8 notifications are set to On.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen similar posts where the recommendation was to upgrade to a new version of skype.&nbsp; I don't have skype and don't want it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried safe mode.&nbsp; I get no sound and no alert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently, it was an issue with an addon product we use called StartIsBack.&nbsp;It was preventing certain Windows 8 alerts from firing.&nbsp;They had an update, and I installed it, and it now works properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I thought it was Outlook was because Outlook 2010 uses it's own desktop alert (which is a much more useful alert than the built-in Windows 8 alerts).&nbsp; Outlook 2013 uses the Windows 8 alerts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By doing this, functionality has been removed. With Outlook 2010, when the alert apeared, you had several actions you could take, right from the alert:&nbsp; Delete the message, add a follow-up, dismiss the alert, open the email, and maybe more (move to another
 folder?&nbsp; I can't remember now).&nbsp; With Windows 8 alerts, your ownly choices are to dismiss the alert or open the email.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to those who tried to help me sort this out.</p>

            POP mail downloads to the Inbox under "On My Computer". Unless you delete or remove messages they will stay in the Inbox. The behavior you are describing sounds like an IMAP or Exchange account that has a limited mailbox and they are deleting from the
 server.<br />
<br />
If you open your account under Tools in the Menu bar, it should say POP, IMAP or Exchange after the name of the account.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>If you close and restart Outlook do the messages show up?</li><li>Check your Schedules to see if you are deleting messages. Open <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Empty Deleted Items Folder</span> schedule. Did you perhaps add the Inbox to delete items after 28 days?</li><li>Under Filters be sure you don't have unread or flagged only selected.<br />

            <p>Hello Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your description, it seems like there is a corruption of Internet Explorer Security due to which you are getting this error. This might be occurring due to missing Internet Explorer security update. I will certainly help you with the issue. However,
 we need few more details to understand the cause of the issue better.</p>

<p>Adding to Favourites worked fine in IE8 with Windows 7 x64</p>
<p>However, the problem of adding favourites arose when upgrading from IE8 to IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Solution</strong> </p>
<p>Instead of clicking the <em><strong>star</strong></em> and then <em><strong>'Add to favourites'
</strong></em>button (which had no effect), I tried dropping the 'Add to favourites' menu down and clicked on the alternative option
<em><strong>'Add to Favourites Bar'</strong></em></p>
<p>This introduced a horizontal bar along the top, with the website to be added shown at the left-hand side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then dragged the website directly down from the bar to the main body of Favourites.</p>
<p>Deleting the website from the bar left it in the Favourites area. Problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in IE11 the Favourites area is on the RH side so, on clicking the star for Favourites, it is necessary to click the little blue icon at the top (Pin the favourites centre) to shift the Favourites area to the LH side of the screen (where it was in
 IE8). Otherwise the web address cannot be dragged to the Favourites area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word suddenly disappeared from my desktop</h2>
                    <p>I had pinned Word and Excel to my start panel. Today, they disappeared.</p>
<p>I work with excel and word all the time. I had Excel documents saved to my desktop. When i looked thru my documents folder, the thumbnail picture for Word and Excel were gone, replaced by blank little pages.</p>
<p>When i tried opening a word document, the "what program would you like to open this with" popped up. I chose "word" and while it opened, it opened as a "read-only" locked document. There is no way that should be as i neither locked it nor is there anyone
 else using my document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With excel, it is gone from my computer completely. I dont see that, nor do i actually see Word in my Apps + Features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions on what might have happened? im going to try restarting my computer, but im open to anything else</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can change the way you sign in and show up to recipients by adding aliases to your Microsoft account. An alias is like a nickname for your account that can be an email address, phone number, or Skype name. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12407/microsoft-account-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> on how to set up and manage aliases on your Microsoft account.<br />
<br />
Let us know if that works for you.

<div>I have downloaded the trial version of Lepide and can see the data but this product is $499. I would be happy to &nbsp;pay for a third party tool if I knew it would work. OST2, Kernal and others don't support Outlook 2013 as far as I have found</div>

<h3> kenneth franck  say:</h3>
<h2>            According problems with WM 6</h2>
                    I have this very anoying problem with My TyTN.<br />
Recenty I installed the new OS WM6 on my unit.<br />
Everything looked just fine until I got connected to a WiFi.<br />
First of all the new WM 6 have been updated wih some nice facelift in many ways witch also include Wndows Live.<br />
A program that includes all of Microsofts nice ways to get connected to your friends out trough the world.<br />
I´m one of those people that wants to stay connected while traveling all over Europe in my line of business.<br />
When I as in Czech Republic a week ago and got online through the hotels WiFi to look into my POP3 accounts and getting my mails downloaded to my unit it all seemed to be working lovely, however to my surprise, when I wanted to download my mails from my Hotmail
 account using Windows Live my HTC didn´t use my already excisting WiFi but started my GPRS connection.<br />
I was still connected to the hotels wireless router but Windows Live refused to accept that connection.<br />
I tried to configurate Windows Live but without any succes.<br />
Later that week I contacted retailer back home in Sweden in the hope that they might have a solution to my problem.<br />
But no!<br />
There were nothing they could do then transfere my problem to the next level of expertice.<br />
This problem is however adding a wery irritating cost to me and my company.<br />
At this point I can´t use My TyTN without being charged xtra.<br />
I hope that this will be sorted in a wery near future.<br />
But if there is a solution please let me know or I´ll just have to find me a hole new concept to work from.<br />
Your´s Kenneth<br />

<p>I'm just assuming that the default is via the phone connection so if it is available, it will use it.</p>
<p>By any chance did you try to shut off the phone then with just Wi-Fi&nbsp;on,&nbsp;see if your email them comes over Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>I have one WM6 device, a JasJar that I use exclusively for connection via Wi-Fi.&nbsp; (It is an incredible device just the phone radio is bad in my area).&nbsp; I do not have the phone enabled and it connects perfectly via Wi-Fi to get all my HotMail.</p>

<p>Hello Jennifer, </p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for getting back to me! I normally go into the google page using my i phone and then go onto the email signing in page to try and access my emails. my email works fine but every time my boyfriend tries to access his email it doesn't seem to work.
 He uses the same password for everything so there shouldn't be a problem with him accessing it! And it's also stopping him for using his Xbox as the account matches with this email he's trying to regain. I have tried different browsers but that doesn't seem
 to make any difference. Every time he tries to sign in the error message we get is that we have tried to sign in too many times! This email he is trying to access is the email he uses for everything like his Apple ID etc but Apple said they were unable to
 help with this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>he has filled out a form where he's been asked to confirm his recent email contacts but he can only remember 2-3 contacts as he's not been able to check his emails for a long period of time. I have tried your suggestion but unfortunately it has not helped.
 My boyfriend wondered are there any personal security questions you could direct him to as he'd know the answers to them if he made some for the email. Thanks very much for your help Jennifer!&nbsp;</p>
