    <title>Printer does not print in color Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printer does not print in color Windows 10</h2>
                    I had Windows 8.1, and much to my DESPISE my computer automatically upgraded to Windows 10 even though I continued to click NO when ask to upgrade. Now I am stuck with Windows 10 because I did not know there was a roll back option for 1 month after it
 installed and now the roll back option does not appear in recovery. My questions are: Is there still a way to roll back, and 2ndly does anyone else have the problem of the printer working fine (prints in color with all the test pages etc, new cartridges too)
 but when I try to print a word document with color or pictures of any kind they print all in black and white/grayscale. I have already tried the preferences/properties in the printer/device settings, they are all in color and the grayscale is off. the printer
 is an HP Deskjet3520. it worked fine until Windows 10 downloaded.&nbsp;

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            That dump says that your BSOD resembles this (yes?):<br />
<br />
*** STOP: 0x000000f4 (0x00000003, 0x89c4bda0, 0x89c4bf14, 0x805d29b4)<br />
<br />
*** ehdrv.sys - Address 0xa77804d0 base at 0xa777f000 DateStamp 0x4c3d71d7<br />
<br />
The ehdrv.sys belongs to your ESET antivirus/antimalware installation, but there are conflicting signs here.<br />
<br />
Either be sure your ESET is current, reinstall it or replace ESET with <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a>.<br />
<br />
You could just ditch ESET for the time being (you can always reinstall it later) and then see how things look after uninstalling it and they have a special uninstall method that you can read about here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=SOLN2289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=SOLN2289</a><br />
<br />
<br />
In addition, the STOP: <span style="font-weight: bold">0x000000f4</span> (0x00000003...&nbsp; is almost always a hardware problem, but that could also be your ESET interfering.&nbsp; Anything with a 0x000000f4 is likely a hardware problem so it would not hurt to check
 that out too.<br />
<br />
The 00000003 is your clue.<br />
<br />
I would run a chkdsk /r on your HDD and a memory test.<br />
<br />
To run chkdsk /r, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
chkdsk /r<br />
<br />
Click OK and respond in the affirmative that you want the volume checked on the next reboot (then reboot of course).<br />
<br />
When chkdsk runs automatically on a reboot either because XP thinks it needs to (perhaps your NTFS volume has been marked as dirty) or you chose to do it yourself, the results are shown in the Event Viewer Application log.&nbsp; You need to look there for the chkdsk
 log and any problems after chkdsk has run. <br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Look in the Application log for an event sourced by Winlogon, something like:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winlogon<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1001<br />
Description:<br />
<br />
Checking file system on C:<br />
<br />
The type of the file system is NTFS.<br />
A disk check has been scheduled.<br />
Windows will now check the disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; 39070048 KB total disk space.<br />
&nbsp; 25151976 KB in 78653 files.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 237080 KB in use by the system.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65536 KB occupied by the log file.<br />
&nbsp; 13632736 KB available on disk.<br />
Windows has finished checking your disk.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you see any errors - even errors that are corrected, run chkdsk /r again until you see no errors.&nbsp; You should have no errors.<br />
<br />
Run a test of your RAM with memtest86+ (I know it is boring and will cost you a CD).<br />
<br />
Memtest86+ is a more up to date version of the old memtest86 program and they are not the same.<br />
<br />
The memtest86+ will not run under Windows, so you will need to download the ISO file and create a bootable CD, boot on that and then run the memtest86+ program.
<br />
<br />
If even a single error is reported that is a failure and should make you suspicious of your RAM.<br />
<br />
If you have multiple sticks of RAM you may need to run the test on them one at a time and change them out to isolate the failure to a particular single stick.<br />
<br />
Always keep at least the first bank of RAM occupied so the test will find something to do and there is enough to boot your system.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, reseating the RAM in the slots will relieve the error but a failure is still cause for suspicion.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
If someone says to run memtest86, you can tell them to go pound sand and that you know memtest86+ supercedes memtest86 and here's why:

            <p>Thanks for quick reply. Im not connected to a domain. I cannot get to the desktop. When i start, "Starting Windows" comes up, Welcome/Windows 7 pro. Then the message, "the group policy client service failed the logon. Access is denied. I restarted, holding
 F8 key and got Error 0210, press F1 to set up, which takes me to BIOS set up utility menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were no error messages as the system restored to 7, simply a please wait while the system restores to 7 or something like that, then it booted and looked as if it was fine until the access denied message came up, also my normal logon icon, " new user"
 came up, but in tiny type. Im afraid 7 components were removed from the pc and now i cant get on the web to get any other OS</p>

<h2>            cleaning the registry, fixing graphics driver crashes once and for all</h2>
                    Hi, &nbsp;well I didn't have "graphic driver stopped working" until I upgraded my card from a 260 to 275, and since then have put in multiple 275's and one 285. &nbsp; Well I get the nvlddmkm problem all the time now
<div><br />
</div>
<div>AND</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I look in the REGISTRY, &nbsp;under<span>HKEY LOCAL MACHINE / &nbsp;SYSTEM / CURRENTCONTROLSET / CONTROL / VIDEO</span>, &nbsp;whereever the video is stored, &nbsp; THERE ARE MULTIPLE entries/code/folders &nbsp;for 275's and 285's. &nbsp;and stored with each
 is an nvlddmkm.. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I want to clear my registry, and only have the one entry / folder containing one nvlddmkm per card I have installed, and eliminate redundancy in the registry as a source of nvlddmkm</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you</div>

            I was suggesting that you uninstall everything nvidia first (leave your chipset alone for now - I don't know that you can uninstall it actually), reboot, make sure Windows update doesn't run, run ccleaner, reboot again, then reinstall the necessary nvidia
 stuff directly from NVidia's site.<br />
<br />
You don't uninstall your chipset drivers, you can only update them and perhaps reinstall them from what I understand (http://www.pcguide.com/vb/showthread.php?t=20094). I'm not positive if the chipset drivers are included in the driver packages from NVidia
 or not because I've only had ATI cards up to this point. So basically, I'd leave your chipset alone at the moment and just uninstall your graphics driver and go from there.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

    <title>Windows 10 DLNA media streaming from PC to Xbox One not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stocktiki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 DLNA media streaming from PC to Xbox One not working correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hoping a Windows expert can help out. Trying to access the video collection stored on my PC - from my Xbox One. To be clear&nbsp;- looking to pull from the PC to the Xbox One - not push or "cast" from PC to Xbox One.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set up media streaming Control Panel&gt;Network and Internet &gt;Network and Sharing Center &gt; Media Streaming options</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox One shows up as a media streaming option and I've check the "Allowed" box and confirmed all content is selected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in Control Panel&gt;Network and internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt;Advanced Sharing setting I have turned on:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn on network discovery (for Private(current profile))</p>
<p>Allow Windows to manage homegroup</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also clicked on "Choose media streaming option..." and confirmed the network shows the Xbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However - for whatever reason - the Xbox One can "see" the PC&nbsp; and the library - but it can only see folders in the "public" User folder - not my personal user folder - even though it appears it should.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this? Also, is DLNA transmitting the library from Windows Media Player - as in Windows 8.1 - or directly from File Explorer?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I have the same issue and it's driving me insane. I was able to get the media player to connect finally and its absurd how complicated it is, you have to navigate all the folders it creates to organize music but doesn't allow any of them to access according
 to those categories (Album, Artist, Genre, Playlist, etc).&nbsp; You have to find the folder holding the file location. Oh well right I figured I'll just use the file explorer but it won't connect to the server even though the media player is connected. Anybody
 got any current info? If once I can get this server is it possible to use windows as a storage device for xbox files? I would love to know how to make the computer compatible with storage.</p>

<p>I meant to add everything I had done. I had taken down the firewall, gone to the advanced settings on network and sharing center, make it discoverable, turned on printer and file sharing for private and public networks, allowed windows to manage homegroup
 connections, turned OFF password protected sharing. Then in Media Streaming Options I renamed the library and customized both to allow all media to be available. I then connected the xbox one within devices by adding it manually. It wasn't till after one more
 step that the media player finally connected. I use Parallels third party software, great program, that allows Windows to run as a virtual machine. For anyone running this at this point must look into Parallel's "configure.." which opens "windows 10 configuration"
 window. You will then enter the networks section and change the source to "default adapter". That ultimately made it work. I did have a problem along the way where windows was made the default for my media files on my mac but after research changed it through
 the file's get info option. Now the next thing I did to try and fix the connection is opened ports for the router describe by microsoft. I found a great video where someone explains the steps. Howevery it didn't connect still. I have also made a homegroup
 on windows was another step. The ports opened included the following &nbsp;</p>
<p>Port 88 (UDP) <br />
Port 3074 (UDP and TCP) <br />
Port 53 (UDP and TCP) <br />
Port 80 (TCP) <br />
Port 500 (UDP) <br />
Port 3544 (UDP) </p>
<p>Port 4500 (UDP). Im really at a dead end and don't have any other clues but will continue to hound around, if anyone has a info please help. And if you found this helpful please pass it forward.</p>

<p>Well, I have having similar issues - how I fixed it was to go into the File Explorer and click Libraries on the left side. &nbsp; After that, along the top, selected the part of the ribbon or whatever it's called that it titled Share.&nbsp; Then I clicked each entry/library
 in the main pan of the window and in the option in the ribbon I selected "Homegroup (view..." and waited for the progress to finish before moving onto the next entry.&nbsp; This fixed the problem entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought about checking there to see what the sharing settings where set to because I notice that in Control Panel that when I went to check my sharing settings for my Homegroup that everything other than printers was not shared, and changing this and hitting
 "ok" or whatever didn't seem to do anything (when I went back, everything was back to not being shared).&nbsp; I couldn't figure out why this was happening, so I checked in File Explore so I could right click the Libraries in there to see what was going on.&nbsp; that
 is where I noticed that the sharing check box was not checked and was greyed out.&nbsp; So I figured using the share options in the ribbon UI might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did, so I can see all of my music, photos and videos on my Xbox One.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro 64-bit not detecting CanoScan N670U Canon Scanner - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro 64-bit not detecting CanoScan N670U Canon Scanner Properly</h2>
                    <p>Up to the latest Windows 10 Pro 64-bit updates and patches as of today, my USB Canon scanner (CanoScan N670U) is not properly detected by the system. A recent Windows update solved three major problems that I had, but scanner problem remains unsolved. Before
 the latest update, system did not detect my Canon scanner, built-in SATA DVD drive, USB HP printer and one of my USB mice. Screenshot of Window's Device Manager attached below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49068b6e-6a97-4b96-83e7-75ea9a43e6a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49068b6e-6a97-4b96-83e7-75ea9a43e6a7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Switching back to WindowsXP with same scanner connection intact, the scanner is detected normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Khalid,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. I understand that

            <p>Hi Khalid </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a Windows 7 32 bit on which I had the CanoScan Lide20 driver installed. I Upgraded this system to 32 bit Windows 10 and the driver continues to work and scans perfectly well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at Canon's web site there is only 32 bit drivers for this device (confirms what RJ stated)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to install the 32 bit driver on my other 64 bit Windows 10 does not yield an error but will not make the driver work (guess I had to try)
</p>

    <title>Adding A SD card for memory on my hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding A SD card for memory on my hard drive</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire One 1-131 Cloudbook 11 it has only 2GB of Ram and came with Windows 10 but I have dumped all apps I can and did several disk cleanups and it just cannot operate with more memory. I have put a 32 GB memory card in to stay and formatted
 to NFST and can't seem to get hard drive to use it . I moved what it would allow me to into the card but is not enough I have worked hard to just create 1.5 GB but it goes away quick with updates all the time . I see in Disk Management there is a way but&nbsp;I
 must be doing something wrong and can't figure it out . Any help would be appreciated&nbsp;, I am on the verge of giving up on it and trying to make this work for my mother for simple email use.

<p>
</p><p>To further assist you with your concern, we need to ask you the following questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you say "it just cannot operate with more memory", do you mean that the device is going on slow?</li><li>You said you put 32 GB memory card to the computer, are you using this to transfer the files to the memory card?</li><li>Did you get any error message regarding the issue you are experiencing?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your reply.</p>

            Thanks Nick for reply, I mean that this Acer Coudbook 11 is constantly out of memory no matter how many times I clean hard drive and delete temp. files. I added a 32 GB card and reformatted it in hopes of hard drive using it for added memory or space,
 but it did not use it for some reason even with it mounted to the C drive, So I tried moving files to it but could not move the big files that I need to . I have uninstalled every thing I can get away with and still operate, I have only 7 total programs on
 it at this point. I have read on Windows Community that I can uninstall from C drive and reinstall on SD card as a get around but I went ahead and preinstalled all the programs&nbsp;I planned to take off C drive and uninstalled one which was Intel Graphics but
 it did not seem to work correctly as&nbsp;reinstalled from&nbsp;SD card. For some reason it seems to be working much better today but now I'm leery of proceeding with what I was doing. Any help with this or other idea will be appreciated T

<p>The capacity of your computer really depends on its full specifications and the applications and programs you install. Is this a brand new computer you are using? Its very unusual for a high spec computer to be out of memory by only just having a total of
 7 programs. Doing disk cleanups is definitely a smart move you have taken as it rid your computer unnecessary bulk of junk files. Since this didn't work out for you, we recommend you to visit the link provided and kindly follow the steps provided that you
 have not done yet: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12425/windows-10-free-up-drive-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks Nick, I went to the link and reviewed the checklist and I have done all and some three times . The only item on that list that could help me is moving files to another disk . I have had little luck in moving any files that would make a difference
 on space it won't let me take most of them. I have been able to get it down to 12.3 GB's of 14.5 GB but that took a lot of doing.I got a suggestion from another on Microsoft Community and I tried it on one program and it made me nervous and that was to uninstall
 one program at a time and reinstall it back to the SD card I have permanently &nbsp;attached. I would welcome your input on this. I did go ahead an download all the ones from Acer site so they would be at my disposal on the SD card&nbsp;but after doing one of them the
 computer had some erratic behavior, it cleared up and right now its working better than it ever has and no pop ups about low memory in two days now. Let me know what you think about going forward with this because the next few are critical programs like Intel
 Wireless&nbsp;and Intel VGA which is 501 MB by itself. Another thing I don't fully understand .I have put the 32GB SD card on the C drive and it shows up there I named it Media Container and when I look at drive as a whole it says I have only 1.78 GB of space left.
 But I open it and the Media Container has 28 GB of space left , how does that space not count as part of C drive space left , is there something I need to do for it to recognize that space as its own ? Oh and I do have it set to put all future files on Media
 Container but it will not let me set the Apps to be downloaded to that container.</p>

<p>Adding Storage memory will not improve your RAM (2GB), you need to install more RAM memory if possible (Unfortunately I do not think the RAM can be increased on this model.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try changing the location where items are stored by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open 'Settings' &gt; select 'System' &gt; select 'Storage' &gt; navigate to &amp; select 'Change where new content is stored' &gt; select where you wish to store various items - select drives other than your (C:) drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you insert your Memory Card and any other storage device and they are recognised, before carrying out the above actions.</p>

            Hey thanks Bob, I have changed where new content is stored but things like music , photo's and documents and maps will not be put on this device and it will not give a choice on first item " New Apps will save to "it is faded and can't change setting for
 whatever reason if I could that would be a big plus but so far I have not seen a way to make it let me store apps in another location. This Cloudbook 11 only has 2GB ram and can't add any. I originally got this for my mother but it would not even load all
 of Windows 10 , 1511 or 1607 I had to reset it and hide those updates to even make it useable for mom to email which is all she needed but now I'm just trying to get some use from it like searching and paying bills from bed or on the road. Its taken a lot
 to get it to 1.78GB of free space but not sure how long that will last with so many updates on Win 10..If you have any ideas on why I cannot select another place for Apps let me know, thanks and take care.

<p>It was a decision before to postpone the apps on SD functionality to a later release. With the recent updates, it should already be available for use. Have you made sure that your Windows version is already up to date?</p>

            Thanks Nick for your reply . Let me give you my whole situation . You ask if it's up to date and no it is not and the reason is not enough space to do so. When I got this Cloudbook 11 it was for my mother to just do emails, When I went to set it up it
 was trying to upgrade to 1511 version and there was not enough space to do so . It prompted me to add some space by buying a flash or SD card with minimum of 16GB of space and I did but it would not use it for a certain part of the upgrade it said it had to
 go on C drive only and I should remove programs to make room and I did but still could not get it done so I asked Microsoft for help and a tech took remote access to it and made changes. well after that I had no mouse and was forced to do factory reset after
 talking to another tech about it , he suggested to reset and then hide the upgrade so it would not try to install it as I really would not need it just for emails. So I did that and got it to work fine but Mom is 85 and she did not even tur

            I'm afraid none of that worked. The adapter still won't turn on after sleep/shut down unless I run the diagnostic for it.<br />
<br />
I should note that, at least on start up (not when coming back from sleep) the wireless appears to be on long enough for dropbox to connect, then for whatever reason it shuts off.<br />

<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What does the diagnostic say was done when you run it?</p>

</span></span></span>Are you using an Intel program to connect to the wireless or is Windows managing the wireless?</p>
<p>After you resume from sleep, and you are experiencing the problem, check if the WLAN AutoConfig service is running or not and if it isn’t, I would suggest you to start the service.</p>

<br />
Make a small batch file with a single line:<br />
ipconfig /renew<br />
<br />
Put it in a folder somewhere<br />
<br />
Open the task scheduler and create a new task. Make sure that you check "Run with highest privileges."<br />

Trigger should be set to "On workstation unlock of any user".<br />

Action is "Start a program". Point it you your batch file.<br />

Under the Conditions tab, make sure "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power" and "Stop if the computer switches to battery power" are both unchecked.

<h2>            Samsung Monitor doesn&#39;t provide full display</h2>
                    I purchased Samsung SyncMaster S27B350 monitor few days ago for my Gateway desktop using HDMI cable.&nbsp; Although the display settings is at the recommended state (1920 x 1080) and installed the latest drivers from Samsung web site, the screen doesn't display
 to it's fullest extent.&nbsp; I also checked Windows Update and seems to indicate that I have all the latest updates.&nbsp; After speaking with Samsung representative, I learned that it's an issue with Windows 7 and HDMI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp;needs to provide the driver support
 for Samsung monitor and HDMI.&nbsp; I&nbsp;changed the cable to DVI and it seems&nbsp;to work fine and get the full display.&nbsp; Anyone aware of Windows drivers to support Samsung monitor&nbsp;with HDMI or is this another issue of the Samsung representative passing the issue of
 to someone else?&nbsp;

            You sometimes have to tweak the settings for your graphics card to get the display to fill the whole screen. Look for overscan/underscan settings in your graphics card software.

            You're correct.&nbsp; I switched back to HDMI cable after using DVI and adjusted the scaling option on the Intel Graphics Adapter application.&nbsp; I manually adjusted until the entire desktop was filled.&nbsp; If the Auto Adjust feature on the monitor worked with HDMI,
 this may have been done automatically.&nbsp;However, needed to do this manually.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

<span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>IDT Audio system tray application is associated with the audio drivers installed on your computer. Sttray.exe belongs to SigmaTel. Installing the audio drivers should fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What’s the make and model number of the computer?
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I’d recommend you to disable the same from loading at startup.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Start.”
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “msconfig.exe” in the “Start” search box and hit “Enter.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the “Startup” tab.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Uncheck “IDT Audio” or any related entry from the list.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Apply” and “OK.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Ensure NOT to disable any of the Microsoft services.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Additionally, to fix the issue I’d suggest you to download and install the latest audio (sound) drivers from the computer/motherboard manufacturer’s website.
</span></p>

<h3> kash97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Primary DNS Server when trying to access internet</h2>
                    Computer has worked fine for the last year until 2 weeks ago and now can't connect to the internet.<br />
<br />
Running Windows Vista on broadband and connected directly to modem by ethernet.&nbsp; Internet provider has run tests and confirmed modem is fine and it is as my laptop works fine on it.<br />
<br />
By re-booting the modem, the internet will work and you can type in a couple of sites and it seems okay but you can't do anything on a site, ie enter details and even if you don't try and enter anything, you can only view usually 2 sites and then it goes again.&nbsp;
 However, the network icon shows as on and connected to the internet.<br />
<br />
On diagnosis, it says that it cannot access the Primary DNS Server.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea how I can solve this or should I just completely re-install windows from the original set up disc?

            A few things you can try...&nbsp; [This&nbsp;will have Windows try to automatically repair your connection]<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Open "Network and Sharing Center" (you can search for this from the Vista start menu)<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Under tasks, click "Diagnose and repair"<br />
<br />
If that fails you can try...&nbsp; [This will use the NETSHell utility to RESET your network interface (removes any static configurations and sets to DHCP)]<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Open a command prompt (you can also search for this from the Vista start menu, if you have UAC enabled, you'll have to start it as Administrator)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;From command prompt type:&nbsp; NETSH INTERFACE IP RESET RESET.LOG<br />
<br />
If you still have problems, try to post your IPCONFIG /ALL, HOSTS file, and ROUTE PRINT to this forum.<br />
<br />
How to:<br />
<br />
IPCONFIG /ALL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open command prompt and type:&nbsp; IPCONFIG /ALL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To save the output to a file simply type from the command prompt:&nbsp;&nbsp;IPCONFIG /ALL &gt; filename.txt<br />
<br />
Your HOSTS file is located in the following path&nbsp; (the HOSTS file does not have an extension, it's just named "HOSTS"):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %windir%\system32\drivers\etc\HOSTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\ETC\HOSTS<br />
<br />
ROUTE PRINT<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open command prompt and type: ROUTE PRINT<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To save the output to a file simply type from the command prompt:&nbsp; ROUTE PRINT &gt; filename.txt<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: If it gets really hairy, you can provide NETSH DUMP (this provides virtually all network settings)... You definately shouldn't need to re-install Windows.&nbsp; There is most likely a network setting configuration problem that is causing this issue.&nbsp; Good luck!<br />

<p>That's the part that doesn't make sense... the data/partitions on the drives are fine... it's just Windows that is messed up.&nbsp; I can't see recovering many TBs of data just because windows messed up the array mapping.&nbsp; If this was an actual raid array, I
 would just select all three devices and select 'rebuild array'.</p>

<p>If two different Windows 10 (must be same versions) can't see the Storage Space then it is hosed.
</p>
<p>Storage Spaces is flexible but not quite as recoverable when issues arise as a hardware raid could have.</p>
<p>I've had this happen before and the Storage Space was gone. I redid the Storage Space, restored from backup, and it's been working fine since. I have no idea what corrupted it previously.</p>

<div>I did their 30 day trial of Advanced System Protector and it found a trojan. To get rid of it, you upgraded to their full program which I did and then was infected by numerous trojans and viruses.</div>
<div>My computer was unusable.</div>
<div>I did a system restore and everything was back to normal.</div>
<div>I asked my bank to reverse the payments which they did.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I was refunded twice by mistake, I think but hey, I spent a lot of anxious moments getting rid of the trojans etc.</div>
<div>Systweak emailed me with a confirmation of payment refunded with no apology for infecting my computer.</div>

            <p>I purchased Winzip Driver Update recently. &nbsp;I ran the program and was told there was one driver I that could not be updated. &nbsp;I was advised to give full access to windowsdu.exe. &nbsp;I did this. &nbsp;It did not help. &nbsp;There was a phone number given for help on the
 Winzip site. &nbsp;I called this number. &nbsp;I thought I was calling Winzip. &nbsp;Like others who have posted about Systweak, a program was run, and I was told I had many problems. &nbsp;I gave the agent remote access. &nbsp;I told the agent I only wanted to update the driver.
 &nbsp;I was told I could not update the driver since the driver did not belong on my computer. &nbsp;I said that any drivers I had came with my computer. &nbsp;I began to suspect that I was not talking with Winzip. &nbsp;I asked if the agent was with Winzip. &nbsp;The reply was yes.
 &nbsp;I still doubted the accuracy of this. &nbsp;The advice was given that I purchase expensive help from them. &nbsp; I said I only wanted to update the driver. &nbsp;I finally disconnected the remote assistance and hungup the phone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to contact Winzip by email using a form posted on their website. &nbsp;For all I know my email may have gone directly to Systweak. &nbsp;I think Winzip should look into this. &nbsp;I never would have contacted a third party for help with this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am writing to alert other users about the Winzip driver updater software. &nbsp;There is something definitely wrong here. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Once I upgraded, I began re-installing all my programs.&nbsp; One of those programs, WinZip System Utilities Suite, continually crash after I entered my Serial Key.&nbsp; The error message said certain dependencies
 were not in place, but no Dependencies were listed to help me track down the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I EMailed WinZip and let them know about this issue, then decided that I would dig out my original installation executable for the program.&nbsp; I then ran the installation and after entering the Serial Key, the old program completed the installation process
 and works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next day I received an EMail from I thought was WinZip.&nbsp; They asked me to get the Team Viewer program and install it onto my system.&nbsp; I was then asked to send a "Add Contact" request through SKYPE, and include my Time Zone, my Name, the 9 Digit Code
 from Team Viewer and finally the PW from the Team Viewer session.&nbsp; I followed the instructions, but wasn't contacted by the SysTweak Support people, so I decided to go looking for just who these people are, which led me to many unsatisfied Customers, this
 post included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading this Post, I turned my Team Viewer off and left whoever it is in SKYPE a message stating I had my doubts that these people work for WinZip.&nbsp; I also changed my PW for unattended access, as I set that up, thinking it would be a WinZIp person
 working on my system to see exactly what was going wrong with the install.&nbsp; Now I know that isn't what happens, and yes, I'm very shocked to hear that WinZip wouldn't make it known that their System Utilities Suite application Support comes from a 3rd Party
 Support Vendor.&nbsp; Why this information isn't made public up front worries me.&nbsp; WinZip has been around since the second iteration of the PC, and I've been a user of theirs just as long.&nbsp; But to find out by accident that a program that I use, which clearly was
 purchased from WinZip, is actually not supported by WinZip, is disappointing at the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess my next step is try to get someone from WinZIp to explain just what is going on with their support for their product.&nbsp; For you Windows 8.1 people that run across the same error I did, I suggest you get the 2.0.648.13214 version and don't allow
 it to update!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t save anything - access denied - but using Admin account</h2>
                    I have Windows 7, and every time I try and save something in my user folder, it says access denied because I'm not an Admin - but I am - and then it asks me to save it in the previous user's folder which has some sort of lock on it so I can't delete it.
 There is only 1 account (mine) but it still won't let me save files anywhere but the locked admin folder. How do I delete or unlock it? I am minutes away from throwing my monitor out the window. I tried prntscrn'ing the problem, but it wouldn't let me save
 the MS paint doc!!

            Your very first step with a used computer is to do a clean install of Windows. You have no idea what problems you inherited from the original owner. If you are unwilling to do this (not recommended), then since new accounts work fine make yourself a new
 Standard user for daily work and keep one of the new administrator accounts for your "CompAdmin" account as described in the Recommended Setup above. Copy the data from your old user account to your new Standard account and then delete the old user account.

</p><p>I did a system restore back a couple of weeks thinking something had installed on the system and caused these issues. The restore did not fix this mess. I'm not computer stupid but I'm not tech savoy either. Have no idea how to fix this. Did have the system
 shut down on me twice today stating it encountered an issue but that was before I did the restore.&nbsp; How do I get everything back?

<p>I use classes with the both of them. Both are good weapons in Ghost. Remington probably has more range (seems that way) but the Honeybadger is a two hit kill with the semi auto select fire attachment, plus its got the silencer already that leaves you open
 for other attachments.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I've been using mostly shotguns, but have experimented a little. Remington seems a little better to me than the honey badger. Honey badger I thought was a bit weak.

<p>&nbsp; From what little experience I've had, I prefer the ak12 over either of them.</p>

<p>I like both in different situations.HB is awesome for full on rushing the enemy spawn but the Remmy is a solid defensive weapon and it kills quick if you get your shots on.If i ever get Stonehaven i go Remmy every time.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 10 you need to make sure your location is set correctly in the system settings and you also need to make sure the Microsoft Store is selected for the right region.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">To change the country for your account, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to your <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft account</a>.</li><li>Select <strong>Edit country/region</strong>.</li><li>Update the Country/region, State, ZIP code, and/or Time zone fields as applicable.</li><li>Select <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For the system settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Select </span><strong>Start</strong><span> &gt; </span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>Time &amp; Language</strong><span> &gt;
</span><strong>Region</strong><span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Under </span><strong>Country or region</strong><span>, select your new region. You can change it back any time.</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>For the Microsoft Store:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Go to </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store online</a><span>. At the very bottom of any page, select your current language/region and then select a new one from the list. You can
 switch back to your original language and region at any time.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>When trying to make a purchase, it should ask you to update your billing information but you can always do that from the Payment &amp; billing section of your online Microsoft Account.</span></span></span></p>
