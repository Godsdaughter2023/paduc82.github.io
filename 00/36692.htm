<p>
</p><p>I have an official version of Windows 8 on my PC, which I successfully upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Now, I want to upgrade it to Windows 10. I downloaded the .iso file and mounted the disk, and clicked on setup.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now an error is thrown saying "Something happened",&nbsp;"Setup has failed to validate the product key".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am <span>

<h2>            Disk Cleanup Hanging &#47; Not Completing - Temporary Files</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's 'Disk CleanUp' Utility frequently 'hangs' and does not (appear) to complete clearance of Temporary Files.<br />
Note, I'm <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>NOT</em></span> referring to the 'Temporary Internet Folder' (with the PadLock Icon next to it) but rather, the other 'Temporary Files' volume that appears further down the Disk CleanUp Window (next to Thumbnails)
 when you open Disk Cleanup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present, not a 'critical' issue, as Temporary File Size shown as just over 8MB, but would like to resolve, clean and stop the 'Hanging / Stalling'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it safe to go to C/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp&nbsp; then simply delete that Folder's 'Content' manually? (Or is that
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>not</strong></em></span> the source of the un-deleted Files?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't want to install a Third Party Utility to run a 'Cleanup' (don't trust Third Party App Code - i.e. virus / adware risk)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

<p>8MB, leave it alone, they are system files that probably can not be deleted. Mine is much more than that and can not be deleted. 8Mb is nothing. It is like a grain of sand in a sandbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just uncheck it after 2nd scan for system clean up and complete disk cleanup. Also I would create a restore point first, and then in More Options in disk clean up, select to delete all but last restore point to free up space.</p>

<p>Hi Seahawks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note your thoughts, but any suggestions regarding the 'hanging' of the Disk Cleanup Utility?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Progress Bar just displays at about 90% and never seems to conclude.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is 'manually' deleting the Temp Folder Content feasible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft (if you're watching) please improve your Disk Cleanup Utility PLUS please add a 'Finished Cleaning' Notification once the operation has concluded. In that way, we'll all know if the Cleaning Job has properly completed.</p>

<p>Well what part on disk clean up does it show when hanging up. Is it when it shows deleting the Temp files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, try unchecking temp files and see if it hangs up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows what files on the progress it is at during the clean up.</p>

<p>Good Point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just ran it again and (this time) it Hung at 'Thumbnails'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could be this is an 'intermittent' issue (i.e. Hangs a lot of the time, but 'sometimes' manages to finish the job).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performance just a bit 'hit and miss' I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll just have to keep an eye on it and hope it's less fluky in the future.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi, welcome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&gt;"...does this mean we have a bug?"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Quite sure that it is a Trojan, to find it out, please follow those:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, make two deep scans with Malwarebytes at least, it can be downloaded at:
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> &nbsp;and follow the instructions to install it.
</span><span>Run and update, scan after.</span></p>
<p><span>If something is found, follow MB instructions to clean your PC. Make two quick scans a day after updates to be sure that everything keeps fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Download CCleaner at:
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/</a>, run it and clean your machine.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>Uninstall any previous antivirus and install Microsoft Security Essentials at: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/</a>&nbsp;that
 works fine with Malwarebytes, use the native &nbsp;Windows Firewall also.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>But if you still feel uneasy after those, go to reformat your PC HD in a new “clean install” (custom) being aware that all files will be erased, but you will have your
 machine clean and more secure than before. See <span>
Install, reinstall, or uninstall Windows at: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/install-reinstall-uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/install-reinstall-uninstall</a>&nbsp; .</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p><span>Personally, this last would be my first choice in such a case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Just one more suggestion to play it safe, use two or more standard accounts and respective passwords, let the administrative one only for administration&nbsp;with strong password.&nbsp;Windows
 7 User Accounts at:<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/2974-user-accounts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/2974-user-accounts.html</a>&nbsp;, being aware that this is an outside link.</span></p>
</span></span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Good Luck.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 crash to black screen, monitor switches off, keyboard stops working, need to manually reboot</h2>
                    Hi, guys I have the 'black screen' problem with windows 7. I am running a dual core athlon 5200+ with a Radeon X1950 Pro. I have installed the latest drivers, but still have the same problem.
<br />
Problems first started while playing games but now windows just crashes (seemingly randomly) with a black screen, then the monitor switches itself off (computer still running), and the keyboard stops working (if i press caps lock , num lock, scroll lock, etc
 the light on the keyboard doesn't change status). I have also got windows xp installed on the same pc and have no problems with that at all.
<br />

This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
<strong>BlueScreenView</strong> - Free -&nbsp;scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes,<br />

MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the BlueScreen (BSOD) to within a second or so of the<br />
time of the BSOD to provide more information as to possible cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
<strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file -<br />

<p><strong>AppCrashView </strong>- Free -&nbsp;a small utility for Windows Vista and Windows 7 that displays the details of all<br />
application crashes occurred in your system. The crashes information is extracted from the .wer<br />

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            I am seeing more and more companies only developing apps for andriod or ios. &nbsp;I feel like Windows Phones are becoming the new blackberry. &nbsp;Without the ability to run apps in the background even available apps operate in an inferior manner than the andriod
 or ios versions. &nbsp;I too have a Windows phone and an andriod phone and have found android which is what I base my remarks on. &nbsp;Maybe if they get Windows 10 phone to join domains and have better VPN support it becomes attractive for business use.

            <p>Apps for Windows Mobile is concern of many users, companies claiming because market share of Windows Mobile is not as high as Android , they don't want to spend resource on hiring developer or develop for Windows Mobile. Then new way come into picture known
 as Universal Windows Platform, where they develop one core code and they need a bit of modification to make it work on Windows PC, Windows Mobile, HoloLens, Xbox and other devices. If developers aren't lazy they could go for it. No one could doubt that Windows
 PC has the greatest market share in the world.</p>
<p>So consumers must put pressure on companies to develop App for Windows Mobile too. No one would accept a company saying sorry, you must buy Android device to use this App , but it is behavior which companies are doing.</p>
<p>In addition, if there is any basic App which is not available but you want it, why not develop it yourself using Windows App Studio:</p>
<p><a href="https://appstudio.windows.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appstudio.windows.com/en-us</a>
</p>
<p>You don't need to be developer, it is easy for everyone who want to develop basic App for Windows (PC and Mobile). This is very unique experience for everyone who is using Windows Mobile.</p>

<p>Hello Roger, I hope 🤞 that you decided to purchase a Windows 10 phone. Two main reasons in my view maybe even 3 for that matter:</p>
<p>1) the Microsoft 950 xl with two sim cards is in my book one of the best phones in the market, I have had in the last 20 years many phone brands and many OS. However this model is in unlocked version middle prices with top price features.</p>
<p>2) with continuum and the ever improving Windows 10 the combination is a winner also from a cybersecurity point of view. The link with Office 365 and synchronization among the platforms is top. I do not find the application issue a problem there are plenty
 of alternatives. To bad if they do not make an app they loose out not you.</p>
<p>3) Neither the other two OS producers have a connection like the Gates Foundation. In my opinion they do a fantastic job worldwide with the profits Microsoft made, and by using their products I feel I contribute indirectly to that foundations work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said with the way the Microsoft team is going with the Windows 10 project I believe in the future more and more people will start to realize to pick up on Windows 10 mobile. Hope this is of assistance to you...</p>

            Is it really our job to do Microsoft's marketing job? Why should I have to spend my time contacting just about every app developer and beg them to make windows version? There are copyright issues and licencing issues if I go out and make my own version
 of most commercial apps.

            A pity great phone my 950 xl with 2 sims. &nbsp;In my view lots of potential with Windows 10. Rethink Apple Android grip on the market, &nbsp;analyse how many apps you really use, consider cybersecurity etc. Still enough room...&nbsp;

            These are two issues, Windows marketing is excellent only the underlying advantage of the foundation is another consideration to be made. As for the apps to many rubbish when I look at the Google store rather look at the somewhat serious windows store.
 Thanks for your reaction.&nbsp;

            <p>In no way, is the foundation some kind of underlying advantage, that helps anyone in need of some mainstream apps.</p>
<p>Now sure how many bank apps you just called rubbish but after many complaints...none, 0, not one of the three banks I deal with were willing to even consider a Win app. Get serious!</p>

            It is attractive for business; the cyber security excellent and improving under the umbrella of W10 enterprise. Further more some of the Microsoft phones have dual sims which is interesting for companies so that employees can have their private and the
 company sim in one device. The apps issue is largely over blown, from a business point of view there are all the apps one needs in a business environment. PayPal app I do not need because I go encrypted online with PayPal etc. Again the lack of application
 is widely overrated I have the 950XL now for sometime and I must say one of the best phones I have ever had. With Continuum it is the best and only PC\Smartphone available. For presentations and excel calculations no problem, editing contracts no problem,
 emailing no problem etc./etc...... And on top of that I can buy two for the price of the overrated other brands price and the integration with Desktop and laptop is without glitch. NO BRAINER,

                    <p>OK, here is the thing:</p>
<p>I have few games on my computer.</p>
<p>After my Windows 8.1 upgraded yesterday to Windows 10, FPS in ALL of those games drastically dropped!
</p>
<p>FPS in all those games was over 60fps before upgrade, now barely reach 30. Most drastically example is Deus Ex Human Revolution which is not demanding game at all and which was very much smooth with minimal FPS of 60 before this Windows upgrade, and now
 barely has 10 FPS and it's completely unplayable !!! But situation in other games is not better either.</p>
<p>After Windows 10 upgrade, NVidia updated it's drivers yesterday as well....</p>

<h2>            Windows Update won&#39;t connect to the Internet</h2>
                    Hello. I've been experiencing problems with Windows Update. I have just upgraded to Windows 10 a few weeks ago, and I still cannot get Windows Update to connect to the Internet to see if I need updates. My connection is fine, &nbsp;I am running it through WiFi
 and I can run Google Chrome (my default browser) without any issue, but this program can't seem to find a connection. Has anyone else been experiencing this problem? If so, can you share the solution? Thank you very much!

 about it not being able to connect to the Internet. Do you have other suggestions? Thank you for the advice, by the way.

            <p>Tools you will need for this task:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://code.kliu.org/misc/winisoutils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">eicfg_removal_utility.zip</a></strong> – is a simple tool that will remove the ei.cfg from any Windows ISO disc image, thereby converting the image into a “universal disc” that will prompt the user
 to select an edition during setup. It’s a free download <strong><a href="http://code.kliu.org/misc/winisoutils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>
</li><li><strong>Genuine Retail Windows 7 32 bit Installation DVD – </strong>this will be used to reinstall Windows 7 Starter 32 bit, any retail edition of Windows 7 32 bit will do, this includes Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate, doesn’t matter if its upgrade
 or full version. You cannot use a 64 bit DVD because there is no 64 bit version of Windows 7 Starter. You will need to create an image of the disc, please refer to our Notebooks.com tutorial about how to create a digital backup of your software
<strong>here</strong> </li></ul>
<p>After you have created the image of the Windows 7 32 bit DVD, we will edit the image and remove the ei.cfg file so we can reveal all editions of Windows 7 during the installation and select Windows 7 Home Basic. Lets take a look at doing it step by step.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2fimage_thumb.png%3fw%3d560%26amp%3bh%3d240" /></a></p>
<p>After downloading the eicfg removal utility, you need to extract it, since its in a .zip file. Just right click it and click Extract All.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/image1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2fimage_thumb1.png%3fw%3d564%26amp%3bh%3d78" /></a></p>
<p>Double click the <strong>eicfg_remover.exe </strong>file to launch it.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d546%26amp%3bh%3d390" /></a></p>
<p>Browse to where the Windows 7 Image (.ISO file) is stored, select it and click
<strong>Open. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d308%26amp%3bh%3d258" /></a></p>
<p>That’s it! the ei.cfg file is now removed. The next step now is to reinstall Windows 7 Home Basic. Because most Netbooks do not include a DVD drive, you will have to use a tool such as the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool</a>)

<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3_thumb.png%3fw%3d522%26amp%3bh%3d276" /></a></p>
<p>This simple tool will help you convert the same image file you just created to a USB thumb drive. For installation purposes, you should get a thumb drive that’s at least 4 GBs in size to store the installation files. Browse to where the Windows
 7 Image is stored, open it. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3b.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3b_thumb.png%3fw%3d500%26amp%3bh%3d266" /></a></p>
<p>Select the USB device where you want to have the backup stored to for installation.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3c_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d500%26amp%3bh%3d250" /></a></p>
<p>Once the USB device has been identified, click the <strong>Begin copying
</strong>button.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3d.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3d_thumb.png%3fw%3d487%26amp%3bh%3d263" /></a></p>
<p>And that’s it, the next step now is to boot your Netbook from the thumb drive, make sure the thumb drive you will be installing Windows 7 from is plugged into the USB port. This might vary by manufacturer, but the usual one to try is F12, start
 your Netbook and press F12 repeatedly until a screen is displayed giving you the option to boot from a USB Memory device, select that and press
<strong>Enter </strong>on your keyboard. The screen should look something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d525%26amp%3bh%3d386" /></a></p>

<p>Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment, the only difference this time is, you will be given a choice to select the edition of Windows 7 you want to reinstall.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-5_thumb.png%3fw%3d566%26amp%3bh%3d426" /></a></p>
<p>Select Windows 7 Starter and proceed with the installation as normal. I suggest that you create a backup once the installation is complete.
</p>
<p><strong>One thing to note, you will need a 32 bit Windows 7 installation media to do this, any edition of Windows 7 such as Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate will do. If you can find a disc, you can download a copy from the following link
 and use that to create the all in one disc:</strong></p>

<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

8 MICROSOFT STORE ERRORS AND HOW TO FIX THEM 
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-microsoft-store-errors/ 
Joe Keeley February 15, 2018 
&lt;snip&gt;
The Windows Store, recently rebranded as the Microsoft Store, is the official marketplace for downloading games, apps, themes, and more. It’s not uncommon for it throw out errors, many of which are hard to resolve. We’re here to help.
Whether your Store is apparently missing, has a damaged cache, stuck downloading, or something else entirely, we’re here to offer all sorts of solutions that should hopefully get everything sorted.
.  00. RESTART THE COMPUTER
Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs or Windows simply get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen component constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them completely is to restart the computer. 
.  0. MS STORE TROUBLE SHOOTING PROCESS
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps - Fix problems with apps from Microsoft Store
http://aka.ms/diag_apps10 - Direct link to dowload the MS Store trouble shooter
Also Use the built in Trouble shooter
Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
Scroll down to the bottom 
Click Windows Store Apps
****  Optional Bonus ****

.  1. WINDOWS STORE WON’T OPEN: WON’T GIVE YOU AN ERROR MESSAGE
.  2. TRY CLEARING THE STORE CACHE. WSRESET.EXE
Additional instructions 
http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/ 
WSReset.exe must be “Run as Admin”
Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
.  2B (OPTIONAL) MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
If the problems remain, you can try the manual process to reset Windows Update. The store uses Windows Update, so if there is a problem with Windows Update it could affect the store
Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html 
https://www.tekrevue.com/how-to-enable-system-restore-windows-10/ 
Create a System restore point. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point )
Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
Follow the instructions in this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6eHDtylDYo - How to Fix Win Update Errors
This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
. – in start menu search for Windows Update
. - click on “Check for Updates”
. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates
Windows Update Reset batch tool made by MS for XP up to Win10 Creator. 
https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Reset-Windows-Update-Agent-d824badc 
Download the tool from this page. 
Run it (use “Run as Admin”)
Run option 2
.  3. WINDOWS STORE IS MISSING: YOU’LL NEED TO REINSTALL IT.
Re-Install All Store Apps Using PowerShell
…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
…*  right click and select “Run as Administrator” option.
…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}
………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
………  get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmanifest.xml”)}
.  4. WINDOWS STORE DOWNLOAD IS STUCK: 
first check that you’re not trying to install them to an external hard drive.
.  5. ERROR CODE 0X80072EFD: THE STORE IS HAVING NETWORK ISSUES. 
Temporarily turning off the firewall was reported to work for one person.
.  6. ERROR CODE 0X80072EE7: IS A NETWORK ISSUE
This particular error code implies that the server has stumbled. It’s a network issue and can occur even if your internet browser is working perfectly. For this, try resetting your proxy settings. Press Win + R, input cmd and press Enter. Input this and press Enter:
netsh winhttp reset proxy
Restart your computer and open the Store, which should now be working.
.  7. ERROR CODE 0X8000FFFF:  STORE ERROR THAT SAYS THE PAGE CAN’T BE LOADED.
.  8. ERROR CODE 1: THIS IS A VERY CURIOUS ONE. IT WILL APPEAR WHEN YOU TRY TO LAUNCH THE STORE.
&lt;/snip&gt;
RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)

            No pausing it.&nbsp; It will work in the background fine. Depends on where you are backing up to as to how long it might take but its pretty fast here to everywhere other than to a usb thumb drive.&nbsp; My laptop uses windows Backup(File History) to an attached
 SSD on a usb port on my Wifi Access Point.&nbsp; Never ever even notice it working, but it works. &nbsp; System images from SSD sata3 to SSD sata2 internally 30gb is 2 to 3 minutes.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 and XPS Document Writer issues</h2>
                    I used to be able to select where I wanted to save my files when using&nbsp;XPS Writer&nbsp;on windows 8 and now it doesn't give me that option using windows 10. I also used to be able to rename the file before saving and no longer have this option as well. I tried
 going through the printer options and preferences, but with no luck. Is there any way to update this? Thank you.

            Same Problem. Example: Say you want to print this screen to a file.&nbsp; I press the "more actions" pull down and select "print", then a window pops up to choose printer, I then select "XPS Document Writer" there is no option to change the name of the file
 or the save location as with the old version that allowed you to pick "Save As".&nbsp; It now gives it a default name and puts the file in the Documents Folder.&nbsp; Hopefully there is a way to allow me to change the file name and its location without doing it manually
 after the fact.

            <p>It appears this is a problem with the new "Edge" browser specifically.&nbsp; In regards to that, the above post is completely irrelevant and unhelpful.&nbsp; However if I use Chrome, I get the "old style" XPS functionality.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put: </p>
<p>With a document open, "Print to XPS".&nbsp; In old versions of Windows, a&nbsp;Save dialog would appear, allowing you to choose the location and filename.&nbsp; That's exactly what it SHOULD do, anything else is idiotic.&nbsp; Apparently like many other Windows 10 decisions,
 the idiotic decision was made as the "Microsoft Way".&nbsp; There is no dialog box, it simply says "Saved the file to your documents location", with whatever name it chooses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I generate a financial payment, I want to "Save As" XPS, to a folder dedicated to that financial institution, on a location on my network storage drive, each payment is for a different vendor, and saved to a different folder, with a filename that I
 choose with a specific format of "date-payment" to make sorting and finding payments easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has made that impossible.&nbsp; How is not allowing the user to choose what to name their files, and where to save them, an improvement? This is stupid, just like the parental control changes, the requirement that I had to reconfigure my child to have
 an online account, and not be able to use their old "local" profile on the PC as a "child account, etc.&nbsp; I'm an I.T. professional with 25 years in the business, and the horrible usability changes Windows 10 has made to "make it dumber" as far as I can tell,
 are clearly designed to take freedom, flexibility, and efficiency, away from anyone that has a brain.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix the XPS writer, go right back to "save as" format where I can choose what to name my file, and where to put it, without having to hunt it down after the fact and "move" it.&nbsp;

            Thanks Chris, I tried using Chrome instead of Edge and that solves the problem of not being able to control the filename or location of the folder to save&nbsp;the file&nbsp;in.&nbsp; I don't know why Edge was designed this way but it needs to be fixed.

            <p>Assuming that you have administrative access, the following article describes a workaround. It changes the default to XPS rather than OXPS.</p>

    <title>Windows UPDATE not working properly ever since Windows 10 was - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevezv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows UPDATE not working properly ever since Windows 10 was released.</h2>
                    <p>I used to receive a notification that Updates were available, and a link to get them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since Windows &nbsp;10 was released this no longer happens. I have not a notification since that time</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now informed by my Anti Virus software (Not By Microsoft!) that my system is not up to date, and telling me to use windows update. When I go to the Update site I am faced ONLY with the immediate prospect of installing Windows 10. The only way I can
 get Security and other updates germane to Windows 7 is to select the "Check for Updates" option. Doing so can take HOURS of waiting time. I do not exaggerate. It is now 6:10 PM. I started to use Update at 4:20PM!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And once I am presented with a list of available updates, I must DE-Select Window 10 Manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like Windows 10 to be removed from the list of updates, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
or at least be able to find what is available and choose for myself what I want in a reasonable and timely manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to entirely remove Windows 10 from the update list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there some quick and certain way to get the list of available updates without this endless wait?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey Stevezv.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me too. &nbsp;As Charlie Brown once said, "Auuuuuuggggghhhh!!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found my wife has been neglecting her Windows (7) Updates, again. &nbsp;Since I got my mittens on it, I figured I'd do a good turn, and get it caught up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At 5 PM, I told Windows Update to look for available updates. &nbsp;It took <em>2 hours
</em>before it finally told me that it needed 30 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen a computer have a nervous breakdown if you ask for too many updates at once -- 2 GB is not enough in the 21st Century -- so I selected the two largest updates for a total of 100 MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I pressed Go Do Not Collect $200, it took <em>another 2 hours</em>&nbsp;<em>15 minutes</em> before the updates downloaded. &nbsp;I happened to be staring at the computer at the time, and once the downloads started, they were done in a minute. &nbsp;Installation and
 restarting took another few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I should have selected more updates to install, because two was nothing, and I'm afraid it will take another
<em>two hours </em>before I get a refreshed list of available updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I remember complaints exactly along these lines about Windows Update started with the Windows 10 noodges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which reminds me, thanks for reminding me to check for Windows 10 updates. &nbsp;If I click on a particular update and select "Details" and avoid anything about updating to Win 10, and then if I find the computer has updated to Win 10 anyway, I'm going to mail
 a brick to Microsoft -- reverse postage due, with a piece of fish duct-taped to it, when the weather gets warmer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to check for Win 10 stuff with the two updates I just did, but the computer still says it's Win 7. &nbsp;Whew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to be more understanding. &nbsp;Microsoft probably can't afford more Update servers, etc. &nbsp;And there are soooo many computers out there needing updates...</p>

            <p>Microsoft is really letting the user community down on these sad topics.&nbsp; The problems are MSN systems problems related to Windows 10, which some of us got from their FREE download offer.&nbsp; I have had nothing but bad vibes about windows 10 ever since.&nbsp; PC's
 don't work properly under Windows 10.&nbsp; At least mine doesn't. &nbsp;Windows freeze up, e mail access is delayed, considerably at times.&nbsp; Sometimes no e mail access.&nbsp; We should not have to restore to previous versions to get around Windows 10 problems or re-boot
 the PC's.&nbsp; MSN USE to be a leader in the field. No longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess if Apple can refuse to unlock phone for the US Government [and get away with it] that MSN can tell the user community - to bug off - we aren't working on these trivial matters.&nbsp; Fix it yourselfI have been a MSN user for over 15 years; and NEVER EVER
 seen the **** that coming along now with the new, great? Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next PC will be Apple.&nbsp; We never hear from MSN.&nbsp; Does the user community run the show with MSN?&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps so, because it's FREE to MSN.&nbsp; Zero cost to MSN, although they probable have folks monitoring this web site, for good ideas.&nbsp; Note: they must be
 skipping the problem issues being discussed. The user community has some good comments, and some not so good comments.&nbsp; Who are we to trust?.&nbsp; Also, I see adds popping up to fix this or that issue, which will cost money and could screw up the systems more
 than they are currently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my ending comment is to MSN -&nbsp; WAKE UP and fix these issues and provide auto downloads into PC's to get them fixed.&nbsp; I am talking of Windows 10 users in particular.&nbsp; I am running on a HP Envy PC.&nbsp; I also wonder if one were yo purchase the Windows 10
 CD [if one exists] and runs it on a PC that already running on the FREE Windows 10, if it might? work properly.&nbsp; I did not say better, I mean properly.&nbsp; These tie delays are maddening [are you listening MSN??].</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally am tired and fed up over Windows 10&nbsp; and look forward to my next PC acquisition [Apple].</p>

            <p>Hey Thrashzone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That article from ZDNet is great.&nbsp; It's short reading, and should be a "must-read" for EVERYONE on this thread that's having trouble with Win7 updates, or anyone just starting to run into problems with Win7 updates and landing on this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article mentions that Microsoft recognized the Win7 Windows Update problem in their "Microsoft Knowledge Base 3102810: Installing and searching for updates is slow and high CPU usage occurs in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2."&nbsp; The ZDNet article
 links to the Knowledge Base, which will only give you a headache, but it doesn't really provide any advice as far as I could tell, certainly not as much advice as the ZDNet article.&nbsp; But it's interesting that MS recognizes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ZDNet article describes how dozens or hundreds of updates are rolled into a "service pack," a gift which would simplify installing the 250 updates that have been released since SP1 was released.&nbsp; But according to the article, there's no chance that Microsoft
 will release another service pack for Win7, because it's 5 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to me, they're either lazy bums for refusing to put together another service pack -- considering that Win7 will be supported until 2020, or they're trying to push people into Win10 with it's better-developed domestic spying functionality.&nbsp; Remember,
 in the fight between Apple and the FBI about hacking into that terrorist's iPhone, Microsoft took the FBI's side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, anyone installing a fresh copy of Win7 will have <em>days</em> of installs to perform, with all those hundreds of individual updates to perform, and the way the process hijacks a computer for the duration, and the long waits before getting a response
 from the Windows Update servers at the start of the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ZDNet article also includes advice that before starting a Win7 installation process, begin by downloading two updates

KB3083710</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3102810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB3102810</a>, and copy them to a USB flash drive.&nbsp; After installing Win7, if you point its Windows Update to those two updates, it will speed up the Update process for the other 200+ updates so it only takes "a few hours" instead of days-or-more.&nbsp; At least
 that's what the article says.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any update problems will be aggravated by older hardware.&nbsp; MS fails by recommending a "1 GHz processor and 512 MB of ram," which does a disservice to so many people.&nbsp; There's a big difference between a 1 GHz i-type processor (i3, i5, i7), and a 1 GHz Pentium
 D with hardly any instruction sets, so only saying "1 GHz" is too non-specific at best, and disingenuous at worst.&nbsp; And 512 MB of ram is just silly -- imagine mixing a "giant swap-file" into the Windows Update problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One criticism I have of the ZDNet article is that it's very M$-centric; it's written under the assumption that there are no other Operating System options besides Windows, and it doesn't have much to criticize about Win10.&nbsp; But it does put the Win7 Windows
 Update problem into a pretty good perspective, especially with the "forecast for pain."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you are there.</p>
<p>

    <title>Persistent Sticky Keys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jake_raupp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Persistent Sticky Keys</h2>
                    Happy summer to everybody :)<br />
<br />
<strong>System Details:</strong><br />
Acer Predator G9-793<br />
Intel i7 6700HQ<br />
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 (8.0 GB VRAM)<br />
16.0 GB RAM<br />
<br />
<strong>OS Details:</strong><br />
Windows 10 Home<br />
Version 1803<br />
OS Build 17134.165<br />
<br />
Any more details/logs, please feel free to ask :)<br />
<br />
<strong>Issue:</strong><br />
I've been having an issue for the past 4 or so months with sticky keys persistently turning itself on. If my computer goes to sleep, it will automatically turn sticky keys on again, regardless of shift being pressed 5 times. Sometimes if the computer idles
 long enough it will turn back on as well. To turn it off, I go into Ease of Access Center, and uncheck the box that says "Allow the Shortcut Key to Start Sticky Keys", and turn off the toggle that says "Press One Key at a Time for Keyboard Shortcuts" (Sticky
 Keys). This effectively turns it off, until the computer is left unattended or is put to sleep.<br />
<br />
<strong>Solutions Attempted:</strong><br />
1) Entering the registry and changing the values of the&nbsp; Sticky Keys, Filter Keys, and Toggle Keys (flags values) to the suggested values in all the other Sticky Keys Threads. No result. I double checked and the values did stay changed.<br />
<br />
2) Renaming the sticky keys files (sethc.exe) in the OS folder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3) Deleting the sticky keys files.<br />
<br />
4) I tried the "windows troubleshooting" which brought me to a thread saying to delete the "flags" folders for Sticky, Toggle, and Filter keys in the registry. Still no result.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help in advance :) Please feel free to ask for more information.<br />

<p>Hi Jake,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing the solutions you've performed in trying to resolve this issue. With the troubleshooting steps you've tried, it seems that your user profile might be corrupted. I suggest that you create a new user profile on your computer to isolate
 the issue. You can follow the steps provided on the link <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're still experiencing the same issue with the new user profile, then I recommend performing a clean boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs which helps us determine whether or not the
 issue is caused by a software conflict that occur when a new program or update is installed. For the detailed steps, please check out&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How
 to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></a> and follow the ones for <strong>
Windows 10</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: Please go through the section:&nbsp;</span><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span><span>&nbsp;of the Kb article to boot the computer
 in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<h2>            Network Icon displays with the Blue circle in task bar</h2>
                    <p>This isn't a big deal, but, if it is an easy fix I would like to know it....&nbsp; Running Win7; 32bit Home Premium&nbsp;and &nbsp; IE9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I bootup my PC, occasionally the Network Icon which I have set to appear in the lower right side of the Taskbar.....displays with the Blue Circle on it.&nbsp; Normally you see this blue circle until the network connection is complete and then it disappears.&nbsp;
 When this Icon displays with the Blue circle, and I have a Network connection (confirmed by opening IE9 and it opens fine)....if I re-boot normally the Icon displays as it should without the Blue Circle.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Are you using a wired or wireless connection? <br />
<br />
2. Which is the antivirus program installed on the computer? <br />
<div>3. Who is the manufacturer of the computer? What is the make and model? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you see a blue circle, it means the network has been located. Ideally it should disappear once it is completed the connection.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the network troubleshooter</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7<br />
</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>(Applicable only if you are using wired connection)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode with Networking.<br />
<div>Step 1: Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.<br />
<div>Safe Mode with Networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers and services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer this link to boot into Safe Mode:<br />
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Refer this link for more information:<br />
<div><strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2: Clean boot</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>If you do not face the issue in safe mode, then put your computer in clean boot and check for the issue.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong> Disable antivirus software if installed any and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Warning: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Update the driver for the Network Adapter to the latest by visiting the manufacturer’s website.</div>
<div><br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Further every time I want to make any change in the Laptop I also get a Pop Up authorization for proceeding with the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Post this I have also been facing problem with my inbuilt Acer Crystal Eye Webcam which is recognized ONLY when checked through WebViewer and even the Webcam Executable Application doesn't show anything. &nbsp;Would like to mention that though the webcam is
 accessible through webviewer the SKYPE application is not able to recognize any Webcam in the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Internet Explorer has stopped working though I have reinstalled the same. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Request you to please help me overcome these issues.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description I understand that you are facing unnecessary popup for an unknown application and facing issue with the webcam while accessing it through web
 viewer and it’s unable to recognize your webcam in the laptop. You are also experiencing Internet Explorer crash issue. . I can understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. I will certainly help you with all your issues.
<span>I suggest you the following steps to resolve the issue:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in a
<strong>Clean Boot </strong>state and check the status. A <strong>clean boot</strong> helps to verify if any third party application service or startup item is causing this issue. I suggested you to perform clean boot as it will stop the unnecessary program
 being run in the background which might be related with the popup which you have described in your post.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer you to the Link for
<strong>Clean Boot:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Important</span></span></strong><span>: Putting your system
 in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Note</span></span></strong><span>: After you have finished troubleshooting,
 follow steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;suggest you to uninstall the webcam driver from the device manager.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link to the article based on how to uninstall devices and driver packages from device manager:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once uninstallation would be completed please reinstall the
<strong>WebCam Application</strong> from ACER support.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the Link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still face issues with Internet Explorer after Clan Boot I suggest you to follow the steps which is mentioned in article on “</span><span><span>What
 to do when Internet&nbsp;Explorer isn't working”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Important</span></span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong><span>
 The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note
 these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</span></p>

<p>...repairing the zip extension is right at the bottom of the list. The instructions are right at the top.</p>

            It didn't work...the file still when about to download says it will open with notepad. This is the screen that says opening: "you have chosen to open...." How should fire fox do with this file. I need it to stop having notepad as the default<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Apologies, I think that the way your question is phrased has confused me.</p>
<p>Exactly what file is it that you are trying to download? If you don't know its full name can you provide the download url (web address)?</p>
<p>It now sounds to me like the file is not a zip file but is a file that 7-Zip can open and&nbsp;that you have inadvertently told your PC that this type of file should open with notepad. If that is the case...</p>
<ul>
<li>Download it and save it to a known location (if you haven't already)</li><li>Right click it, rest the mosue pointer&nbsp;on Open with, then click Choose default program...</li><li>Select 7-Zip as the default program, tick Always use the selected program to open this kind of file</li><li>Click OK</li></ul>
<p>Tricky</p>

            That doesn't work either....it was a file type that was only known as 002 file, the 002 from the fact it was the second. 7-Zip can only extract from this file not open it. I need it to stop downloading it as notepad or anything...it needs to be in the
 original state, an unknown file type for my computer.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As far as 7-Zip is concerned, extracting <em><strong>is</strong></em> opening.</p>
<p>Notepad would not open a .002 file unless the file association for 002 was set to use notepad by default. So, unless the dougknox fix for notepad did not do its job, that cannot be your problem either.</p>
<p>I am not sure what your problem is. Perhaps if you gave me the download url as previously requested,&nbsp;things might become clearer to me.</p>

                    Hi,<br />
<br />
starting today i've started getting this error, when ever it happens explorer locks up and a bunch of the app's in the metro interface no longer work (or at least the links don't work).<br />
<br />
These are the error's i have found in the event viewer :<br />
The server {995C996E-D918-4A8C-A302-45719A6F4EA7} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.<br />
The server {329B80EC-2230-47B8-905D-A2DCF5171C6F} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.<br />
<br />
the first error points towards : %SystemRoot%\System32\rundll32.exe %SystemRoot%\System32\shell32.dll,SHCreateLocalServerRunDll {995C996E-D918-4a8c-A302-45719A6F4EA7}<br />
<br />
the second points towards : %SystemRoot%\System32\rundll32.exe shell32.dll,SHCreateLocalServerRunDll {329B80EC-2230-47B8-905D-A2DCF5171C6F}<br />
<br />
does anybody know what might cause this and how to solve it?<br />

            this is now happening every time i try to use explorer, after the crash it works for a few seconds and then hangs again, happens about once every 2-3 min.<br />
<br />
quite a pain in the ...<br />

<h2>            Activate media player on Windows 8 PC</h2>
                    <p>I'm running a purchased copy of Window 8 Pro with Media Center, as stated by the Window Activation Page,&nbsp; on a 32 bit PC.</p>
<p>I must Activate Window Media Center before 31 January, Microsoft reminded me with an Email with the product key.</p>
<p>When I follow the described procedure and I get to the line <strong>add</strong>
<strong>features</strong> and then click <strong>Settings</strong> I do not get the choice
<strong>Add Features to Windows 8</strong>.</p>
<p>I only get <strong>Turn Windows Features on or off</strong>.</p>
<p>I cannot Activate Media Player.&nbsp; I've tried to read most of the FAQs on the subject and followed some of the instruction with no avail.</p>
