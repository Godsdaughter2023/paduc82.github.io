<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 10130 &#8211; Release Candidate or Train Wreck&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is the sad tale of my few days spent testing Microsoft’s Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview, Build 10130.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is the build for which, <a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/known-issues-in-the-latest-windows-10-preview-build-10130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
according to Neowin</a>, "Microsoft has made it clear that this build - and future ones - will focus less on delivering major new features to the operating system, and more on adding polish and stability ahead of its release this summer".<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prone to depression, or of a sensitive nature, you may not wish to read the whole piece, so I shall summarise my conclusions for you.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This build, which should be of the standard of a Release Candidate, given that the official release is set for the end of July, is not fit for purpose.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any purpose.<span>&nbsp; </span>To all intents and purposes, it works so badly that it is unusable.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is disgraceful software.<span>&nbsp; </span>To borrow a phrase from Monty Python, it is the software equivalent of a dead parrot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That’s it.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can turn your attention elsewhere now.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Expect a functional version of Windows 10 in a few months, maybe; don’t hold your breath though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for the masochistic, here’s the story.<span>&nbsp; </span>You would expect an operating system due for public release in just over a month to be virtually wrapped up, all its basic functions firm and reliable, with a few rough edges to be smoothed off in
 the remaining few weeks, would you not?<span>&nbsp; </span>So I thought on Sunday 14 June, when I decided to have another look at Windows 10, set up on my multi-booting HP EliteBook 8540w (Core i7, 8 GB RAM, mobile NVIDIA&nbsp; Quadro FX 880M, one SSD, one HD, standard
 MBR partitioning).<span>&nbsp; </span>This system has been happily triple-booting Windows 7, Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon, and earlier versions of Windows 10 for several months now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The most recent Windows 10 build I had installed was 10074.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It looked promising, although I was at a loss to understand what all the fuss was about really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time I wasn't aware of Build 10130; I just thought I would start by updating my system to the next build on the Fast Ring.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I did that, and initially it all looked OK, although the taskbar no longer autohid.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Right-clicking on the taskbar allowed me to change the search box to an icon, but autohide still wouldn't work, and the Start Menu came up only a couple of times before deciding it had had enough.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Clicking an icon on the taskbar produced nothing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I managed to get Settings up so I could run Updates, but after that everything went pear-shaped, and even Restart didn't work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had to use the physical Power button to reboot.<span>&nbsp; </span>It's had more use in the last few days than it has for months.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Logging in again got me no further towards a working system.<span>&nbsp; </span>
So I decided that the update process must have failed, and I would have to do a clean installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I went to the Microsoft website to check whether there was an ISO later than 10074 , and discovered that the site is now offering Build 10130, including a GB (UK) build, so I downloaded and burnt that to (fortunately) rewritable DVD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I did a clean installation, making sure to delete and recreate the installation partition during the procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't bore you with the history of that installation and the next.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I got systems that wouldn't do anything much; Start menus that wouldn't; taskbars from which no task could be achieved, not even right-clicking to start Task Manager; instances of Task Manager (eventually) which would not manage, or end, any tasks or processes,
 and eventually themselves ended up "not responding"; systems which gradually died, refusing to allow any programs to run for much longer than it took to display "not responding" in the title bar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In no case was I able to restart the system using the Restart option; the Power button quickly lost its layer of dust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add injury to insult, the OS eventually trashed the MBR, so I couldn't boot anything.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Using the OS installation disk, I initiated an AutoRepair.<span>&nbsp; </span>Has that ever worked, for anyone?<span>&nbsp;
</span>For me, System Restore and AutoRepair have never worked, ever.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Well, OK, there was the once, but it was a few years ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>They always result in a long wait, after which Windows comes back and unapologetically says it couldn't actually achieve anything, and perhaps I should try something else.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Ring a friend, perhaps.<span>&nbsp; </span>Couldn't do it?<span>&nbsp; </span>This is not rocket science, just a simple MBR reset, like GRUB does routinely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a bit of messing about, I recovered my MBR manually, so I could get back into Windows 7 and Linux.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But two clean installations later I still couldn't get a working W10 system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes I couldn't get beyond the lock screen.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes login wouldn't go beyond typing in the PIN or password.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes it wouldn't even let me type the PIN or password.<span>&nbsp; </span>
And after the initial installation and updating stage, never ever did Restart or Shutdown work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Never.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not once.<span>&nbsp; </span>Programs installed, ran for a while, then froze.<span>&nbsp;
</span>OneDrive proved almost impossible to configure.<span>&nbsp; </span>Behaviour was slightly different between installations, but always bad.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At one stage, the OS was automatically running CHKDSK at every boot for every NTFS partition it could find, and finding errors to correct too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought I would write up the sorry mess to present to you happy few, you band of brothers, but before that I would do one final clean installation and take notes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Today I did that.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here we go, one last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10 Installation - The Final Cut.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation proceeds normally; I log in to my Microsoft account and set a PIN during the process.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The system sets up my standard desktop background and ID icon.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I repeatedly Update from Settings until no more are presented.<span>&nbsp; </span>At least I don't get the dreaded Error 0x80070103 any more, not sure why.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Why can't Microsoft just say straight out that this error is probably due to trying to install a driver that was already installed, instead of my needing to Google the error number?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I set build updating to Fast.<span>&nbsp; </span>I eventually find where the option to display desktop icons has been hidden (deep in Settings | Display | Themes; why not make it as awkward as possible?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I can start Explorer from the taskbar, so I do so and start the process of redirecting system folders like Documents from C:\Users\Martin to my D: drive, where the folders are set up as D:\Martin\Documents, etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I always keep my data on a separate partition.<span>&nbsp; </span>That works OK, but I am going to need to change the security permissions on D: to ensure programs and I have full access.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There the problems start: the properties dialogs for D: will not let me enter, i.e. type in, a new security principal.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have to reboot to get normal access to the security settings.<span>&nbsp; </span>
During reboot, I get, as I often do, an explorer.exe error on exit (memory could not be read). At least Restart worked this time.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>More messing about with security settings and ownership turns out to be necessary before I can get access to Documents, Music, etc.</p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>More messing about with security settings and ownership turns out to be necessary before I can get access to Documents, Music, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note here that the OS has taken to using the first few letters of my email address as the User, i.e. my user folder is C:\Users\j_m_w instead of C:\Users\Martin.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is presumably because I put in my Microsoft ID during installation, but the system must still have known my first name, since it presents it at login.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also I can't find myself as a security principal under Martin, only under j_m_w.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Weird.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Well, stupid, actually).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I use Settings to ensure all the system and taskbar icons are shown in the notification area, so I can see what's going on there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I start the Task Manager by right-clicking on the taskbar, because I know I'm going to need it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the course of messing around, I get two Control Panel windows, one containing only the message "Page failed to load".<span>&nbsp;
</span>Never mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install Core Temp so that I can keep an eye on the processor temperatures, which have been known to get a bit high in the past but have been fine during these tests - think my heat sink needs replacing, the heat pipe's probably low on gas.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also install Networx, so I can check download rates when updating.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Then install EaseUS Todo Backup Free 8.3, so I can back up the OS to external USB HD, and maybe save a bit of time if another reinstallation becomes necessary.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also enable .NET 3.5 and install Windows Live Mail.<span>&nbsp; </span>At first WLM works fine and downloads my Hotmail.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I try to change the mail Store Folder to one on the D: drive; at the end of the procedure wlmail.exe locks up, and Task Manager refuses to kill it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Eventually Task Manager refuses to do anything at all, and becomes unresponsive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>By now Networx has frozen - the graph display has stopped moving.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Ctrl-Alt-Del, as is usual with this OS, does nothing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Restart does not work when selected from the Start Menu.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then the Start Menu won't come up any more, although right-clicking on the Start icon brings up a menu from which Restart can be selected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But that doesn't work either.<span>&nbsp; </span>Long press on the Power button.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Leave the system to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Return to the PC to log in, but I left it too long.<span>&nbsp; </span>The lock screen lifts OK (sometimes it has literally locked in place), but when I type in my PIN, nothing happens.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I select password entry instead, but no input box is presented, and still nothing happens.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I select the power icon and Restart, but it doesn't work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nothing happens.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Long press the Power button.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again.<span>&nbsp; </span>This time I wait and log in straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Core Temp comes up fairly quickly, but Networx takes a while, for some reason.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This OS is supposed to be fast?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decide to install Firefox.<span>&nbsp; </span>Installation goes OK, but when Firefox gives me the option to make it the default browser, Windows refuses to do so, and says I have to go to the Settings | System page (I think) and do it myself.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Gee thanks.<span>&nbsp; </span>I try to sign in to Firefox Sync, but the Firefox title bar is displaying "not responding" before I can complete the sign-in.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I try to kill Firefox with Task Manager, but pressing End Task does exactly nothing except begin the process of locking up Task Manager.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Task Manager "not responding"?<span>&nbsp; </span>****?<span>&nbsp; </span>Shouldn't Task Manager be beyond that sort of thing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Networx stops.<span>&nbsp; </span>The taskbar has become unresponsive, and the Start Menu will not come up.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I just get the circular "timer" cursor when I hover it over the area.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Core Temp is still going.<span>&nbsp; </span>Think positive.<span>&nbsp; </span>But nothing works now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Reboot - using the Power key.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, I log in quickly and am immediately confronted with "We couldn't find the location of your OneDrive folder."<span>&nbsp;
</span>Serves me right for having relocated it to the D:drive, I suppose.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I select to Reconfigure, and enter my Microsoft ID (why?<span>&nbsp; </span>The system already has it) but the reconfiguration process stops at "Sync your OneDrive files to this PC" ...<span>&nbsp;
</span>"loading your list of folders".<span>&nbsp; </span>Closing the dialog box and clicking on the OneDrive taskbar icon to restart the process gives no result.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Left- or right-click on the icon - nothing. Try using Task Manager to stop OneDrive so I can restart it - doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Networx has stopped.<span>&nbsp; </span>Select Start Menu, Power, Restart - no highlight on Restart, no response.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Right-click on Start icon, Shut down or restart, select restart.<span>&nbsp; </span>
No response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hard reboot - again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Login, presented immediately with OneDrive setup dialog.<span>&nbsp; </span>It works this time, so I let it set up OneDrive on C: to avoid further trouble.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Note that, amazingly, this version of OneDrive is dated 2013; that is to say, it is the version shipped for Windows 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In an RC version of the operating system, critically dependent on an updated OneDrive for its success, shouldn't Microsoft be doing a little better than this?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Whatever happened to the useful file placeholder system in Windows 8.1?<span>&nbsp;
</span>That would have been really good if a file or folder's online/offline status had been more clearly indicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to Settings | System to change the default browser to Firefox, which works OK.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I try to go to Settings | Updates, but Settings locks up just as I select Updates, so I can't get in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to log in to Firefox Sync again, and get as far as typing one character of the login before Firefox goes to "not responding".<span>&nbsp;
</span>Networx has frozen again.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can't do anything with the taskbar or reach the Start Menu.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I try to use the Task Manager to kill Firefox, but nothing happens.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Eventually a little box comes up with "Microsoft Windows - the application is not responding"!<span>&nbsp;
</span>Microsoft Windows is not responding!<span>&nbsp; </span>You can say that again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I select "End Process" for kicks, but nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select the Start Menu, press Power.<span>&nbsp; </span>No result.<span>&nbsp; </span>I click away, then click the Start icon again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No Start Menu.<span>&nbsp; </span>I right-click the Start icon, and get the menu for shutdown or restart, but choosing Restart just puts the cursor into circular "waiting" mode, so guess what?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Long press on the Power button.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, I decide to reboot into Windows 7 to try to restore my sanity.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Windows 7 promptly starts CHKDSK, which scans every NTFS partition, and corrects various errors that it finds, including in the master file table for D:.<span>&nbsp;
</span>How did D: get corrupted?<span>&nbsp; </span>I am starting to get really cross now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I eventually get into the much more pleasant environment of Windows 7, with its restful Aero windows, and start to fix the permissions on D: so it can be reached properly from both W7 and W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I boot into Linux Mint Cinnamon 17 - a really pleasant environment, set up with Variety to be pretty to look at, where everything works, and works fast.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I do a quick apt-get update/upgrade, just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I reboot, and leave the machine to boot back into W10.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately I again leave it too long before coming back to the PC, and although I can enter the PIN, login doesn't happen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Selecting Restart doesn't work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Power switch reboot - again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This time the PIN works and it looks as if login is proceeding - but no, the little spinning circle of white dots just stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power switch reboot.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, I get in, but I can't get any sense out of OneDrive, which seems not to be working at all.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I run Firefox to try to sign in to Sync, but suddenly it is - guess what? - "not responding".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cursor is now a spinning circle.<span>&nbsp; </span>The taskbar is not usable.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Start Menu is not accessible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Core Temp has stopped (with a low temperature indicated).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Networx has stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have stopped.<span>&nbsp; </span>Windows 10 Build 10130 is a disgrace.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Shame on Microsoft for accepting the goodwill and input of hundreds, if not thousands, of people and rewarding them with this rubbish.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Shame on Microsoft if the <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/12/how-windows-insider-feedback-influences-windows-10-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
best example</a> it can give of the use it has made of that input is to implement a new window button and move it about on the title bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In postscript, I am surprised that no-one else seems to have reported suffering in the same way.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I could have repeated the tests on another computer, I would have, but if it had run W10 satisfactorily, that would still leave the question of how the 8540w could run Windows 7, Linux Mint, and all previous builds of Windows 10, but not this build.</p>

<p>Thank you for your detailed description of your experience. &nbsp;You're not alone, and I wish I could say it gets better, but I have my doubts. &nbsp;Each new build seems to introduce more issues than fixes. &nbsp;By now one would think we've turned the corner so to speak,
 and problems would be relegated to unusual use-case issues, or limited functionality in new features. &nbsp;Instead, the basic and core functions of the OS are hit-or-miss. &nbsp;Some people report it being fast fluid and flawless, but that has not been my experience.
 &nbsp;The last build that worked for me was 9879 and it's been downhill since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for kicks, I'll wager that if you did the compatibility testing for your computer against the "get Win10 app" it would green-light and say there's no known issues.</p>

            I've read about many of these issues coming across many threads, but not all of them in one single thread like this one. Overall, I'll say I've been reasonably lucky with only a handful of serious issues spread over many builds until I got to 10130. Even
 at that, enabling the NX bit in the BIOS got me going though I am now on Pro Edition instead of the Enterprise Edition where I've been testing up till now. I agree that this thing is far from ready for a July 29th release. More testing Is definitely needed.

            <p>just 'ew'. &nbsp;thanks for finding all of that. &nbsp;I skimmed it, saw a few really NASTY problems you had, and thought 'way more than enough'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad I didn't get 10130. &nbsp;I still have an older build that I HAVE! NOT! BEEN! USING! because I need to devote my time to work that pays for a bit, but if I left my VM on long enough to download that and let it install itself, it'd probably end up being
 a worthless pile of bits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>not like it really matters, except I activated one of the copies of DevStudio on it, but I doubt I'll *evar* use that version, since 2010 does fine for me. &nbsp;On windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>again, thanks for confirming that this Pile Of Bits called 'Windows 10' is not worth installing. &nbsp;EVAR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can't rush to market like this and expect end-users to test all your bugs, ya know? &nbsp;That goes DOUBLE with the COMPLETE LACK of worth-while features that aren't "virtual desktops". &nbsp;that's the only one *I* found, anyway. &nbsp;All other 'new features' are
 STINKERS, particularly the adware+spyware, and the tiles in the start menu.</p>

Thanks for your reply - you're quite right, the "Get Windows 10" utility does indeed come up with "You're good to go!".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also have pointed out that I verified the SHA-1 hash of the downloaded installation ISO using HashTab, and I verified the installation DVD on burning it.</p>

            To be fair to Microsoft - although I'm not sure I really want to be fair - I should make a couple of points additional to the original post.<br />
<br />
1) Much to my surprise, there are people out there running 10130 on systems similar to mine with no problem whatsoever.&nbsp; I posted a similar rant on the HowToGeek Discussion forum (https://discuss.howtogeek.com/t/windows-10-technical-preview-build-10130-release-candidate-or-train-wreck/29879/4),
 and wilsontp in particular is running an i7 Lenovo system with hardware virtualisation turned on, without incident.<br />
<br />
BIOS settings for the processor do seem to be a possible issue, but the limited selection presented in my BIOS looks plausible to me - virtualisation and Data Execution Prevention, mainly.&nbsp; I'm not sure what the NX bit is, but I don't have an explicit option
 for it.&nbsp; But if certain settings are necessary, surely the "Get Windows 10" utility should tell you what they are?<br />
<br />
<br />
2) I continue to be amazed by the number of posts by people looking for help because they are having problems with Windows 10 on their primary PC, or on a machine which has taken a great deal of effort to set up and contains valuable material.<br />
<br />
Under no circumstances should anyone install any version of Windows 10 on a PC that contains data and programs essential for work or private use.&nbsp; Do not install W10 on a PC unless you don't mind if the system is trashed.<br />
<br />
To their credit, Microsoft has made this clear from the outset.&nbsp; I have to feel some sympathy with people like students who can't get their PCs to work after W10 installation and so on, but why don't they read the directions first?<br />
<br />
I set up data files and folders (Document, Music, Downloads, etc.) on a separate (D:) partition, so installing or reinstalling to C: has no effect on the data.&nbsp; All that is necessary is to redirect the folders using the Location tab after installation.&nbsp; But
 even then, I have all the data backed up (i) on an external USB, and (ii) in the cloud (Wuala.com).<br />
<br />
When I finally crack and throw the Windows 10 PC through the window, it won't actually matter all that much.&nbsp; Except to someone walking underneath, maybe.<br />

            <p>Of course the answer is dependent of whether you are Microsoft, their lacky press or an end user.&nbsp; If you are in the two prior groups.... This release is the best thing since sliced bread.&nbsp; If you are in the last group you are wary and scared to death that
 this is going to be released.</p>
<p>But hey...... Microsoft doesn't care.&nbsp; They will release it.&nbsp; Corporate sponsors will shove it out there and the poor, unsuspecting public will lap it up.&nbsp; And cuss it, and hate it, and drive support folks absolutely NUTS!</p>
<p>Wait until the "update like we tell you or else" policy hits and you have a bunch of not-so-tech-savy folks getting BSOD, black screens or boot loops because a driver that Microsoft just forced on them crashes their machine.&nbsp; Won't that be a fun day at The
 Geek Squad?!?!?&nbsp; :p</p>
<p>I am just so sad that Microsoft just refuses to listen to anybody but their own cheer squad.&nbsp; It is a sad, sad day indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take care</p>

                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Outlook.com has deleted all of my past emails apart from the ones received in the last week. I'm extremely concerned as I had some very important emails on there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had several notifications on my phone telling me it had failed to sign in to my email account. I then looked on my email on my phone and mac and they had all disappeared.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me get them back!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind regards</div>

When wa the last time you logged in using a web browser (not from a mobile device)?<br />
<br />

<h2>            Getting a URL to go back to a specific email in Outlook 365&#63;</h2>

<p>

            <p>Not quite sure what you mean by&nbsp;<em>Outlook 365</em>.</p>
<p>There's Outlook, part of Office 365, or there's Outlook Web Access (OWA) or there's Outlook.com, the web-based email service.</p>
<p>If you're talking about the latter, then just double-click on the email, and you'll see the link in the browser address bar...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here's the URL I use to access my email: https://outlook.office.com/owa/</p>

</p><p>The URL contains "owa", but the title bar also says Office 365 (see screenshot).</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion to double-click on an email. I tired that, but here is the URL I get:&nbsp;https://outlook.office.com/owa/projection.aspx&nbsp;</p>

<h3> jason grabowski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add-Ins for Project 2019</h2>
                    Will my add-in that works for Microsoft Project 2016 work with Microsoft Project 2019? With no apparent VSTO support directly for office 2019, I am hoping that my add-in will simply run just as it does for Microsoft Project 2013 and 2016.&nbsp;

<p>Okay, got the answer I was looking for. Ended out buying a license of Project 2019. My add-in works fine. Thought that would be the case since I had read that the version number of Project 2016 and Project 2019 were the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps anyone else that was looking for this answer!</p>

    <title>Embedded Excel sheets in Word lose formatting after editing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#40;tim b&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded Excel sheets in Word lose formatting after editing.</h2>
                    <p>We're using MS Word and Excel for Office 365 MSO (16.0.10827.20118) 32-bit.&nbsp; Windows 10 Pro 64</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've used inserted Excel sheet objects in Word documents for several years.&nbsp; The inserted Excel sheet object(s) has certain formatting such as black title bars, fonts, bold/italic, etc.&nbsp; Now, when you open a Word doc such as this the inserted Excel sheet
 object looks fine.&nbsp; All of the formatting is there.&nbsp; But when you double-click the Excel object and edit it's contents...when you click outside of the Excel object when finished editing all of the formatting goes away.&nbsp; It looks like plain text.&nbsp; However,
 when you double-click the Excel object again all of the formatting returns and it looks normal again.&nbsp; Click outside of the Excel object...formatting disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to mention that Windows updates were pushed earlier this week and shortly after this behavior was noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to be clear...before the Windows updates the Excel objects could be edited and saved and the formatting would remain.&nbsp; Now, if you open a file that hasn't been opened since before the updates all formatting is there.&nbsp; Double-click an Excel object...edit
 it...and click outside the formatting is gone.&nbsp; Double-click the object formatting returns...and so forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>We found that the Excel insert worksheet was from a very old Excel template.&nbsp; We found a workaround that fixes the issue permanently and this only affects two users.&nbsp; When a user comes across one of these Word docs with the Excel insert, they click in the
 upper left corner of the old current worksheet and Ctrl-C to "copy all".&nbsp; Then they insert a new updated Excel sheet into the Word doc and Ctrl-V to "paste".&nbsp; This keeps all of the formatting in place and they only have to adjust a couple of lines down and
 from the left to make it the same size as the old one.&nbsp; Very easy process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion, we seemed to be working with some very outdated material that eventually quit working because it was so old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all of your help,</p>

<p>I have similar issues with both my Surface Pro 3 and Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga. The update appears to start downloading and then forever stays at 0%. Ran the&nbsp;Windows 10 Update Troubleshooter, cleared the&nbsp;Windows\SoftwareDistribution folder, stopped and started
 the Windows Update&nbsp;service. Nothing seems to help.</p>

            <p>Same here on&nbsp;two devices, device 1 stays at&nbsp;Downloading 0%, while the other stays at 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device 1, shows &gt; 20% CPU consumption for the "Delivery Optimization" process, with some&nbsp;network receive activity (&lt;1Mb/sec.). Both process and network activity stops after 10-15 minutes while the download status remains at 0%</p>
<p>Device 2, shows &gt; 20% CPU and some limited network receive activity (&lt;1Mb/sec.), DL status is now at 100% for more than 2h.</p>
<p>This whole process restarts after system reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>
<p>Device 2 &nbsp;successfully updated (took 3h25' to finish)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device 1 is now at 100% download. "Delivery Optimization" process is still at &gt; 15%, memory consumption ~30MB &lt;-&gt; ~70MB, little or no network activity, very low disk activity.</p>
<p>Wonder what Delivery Optimization is actually doing.</p>
<p>

<p>After the gpupdate &amp; reboot, the whole process starts over&nbsp;again, so the download is back at&nbsp;0% with the Delivery Optimization process consuming &gt;15% of CPU without performing other activity&nbsp;(disk/network).</p>
<p>BTW. The gpupdate only restores <strong>changed </strong>GP settings, so this is only a
<em>solution &nbsp;</em>if you previously delayed updates through policy settings.</p>
<p>Looks like the Delivery Optimization process&nbsp;is the evil doer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Stupidly enough, I did both things at the same time. After restarting my computer, the Build 15007 downloaded in no time. Now I cannot tell which one helped. "gpupdate /force" trick or turning on "how updates will be delivered" setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;the download is in the first stage of installation. A couple of minutes later, it will ask me to restart.</p>
<p>

                    If the navigation pane is hidden by default (File, Options, Current Database, Navigation, Display Navigation Pane is selected) users can still access it by pressing the F11 key.<br />
What key will hide it again?<br />

            <blockquote>This still leaves a vertical bar with the words "Navigation Pane". Also &gt;&gt; appears at the top and by clicking this the full pane becomes visible.

Once opened, you can't rehide the Nav Pane, only minimize it.&nbsp;

<div>Why do you need to? You set it be hidden under Options. If you need to open it for development purposes, then do so. Close the database and it will open with it hidden.</div>

            <p>With the selection in Access options is one way to hide the navigatione pane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way is using VBA code;</p>
<p>Function HideNav()</p>
<p>DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdWindowHide </p>
<p>End Function</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then create an Macro called autoexec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this macro create an Action called RunCode</p>
<p>The value is the Function Name: HideNav()</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When restarting your database, your navigation pane is hidden.</p>

I have tried this many times. It usually locks up for hours and doesn't work. Nothing seems to work to make my Office 2013 Home and Student work. How about a refund and let's try again!!

<h3> lalalee---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are the N93 pictures so bad&#63;</h2>
                    I've been using the N93 for a week or so, and I can't seem to take any good pictures. The pictures come out very grainy. I end up deleting all of them. Has anyone out there found a way to take decent pictures?<br />
<br />
Also, I notice when taking pictures/video outside, I can't see the viewfinder because the light... is there a way to increase the backlight on the display?

            Pictures in low light conditions are grainy. Probably nothing that can be done about that, except going outside or turning on the more lights inside. In good lighting I get good pictures on my N93.<br />
<br />
For the other question: menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Display &gt; Light sensor &gt; turn to "Maximum".

            Ofcourse turning it to maximum shortens your battery life. Which is already short - though understandably - its a great phone but I wish the batteries in this world were better. If anyone knows what are the other gold contact points in the battery area?
 I mean other than the 3 power contacts underneath theres like 8 or so extra points... .

            No Petrib meant this setting - not found in the camera settings but under ...<br />
<br />
menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Display &gt; Light sensor &gt; turn to "Maximum". <br />
<br />
I have no idea if this affects the camera sensitivity and personally I doubt it for me all it does is increase the display and keyboard brightness - but I will research and return.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Feedback Hub enables you to share your input for&nbsp; Microsoft and the app isn't that great if it isn't working properly. There are ways to correct this issue, we suggest that you check these methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Reset the Windows Store Apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the Search Box, type in <strong>Apps and features</strong> and click it.</li><li>Locate Feedback Hub and select it.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced options</strong>, then click the <strong>Reset </strong>
button. Press <strong>Reset </strong>again on the window that pops up.</li><li>A check mark located beside the <strong>Reset </strong>button is an indication that the Feedback Hub has been reset.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Re-register the Feedback Hub app using Powershell.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the Search Box, type in Powershell, right click on it and select Run as administrator.</li><li>Type in <strong>Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}</strong> into Powershell and press Enter.</li><li>After the command is executed, restart your PC.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Reset the Windows Store Cache.</p>
<ul>

            The two batteries are different.<br />
<br />
The new sicocco battery has been documented at having a slightly better output, although two batteries are supplied as standard with both editions, and quoted talk time and standby time are at optimim conditions etc etc :)<br />
<br />
Its never wise to mix and match batteries or use third party ones as this would invalidate the limited 2 year warranty Nokia provide.<br />
<br />

    <title>insufficient info for hotmail account recovery FORM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ms_way  say:</h3>
<h2>            insufficient info for hotmail account recovery FORM</h2>
                    Hello: I have one about 15 years old hotmail account that got blocked by microsoft recently for suspicious access. hotmail login page ended up having me submitting a form with multiple questions regarding:<br />
-&nbsp; my account profile: But the problem is I don't even recall what I put in for those fields when i created the account years ago<br />
<br />
- the form also asked for recent subject lines for four sent emails. I got the exact subject lines from my friends and provided CORRECTLY<br />
<br />
then I got an automated reply with an issue number saying Microsoft reviewing it further. then they denied it and asked to resubmit the form. I tried it multiple times but unfortunately do not have any other "authentic" proof except sent email subjects which
 seems not enough for unblocking. <br />
<br />
I am totally at a loss here, I really need to regain back my access since that account has just too many important emails. Would be a life saver if I could touch base with someone in Microsoft office and prove I am the original user.<br />
<br />
Please help me. thanks very much - MS<br />
<br />

<p>Audio will not play automatically, the reader has to initiate it.&nbsp; Once the reader interacts with the Sway, autoplay pauses so as not to move the content they are interacting with away.&nbsp; After starting the audio, the reader will then need to click the play
 button in the lower right to restart autoplay.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only if the others have PowerPivot installed on their systems will they be able to interact with the Pivot table that you would have created using the PowerPivot i.e. apply filters/use slicers etc.&nbsp; The PowerPivot can only be installed on certain SKU's of
 MS Excel 2010 and higher versions.</p>

<h2>            Unable to print from Internet Explorer 11 &#38; Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>My printer is a Kodak ESP3250. It works fine. I have Windows 7 on an HP Pavilion. When I use IE11 I can not print a web page. In Live Mail I can not print an email.&nbsp;These used to work just fine. The failure mode is as follows:</p>
<p>1. The print command is given</p>
<p>2. The printer selections screen appears.</p>
<p>3. Selections are confirmed</p>
<p>4. Print is selected</p>
<p>5. Nothing happens and there is no error message or item in the printer queue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can print web pages just fine using Fire Fox or Chrome, but not Internet Explorer. If I want to print an email I copy it and paste it to any word processor and print it there, but not with Live Mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drivers are current, the print trouble shooters show printer is ready and willing, and I have tried several of the esoteric tricks&nbsp;I found online except the ones I am not technically astute enough to dare trying. Is there not a straight forward cause
 for these problems???&nbsp; My Google searches seem to show that these problems are common to many Windows users and are prevalent to the MS applications. Suggestions??????</p>

            <p><span>Hello Bill,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the issue description I understand that you are not able to print from Internet Explorer 11, though it shows print preview but nothing happens when command given to print.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is this issue specific to a particular webpage?</span></li><li><span>Have you tried printing the webpage running Internet Explorer 11 as administrator?</span></li><li><span>Were there any significant hardware or software changes made prior to this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>This issue may occur due to outdated or corrupted printer drivers, if you do not have printer permissions assigned, if Protected Mode is enabled for the Internet security zone of the web page or if there is an issue with temporary folders on your user
 account and the Low folder under the %TEMP% location has been deleted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s follow the methods below and check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for trying to help with my print issue. I tried each of your 5 steps. Web pages still do not print. I did find out where all my aborted print attempts went however when I looked in the Temp/Low folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything in common with Live Mail and IE11 regarding printing that might offer a clue. Jobs are not going from the Low folder to the printer queue but they do make it to print preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Could be a combination of factors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Lots of persons trying to update to it.</p>
<p>- Bandwidth</p>
<p>- The time it takes varies, can be from 45 mins to 2 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could cancel the update and wait until it is released to the Slow branch then download the .ISO file for build 10049 then do a build to build upgrade.</p>

            Just for feedback. I was able to download the new build and started the install. It took about 12 hours to get to 70% and then hung up. I reverted and to the 10041 build for the current time. I have another computer I am trying to do the install on and
 will let you know how that goes. Thanks

            <p>My upgrade too 10049 was slow to install as well taking about 30 minutes to complete. My advice would be to check for disk activity. Most PCs have an LED on the case that blinks while disk reads/writes are occurring. Be patient.</p>

            I am trying again for the 6th time. The update downloaded in about 20 minutes. As of this writing It started installing and hour and half ago. The circle is saying 23 percent and the setup is at 77 percent. Let's see if it installs properly. Hopefully
 the final build will install faster than this. &nbsp;My computer does have a red led activity light.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is kind of common for there to be a significant delay at 30%... then the progress jumps rapidly...</p>
<p>It is also possible the process has hung...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... the installation file you keep downloading is in C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download....</p>
<p>Before you click install, copy it to a backup somewhere... </p>
<p>it's file name is <strong>0f5f91def7110078b4c9c91d0e94ca76... </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The next install .. if necessary... just copy it back into the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download... Do this just before clicking on the Download button for the installation...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do hit the download button, the INSTALL will come up in a few seconds...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had much better luck with installations since I started letting the machine set for 5 minutes or so before clicking the&nbsp;Restart NOW button... In fact, I've started selecting restart in 1 hour, then in 5 minutes or so, restart manually... No more hangs...</p>

            OK things are looking up for me on the 2 computers I did the new build on. The first machine worked after the second time I did the install and took about 8 hours. The second machine went slower but installed the first time around after about 13 hours.
 Yes it could have been bandwidth or something else but both are up and running 100%. Thanks

<p>hi klmorgan,</p>
<p>it seems the issue is caused by credential (password changed), so please try the following steps and let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>1. right click onedrive icon in taskbar and stop syncing all the libraries, <strong>
exit</strong> onedrive for business sync client. (you will need to sync from the scratch then)</p>
<p>2. delete the previous credentials via control panel &gt; credential manager &gt; windows credentials and remove all office related credentials one by one.<br />

<p>3. restart your computer.</p>

    <title>How do I remove a field code&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I remove a field code&#63;</h2>
                    While editing documents I typically use my shortcut keys. first the ctrl A to select all and then F9 to update all the table of contents and captions. Well this time I did a ctrl A to select all but then for some reason I did a Ctrl F9. Apparently this
 inserted the entire content of my very large document inside a field. There is a curly brace { at the beginning and end of my document. I never noticed and saved and when I open the document the field is turned off so there is no content to view, it's hidden.
 After a lot of panic and trouble shooting I finally figured out that I can toggle the field code and my content returns, but now how the heck do I remove the unwanted field and keep the content? I can't delete the braces or the text is removed. The document
 is 150 pages so a copy paste inside the braces is just not working out, at least not so far. This has got to have happened to someone else in the past, it seems crazy I can't just delete the brace or right click and select that I

            <p>No, you can't delete the braces (they aren't really characters in the internal representation of the file; they're just for display).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can do is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the field code. Turn on nonprinting characters (click the ¶ button on the Home tab).</li><li>Click to the left of the first real character inside the field code.</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/172135ba-4c93-42e4-9cad-cf3dc1f0df3b" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the vertical scroll bar and/or the scroll wheel (if your mouse has one) to bring the end of the document into view -- DO NOT use the arrow keys or the Page Up/Down keys, which move the cursor.</li><li>Hold the Shift key while you click to the right of the last real character in the field code. That selects all of the code but not the braces.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Cut the selected text to the clipboard.</li><li>Delete the field (which is now just two braces with a couple of spaces inside them).</li><li>Paste from the clipboard.</li></ul>
