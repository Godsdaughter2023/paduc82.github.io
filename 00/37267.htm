            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that PC says that no connections are available and I appreciate the effort made towards the fixes you have already tried. I will be happy to answer your query, however, let me ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>When was the last time it worked without any error?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li></ul>
<p>There could be several reasons for this cause including incorrect network adapter settings, network adapter missing/corrupted/outdated etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>There may be a tiny switch on the side of the laptop (on in the front) that turns the wireless ON/OFF. Make sure you’ve switched it on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You may also need to toggle the laptop WiFi by pressing and holding the Function key and pressing F2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let's run the network troubleshooter and see if it can detect and fix the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open the Network troubleshooter by right-clicking the network icon in the notification area, and then clicking
<strong>Troubleshoot problems</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the 'Microsoft Help' and 'How-to article' for more information: </span>
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7</a></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>Change adapter settings</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>network and sharing center
</strong>in the Start search box and hit Enter. </span></p>
<p><span>2. Click <strong>Change adapter settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right-click the connection and select <strong>Enable.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The majority of connection problems within Windows 7 have been solved by installing the latest driver for the wireless network adapter obtained from the manufacturer. Download and install the Windows 7 compatible
 drivers and check if the issue gets fixed. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information on updating drivers:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Audigy 2 ZS standard drivers work only in stereo mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sailormax2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audigy 2 ZS standard drivers work only in stereo mode</h2>
                    <p>I can't use "Quadraphonic" or "5.1 Surround" mode with my Creative Audigy 2 ZS sound card and standard drivers of Windows 8. (There is no other drivers for Windows 8)
</p>
<p>I can choose any mode, but after first use, including "Test" button, "Audio channels" setting reset to default value ("Stereo").</p>
<p>If click on "center" or "rear" speakers in test mode, sound output: even click - correct speaker, not even click - one of front speaker (wrong).</p>
<p>Windows 7/Vista work with this sound card without any problems.</p>
<p>Is it possible to fix this problem?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for asking this query in Microsoft Community and we are glad to know that you have chosen Microsoft Windows 8 for your PC!!!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your issue description, it seems that the problem is with the incompatibility of the device drivers with Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you getting any error message when you use the device in other modes other than the stereo mode?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the following steps and let’s know the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run Hardware Troubleshooter</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try running the hardware troubleshooter and check if that helps. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the ‘Windows + C’ to activate the charms menu or move the mouse pointer to bottom right corner of the screen and you will get the charms menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on ‘Search’ and select ‘Settings’ and type ‘Troubleshooting’ and select ‘troubleshooting’.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on ‘Hardware and Sound’ and select ‘Hardware and Devices’ and click on next to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Update the Drivers.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if the above step does not work, Let’s try updating the drivers for the Sound Card. Follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press “Windows key + X”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “Device Manager” and right click on the device and select “Update Driver Software”.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the installation of the latest driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Install drivers in Compatibility Mode.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Visit the manufacturer’s website &amp; download the Windows 7 sound card drivers for the device and we can try installing the drivers in compatibility
 mode to check if that works. Follow the instructions given below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the setup file, scroll down to Properties and click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the window that pops up, click Compatibility tab.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under Compatibility mode, check the box “Run this program in compatibility mode for”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the scroll down select “Windows 7”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under Privilege Level, check the box “Run this program as an administrator”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Apply and Ok.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I don't have any error messages when you use the device in other modes other than the stereo mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooter don't see any problems with my sound card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no any update for drivers, because there is no official drivers for Audigy 2 ZS from Creative Labs for Windows 8 and "No development plan" &nbsp;(&nbsp;<a href="http://support.creative.com/kb/showarticle.aspx?sid=61105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.creative.com/kb/showarticle.aspx?sid=61105</a>
 )</p>
<p>In result I&nbsp;use Microsoft's&nbsp;drivers of Windows 8 and you are my only hope to fix this problem :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If install latest drivers from Creative Labs&nbsp;(&nbsp;v2_18_0017 )&nbsp;for Windows 7 in Compatibility mode, in result I have same problem, but in this case sound test of not stereo modes&nbsp;<strong>always</strong> all sounds output in front speakers (with standard drivers
<strong>even</strong> click on rear/center speakers&nbsp;- play correct speaker, <strong>
not even</strong> click on rear/center speakers&nbsp;- play one of front speaker (wrong)). And with this drivers Windows do not reset speaker mode to stereo, but do not use center/rear speakers also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi , I have the same problem the sound only came out of FRONT SPEAKER even when I click to test the subwoofer still sounds come from the front speaker even rear test or center all come from only the front speakers !!! and I find out some fixes but not all
 times works I don't know why ok let me tell u how to do that !!!</p>
<p>at the first change your computer date time to 2013</p>
<p>and disable the sound card from the device manager and re enable it again</p>
<p>and check again its works or not if its not working disable sound card from device manager</p>
<p>and restart the pc and change time again to 2013 and restart and re enable the sound card from</p>
<p>device manager again and check again I use this to fix my sound card and that's works some times.</p>
<p>I hope creative or even Microsoft make some fix for it its really&nbsp;painful !</p>

            I've had this issue with Windows 7 back in 2010 and it drove me nuts until I realized the Windows driver was the problem. You have to disable the auto install feature in Windows and then load creative's drivers. This will fix the issue. The audigy card
 will not be fully functional with Microsoft's version of the driver so you have to stop the auto installs otherwise it will never work properly.&nbsp;

            <p>After 6 hours of phone calls the options are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) go back to windows 8 (your information was not updated nor deleted - it is a different app - your info should still be in the old OS - a concept beyond my comprehension) ie. Uninstall windows 10</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;log into your MS LIVE account, assuming you had synced the previous calendar. Then sync your live account to the calender app</p>
<p>3) go back to Windows 8, then sync your live account then reinstall windows 10. Worse, you can screen capture and manually enter into windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's dumb and inconvenient. Those are the only options that the Microsoft offered me.</p>

<h2>            Feature Suggestion&#58; Wave to sign-in</h2>
                    
<p>I'd like to see an option that requires users to wave for Kinect to sign them in. &nbsp;I'm tired of my whole family getting signed in as they walk through the living room. This would also alleviate the problems with false sign-ins where inanimate objects and
 pets are being detected as children (unless you've taught your dog how to wave, of course).</p>

<p>I am not convinced there is even facial recognition anymore on K2. It signed me in when my behind was facing the camera the other day. I really don't think it can tell one person from another very well. It has also tried to detect me as the guest after it
 had already signed me in. This device is really best used in a one person household in my opinion. It needs some tuning.</p>

<p>They said it doesn't just look at face, but also the person's body structure. For example showing a photo of yourself to the camera according to Microsoft wouldn't work, as it expects to see certain skeletal features that it uses to recognize the user as
 well.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I don't know if that's any justification to signing you in with your back facing the camera, but still :P</p>

<p>Mine works fine. Signs me in right when it sees me, even if I'm just walking by and not exactly pointing my face towards it. If you are in front of it and it still cannot see you, just hold your hand out above your head and it should recognize you. If that
 won't work, go to sign in and then to "Wasnt recognized" and it will help. </p>

<p>Yeah, I have a four person household, and it works fine. &nbsp;I've tried signing out, then turning around, but it won't Kinect me in unless I leave out of sight of the Kinect, then come back in. &nbsp;In the beginning it had a hard time recognizing me, and I had
 to do the "Kinect Didn't Recognize Me" option. &nbsp;I imagine this is building a library of images to better recognize you at. &nbsp;Now, it recognizes me every time.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The problem with adding more gestures and voice commands, is the amount of variables that could cue the wrong command. &nbsp;Say they add the whistle feature, then the kids let loose those high pitch squeals they do when they are playing. &nbsp;Or even now, where
 the Xbox voice prompt will come up when you say something remotely sounding like Xbox. &nbsp;The more options, the more frustration that would come.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>However, just because it works for me, doesn't me it will or does for everyone else. &nbsp;Try using the "Kinect didn't recognize me" option multiple times, when Kinect detects the wrong person; that should alleviate some of the misrecognition issues.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Version&#47;Build Info</h2>
                    <p>I am not a Windows user, usually: about three times a year I boot into Windows and the first thing I&nbsp;<em>try</em>&nbsp;to do is run the update assistant. My last session was in August 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I logged in and tried to run the update assistant and was thanked for updating Windows 10. To be clear: I am running Windows 10 Pro and the last time I updated it was last August. I've run into issues with the update assistant in Win 7 so I decided
 to manually check the version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The info at the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4043454/windows-10-windows-server-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Update History</a>&nbsp;webpage shows only Windows 10; not Pro. Are they the same OS build
 and only added feature&nbsp;sets are enabled? If so, why won't my system update to the current "version 1903?" If not, where can I find the version info for Windows 10 Pro?</p>
<p>

            Hi sandifop 
<br />
<br />Click the link below, then click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1903 and bring your PC right up to date
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty with the above method, with these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Sonic 3 &#43; Sonic&#38;amp&#59;Knuckles</h2>
                    
<p>I was reviewing these 2 games and thought about downloading them. If you're familar with these 2, you can play them both where you start with Sonic 3 and play all the way to the end of Sonic &amp; Knuckles. You could also connect Sonic 2 and Sonic&amp;Knuckles and
 play it as Knuckles. My question is, if I download both of them, is there a way to connect as one, or would it have to be 1 game download called something in the area of "Sonic 3 Plus Sonic &amp; Knuckle?"</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Not at all. When you download Sonic And Knuckles there's a area that says "Extras" Under extras you see "Sonic 3" And if you have sonic 3 or Sonic 2 downloaded it lets you connect sonic and knuckles to one of those games. HOpe it helped.</p>

<h2>            Redeeming X Box live membership for childs account</h2>
                    
<p>Help</p>
<p>I have bought my 10 year old daughter&nbsp; a 12 month subscription to Xbox live Gold and I am finding it impossible to redeem it to her account. My wife and I have spend over two hours today on the helpline but still with&nbsp; no success.</p>
<p>I understand a childs account must be linked to an adult account so I have set up a parental account as well as my daughters account. The Xbox will not accept the linked account and I also have tried this on my laptop and the codes can not be redeemed on
 my daughters account (I get one of those "oops something has gone wrong" messages. The link to redeeming the voucher works on my account but not my daughters.</p>
<p>Any help or advice gladly received before I do battle with the support service again!</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same issue. This is absolutely the most frustrating experience I've had online EVER! How is it possible that the "get help here" link on the XBOX parent login page doesn't work? Or that a parent cannot log into their own account to finish
 the redemption process? Lastly, how can Microsoft not address this issue that SURELY has happened repeatedly to millions of parents. Ridiculous.</p>

 but ubuntu was still there. However, it would freeze when I tried to run it. Then I tried REINSTALLING ubuntu, now I have about 12 boot options, vista works fine but ubuntu is running terrible, none of the applications and download stuff is working, errors
 left and right...<br />

            Hello audiologic09 :) Thanks to use this forum :) OK, let's go to unistalling ubuntu :)
<br />
To unistalling ubuntu you have to reinstall Windows Vista. During the installation of windows vista you can partition your hard disk. Let's go:<br />
1) start pc and put in Windows Vista DVD and press Canc on the keyboard to enter in the bios. See manual of your motherboard where you can set the CD/DVD drive as the first boot.<br />
2) Save the changment of the bios and exit. It will restart pc. <br />
3) After restart, it will run the Windows Vista dvd and see this help for the installation<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/e77344fa-e978-464c-953e-eba44f0522671033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<strong>Upgrade</strong> to begin the upgrade. You might see a compatibility report." you must choice<strong> Custom(Advanced)</strong> and now you can&nbsp; repartition your hard disk to install only Windows Vista :) Delete all partitions to create the free space
 and with the free space you can create one partition where you will install Windows Vista. Then, after this point, there is the installation of the system.<br />
<br />
Thant is what you have to do :) <br />
<div>I hope to be of state aid:) <br />

<h2>            Xbox wont play new &#38;&#35;39&#59;xgd3&#38;&#35;39&#59; format game discs</h2>
                    problem: with the latest firmware update, my xbox slim will give me an unrecognized disc error for xgd3 format discs, which are the new format Microspft made to increase the capacity of the disc and to combat piracy. It should be noted that my xbox has
 been in no way, shape, or form been modified except for a replacement laser that a repair shop put in thinking it would fix the problem i have but it didnt. Here's the catch, all the games I said didnt work that are on the 'xgd3' format work perfectly on other
 consoles, and also (most importantly) work on my console AFTER i delete the system update with x lb rb x lb rb x or whatever it is to remove updates from the xbox. When i play my game after that, i decline the xbl update, and i have absolutely no problem playing
 any discs. It should also be noted i was part of the xbox research group that tested the new disc format when they sent out revised copies of halo reach on that format and my xbox played it perfectly then. All of thus sums u

It should also be noted that you've snookered yourself by doing that. In short you've invalidated your warranty and now MS won't go near the console. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I can tell by your other posts that you add nothing to discussions except your own opinions when a problem calls for facts. If you read my question you would see I'm not asking Microsoft to touch my console at all, I would've paid the $99 if I wanted them
 to handle it. The problem is with their system update on nothing on my end, which is why I won't give them more money to fix a problem they caused.

<p>Please refrain from posting further in my thread, you have nothing tangible to add.</p>

<p>There was a small section of consoles that had problems with the new disc format and you were advised to send your console in for repair (free if I remember correctly) and you got sorted inside of a week. However that option is now closed off to you because
 you've invalidated your warranty.<br />
<br />
Clearly that's not what you want to hear but unfortunately for you it's the truth. If you just wanted to find people who agree with you then I'd advise opening an account with Facebook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm aware of that program they ran, which was for older console models, an microsofts official stance on that was:
</p>
“Following a recent update to our system software, we have become aware of an issue that is preventing a very small number of Xbox 360 owners from playing retail game discs,” Microsoft stated. They also elaborated on the problem caused by the update: “This
 issue manifests itself a as a unique ‘disc unreadable’ or ‘disc unsupported’ error on the screen. We are also able to detect this issue over Xbox Live and are proactively reaching out to customers that may be impacted to replace their console." Source: http://greatgamingcrusade.com/2011/05/18/xbox-360-update-may-cause-problems-to-older-systems/
 From that source, you may also read that Microsoft can detect that issue over box live and had been reaching out through emails, I did not recieve an email for that program and this was not eligible, so me having my laser replaced has nothing to do with it.
 Again, I've done my homework and again, you've done nothing to add to the answer except add poor humor. Stop posting on this thread.

<p>Hey man I am having the same problem right now. &nbsp;Some of the games wont work but after opening and closing they are fine. &nbsp;I got Prototype 2 yesterday and it wont play at all. &nbsp;Xbox told me it was my console and I just cleared my warranty by a few months.
 &nbsp;Now I have to pay them to fix an issue that isnt my fault or the games. &nbsp;I hardly play online and I hack everything in my life but games. I had my xbox a lil over a year and got a 41000 gamer score. I buy all the new games and even download a lot of stuff
 of their network. &nbsp;You would think they would man up and fix the issue they cause. &nbsp;I am having a real hard time figuring out y the *** shouldnt I mod my ***?? &nbsp; I can play every game for free and at the worse case scenario I cant play online. &nbsp;I dont do that
 much anyway. &nbsp;I have never seen a company *** in their own bed so much and never claim it. &nbsp;</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
a. Have you tried installing the game in Windows XP SP2 compatibility mode?</div>
<div><br />
Since these games are too old to work on Windows 7, I would try installing them in Windows XP mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
If the game is designed for Kernel mode Operating System it may work. Let us give a try installing it in Windows XP SP2 compatibility mode and check.<br />
You can find more information about compatibility modes in the articles below:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-program-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-program-compatibility</a><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
Also you may alter the hardware acceleration and check for dungeon keeper 2.</div>
<div>You can also try changing the hardware acceleration to medium and verify.<br />
1. Right click on empty space on desktop.<br />
2. Go to Screen Resolution.<br />
3. Then click on Advanced settings and click on the tab "Troubleshoot".<br />
4. Set the hardware acceleration to medium. (here you will get the option only if your Video card support hardware acceleration).</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Also, if&nbsp; the above steps does not work install Windows XP mode on Windows 7 and&nbsp; then try installing&nbsp; these games and check.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Here are some links which explains about Windows XP mode in Windows 7. You are advised to download and install the Windows XP mode on Windows 7 machine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Windows Virtual PC</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Install and use Windows XP Mode in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Using Windows XP Mode</strong><br />

    <title>Ultra Heavy Battery Drain in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supreethkumar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ultra Heavy Battery Drain in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am using Lenovo Ideapad S-510P. I used to get 6 hours of battery backup when I was using windows 8.1. But after upgrading it to win 10, my battery backup is 1hr 12min at 100%. Laptop is heating even when it is idle and not running any applications. I have
 generated energy report. And noticed that processor utilization is&nbsp;very high. Since I cant upload *.htm, I will be attaching images</p>

            <p>Hi Supreeth, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that&nbsp;Windows 10 consumes more power as there are more services running In background.&nbsp;the issue is faced by many users of Windows 10. so, suggest you to create a power plan according to your requirements in order to consume less power
 and increase the backup time for battery. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;there is an option <strong>Battery saver</strong> in Power and sleep setting which will have a control over the background services when enabled and consume less power. But when enabled&nbsp;it will stop the Windows Update from downloading updates and should
 be disabled for Windows Update to download and install the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to write to us <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
for any other assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Check Out the wear level. I downgraded to windows 8.1 but surprisingly battery lasts only 1 hrs 16 min. Downgrading was supposed to fix it and give backup 6 hrs but it didn't. I tried startup booting in Linux. Still it showed me 1 hr. I performed a factory
 reset and updating drivers. Still the problem persists.</p>
<p>So this is my analysis,&nbsp;<strong>Upgrade to Win 10 has dealt permanent damage to my battery.</strong> Because It should have shown 6 hrs in linux.</p>
<p>If MS doesn't fix this ASAP, I will sue it for damaging my property.</p>

            <p>Exactly the same as me! 6+ hrs on Win 8.1 and now barely 2 hrs on Win 10. </p>
<p>And this so called Battery Saver gives barely 15-20 minutes more. It's ridiculous.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These replies by microsoft support engineers are an insult. Instead of saying that they're working on fixing this issue asap (and it's a maaaaaajor issue btw), they're suggesting some bs solutions with battery plans and savers. I mean really...</p>

                    Attempting to install an app in the Windows 10 Store and it won't work. Installs very small amount at a time, then freezes, download bar is grey and it won't continue download. Cannot find a solution and not sure why downloads won't work. Before attempting,
 I kept getting an error saying "Couldn't install, we'll try again shortly". Tried some solutions to fixing the Store but it continues to not download the app. Nothing I've tried works and I can't find a way to fix this.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            I suggest you see if this happens for all user accounts (create an extra if necessary to test).<br />
If it works in a different profile see <br />

    <title>Download games on Hard Drive instead of SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe12345671  say:</h3>
<h2>            Download games on Hard Drive instead of SSD</h2>
                    Hello, i currently got a new gaming PC and it came with a 256 GB SSD along with a hard drive. However, i have already used all the available space on the SSD, and would now like to download games and store it in the Hard Drive. I have already went to the
 settings and put "download new content on HDD" or something along those lines. However, i am attempting to resume the download of a certain game, but the download is already stored in the SSD, and cannot resume due to lack of space. I would like to transfer
 this game/download to the hard drive rather than the SSD but do not know how. Please help. Thank you.

            Hi Joe, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />You've performed the correct steps to change the location of your Microsoft Store downloads, but since that download has already started on your SSD you'll need to cancel the download, delete the files, then start the download again after rebooting your PC.
<br />
<br />This should make the Microsoft Store download the app onto your HDD instead of SSD.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!       
        </p>

            Hey Graeme! I had originally done this with League of Legends. I was unable to patch the client due to lack of space on the SSD. However, I uninstalled it, and re-installed it on my HDD instead, and was able to patch and play again. I tried doing this
 with fortnite (which was the game i was having trouble downloading), but it wasn't working. However, thanks to your reply, i realized i had done this earlier with league, so it must work somehow! I then realized i wasnt properly uninstalling fortnite and deleting
 all the files in the SSD. I then redownloaded fortnite, and was given the option of installing it in a certain location. I installed it on the HDD obviously :D. Thanks for this post, it made me realize that it would work one way or another! Thanks again!
