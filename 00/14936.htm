<h2>            How to stop Office 365 from saving anything to the document server</h2>
                    <p>I'm at my wit's end.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I stop Office 365 using my OneDrive server?</strong> I want to ALWAYS save/load files from my local PC. I store all my documents in my local PC OneDrive folder and allow the OneDrive app to synchronize them with my other PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've removed the OneDrive - Personal service from my Office 365 but files still get saved to the document server
<strong>on a seemingly random basis.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do Ctrl-S to save a new file, the standard Windows dialog pops up and I save the file locally. Next time I hit Ctrl-S it tries to save to the server - even though OneDrive - Personal isn't integrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have lost hours of work because of a synchronization error that would not have occurred if Office 365 did what I told it to</strong> and not what Microsoft thinks it should. I had no chance to intervene as I watched the OneDrive app point out the
 error and automatically delete my local files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rely on using OneDrive for a form of backup/sharing across devices. Not knowing where a file will be/has been saved is frustrating and I am
<strong>losing trust </strong>in the file management of Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Tell me how to turn off any integration with the server</strong>. <strong>
Don't tell me to save my files to a different location on my PC.</strong> OneDrive folder is where they need to go. This kind of integration didn't exist in Office 2013 etc and neither did these kinds of problems.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you opt to have your files saved or stored on your local PC instead of having it stored on OneDrive cloud storage, then you can just simply
<strong>unlink</strong> OneDrive. By doing so, all of your files will be saved to your PC. So, for you to do that, please refer to this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-off-or-uninstall-onedrive-f32a17ce-3336-40fe-9c38-6efb09f944b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Turn off or uninstall OneDrive</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, for you to access the files that has been stored on your OneDrive cloud storage, just sign in to
<a href="http://www.onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive.live.com</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance regarding this concern, just send us a reply.</p>

<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlinking OneDrive does not work. Even logging out of Office 365 doesn't prevent files from being saved remotely instead of where I request them to be. Here are steps to recreate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Log out of Office 365 so that 'Sign In' shows at the right of the menu bar instead of my name and make sure OneDrive - Personal is not in the list of services.</p>
<p>2. Create a new Word document.</p>
<p>3. Choose File\Save As...</p>
<p>4. Select a location in my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">local </span>
OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>5. Click okay.</p>
<p>6. A dialog box pops up asking me to log in. I close the box.</p>
<p>7. The dialog box pops up again. I close the box.</p>
<p>8. The document gets saved to my OneDrive server - BUT I'M NOT EVEN LOGGED IN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want Office 365 to do nothing EVER with my files except save them to where I tell it. I want the OneDrive background service to manage my OneDrive. Why on earth do files still go to the server when I am not even logged in and I dismiss the request to log
 in each time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just wrong and not at all secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT - the pop-up login dialog only seems to happen with Word (as far as I can tell.) However, all Office apps insist on saving remotely even when I request otherwise.</p>

<p>What you're referring to is the built in OneDrive app on Windows 10. Please refer to the image below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e77b1fd-8451-4c53-a202-ba5c7a61623b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e77b1fd-8451-4c53-a202-ba5c7a61623b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If you're saving files in OneDrive, then it will be saved on your PC, not on OneDrive online. Note that you need to sign your Microsoft account on the OneDrive app in order to sync your files to the online cloud storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference, please refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/onedrive-desktop-app-for-windows-850703dd-ea56-4c7a-bff5-6c2e4da227cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I understand what OneDrive is - I've used it for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm talking about Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am logged out of Office 365 and try to save a new office document to my local OneDrive folder, I am asked twice to enter my Microsoft credentials - that makes no sense at all since I want to save locally. After declining each request, I see the status
 bar very, very clearly show that it is trying to save the document to http://d.docs.live.net and, after that, the autosave switch in the menu bar for the office app appears. And the title doesn't save "Saved To PC", it says "Saved To OneDrive" - i.e., the
 remote server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This simply is not correct behavior (surely?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never happened with older Office versions. Saving to OneDrive locally didn't create any issues and I could get the files sync'd easily with my other devices using the OneDrive background service.</p>

<p>With that being said, if you didn't set the file to be saved to that particular location, then try changing the path file location of the files you want to save. If you're saving a Word document, click
<strong>File</strong> on the upper-left corner, select <strong>Save As</strong>, then click

            I am having the&nbsp;<strong>EXACT </strong>same problem for the past month. Absolutely infuriating watching Word, Excel, etc tell me it is connecting to d.docs.live.net everytime I try to save a file to my LOCAL onedrive folder. The delays and sync errors
 this has caused have led me to investigate using dropbox until this gets worked out.

<p>I have the&nbsp;<strong>exact</strong> same issue. One work around I've found is to close the onedrive program - it stops trying to save to d.docs. But I have to then remember to re-enable onedrive at the end of the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forced saving to d.docs is <strong>absolutely infuriating</strong></p>

<p>The problem with Microsoft Office 365 is that it is trying to be like android and live save everything to onedrive, not using the simple onedrive folder on your pc.&nbsp; I f-ING hate this stupid BS.. so what you want to do is go to File / Account and then SIGN
 OUT.. you dont want Onedrive to show as a connected service.&nbsp; That will stop Office 365 apps from using the document server and make duplicate files when you think you are working off the one in your onedrive folder when it actually created another one.&nbsp; It's
 the most stupid thing Microsoft does, but there it is.. sign out and it will work like you expect it to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The purpose of this is so multiple people can work on the same file at once -&nbsp; A great idea- but regular people with there own single account have ZERO use for this and Microsoft screws up their data and turns it on anyway...</p>

    <title>Nokia Maps, Nokia Map Loader and the Philippines&#39; Map - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia Maps, Nokia Map Loader and the Philippines&#39; Map</h2>
                    I just bought the N95 8Gb last week and was happy with my new phone until I was trying the Maps application, I found out there was no pre-installed Phillipine<br />
Map, so I went and downloaded the Nokia Map Loader hoping the the map would be there so I can update my phone, sadly no Philippine map to upload to my device. Sigh.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know when Nokia's going to come out with the Philippines Map for the Nokia N95 8gb? (Or any other phone model that needs it)<br />
<br />
It would be great if Nokia can give out hyperlinks for individual country/city map downloads on the

            It really annoyed me to see Nokia advertising phones in the Philippines with the new map feature, implying that it could be used in the Philippines, as purchased. In fact, the Philippines map is listed as available on one the Nokia web pages but, you can't
 find it when you go to download it. I think that borders on false advertising.<br />
<br />
It sure would be nice if Nokia would give us a clue as to when the Philippine map will be available.<br />
<br />
I have an Nokia E65 and use a HOLUX GPSlim 240 Bluetooth receiver and have used it successfully with the Navigator and Sports Tracker programs around the Philippines. With the Sports Tracker, you can export your travel route (after the trip) to Google Earth
 and see exactly where you went. However, this isn't much help for navigating and I sure could use it in downtown Manila.

            Thanks for the replies guys. I believe something must be done with regards to this issue. The Philippines has long been Nokia's guinea pig in terms of R&amp;D and marketing and to be left out of the new tech stuff really blows... Everyone deserves value for
 money, consistent customer service and truthful advertising. EVERYONE.

            i also use a nokia N95 classic and its quite disappointing that nokia has not even distributed a map for the Philippines which is available for download. even the nokia.ph site has no Philippines map available. hopefully, nokia will do something about
 this or they better not advertise more of their gps technology here in the Philippines because Filipinos get nothing from it.

            same problem here. im usinf the n82 and found no map at all. i also downloaded the current map loader from the nokia site and chose the asian region in the application, and there is no "philippines" in the list. i don't know whats wrong because in the
 country list where maps are available for download in one of the nokia websites philippines is included there.

            ahh just was i was looking for. i have an n82 and was astonished about it's features especially the gps and just like everyone else downloaded everything to have my maps updated but unfortunately there's no philippine map available. what the... this is
 indeed false advertising where you see in that commercial everything was checked thru a map and yet it is not applicable in your home country and mind you they sell this model here. and it's already 2008 and no map available yet?<br />
<br />
though when i used navfone as one of the applications in this unit it is fully functional with complete maps of manila, boracay, cebu and davao and voice guides. however this was installed as a trial only version and you may use it 7 days after gps activation.
 which is then why i reverted to maps. but why is there no preloaded maps like that one on navfone? is there a way for maps application to use the maps pre-loaded via navfone? how will we able to do it?

            i don't know madmicmar, but i think for you to be able to fully use the navfone, you should purchase the full-product. Anyway, i already emailed nokia regarding the problem and all they said that they don't have any idea when the philippine map will be
 released since it is not their company who is responsible for the development and production of these maps.<br />

Anyway, i tried downloadin the whole asian maps (using the nokia map loader), it was about 350-400MB and it includes the philippines. But it does not show the philippines as a stand alone download unlike the other countries such as singapore etc... I think
 this was because the philippine map was not as detalied as singapore's map. Only major roads (mostly in the NCR region only) and airports are included in the maps. Buildings are labeled very minimally. And after using it for sometime, i'm gonna erase it from
 my memory card since it doesn't have a use and it is only taking up space on my memory card.<br />
<br />
Hopefully nokia will have a follow-up on my email since there are a lot of people right now who has nseries maps capable devices and the map will really come in handy...<br />
<br />
...Bugging the nokia customer service with email complaints about the maps may urge nokia to force their map maker companies to make maps for the philippines. hehehe... :)

            i have the n82 black edition which have the Philippine map installed already! unfortunately the map is too inaccurate to be useful, for one i discovered that subic is in the wrong place (located on the southern part of pampanga based on the map). 2nd the
 actual gps location is off by almost 2km at least based on your location from the map. i don't know if this is because of poor gps signal or the maps are not accurate enough.

I highly agree! they are no way to be accurate and they are not as detailed, as singapore's. Or any other country out there. The maps that they have so far, is useless.

So I helped Nokia a bit by making a page with download links: <a href="http://nokiamaps.moo.no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Microsoft Band replacement and refund - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keith outlook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Band replacement and refund</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Microsoft Band on February 9, 2016. Shortly after that, I had to return it to the warranty replacement department. After this, I started to investigate online and found that this was a common and known problem for the Microsoft Band 2. This
 did not concern me because I do not work with it, and therefore this was an isolated instance, or so I thought. This band was important to me, and for I am a 100% disabled Veteran, and used it to track medication times, and doctor appointment reminders. And
 because of this needed the band to help me remember medication times, and to track my appointments, as well as appointment reminders. I received a new Microsoft Band 2 in the mail after the return and thought that was the end of it. Not long after that, the
 Band started to come apart again, and this time the battery would not hold a charge. I was pretty upset and requested a refund from Microsoft. The Microsoft agent on the phone stated that I must start a return process, for a refund. I was assured that I would
 receive a refund check, as they have no more replacement bands in inventory. And so once again I had to return my Microsoft Band 2 for the second time. I had bought this band to help me with appointments and medication times, but instead of helping me, it
 only caused me to have stress, anxiety, and problems. About a month after sending my Microsoft Band 2 off, I received a replacement. I called the Microsoft Band support team, and they pretty much told me “oh well,” you have a new Band. This was very disappointing,
 as I was promised a refund from the Microsoft Band 2. I was told that instead of a refund they “found” a new one in inventory, and to “deal with it.” So, I had no other choice, but to “deal with it.” I have been using my “new” band, and the band part of the
 watch is already starting to separate again. I have contacted customer service and still receive the same runaround. I am finished with this Microsoft Band 2 and feel taken advantage of, because of my disabilities. I have already had a panic attack today,
 after being on the phone for over an hour, trying to get someone to provide something equal to customer support. The entire process has started over again, and I feel trapped, and do believe this is a fraud from Microsoft. This is the same part breaking for
 the third time, and it is a known problem. I would like to have a full refund, and that is all I want. Microsoft Band team refuses to provide me with a refund. I was told over the phone today, that “if I were smart, I would process a replacement before the
 warranty period runs out, in two weeks.” So now I am forced to receive a replacement Band, that will break again, this time out of the warranty period, and I will be stuck with it. I am on a fixed income, from being 100% disabled, from serving my country.
 This is a lot of money for me to just throw away, on something that was supposed to make my life easier. Instead, I have had panic attacks, and stress since buying this Microsoft Band 2. Microsoft is not below stealing from disabled veterans, and this behavior
 is despicable. I am posting this on every social media website, as well.</p>

<h2>            Using Office 365, Windows 10&#59; How to use &#39;Open With&#39; to open .dbf files with Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Two issues:</p>
<p>1. I am trying to open .dbf files with Excel. But when I use 'open with', Excel does not come up as an option. So, I&nbsp; click 'more apps' (no joy), then I "look for another app on this computer". But where in Program Files (or Program Files (x86)) do I find
 Excel?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Why do my .dbf files tell me that they are Adobe Acrobat Documents (with the .pdf symbol), when the extension is .dbf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!,&nbsp;</p>

<p>That goes to any export operation &nbsp;(option available only to OneNote 2016 users)</p>

<h2>            OneNote want to edit attachments &#40;pdf annotation&#41; but they are read-only</h2>
                    <p>I really want to love this thing. - I do. But it's immensely frustrating, that upon fresh install (newly bought SP4 w. Win10), that I cannot annotate pdf's attached to a note and in the same workflow save it back to OneNote. The files seem to be read-only.
 In Drawboard I get "Access denied" and it Foxit Mobile I get "Save failed!". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I applies both to Office OneNote (desktop) and the Windows Store app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do? </p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I attached a pdf to a OneNote note (not printout or link). I then double-click which opens it in FoxitMobile or Drawboard (whichever default, saving in both fails).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I do my annotations (highlight etc.) and subsequently want to save it back to the note, but this operation fails (the file is read-only) and I'm forced to either save the changes elsewhere (that is decoupled from the note) or abort them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it. Also, I've tried OneNote 2016 from the Office trial. Neither works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I've tried editing the same note on a different machine (Win7). Here I can save the file back to the note as expected.</p>

    <title>Open SMS suddenly slow on 6700 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sorenwerk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open SMS suddenly slow on 6700</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a Nokia 6700 Classic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a few days it suddenly took 25 seconds to <u><em>open an SMS for viewing</em></u> from the Inbox and from Drafts. Whereas it still only took one or two seconds to open the same message for editing from Drafts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was hardware error on the phone (the zero keywas was bad) so I got a new one, which fixed my problem. And the man down at the store (<a href="http://www.3.dk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.3.dk</a>), said he had heard of the slow SMS problem before, and that
 Nokia was working on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what I'd like to know is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a known problem?</li><li>If so, where can I read about it?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like my 6700 very much. But I <u><em>do</em></u> have issues with it, and I <u>
<em>will</em></u> be looking for more solutions on this forum. :)</p>

<p>Hi, I have the same problem with my Nokia 6700. It's been working fine since I got it five months ago, but all by a sudden, about a week ago, some problems arose:</p>
<p>* Opening text messages takes between 1 min. and 3 mins. (depending on the size of the message.</p>
<p>* A fully charged battery only lasts for about 5 hours (drastic over-night change from having a standby time of approximately 3 days)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no hardware problem, like Soren, so I can't claim a new phone ;-)</p>
<p>I've tried re-installing the firmware, though, but to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would, as the original poster, be very interested in konwing if Nokia has done anything to resolve this problem.</p>

<p>I've been having similar problems. I have a 6700 and my text messages have started to take about 25 secs to open. Plus my battery is starting to run out a lot quicker even though I use it minimally.</p>

<p>I'm a bit miffed that no one at Nokia has answered my original questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a known problem?</li><li>If so, where can I read about it?</li></ul>
<p>But I think I can guess what the problem is - and I think it <em><strong>is</strong>
</em>a hardware problem. And you should <em><strong>insist </strong></em>upon getting your phone replaced! I think there's a regular short circuit somewhere in the phone - or a "the-wires-are-too-close-together" thingy. After all, it IS a very small phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem disappeared when I got a new phone. But the new phone had problems too. It started shutting down (shutting off) in the middle of conversations! And one day, it wouldn't start up again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I went back to the dealer with it, where it got repaired on the waranty. But it didn't take long before it started shutting down again. So I sent it back, and this time they put in a new motherboard. I hope that helps, because I do love my "little black
 phone" so.</p>

            Like I said in my original posting, Nokia replaced the phone for other reasons (one of the keys was bad). The new phone did not have the problem.<br />
<br />
Also - the new motherboard has solved the shutdown problem.<br />

    <title>Exchange program for Band users that lose weight - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n3leaf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exchange program for Band users that lose weight</h2>
                    So I've been using my Band 2 for about 3 months and I really feel like it has been one of if not the most contributing factor in my progress.&nbsp; I wasn't really out of shape or overweight necessarily, but it helped me push over my training plateau.&nbsp; However,
 even though I didn't necessarily have weight to lose, I have still lost around 8 lbs and have definitely leaned up since I started using the band.&nbsp; My band can still tighten enough, but at times I have to use the very last notch.&nbsp; So it got me thinking, what
 about individuals that perhaps end up losing 20+ pounds or enough to significantly lessen their wrist circumference? I think it would be great if Microsoft offered a trade-in program for individuals that lose significant amount of weight and end up having
 a loose-fitting band so they could get the next size smaller. Anyone else experiencing enough weight loss that results in your band loosening up?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about your issue currently? Has the issue been fixed? Does the issue happen each time you save Visio drawing as HTML webpage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to create a new bank drawing, drag one shape in page, then save it as HTML webpage. Confirm if the issue can be reproduced.</p>
<p>

    <title>16 GB micro sdhc card only using 14.9 GB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lipsu_usqil  say:</h3>
<h2>            16 GB micro sdhc card only using 14.9 GB</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a new sd card for my phone. I can't remember the brand, but it has 16GB space and is class 6. I formatted the card with my nokia 5230 (in which I use it). Howewer, when I look at it in File manager it says 14.9 GB free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that space is needed for system files, but what bugs me is that the original 2GB sd card only used 0.3GB for this purpose. I'm losing triple the amount of space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm interested both in hearing why this happens and if it's possible to free some of this space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            You need to reinstall Win8.1 to get the upgrade to Windows 10 and no such thing as "full" version, when did you install the Preview version as of July 15 you needed to have an active version of Preview. for the newer builds.

<h3> jayseeem  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Go to&#34; keyboard command&#63;</h2>
                    I'm in the final stages of work on a 400-page manuscript and I need to be able to go to specific pages. In Word 2011, ⌘+G doesn't bring up the go to dialog box as it used to. Nor does there seem to be a "Go to" command on the textual menu at the top of
 the window, as there used to be, so I can't see how to add a keyboard shortcut the usual way. The only way of bringing up the Go To box I've found is by pressing that tiny button on the bottom of the scroll bar and clicking on box 6. Which seems unecessarily
 complicated.

            <p>Hi Gustavo Bellotto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the mail headers you provide (I have removed them to protect your privacy), this is an email from Google to your Gmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it’s a Gmail account, please change the settings in Gmail to check how it works:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Gmail.</li><li>At the top right, click the gear Settings.</li><li>Select Settings.</li><li>Scroll down to the Images section (stay in the "General" tab).</li><li>Choose Ask before displaying external images.</li><li>Click Save Changes at the bottom of the page.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can double confirm the Outlook settings via the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Outlook.</li><li>Click the File tab.</li><li>Click Options.</li><li>Click Trust Center.</li><li>Under Microsoft Outlook Trust Center, click Trust Center Settings.</li><li>Check the Don't download pictures automatically in HTML e-mail messages or RSS items box.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Franky</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt response.</p>
<p>That message was directed to my gmail account but it was automatically forwarded to my outlook account where I usually read my gmail messages. The issue I described occurs inside Outlook. I have no problem reading the same message in gmail web client nor
 in my windows phone device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found why Outlook is trying to retrieve the images; sending domain is not set as trusted but my gmail address is in Safe Senders Junk E-mail options and outlook was set to permit download images from safe senders:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e05ebde6-d609-4544-a9f7-1f79598891df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e05ebde6-d609-4544-a9f7-1f79598891df" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note however that the original message sender is not in safe senders list but my own gmail account, from where the message has been forwarded. This however could be a reasonable behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the only issue is why retrieving that non-reachable image is rendering Outlook non-responding as it keeps trying to download it in an endless loop, even if a cancel it from the "Contacting: ...." pop-up windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Br,</p>

            <p>Hi Gustavo,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the updates.<br />
<br />
I understood that the issue occurs to your “Outlook account”, as a narrow down step, please configure your Gmail account onto your Outlook client directly and see if you can open the open the email.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I’d like to collect some information for further troubleshooting:<br />
<br />
1. About “outlook account”, do you use an Office 365 for Business account? If yes, log into OWA(<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) and see if you can preview the affected email.<br />
2. The .msg file of the affected email. You can refer to the following steps to save it.<br />
<br />
Opens the email in the Outlook client&gt; <strong>file</strong> &gt; <strong>Save as</strong> &gt; Save as type:
<strong>Outlook Message Format – Unicode</strong>.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Gustavo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the security settings in OWA are different from those in Outlook, it is an expected behavior that some pictures are not reachable in Outlook while they are reachable in OWA (The pictures in your email are not reachable in my test environment, either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix the Outlook non-responding issue, please follow the troubleshooting steps in the article below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2652320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2652320</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if you don’t need the external pictures in Outlook, I suggest you clear all “Permit downloads” boxes in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Franky</p>
<p>Fair enough. It is clear that I can prevent this issue to happen by blocking automatic download of external content in Outlook setup.</p>
<p>KB2652320 propose that workaround:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>Step 3: Check&nbsp;the problem which caused by external contents</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Prevent Outlook to download external contents. To do this, go to&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong>Options</strong>&gt;<strong>Trust Center</strong>&gt;<strong>Automatic Download</strong>, select the following two options:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Don't download pictures or other content automatically in HTML e-mail option.</span></li><li><span>Warn me before downloading content when editing, forwarding, or replying e-mail.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Avoid sending such an email with external source.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO however Outlook should not hang on infinite retry when external content is not reachable, in fact I think it is not doing so in other cases but instead it shows a broken image icon in place of missing external image. I do not really understand why it
 hangs in this case. In my opinion it deserves a code fixing. Hope you can address it to Outlook developers team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for you prompt and useful support.</p>
<p>Let´s close this discussion.</p>

<h2>            Presenting Microsoft Project 2007 information &#40;gantt charts and resource histograms&#41; in a Microsoft Word 2007 document</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I thought this was going to be easy but I'm pulling my hair out as it's so frustrating.</p>
<p>I need to present some of the information from my MS Project 2007 file in a Word 2007 document report.&nbsp; I've generated all the task schedules, gantt charts and resource histograms but I can't seem to transfer them across easily.</p>
<p>Firstly I'm trying to put my gantt chart view (including task information) onto one page of my Word document.&nbsp; I've tried using the 'copy picture' tool bar option but it only shows the part of the gantt chart visible on the screen.&nbsp; Due to the size of my
 gantt chart it won't be visible on one A3 page so ideally I'd like it to span across two or possible 3 pages (similar to the way it would look if it was printed&nbsp;to multiple&nbsp;pages).</p>
<p>In addition, I also need to show just the gantt chart (including levelled version)&nbsp;in the Word document and the resource histogram information.</p>
<p>Is it possible to this since I need to show them in one Word document report with heading, footings, prose, etc around them.</p>
<p>Any help will be much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Outlook app on iOS connects to wrong account</h2>
                    
<p>I have a personal hotmail account and an Office 365 Enterprise account for work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to install the Outlook app on my iPad iOS 8.4. &nbsp;First I set up the Outlook type account for my hotmail address, which also connected to my OneDrive. &nbsp;Then I tried to connect my work account using the Office 365?account type, logging in with my work
 credentials. &nbsp;Outlook shows my work folders but when i send a message it comes from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (not even @hotmail.com).</p>
<p>How do I unlink my hotmail account from my work account?</p>

<p>Hi hammer2,</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, pleas share with us the following information:</p>
<p><br />
1. About “connect my work account using the Office 365”, do you mean adding your Office 365 account in Outlook for iOS?
<br />
If not, please share with us the detailed steps.<br />
If so, are there only two accounts (Hotmail and Office 365) set up in your Outlook for iOS?<br />
2. What do you mean “unlink”? Would you like the sender to be your Office 365 mailbox when composing a new email from mobile?<br />
3. Share with us a screenshot of “Outlook shows my work folders but when I send a message it comes from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (not even @hotmail.com)”.<br />
4. Appreciate it if you could use another iPad to check whether the issue still occurs.<br />
5. Did you connect one of your Outlook.com account as a 
connected account of Office 365 mailbox?</p>
<p><br />
To upload the screenshot in the forum, please click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then the
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.</p>
<p>Any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Brook</p>

<p>Thank you for the information regarding the connected account. &nbsp;Although I was able to change the reply to address for the Office 365 account to my work address, it is still very odd to see my Hotmail address still listed as the default email address under

<p>hi hammer2,</p>
<p>regarding “<strong>outlook app on ios</strong>”, do you mean you use the product “<strong>outlook for ios</strong>” talked in the following link?
<a href="http://blogs.office.com/2015/01/29/deeper-look-outlook-ios-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.office.com/2015/01/29/deeper-look-outlook-ios-android/</a>
</p>
<p>if so, we have a dedicated support where you can use the <strong>in-app support</strong> to report any questions or issues regarding this app.</p>
<p>*note when using the in app support.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; it can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. it is recommended that the user turn on notifications for outlook in order to know when the technician is available.<br />
2. if you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you should see a response from the technician.<br />
3. it is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.</p>
<p>example:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp; <br />
thanks,<br />

<h2>            Can MS Office 2007 make use of the additional memory of Win 7 64bit</h2>
                    If i install my existing Office Professional 2007 (32 bit) on a Windows 7 64 bit machine will the programs (specifically Publisher which is memory-hungry for big publications) be able to use memory beyond the 4Gb limit of my current Windows 7 32 bit machine?

            <p>"The main advantage of computers running a 64-bit version of Windows is their ability to use more memory than a 32-bit version of Windows, even if more memory is installed in the PC. A computer with a 64-bit version of Windows can use more memory—4 GB (gigabytes)
 or more—than a PC with a 32-bit version of Windows, which is limited to about 3.5 GB or less.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A 64-bit PC with 6 GB, 8 GB, or more memory can outperform a computer with less memory if you keep a lot of programs and files open at once or you perform a lot of memory-intensive tasks, such as editing HD video or playing the latest 3D games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even so, few programs today have been designed to take full advantage of the 3.5 GB of maximum memory that you can use with a 32-bit version of Windows. So depending on what you do and what programs you use, there might be no advantage or
 only a slight advantage to using a 64-bit version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main advantage comes if you keep a lot of programs running at once." </p>

<p>
</p><p>Whether this means Publisher 2007 will run better on a 64 bit machine is unclear. Note too that by changing operating systems you will also need 64 bit drivers and they may or may not be available for your printers and such. You might want to repost your
 question in one of the Windows forums.

            <p>Hi DavidF</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info. If I move to a 64 bit version of windows it will be because of new hardware - the old stuff is getting too small and slow. My question still is, will Publisher 2007 be able to use more that the approx 3.5Gb limit imposed by a 32 bit
 operating system., or is Publisher itself limited to the amount of memory it can use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Again it is unclear but it sounds like it will. Repost the question in the Windows 7 forum and perhaps you will get a more definitive answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime you haven't discussed why you are finding Pub 2007 files memory intensive. That has not been my experience unless there are a lot of pictures that are uncompressed. I just opened a 101MB file in Pub2007 and it used only 21MB of memory on
 this WinXP machine. A second instance of Publisher used 64MB for a 20MB file with some large uncompressed image files. Compressing the images in your Publisher file might help memory issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reference: Compress Pictures dialog box (2007):<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA100363901033.aspx?pid=CL100605171033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA100363901033.aspx?pid=CL100605171033</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also right click an image &gt; change picture &gt; Graphics manager &gt; change picture display &gt; opt for the 'fast resize and zoom' option. This could help alleviate any 'sluggishness' you are experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p><font><font>Greetings,</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased a&nbsp; Nokia 7070 Prism for my wife birthday and loaded it up for her with all important telephone numbers and madeup for her groups for easy contact of our imediate family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When she receives messages from one of her conatcts in the phones telephone book it only shows the sender as (no name) and the telephone number.&nbsp; Why is this so? Surely the details are taken from the phone book to give this detail?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched the manual and cannot find any information on this subject or how to set the details so both name and number is shown when a message is received from a contact in the phones telephone book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope there is someone out there who can answer this for me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greetings pamdemonium (Sage),</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to let you know the problem has been solved, when I checked the details of each message again I noted each telephone number was shown with the + and country code, this promted me to look at the problem a little closer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my haste to set up the mobile phone I never added the + and country code to everyone's mobile telephone number so I went through themobile phone's telephone book and quickly added the + and country code to everyone's mobile telephone number and sure enough
 on going to the messages received now appeared the name of each sender.</p>
