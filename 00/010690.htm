<h2>            MAC Outlook Office 16 not opening links</h2>
                    <p>I am running High Sierra and just updated to Office 16. When I click on a link, a new browser opens but that is all. I have to copy and paste the link to get where I want to be.I am running Chrome and when I say new browser, I mean it does not open a new
 tab, so I end up with multiple browser windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the links to open properly?</p>
<p />

<h2>            Is There A Windows 10 Tech. Preview Guide Somewhere &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm running the windows 10 tech. preview on my laptop that was running windows 8.1 version. Certain things are 'similar' to the way they were in 8.1, and of course other things are quite a bit different. Is there any sort of guide somewhere that explains
 how to use windows 10 tech. preview..and if so, where is it located ? One item I'd like information on is how to keep what was called the metro view on as default.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

regsvr32 msxml3.dll<br />
-----<br />
Msxml3.dll is a Microsoft XML parser dynamic link library. It is<br />
obviously needed by PC Suite, but wasn't registered as installed<br />
by the system. Using the "regsvr32" command on the .dll registers the file.

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - Get scheduling assistant info for multiple accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having Outlook 2013 configured with two accounts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every account is having its own different domain (AAA.com and BBB.com) and also separate corporate address books.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to create a Meeting (for example from AAA.com) I start then to add attendees in that meeting using the scheduling assistant. The attendees that I am adding are from both domains (AAA.com and BBB.com).
</p>
<p>As the meeting was created using the AAA.com account, then I am only to see the availability (Free/Busy hours) from the same account... BBB.com availability information is show as not able to be obtained...</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19c48a27-8f1d-4d7b-8581-5063bb4de2d9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do the opposite (creating the meeting from BBB.com) then logically the AAA.com are not shown and I have only visibility to the BBB.com availability information...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that Outlook can merge both information and show availability from both domains, independently on which account I am using to create the meeting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>

            No, since your AAA account doesn't have permission on the mailboxes on the BBB server and vice versa. These 2 environments need to be federated at Exchange level in order to do what you want.

<p>Just as a quick FYI, for Office 2007 there was a "Military Appreciation Edition" (MAE) in retail packages sold in the Exchange system (PX/BX).&nbsp; This was Office Standard 2007 with a special product key that was programmed to permit three concurrent activations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Office 2010, the MAE is the usual Office H&amp;S 2010 with&nbsp;special package graphics at a significant discount from normal retail.&nbsp;

            What you have to do is a phone activation. Don't enter any information until it offers you the option of speaking to a service rep. Explain that you are transferring the installation from a dead machine to a new one. They should allow it. If not, politely
 ask to speak to a supervisor.<br />

<p>bought 2nd hand e7-00 second I've owned - made a mistake and bought 1 locked to THREE (3) I need it on O2 / unlocked got an unlock code from the net which worked but the phone will not allow me to switch on data nor wifi - the icons 'behind' the main screen
 are greyed out - bluetooth and silent are fine -- thinking either the phone is u/s or has only partially been unlocked.... any ideas?&nbsp; have tried an o2 sim (giff gaff) and Vodaphone (lebara) stillno joy</p>

<p><strong><u>Generic Symbian Anna update troubleshooting:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136052</strong><strong>: Why don’t I see Symbian Anna update packages in the software update client on my phone?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>There could be several reasons.</p>
<p>1) Symbian Anna has not been released for your country yet and therefore no update is available yet.</p>
<p>2) Symbian Anna has been released for your country but you are using</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) a productcode that belongs to an operator that has not approved the update yet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) a productcode that belongs to a country that has not released the update yet</p>
<p>3) You have checked for software updates in the last 24h and your phone is not showing new available updates, as it is only connecting to the server once every 24h and any other time only check its memory. To clear your phone’s cache, tap the Clock on your
 homescreen and change the date of your phone to next day (via Settings). For example, if todays date is 6th Nov, then set the date to 7th Nov. This will make existing updates visible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136053</strong><strong>: Why don’t I see Symbian Anna update packages in OviSuite?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>There could be several reasons.</p>
<p>1) Symbian Anna has not been released for your country yet and therefore no update is available yet.</p>
<p>2) Symbian Anna has been released for your country but you are using</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) a productcode that belongs to an operator that has not approved the update yet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) a productcode that belongs to a country that has not released the update yet</p>
<p>3) You have checked for software updates in the last 24h and OviSuite is not showing new available updates, as it is only connecting to the server once every 24h and any other time only check its cache. Available updates will get visible after 24h – or try
 to update via the software update client in your phone (by using WiFi).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135977: Why don’t I see Symbian Anna after just having my phone updated over the air via the Software Update client?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>In some product codes/phone variants when updating via OTA (over the air) it is not possible to jump from the existing software version directly to Symbian Anna, if another software release has been accepted for that phone variant in between the old software
 and Anna. In this case when using OTA the intermediate software versions need to be installed first.</p>
<p>If using Ovi Suite or Nokia Software Updater (NSU) all variants of Symbian Anna supported phones can be updated directly to Symbian Anna.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>FA136073</strong>: Why can’t I download Symbian Anna application packages (Installation fails)?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The reason for this is most likely a problem with existing QT files on your phone. Please try the following:</p>
<p><strong>A) Solution1</strong> – especially if you have “Nokia bubbles” on your phone</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install the following QT files on the C: drive of your phone in exactly this sequence</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <a href="http://dl.nokia.com/ns/sdo/QtSA4.7.301.sisx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://dl.nokia.com/ns/sdo/QtSA4.7.301.sisx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<a href="http://dl.nokia.com/ns/sdo/QtWebkitSA4.8.0.sisx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dl.nokia.com/ns/sdo/QtWebkitSA4.8.0.sisx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<a href="http://dl.nokia.com/ns/sdo/QtMobilitySA1.1.301.sis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dl.nokia.com/ns/sdo/QtMobilitySA1.1.301.sis</a></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While you install above QT files you MUST keep the following things in mind:</p>
<p>*Installation must be done to C: drive of the phone. If you by mistake select E: drive, you can cancel the installation and re-install again. If E: drive installation is complete, you can re-install one more time and select C: drive for installation.</p>
<p>*Installation order must be met. First it has to be QT (QtSA4.7.301.sisx).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the software update client on your phone via Menu&gt;Applications&gt;(Tools&gt;)Softwareupdate</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the shown Symbian Anna application packages and start the update</p>
<p><strong>B) Solution2</strong>:</p>
<p>- Launch the File manager on your phone (Typically found: Menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; Office -&gt; File mgr.)</p>
<p>- Choose Options -&gt; Find -&gt; E: Mass memory -&gt; Root folder</p>
<p>- In the “Find text:” window, type “*.sisx” (without double quote) and the select find.</p>
<p>- It will display many sisx files starting with “TMP”. Example: TMP3efa4.sisx.</p>
<p>- Now select Options -&gt; Mark multiple items&nbsp; and now mark all sisx starting with “TMP”.</p>
<p>- After marking them select Options -&gt; Delete and delete all of them.</p>
<p>- Now tap the Clock on your homescreen and change the date of your phone to next day (via Settings). For example, if todays date is 6th Nov, then set the date to 7th Nov. This is needed to clear the software update cache and make new updates visible.</p>
<p>- Open the “SW update” application.</p>
<p>- Select the shown Symbian Anna application packages and start the update</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135984: Why have I lost Quickoffice and Adobe pdf reader after downloading and installing Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>It’s crucial that you not only download the operating system but also the Symbian Anna application packages. They are available via Ovi Suite update or over the air (depending on your country and operator) as well. The package called Symbian Anna 1/2 contains
 the Quickoffice and pdf reader, and Symbian Anna 2/2 contains other important service updates, so we recommend updating everything you see in Ovi Suite or the Software Update client.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>FA136033</strong>: Why do I get an error message “Phone setup: Feature not supported” after the update to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The message will vanish as soon as the application package Symbian Anna 2/2 is installed, which is part of the Symbian Anna update.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>FA136059</strong>: Why do I get Error 12017 when trying to update to Symbian Anna via OviSuite?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Error 12017 (FailDeviceError) means that the device is not responding. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Check if the device reboots normally. If it doesn’t, Nokia OVI suite cannot talk to it.</p>
<p>2. Check if it connects to Windows through USB normally and it is in “OVI Suite” mode. Make sure USB connection works reliably and the USB driver is up to date. You can also try to change the USB port if there is USB hub or internal hub in laptop computer
 that can work less reliably.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135962: What happens if I skip the application updates (i.e. have only downloaded the operating system update) while updating to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Application updates are classified as either mandatory (Symbian Anna 1/2), important (Symbian Anna 2/2), or optional (Social, Ovi Store, Angry birds). If those application updates are not done, your experience will not be optimal. Without these updates you'd:</p>
<p>- not have Adobe PDF reader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- not have Quickoffice.</p>
<p>- not have Microsoft Office Communicator.</p>
<p>- not have In Device Search.</p>
<p>- not have Internet Radio.</p>
<p>- not have Social client.</p>
<p>- not have a working music store.</p>
<p>- have issues with Phone feature is not supported appearing every boot.</p>
<p>- have subtitle support missing from Video player.</p>
<p>- miss all Surround icons for apps that are included in the application packages &nbsp;</p>
<p>- miss all the error fixes to the service/TPO clients.</p>
<p>- miss all the enablers ( NAC, Qt, SSO, Ovi Notifications ..).</p>
<p>- The email attachments can’t be read as Quickoffice/Adobe reader won’t function.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; You might see mixed old &amp; new icons in the menu or Homescreen.</p>
<p>No further application updates can be done unless the mandatory Symbian Anna package is installed.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135983: Why do I get the message "Phone feature not supported" after the Symbian Anna upgrade?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This message is displayed if only the Symbian Anna device upgrade has been installed, but not the Symbian Anna Application packages. Install the Symbian Anna Update 1/2 and Symbian Anna Update 2/2 as that will solve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136026: What is included in the Symbian Anna Update ½ and 2/2 application packages?
</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </li></ul>
<p><strong>Symbian Anna Update 1/2</strong> includes the following:</p>
<p>Adobe (PDF) reader 10.00(245) / Quickoffice 6.04(460) / QT 4.7.3 / QT Mobility 1.1.3. / Qt webkit 4.8.0. / CPService_2.0.11119 / CWRTCore_1.0.11124 / LKM_1.0.11051 / ONSP_1.2.11120 / OVI 1.0.11121. / SCP_2.0.11121. / SSOUI_1.3.11120 / SSO_1.3.11120 / SSOUserName_widget_1.0.0
 / ServiceProvider_1.0.11124 / CP_ launcher 2.1.1 / Veveo Indevice Search 2.39.201</p>
<p><strong>Symbian Anna Update 2/2</strong> includes the following:</p>
<p>2.3.6 - NAC. / 13.2.24 - Ovi Music 1.1. / 3.6.688 - Maps 3 SR6. / OviMaps-OriginOfDownload-3.6.1. / SignInEnabler_92_1_0NOCS. / Maps_ODML. / Internet Radio 3.03(0) / MS Communicator 2.01.369 / Psiloc font magnifier 3.2.0. / Shazam 3.01(0) / Jolkuspot 3.10.
 / Video Player 9.23(62). / Here and Now 2.0.3 / Internet Search Engine 3.0.8 / Home Screen Search Widget 2.0.5</p>
<p><strong>Additional SW Update</strong> may contain the following optional applications:</p>
<p>Ovi Store 2.12.042 / Social 1.3.237 / NFC Sharing + Angry Birds Free with Magic</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135982: How should I update Symbian Anna if I’m in an area with weak network coverage?<br />
</strong>We recommend to do the Symbian Anna update via Ovi Suite or via WiFi because of the update size (&gt;80MB for over the air updates) and corresponding download times.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136058</strong><strong>: How do I update to Symbian Anna when my productcode belongs to a “SWAP” device?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Nokia doesn’t offer Symbian Anna updates via OviSuite or OTA for productcodes that are linked to a SWAP device at the moment. Please go to your local Nokia Carepoint to get your phone updated.</p>

<p><strong><u>Application troubleshooting after Symbian Anna:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136027</strong><strong>: Why can’t I see the new surround icons after updating to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>If a particular theme, e.g. Midnight Silver, has been installed before the software update, then the old theme by the same name will still be in use after the update. This can result in not showing the new surround icons or other theme features. To correct
 this, choose Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Themes &gt; General and select the other Midnight Silver theme pack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135990: Why do I have mixed old &amp; new icons in the menu or Homescreen after Symbian Anna update?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This happens if you have not installed the Symbian Anna application packages. Please download Symbian Anna 1/2, Symbian Anna 2/2, OviStore and Social via OviSuite or via WiFi by using the Software Client in your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135985: Why is the splitscreen Qwerty not visible when using Swype after Symbian Anna update?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>You have to enable the Qwerty keyboard by opening the message view, selecting the Options button (that looks like a list) and selecting Qwerty keyboard. If you are using Swype, it might be blocking the Qwerty. Try to disable Swype and check if that solves
 the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136050: Why is the split screen view available in Messaging but not in Conversations after updating to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>If split screen input does not appear (in latin-based languages) in conversations view then you have a conflicting conversations software in your phone. You need to remove it, it takes place via:</p>
<p>Settings | Application Manager |Installed Applications</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List of installed applications appears, choose Conversations, remove it.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List of installed applications appears, choose Conversations Server, remove it.</p>
<p>Re-boot the device and split screen input should work after this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136036: Why don’t I have a splitscreen Qwerty after updating to Symbian Anna on a Chinese N8/C7/C6-01/E7?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The splitscreen Qwerty is not available for devices with a Chinese productcode/language, but will be part of the Symbian Belle update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136049: Why are my widgets not working after the Symbian Anna update?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>If you have face this issue, please try a 8 sec reboot, by pressing and holding the powerbutton of your phone for 8 sec until you feel a buzz and the phone is restarting.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136056</strong><strong>: Why are my widgets slow to appear after the Symbian Anna update?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>When the device is first switched on, and sometimes when a particular home screen has been inactive for some time, the widgets appear blank apart from titles and after a brief pause the correct content is displayed. This is normal behaviour and caused by
 the content harverster that is running in the background.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136042: Why is Mail for Exchange (MfE) not syncing emails after the update to Symbian Anna?
</strong></li></ul>
<p>After the update to Symbian Anna, some users experienced problems with MfE (errormessages: “Exchange server error. Try again later” / “Your account does not have permission to synchronise with current settings. Contact your administrator.”). To fix the problem
 do following steps:</p>
<p>1. Open Outlook web access with your PC browser, for example via https://[your domain]/owa (depending on your network) – and log into your emails.</p>
<p>2. In your inbox, select Options (on the top right hand corner of your screen) and then See all Options.</p>
<p>3. Select Phone.</p>
<p>4. Delete all connections by selecting the respective phone and pressing (X).</p>
<p>Then just go back to the Mail for Exchange client on your phone and do a sync.</p>
<p>If above does not help, contact Nokia Support.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>FA136074</strong>: Why is Ovi Store not working after the Symbian Anna update?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This problem is linked to incompatibel QT components. Please do the following:</p>
<p><strong>SolutionA:</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install the following QT files on the C: drive of your phone in exactly this sequence</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While you install above QT files you MUST keep the following things in mind:</p>
<p>*Installation must be done to C: drive of the phone. If you by mistake select E: drive, you can cancel the installation and re-install again. If E: drive installation is complete, you can re-install one more time and select C: drive for installation.</p>
<p>*Installation order must be met. First it has to be QT (QtSA4.7.301.sisx).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Ovi Store</p>
<p><strong>B) Solution2</strong>:</p>
<p>- Launch the File manager on your phone (Typically found: Menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; Office -&gt; File mgr.)</p>
<p>- Choose Options -&gt; Find -&gt; E: Mass memory -&gt; Root folder</p>
<p>- In the “Find text:” window, type “*.sisx” (without double quote) and the select find.</p>
<p>- It will display many sisx files starting with “TMP”. Example: TMP3efa4.sisx.</p>
<p>- Now select Options -&gt; Mark multiple items&nbsp; and now mark all sisx starting with “TMP”.</p>
<p>- After marking them select Options -&gt; Delete and delete all of them.</p>
<p>- Start Ovi Store</p>

<li><strong>FA136057</strong><strong>: Why are my pictures slow to appear in the Gallery after the Symbian Anna update?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>When the device is first switched on, the pictures in the Gallery take some time to be diplayed fully. This is normal behaviour and caused by the content harverster that is running in the background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135975: Why don't I see all my pictures any more in the Photos application after updating to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The Photos application in Symbian Anna will only show the items located in the Images, Videos and DCIM folders (e.g. items captured by the user). If you have saved your pictures in a different folder, they won’t be visible after updating to Symbian Anna.
 If there are items that should be visible in the Photos application, move them to the Images or Videos folder on the mass memory or memory card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135980: Where should I copy the images and videos in my Symbian Anna phone if I want to view them in the Photos application?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Copy images to the Images folder and videos to the Videos folder on the mass memory or memory card of your Symbian Anna device if you want to view them in the Photos application.</p>
<p>Note that with the previous Symbian^3 software versions the Photos application showed items from all folders, so you may not be able to view some of your items any more after updating to Symbian Anna if copied to other than the above folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136025 Why are my albums not shown properly after updating to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The Symbian Anna update added support for Album artist field/tag to the Music player and if any tracks on an album are missing this information, those tracks are shown individually under separate albums. To correct your music library move affected tracks
 to your PC, add Album artist detail to those tracks by using, for example, some tag editor application or similar functionality (Advanced Tad Editor) in the latest version of Windows Media Player, transfer tracks back to device and refresh your music library.
 Music ripped, for example, with latest version of Windows Media player will have correct Album artist detail in place as will music purchased/downloaded from Nokia Music Store.</p>
<p>For compilation albums with album artist information in the ID3 tag of a track and the same name in the track artist information, all tracks of an album are displayed as separate albums in landscape mode. This issue will be fixed in Symbian Belle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136048: Do you have problems with Symbian Anna &amp; Nokia Big Screen?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>If you have faced problems with Symbian Anna and Nokia Big Screen, please uninstall the old Big Screen Beta version and install a new one from Ovi via
<a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/106490?clickSource=search&amp;pos=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://store.ovi.com/content/106490?clickSource=search&amp;pos=1</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>In detail:</p>
<p>1. Uninstall Nokia Big Screen Beta: &nbsp;Go to Settings &gt; Application Manager &gt; Installed Apps. Long press Nokia Big Screen Beta, and then Select Uninstall and “Yes” for all enquiries. After uninstallation, please make sure that all Big Screen related files
 are removed. If not, uninstall all packages starting with “Nokia big screen….” separately.</p>
<p>2. Install Nokia Big Screen from Ovi via <a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/106490?clickSource=search&amp;pos=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135984: Why have I lost Quickoffice and Adobe pdf reader after downloading and installing Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>It’s crucial that you not only download the operating system but also the Symbian Anna application packages. They are available via Ovi Suite update or over the air (depending on your country and operator) as well. The package called Symbian Anna 1/2 contains
 the Quickoffice and pdf reader, and Symbian Anna 2/2 contains other important service updates, so we recommend updating everything you see in Ovi Suite or the Software Update client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136035: Why is my GPS very slow after the update to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This can be fixed by changing the settings in the Assisted GPS server. Do the following steps:</p>
<p>• Select Menu&nbsp; &gt; Settings &gt; Application Settings &gt; Positioning &gt; Positioning server &gt; Server Settings.</p>
<p>• It shows:&nbsp; 1 supl.nokia.com.</p>
<p>• By tapping that, it shows: Server address* Supl.nokia.com and Only in home network Yes.</p>
<p>• Switch Only in home network to No.</p>
<p>This setting should be set to No, because otherwise if you are in a different network than your home network your phone will not use GPS assistance, which results in a long wait to get a GPS fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136051: How can I reduce the battery consumption after updating to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The increased battery life is most often caused by WiFi connections being active all the time. One application that is often connected to this is Microsoft Office Communicator that has to be closed properly via “Sign out” to also cut the connection (“exit”
 will leave the connection still open). Same applies for the Social client: If you sign out and exit the Social Client, then the WiFi connection will be cut as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136030</strong><strong>: Why don’t I have a Games folder on my N8/C7/C6-01/E7 despite updating to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The extra Games folder is part of the individual country &amp; operator customization of your phone and not available for every variant.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136037: What is the “Signal Booster” icon that is visible after the update to Symbian Anna in the Applications folder?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This icon is part of some Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) software for certain customers and will vanish as soon as your phone configuration is initialized properly after the update.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136054</strong><strong>: Why is the connection pop up missing after updating to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>As part of the Symbian Anna update the Connection pop up is removed. &nbsp;Meaning, once you connect to your operator internet or similar, there won’t be any pop up visible anymore.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136038: Why don’t I see subtitles anymore In the video player after the update to Symbian Anna?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The subtitle support is part of the Symbian Anna application packages. Once you install those, the subtitles will be displayed again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA136055</strong><strong>: Why does my E7 display stay black when I make or receive a call after the Symbian Anna update?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This issue is a defect in your phone’s hardware. The shortterm solution is to open the slide and your display will be enabled again. For a full fix please contact your local Nokia Care Point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135979: What happens to paid licenses for Quickoffice and Adobe? Will the license still be valid after the Symbian Anna update?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Symbian Anna includes the full license for Quickoffice and Adobe. Once the mandatory application package (Symbian Anna 1/2) is downloaded, the Quickoffice and Adobe will function normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FA136131 What is Nokia Analytics Collector?</strong></p>
<p>Nokia Analytics Collector is a feature in Symbian Anna and later versions, which optimizes in-application data collection. The application integrates the NAC API and allows collection and reporting of information about application usage. NAC stores the information
 provided by the application (session start, events, session stop), enriches it with some device information such as model, operator, country, unique ID, but does not capture data such as the customer’s location, or phone number or email. NAC sends data in
 compressed and encrypted form to the Nokia back-end systems where it is consolidated to provide important feedback to application developers on general user behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FA136147 Where can I find the Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) and packet data connection events in Log application on Symbian Anna devices?</strong></p>
<p>The log application does not display the WLAN and the packet data (GPRS) connection events on Symbian Anna devices. This has been reported to R&amp;D and the issue is under the investigation. We will update this FAQ as soon as we have more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FA136214 I am using Afaria client on my Symbian^3 device, can I upgrade to Symbian Anna?</strong></p>
<p>We don't recommend upgrading to Symbian Anna. The Afaria client is not compatible with Symbian Anna devices, until 3rd party has updated the application.</p>
<p>More details see following web site: <a href="http://www.sybase.com/detail?id=1094750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FA136376 I am unable to install any Java apps after the Symbian Anna upgrade, how to fix this?</strong></p>
<p>After upgrading Symbian Anna and starting the Java installation file on the Nokia Symbian^3 device, the following error message may be displayed: Installation failed – internal error: Jsr plugin com.nokia.mj.jmpl.chapi.core.utils.ServiceProviderInstaller
 cancelled installation. To fix this, install the following java_symbian_anna_fix.sis file:
<a href="http://dl.nokia.com/ns/java_symbian_anna_fix.sis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dl.nokia.com/ns/java_symbian_anna_fix.sis</a> .</p>
<p>Note: During the installation the file will give the warning message: Application not compatible with phone. Continue anyway. Select yes to proceed.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135994: Is network mode set back to "dual mode" after Symbian Anna update?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Yes, after the update, the network mode will be “Dual mode”, regardless of the previous choice. If needed, choose Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Connectivity-&gt;Network-&gt;Network mode and choose “GSM” again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FA135995: Data use in home country reverts to SIM default value after Symbian Anna update</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>After the Symbian Anna update, the Data use in home country will be the SIM default value defined by the operator, regardless of the previous choice. If needed, choose Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Settings &gt; Data use in home country and choose another
 option.</p>
<p>Note: With the automatic setting, additional costs may occur, depending on the operator billing scheme.</p>

            <p>Hi NareshBabu,</p>
<p><br />
the Phone does not have the ability to upload files into websites.<br />
The only thing you can do if you want to share a document with someone is to upload the file into skydrive and then share the skydrive link with that person.<br />
<br />

    <title>Outlook 2016 to Office 365 email - an encrypted connection to your - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 to Office 365 email - an encrypted connection to your mail server is not available.</h2>
                    <p>[this call may be monitored for our quality assurance. If for some reason there should be any hardship on your side, Mr. End User, we will completely ignore, and deny, that there is any recording whatsoever about this conversation -- that is why we say this
 conversation *MAY* be recorded ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brand new HP laptop. Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my Office 365 Business installation straight from MS via my "Software" downloads in OWA. Here's what I just did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User bought new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple months ago the company agreed to O365, so we set up a nice little network share to install Office 365 Business onto all the computers using the office deployment tool and click-to-run. So, I installed Office 365 Business on their laptop using this
 method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also needed Visio, so I thought "sweet, I'll just go buy them a Visio license and download that too".</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Office 365 Business was installed (btw, no mention of any year/date like 2013, 2015?, 2016?), I then went to the end user's OWA to get Visio. Upon installation, I get an error saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Some&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>older(?)</strong></span> apps don't work with Office 2016. before installing the new Office, we need to remove:</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft Office 365 Business - en-us.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>My first thought was, OLDER? You mean 2013 is now "old"?? My second thought was "Office"?! I'm only installing visio, not the entire office suite. My third thought was, what the hell am I still doing in the computer field, everything is a joke lately. Everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So fine, I uninstall the&nbsp;<strong>Office 365 Business</strong>, go re-download&nbsp;<strong>Office 365 Business&nbsp;<em>"with thew new 2016 apps"&nbsp;</em></strong>from the end user's OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Office 2016 and Visio 2016 are now installed. Ok. Finally. I can set up Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to set up their Outlook profile and now I'm getting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available. Click Next to attempt using an unencrypted connection".</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, my co-workers are beginning to wonder why I'm typing so fast and hard on the keyboard. Please, PLEASE, help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>[please take a moment of <strong>your </strong>time (no, we won't pay you for it) to take a survey about our survey!]</p>
<p>
</p><p>fml</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then, knowing computers and how, if you keep trying over and over, or just do random things, sometimes it'll "just work". First, I tried rebooting. Big mistake, especially when I'm in a hurry, because I got slapped in the face by Microsofts "Getting Windows
 ready - Don't turn off your computer" -- YAY. WINDOWS UPDATES FORCED UPON ME. Granted, an update might actually fix this error, but that is part of the bigger problem, the grand scheme of things with what's wrong with computers and how things are released
 before they even work. Twenty minutes later, I'm logged back in. Whatever updates did happen (don't care to go see where the *new* location of Windows updates (is it even called that this year?)), didn't work. So, again, knowing computers sometimes *just work*
 when you do stupid nonsensical things, I opened Microsoft Word. I noticed it wasn't signed in (I know right... just want to write a letter, but you better sign in first for "better customer experience"), I decided what the heck, might as well sign in, the
 end user will have to eventually anyway...&nbsp;<em>so they can type letters. </em>I sign in, ACCEPT the terms and agreements first, of course, and after clicking sign in, the window times out! Image below.
<strong>I am officially beginning my shift AWAY FROM computers. Good luck everyone.</strong></p>

            <p>Not helpful at all. In fact, this just proves my suspicion. In any case, the fact Micro$oft&nbsp;doesn't offer end users, at the point of failure when it simply tells the end user "hey, since you want Visio 2016, we're going to uninstall your entire Office suite"
 the option to "upgrade for free", as mentioned here (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/-We-need-to-remove-some-older-apps-error-a225347f-e102-4ea6-9796-5d1ac5220c3b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/-We-need-to-remove-some-older-apps-error-a225347f-e102-4ea6-9796-5d1ac5220c3b</a>
 --&gt; you can contact the Microsoft <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/ContactUs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Answer Desk">
<p>
</p><p>Why not have a "<strong>get your free upgrade here</strong>" BUTTON on that sad pop-up telling the end user "we're going to uninstall your entire office suite because you want one application, that
<em><strong>isn't part of the office suite</strong></em>, to work on your computer".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case. I am wasting my time. Because as of this morning, the "<strong>An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available. Click Next to attempt using an unencrypted connection"&nbsp;</strong>error message is gone. Hmmm,&nbsp;everything seems to have
 worked, <strong>as it should have</strong>,&nbsp;and I haven't changed anything on this laptop. I am glad I wasted half my day yesterday simply trying to get office installed on a new user's PC, and Outlook set up. It was an eye opener into the wasteful world I'm
 living in. What just happened over night is the same thing that happens all around the world every day. "It's not working" [technician reboots server in the background...] "Try it now!" says the tech. "It works now, thanks you're a genius" says the end user.
 Nope, I just rebooted a server containing glitchy software that shouldn't have been released to the public yet.</p>

    <title>How can I set Outlook to read oldest messages first&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nsdash9  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I set Outlook to read oldest messages first&#63;</h2>
                    I just started using Outlook 2010. &nbsp;When I download new email messages, they are arranged by date with the newest message always selected by default. &nbsp;Is there a way to select the oldest message by default? &nbsp;That way I am reading messages oldest to newest?
 &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I select the Received column, I can changed the message sorting from top to bottom or bottom to top, but the newest message is always selected by default. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, in order to read the oldest first I always have to&nbsp;manually&nbsp;select the oldest message. &nbsp;I have to think there is a simple way to&nbsp;change&nbsp;this, but so far I haven't been able to figure it out &nbsp;And Google searches haven't yielded an answer, either. &nbsp;Can
 anyone help me with this?</div>

            <div>Hello,</div>
<div>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.
<div>There is no setting in Outlook to set the oldest unread mail to be on top and selected automatically. This is by design.</div>
<div>You may provide your suggestion and feedback regarding this to Microsoft in the below feedback forum link:</div>
<div><a href="http://mymfe.microsoft.com/Office/feedback.aspx?formID=375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mymfe.microsoft.com/Office/feedback.aspx?formID=375</a><span>
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>As a work around you may enable the unread emails folder, and change the sorting order to Ascending. This would ensure that the earliest of your unread emails is on top.</span></div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, mac doesn’t support opening .msg files. The email format on Mac is .eml.&nbsp; And I totally understand your concern to have this feature included in Outlook for mac, I suggest you submit your ideas in our uservoice forum via the following link:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many features of current programs have been designed and upgraded based on customers’ feedback. Thanks for your time and efforts to make Outlook for Mac better</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<br />
Its extremely annoying to on see an incoming number without a name.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to fix this? The E65 should reference ALL phone fields.<br />

            I have had the same problem. I think it's because I had my phone book of contacts in there, then added my Outlook Contacts. When the phone recognises a number with 2 references, as in the Outlook contact and the phone book contact, it can't tell that it
 is actually the same person and just puts up the number.

            You would have saved the macros in Personal.xlsb, which is not available right now. To verify this check if you can locate Personal.xlsb&nbsp;in the following location C:\Documents and Settings\<em>user name</em>\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel\XLStart folder.
<br />
<br />
If you are&nbsp;able to locate this file&nbsp;then click on Macros Button on the Developer Tab and click on the drop down near
<em>Macros in:</em> and you would find <em>Personal Macro Workbook. Select Personal Macro Workbook
</em>and list of macros saved should appear in the list. <br />
<br />
Note:- If you do not want&nbsp;the macros to be saved in the <em>Personal Macro Workbook
</em>always choose <em>This Workbook </em>under<em> Store Macro</em> <em>in</em> drop down while saving the macro.

<p>I cannot find my Personal.xlsb file.&nbsp; I write macros and they never seem to save anywhere.&nbsp; Never had this problem on my other computer.&nbsp; Just switched to Windows 2007 on 64 bit machine and running Office 2007 (32bit).&nbsp; I have all the security settings to
 allow macros.&nbsp; I use them once but if I open a new or different file they are not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already wasted more time than I would have saved using the macros!&nbsp; aacck!&nbsp; Maybe I will try OpenOffice</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; You should wait until you verify a solution before checking answered, because some of us won't look at answered questions because we think they are done.</p>
<p>2. The Personal.xlsb, if you have one, is usually saved in a path such as this:&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\XLStart</p>
<p>even if this isn't identical to your location, <strong>you can search for the XLStart folder</strong>.</p>
<p>3. In 2007 and file containing macros must be saved as an XLSM file (macro enabled) not XLSX.&nbsp; New to 2007.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;When you record a macro you are asked for the macro name at the first step, and you are asked for the location where you want to store them - this workbook, a new workbook or the Personal Macro workbook.&nbsp; In general you choose This Workbook or Personal
 Macro Workbook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like 2003.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;If you store it in the This Workbook you can save it anywhere just link in 2003.&nbsp; If you choose the Personal Macro Workbook you will be prompted to save it when you close out of Excel, say yes.&nbsp; Just like 2003.</p>
<p>6. Macros stored in This Workbook will only be available if that workbook is open - Just like 2003.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. When you open a file containing a macro you will either see the familar Enable/Disable macros dialog box or the security bar (New in 2007).&nbsp; I am assuming security is set low enought to allow macros.&nbsp; If you see the Security bar, you need to click Options,
 and then Enable this feature before the macros will be available.&nbsp; New in 2007.</p>

<p>I'll try again, had to delete my last post it was corrupted somehow.</p>
<p>I'm very new to this forum so may be missing something blindingly obvious.</p>
<p>We have a question from 'TommyRandom' and a propsed answer from a moderator 'Girish Mumar Somasundaran'</p>
<p>With no response from the OP, another moderator 'Dilip Kumar Chinthala' has marked this proposed answer as correct.</p>
<p>Is it the intention of moderators to do this for all questions becuase there's a lot of them out there that the OP hasn't responded to and/or marked as the correct answer or is this just something mod's do for each other and if so why?</p>

<p>Shane,</p>
<p>Your irritation was obviously greater than mine you beat me to the post.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;When you record a macro you are asked for the macro name at the first step, and you are asked for the location where you want to store them - this workbook, a new workbook or the Personal Macro workbook.&nbsp; In general you choose This Workbook or Personal
 Macro Workbook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like 2003.</p>
<p>I never went into the merits of this 'correct answer' but now you have I'll throw in my view. By default when you record a macro it is stored in 'This Workbook', you aren't asked per se, you would have to change that to personal.xlsb and I think the OP would
 remember doing that!!</p>

<p>Who said about anything like that happening?&nbsp; Mike wrote that&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>he</em></span>&nbsp;"had to delete my last post it was corrupted somehow".</p>
<p>No description of the corruption.&nbsp; No explanation of exactly what user interface Mike used, the GUI or some newsreader that relies on the NNTP bridge.</p>
<p>But Mike himself suggested that the "corruption" might have been his fault because he's "very new to this forum so may be missing something blindingly obvious".</p>
<p>So it seems presumptuous to assume Mike's problems were due "those kind of bugs" that someone (MS?) needs to correct.</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; I do encounter "oddities" when I post using the GUI.&nbsp; But my first assumption is that the problem is with my browser, not necessarily the GUI itself.&nbsp; Frankly, I do not really know.&nbsp; But it is at least a possibility, a very common problem.</p>
<p>Anyway, in deference to that, I have gotten in the habit of going back to the top web page and reviewing my postings, looking for "corruptions" (unexpected appearance).</p>
<p>PPS:&nbsp; I really object to those people who complained that some of your posting were motivated by a selfish interest in bumping your points.</p>
<p>First, in those specific cases, it was clear to me that your motives were valid, even if I did not agree with your suggestions.</p>
<p>And second, consider this series of postings.&nbsp; They have no value vis-a-vis solving the OP's problem; but I think they are in the spirit of "community", which some MVPs have suggested MS tries to encourage with these forums.</p>
<p>In any case, we certainly need to be able to communicate among ourselves in this way, even if it is not related to the problem.</p>
<p>Arguably, the fact that that adds to our points is unfortunate.&nbsp; But then again, perhaps it simply diminishes the significance of the points, ergo the medallions by a person's name.</p>
<p>IMHO, it should not discourage us from submitting "insignifcant" postings like these unapologetically.</p>

<p>I concur.&nbsp; Normally, only the OP has the ability to "mark as answer"; and I think that is the way it should be.&nbsp; (The rest of us can only "prospose as answer".)&nbsp; I do believe moderators need that capability as well in order to "close" forgotten threads where
 a viable answer was indeed submitted.&nbsp; However, I think moderators should wait a reasonable period of time (perhaps a week or two) before exercise that authority.</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; IMHO, these kinds of discussions belong in another forum, perhaps the "Answers Site Feedback".&nbsp; They might be more constructive there, if these comments have any value at all.</p>
<p>(That is not to diminish the value of the comment.&nbsp; Instead, it reflects my opinion, honed over many years, that MS is oblivious to most such constructive comments.)</p>

            Where are you writing the macros?<br />
<br />
In a general module in the active workbook?<br />
<br />
They should be in that workbook after saving it.<br />
<br />
Have you saved as a macro-enabled workbook(*.xlsm)?<br />

    <title>&#34;An unexpected error has occurred&#34; when using Web Back&#47;Fwd - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewridzon  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;An unexpected error has occurred&#34; when using Web Back&#47;Fwd buttons</h2>
                    <p>Just in the last few months, my Word 2007 <em>[(12.0.6661.5000) SP2 MSO (12.0.6562.5003)]</em> started acting up when I use hyperlinks within Word documents.&nbsp; I've successfully used hyperlinks for years in Word 2007 as well as Word 2003;&nbsp;this has just started.&nbsp;
 When I use Ctrl-Click to go to another location within the document, subsequently clicking the Web-Back button in my Quick Access toolbar produces&nbsp;an annoying but harmless pop-up&nbsp;stating "An Unexpected Error Has Occurred."&nbsp; Using the keyboard shortcut, Alt-Left
 arrow, produces the same problem.&nbsp; The Web-Fwd button (or Alt-Right arrow) produces the same error message.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>30 seconds on Google indicates many are experiencing the same problem and it's just started in the last few months.&nbsp; I am on a WinXP Pro SP3 machine.&nbsp; I've tried several of the suggestions found on Google to no avail.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>I've tried starting Word&nbsp;in Safe Mode (to test error message, I had to use keyboard shortcuts Alt-Left/Right arrow since Quick Access toolbar is unavailable in Safe Mode); the error message still occurs.&nbsp;
</li><li>Error&nbsp;occurs in .doc and .docx documents.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>Deleting/recreating the hyperlinks doesn't fix it.&nbsp; </li><li>I tried registering the Hlinkprx.dll&nbsp;by typing <span>RegSvr32 Hlinkprx.dll in the Run command window.&nbsp; When I tried that, Windows popped up a message stating, "LoadLibrary("Hlinkprx.dll") failed - The specified module could not be found."&nbsp; Error still occurs
 in Word.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>I have no other versions (newer or older) of Word on my machine.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>My corporate IT dept issues the Microsoft updates every so often to our machines.&nbsp; I can't say for sure, what update caused this to start&nbsp;occurring.&nbsp; But on Google, it seems widespread as if MS issued an update in the last few months, that had a glitch
 in it.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone have a solution to this?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

the lower curve of the "e" is scraggy. I have that problem e. g. with Word/PowerPoint 2010 and can see the problem when I view the font in the Font Control Panel. Only size 18 is affected. Any hints?<br />

            <p>I see the problem you describe, but it's strictly a display rendering effect. Here are screen shots of the same 18 pt character at three different zoom settings:</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a392a919-a11b-47cf-89d0-7c40778aa387" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The character also prints correctly on paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set your zoom to 110% or 120% for editing in Word. If you need to use the character in a PowerPoint slide show, try changing the size of the text to 18.5 pt.</p>
