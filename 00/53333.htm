<h2>            My Speakers won&#39;t work with Windows 7</h2>
                    My speaker won't work with windows 7. It detects my speakers when i click on the speaker/sound symbol on the taskbar but when i check it, it says no devices are detected. I also checked if the speakers are open and they are but they still don't work. My
 speakers are Labtec Multimedia Speakers.

            Hi <strong>jENNiEEE</strong> ,<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Thanks for posting on Microsoft Answers!</strong> <br />
<br />
Let's try the following methods and verify if it resolves the issue:<br />
<strong>Method 1: Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting Services for No Sound in windows 7</strong>
<br />
Lets try Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting Services for No Sound in windows 7, Visit the link below and click on green button that says "Run Now" and follow the instructions appears on the screen.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/no_sound" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gp/no_sound</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2: To update your Audio driver in device manager:&nbsp; </strong><br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, and then click Control Panel<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click System and Maintenance<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath Device Manager, click View hardware and devices<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Sound, video and game controllers<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click your Audio controller, and click Properties<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the Driver tab<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Update Driver button.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Search automatically for updated driver software<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows will now search for an update for your Audio drivers locally and on the internet, then walk you through the process of installing the driver.&nbsp; If it is unable to find a driver you can go to your Sound Card manufacturer’s website and download any updated
 drivers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To find the manufacturer and model of your Sound Card:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, and then click Control Panel<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click System and Maintenance<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath Device Manager, click View hardware and devices<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Sound, video and game controllers<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Under Sound, video and game controllers you will see the manufacturer and model of your sound card.&nbsp; If you need help finding the driver, please provide this information to us and we can try to find it for you.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: Show Disabled devices and Set speaker as default</strong> <br />
Perform the task mentioned below to set speaker as default:<br />
1. Go to Start and click on control Panel.<br />
2. Click in Sound, then a new window will open up.<br />
3. In the new windows click on the tab"Playback" and right click in the window and click on Show Disabled devices.<br />
4. Now check if Speaker is listed there and right click on it and choose enable.<br />
5. Highlight that speaker and click on "Set as Default"<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4. Try compatibility mode of Windows Vista:</strong> <br />
If it does not work on your issue, I'd suggest you installing the Vista driver in Compatibility mode.<br />
Follow the steps below to install this software in Windows VISTA SP1 Compatibility mode:<br />
1. Right click on the setup file.<br />
2. Go to properties.<br />
3. Click on Compatibility mode.<br />
4. Place a check mark the box&nbsp; in the box in front of&nbsp; “Run this program in compatibility mode for” and from the drop down menu choose Windows Vista SP1.<br />
5. Place a check mark on "Run as an Administrator" under privileges level and click on Apply and then Ok.<br />
5. Now double click on the setup file to initiate the install.<br />
You can find more information about compatibility modes in the articles below:<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-program-compatibility<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Meanwhile, please understand that Windows 7 is a new operating system and whole driver store has been reprogrammed; you might wait or push the device manufacturer to upgrade its driver. You can contact the Labtec support on thatThanks for your time and understanding!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.

    <title>Games crash out to desktop and my keyboard function keys are activated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameslease  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games crash out to desktop and my keyboard function keys are activated randomly</h2>
                    So everytime i play any game i usually play pubg, i get in a game and it starts up but i notice the sound skips on and off in game and this usually then leads to a crash and it takes me back to the desktop. From here i cant do anything because my keyboard
 is acting like the function keys are activated or something. Its very strange. I cant type anything because the one letter opens up the windows home and another letter opens notifications and another letter opens narrator and so on. I also want to point out
 that my sound and mic act strange also because my teamates cant here me when i talk and sometimes i cant here them. And the sound of the game differs from time to time as if its not loading the correct sound properly. It changes from high to low able to unable
 to here me talking etc...The mouse is still functioning properly but the keyboard acts up with all these functions and i cant type or open up any games after it happens so im forced to restart my pc and see if it happens again

</p><p>Hi James, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be few reasons why your experiencing multiple concerns in your Windows 10 computer. In order to isolate the issue, kindly answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your computer up-to-date? If not, you may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>link</em></a>.</li><li>Have you made any recent changes to your computer prior to getting these issues?
</li><li>Aside from disabling the sticky keys, what other troubleshooting steps have you done?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>
<p>

            Yes my computer is up to date and the only recent change i can think of is getting a new monitor and running it through an hdmi cable instead of display port. And for the troubleshooting i havent found any other solution to fix this specific problem besides
 disabling sticky keys so thats all i have done. Ive used the windows scan to detect any viruses but nothing pops up. Idk what else to do. Im hoping its my keyboard and not my pc or windows 10 but i dont know how to find out.

<h2>            I&#39;ve lost the ability to connect to wireless networks.</h2>
                    <p>So earlier today my laptop had malfunction and I was stuck in a constant loop of repair and restart. So I when I went into the repair mode, I selected the advanced setting and did a factory reset or something along those lines. When the computer booted up,
 it worked by all my files were deleted, of course. Now the strange thing is that when I went to go connect myself to the internet, it wouldn't allow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See my computer has this small switch thing that allows it to go from wireless to not wireless, but now it doesn't work. The only way I'm able to get internet is by connecting it to my router and using an ethernet cable. Has any one else experience this
 problem?</p>

<p>We don't know what you might have done by your "factory reset or something along those lines."&nbsp; Normally, restoring to factory settings should get your computer to the state it was in when you first bought it -- and everything should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, however, it sounds as if the driver for your wireless adapter and/or the manufacturer's software that enables the laptops special switches and keys to work were not installed.</p>
<p>

<div>I cannot connect to the internet.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have tried a system restore but nothing happens.</div>
<div>This is a link showing what happens when I troubleshoot the problem and also when i open device manager ( look at the network adapters, they all have yellow triangles )</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also ran the Dell Diagnostics, and error Msg: error code 2000-0142 appeared.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Troubleshoot error was 0x08007000E</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would try up update the network adapters but to do that, i have to be connected to the internet. Is there anything that I could do apart from an operating system reinstallation? Would that even help? Thanks</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think you have to download the network drivers on another computer and save it to the flash disk, then put the flash drive with the drivers into the Dell computer and reinstall the drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use a external HDD on USB, or writeable CD (DVD), but I think flash disk (thumb drive) is the best. If you write here the model number of your computer DELL, we can write here the link, from where you can download the latest drivers</p>

<p>There's the True Greatsword Of Artorias and the Cursed Greatsword Of Artorias.</p>
<p>One's with any greatsword and a whole bunch of other swords +10 the other is with a Broken Straight Sword +10 (dropped by ghouls). They're both named "Greatsword Of Artorias" in-game and can only identified by looks and stats.</p>
<p>It's enough when you possess them, whether in you inventory or your bottomless box.</p>

<p>The non-cursed version of the sword has, potentially, the highest damage rating in the game. &nbsp;But the catch is, that damage isn't fully realized until you are at an extremely high level (200+). &nbsp;The weapon scales with C C B and B in all your main stats.
 &nbsp;Might be fun for the regular game, but some of the attacks seem way to slow for PvP.</p>

<h2>            Sharing WiFi between Win 10 host computer and Hyper-V hosted Windows 10 VM AND connecting to Windows VPN from Host computer</h2>
                    I have a Dell XPS 15 Win 10 Laptop on which I've activated Hyper-V and hosted a Win 10 Virtual Machine.&nbsp; Originally the host machine had a working connection to a work-based Windows based Virtual Private Network that worked perfectly.&nbsp; However, upon setting
 up the Hyper-V hosted VM, I found that I had to share the WiFi connection between the host and the VM using a virtual switch adaptor that is "bridged" to the Host's WiFi if I wanted to&nbsp; share folders between the two machines.&nbsp; This had the added benefit of
 allowing the VM to access the internet.&nbsp; But alas, as soon as that "bridged" sharing is established, the host machine can no longer connect to the Virtual Private Network! &nbsp; How can I share folders between the host &amp; VM without bridging, or how can I continue
 to connect to the VPN in the presence of virtual adapter bridging?&nbsp; I've worked on this issue off and on for months without finding a solution.&nbsp; Thanks to anyone who can provide a so

            Hi Christopher.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options - to run System Restore to a point before the problem began.
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  This link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br /> 
<br />5) You can also run the PC's Factory Recovery from it's hotkey at boot, following the procedure for that model found in it's Manual on it's Support Downloads webpage, or by asking Google how to Factory Recover the exact make and model.  
<br />
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I had same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what worked for me:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install , with a clean install in the partition the software chose by default. I tried everything else first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some ,not all, of the user data was retained in a folder named Windows.old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was fortunate to have a backup on an external hard disk (Western Digital Passport w backup software WD Security and WD SmartWare).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it was very frustrating. I spent most of yesterday and today getting the OS, the data, and the applications (Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Chrome, Avast) reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have little good to say about Microsoft this evening, though the customer service agent Senorita Ivania in Managua helped cheerfully and efficiently to get Microsoft Office installed and working for me.</p>

            <p>Nothing happens when I try to play the games because I have no access to them, they will not load at all. It seems to apply to all the Xbox casual games products on my computer. It is as if the server has disappeared. I tried deleting one of them to reload
 it, but it would not reload at all. All my casual games are the same, but <strong>
nothing else </strong>is affected.&nbsp; If I click on Sudoku on the start menu I get an immediate blue-grey&nbsp;screen with " Microsoft Sudoku " on it, and it stays like that. Solitaire collection is similar, but stays on "Loading" with the rotating circle of dots.</p>
<p>It has been like this for three days.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in automatic repair loop....have a cracked screen on computer, but won&#39;t project onto TV</h2>
                    I have upgraded to windows 10 a long time ago, when it was free. &nbsp;The real problem is I have a cracked screen on my laptop, an HP, I have been projecting it onto the TV. &nbsp;Unexpectedly, my computer shut down and now it is stuck in automatic repair loop,
 only know that as I can see a little bit of the cracked screen. &nbsp;I have tried everything with my HDMI cables to switch them out and used two TVs to no avail. &nbsp;What say you? &nbsp;I don't want to have to repair the cracked screen on my laptop, I preferred being
 able to see my computer on the TV. &nbsp;There is only the HDMI plug in in my computer or the USB connections. &nbsp;Where to go from here? &nbsp;I have saved many things I can't get to on that laptop now.

</p><p>To answer your query, you need to press certain keys to project the display to your Television (depends on the Manufacturer). For your case, you need to contact HP's support so they can walk you through on what keys to press.</p>

<p>...you may check if you are able to boot in safe mode. To boot in safe mode first remove the Windows 7 DVD from the drive and press F8 key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Check if you are able to boot to the desktop now. If you are able to boot to the desktop without any error message, go to device manager and disable the display adapters and check if you are able to boot into normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get an error message saying that ‘installation cannot be completed in safe mode’, then press Shift+F10 key. That will open Command Prompt, from command prompt open Device Manager by typing ‘devmgmt.msc’ in the command prompt and then disable the display
 adapters and check if you are able to boot in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If this allows you to boot to the normal mode and complete the installation process then go ahead and first update the display adapter drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if the computer works fine.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 with Docking Station and External Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sp3customer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 with Docking Station and External Monitor</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3/Docking Station/External monitor connected via display port/VGA adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a month of BSOD's on startup after shutdowns, stuck on "SURFACE" login screens, and failed assistance from Support I am reaching out here for assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that when you "Shutdown" the system and try to restart the system it will "hang" on the "Surface" screen.&nbsp; A few reboots later you can usually bring the system back to life, but what a pain.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible workaround provided by support was to connect the display port/VGA adapter directly to the Surface.&nbsp; This appears to be a workaround.&nbsp; But, what is the purpose of a docking station if you have to avoid using a port?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second workaround is to boot the machine undocked and immediately dock it.&nbsp; It is a little more convenient, but still should not be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to use the Surface Pro 3/Docking Station/External monitor connected via display port/VGA adapter as intended.&nbsp; You should be able to "shutdown" and power up without using a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

                    I have kept a Skype dualphone rtx and bought a phone number to use as a house phone for the past 3 years. Suddenly this handy handset &nbsp;is unsupported, and junk. I need to know what is out there and recommended (I am getting contradictory information) to
 replace my "landline" replacement. Its important that I have a phone available to the children, guests, and babysitters, etc. Thanks!

<p>Hello&nbsp;ar9801,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the importance for you to use our services. However, since we no longer support Skype phones, I'm afraid we cannot advise you what VoIP handset you can use to continue using Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have Skype number, you can use it on other supported platforms and continue using Skype. For more information about the supported devices, please visit this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34763/which-skype-enabled-devices-or-platforms-are-no-longer-supported?q=unsupported+device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps but if you have questions and clarifications, please do not hesitate to reply back.</p>

<h2>            Missing .dll file on start up</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7. At some point some type of third party software was installed or uninstalled on my computer and now at start up I get the following error message:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"There was a problem starting C:\ProgramData\getmPING.dll The specified module could not be found."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It does not seem to impact my computer in anyway, but the fact I cannot get this off the system is very annoying. I have tried looking in the System registry, running system scan at the command line prompt, and Microsoft Fixit, but it's still there. Any
 clues on ridding my system of this ghost .dll file would be helpful.</div>

            <p>Yes, you will probably want to delete you old version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process to do this is a bit tricky. You'll need to open up your primary hard drive in the File Explorer, then gain control of Windows.old folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, right-click the folder and follow along with the following pictures.</p>

<p>Yes, you will probably want to delete you old version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process to do this is a bit tricky. You'll need to open up your primary hard drive in the File Explorer, then gain control of Windows.old folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, right-click the folder and follow along with the following pictures.</p>

            <p>You should be able to do this without going into permission changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets start.</p>
<p>Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + R then type: <strong>cleanmgr.exe</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6b24475-5e8a-4784-9f24-b1a18129de18" /></p>
<p>Then hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7/Vista/XP &gt; Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup</p>
<p>Windows 8/8.1/10 &gt; Windows key + S &gt; type disk cleanup &gt; hit Enter on your keyboard</p>
<p>Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c79b9cd1-556b-474c-bc2d-d271e7bbadb3" /></p>
<p>Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.</p>
<p>Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce8a44f2-6dce-4be4-9de7-7304f34c649d" /></p>
<p>Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called
<strong>Windows.old. </strong>Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb7ae70a-7d11-4d28-a26a-262385f417e3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the&nbsp;window called
<strong>Clean up system files. </strong>Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup
 your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 7 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you
 check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.</p>

<h2>            Removing a Xbox account from a parent email.</h2>
                    I am desperate to remove my 24 year old son's Xbox account from my email account,&nbsp;<strong>without</strong> losing any of his (game status) and
<strong>without</strong> having to change my well established email account. &nbsp; Is that even possible and why is this so impossible to do? &nbsp; Would appreciate the help. &nbsp; Thank you

<p>Hello Rhonda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. Unfortunately, there is no way to transfer an Xbox account to a different Microsoft account. Once that Xbox account is created, it is tied to that Microsoft account for good.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one scenario where you may be able to get the outcome you are looking for. Both of these need to be correct :
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You do not use this Microsoft account for anything else, including signing into windows.</p>
<p>2. Your well established email is not a Microsoft domain (Outlook, Hotmail, Live, MSN)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the case for you?</p>

 sounds like I'm <strong>[Mod Removed: Profanity]</strong>. I can't imagine that I am the only adult that would like to remove their adult child's Xbox account. &nbsp; My son has been having problems with his account and it asks him change the password, my password.
 &nbsp; This has happened three times in the last week. &nbsp; I did have a Hotmail email, but the tech that was helping my son did not explain to him that it would delete my account to fix his. &nbsp; I did have a lady from Microsoft call (should have gotten her name &amp; number)
 a week later. &nbsp; She did tell me that it would be possible to recover my Hotmail, I had already sent out my new email to most of my contacts. &nbsp; Looks like I either go through the hassle of changing my email or I deal with this for the rest of my life. &nbsp; Is
 there any chance that this could be brought up to someone that could change this problem? &nbsp; I would appreciate very much if this could be looked at.</p>

            <div><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Is the issue confined to Cleopatra ll?<br />
3. Did you try installing the game in Windows Vista or XP compatibility mode?<br />
4. What is the source of the game installation (CD/DVD or a downloaded file)?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1:</b><br />
Try right-clicking on the actual Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option and check if the game starts.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2:</b><br />
Perform a clean boot and then check if you are able to start the game.<br />

<br />
<strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><br />

            <p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the suggested POST, re: Van Suhton. It did not work for me. First there was/os NO windows Explorer evident or apparent in the listed Tab. The Security tab, would not let me change anything related to the *.OLD folder, and elimination of Inherent
 Permissions did nothing to make it happen. At conclusion of this exercise, the folder remains INACCESABLE. Have had this issue in past when "Upgrades" were installed, and it took a REFORMAT of the HDD to clear it. FYI&gt; the folder can be moved, sent to another
 drive, and that discovery was used in subsequent issues of this nature. At one point, a few years past, I contacted Microsoft Tech and let the "expert" attempt to fix this. It did not work, and after about an hour of efforts and considerable manipulations
 of various settings, it was abandoned with apologies that she could not find a solution. That was under W-7 Pro, which, inspite of some issues, I found to be HIGHLY reliable and preferable to W-10 Pro. I specifically indicated in options that I did NOT want
 W-10 on this rig, but it decided my wishes did not matter, and so installed itself anyway.&nbsp; TO reiterate&gt; Transfer the *OLD folder to an external HDD, or perhaps a SD card, and then format it. End of issue. Thanks for the reply, and perhaps ms Suhton could
 review the steps to see if I forgot something in the process. I searched FOR Windows Explorer until my eyes bled, but could not find it. A SEARCH was launched and NOT FOUND was the result.</p>
<p>FIFTY years working with computers and still have not figured out how to OWN files that should be MINE to start with. DUH? THANKS for your efforts and reply.</p>

            This method does not work. Click on SEARCH, it goes away. NADA. Tried the VaNESSA solution again, for the fifth time, and it still does not work. Perhaps, I have missed something. I click on Start&lt; then Search, and it goes away. Nothing further.

            <p>IT did NOT work for me. There is NO option to "RUN AS ADMIN". Input gives return to the question. Calling the CMD was successful, and input DEL J:\windows.old resulted in ACESS DENIED, Need ADMIN/Write permissions. WILL NOT let me change permissions. Tried
 and OLD trick to MOVE the file to another Drive, then to format. DID NOT let me do that either. When MS engineer or other certified person tried to remedy this SAME type issue, about three yrs past, she gave up after about an hour of remote control. I had
 to format the HDD to get rid of the junk. My butch is that as OWNER and ADMIN of my OWN rig, I should have ability to do WHATEVER with files. MS in its collective arrogance, has apparently decided we Great Unwashed do not know what is best for us, so they
 usurp the authority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the effort. Will respond WHEN I get a technic that works. FIFTY years of working with and ON computers has come to naught.</p>

            <p>Followed instructions through REBOOT/recovery. PART of the PROBLEM is that on REBOOT the system LOCKES up and will not proceed past ten-15 seconds. Have left unit ON all night, over nine hours and it NEVER got off the DIME. MANUAL restart usually fixes the
 HANG, but not always on first try. Grateful for the advice, and it was encouraging, but NO cigar. W-10 has mind of its' own, having RAPED my HDD against my express instructions NOT to install. I do NOT have W-10 software, as it was download. WILL NOT buy this
 crippled codex, but willing to try another methods., and I tried CLEAN BOOT but that did not work either, and can not go back to W-7 pro w/o losing eight months of files. Possible to offload to external drive, then format,&nbsp; but that seems extreme. Did it twice
 to get rid of W-10 last June, but it came back.</p>
<p>Will retry your instructions again. IF it locks/crashes, I will reply again. </p>
<p>Thanks, tis challenge is daunting for forty years of computer skills. Wonder why the idiots who OK'd tis codex did not FIX the glitches before marketing. It is written&gt; "...and haughty spirit before destruction."</p>

 loyal customer and I will continue to do so...While everyone is lining up to get a PS4 this winter,I'll be getting an XBOX ONE...So here I am asking for my seven year watermark on my account,most of my friends have it and I somehow feel left out...I couldn't
 be more open and honest about my situation...I hope someone is able to get this resolved,and I do look forward to continuing with you guys in the near future...</p>

<p>-Sincerely ~Jay~</p>

<p>I never got a letter as to why it happened in the first place nor was I banned or suspended...So maybe it was someone who just didn't like me or felt a certain way...I tend to run into these type of individuals on a regular basis,but I'm not accusing anyone
 for their actions.All I ask is that my gamercard gets the seven year logo on it,I believe it's only fair...Besides,I've had this TAG since GEARS OF WAR 1,and my history for that game runs way back to 2006...</p>

<p>If you have been a gold member for 7 years, Your Tenure will reflect that..... &nbsp;Any account suspensions or bans made by the PET were deserved and NOT just because someone doesn't like you. &nbsp;Maybe official support can take a look at your tenure.... &nbsp; GOOD

<p>I don't mean to sound rude (and I apologize if I do), but what does it matter if your GC shows the 7? Don't play the game for the stats play for the enjoyment :)</p>
<p>P.S. - What does it show now? If it says 6 maybe it'll be 7 later on in the year...?</p>

<p>They gave me the two year symbol instead of the seven,maybe they think I can't tell the difference between a 2 and a 7 Lol...If you do look at my achievements for GEARS OF WAR 1,I have time stamps from 2006...So in all honesty I'm not making this up. I remember
 there was a time when microsoft took it's customers seriously an always put them first,but that seems like a long time ago...I assure you I'm not being ungrateful,which is why I would like to say thanks to the guy who still made an attempt... Have a good one
 fellas,I won't bicker over this any longer,take care...</p>

<p>Only Official Xbox Support will be able to help you out with this. Unfortunately, since you have had an enforcement action taken against you, you may not be able to get it.</p>

<p>Hi there JAYVON! &nbsp;I'm not sure what you mean by enforcement actions, but I just went into your account and tallied myself- two is definitely the accurate Tenure on this account. Tenure is only accrued while the account has a Gold membership. Good news is,
 looks like if you keep that gold membership, it's coming up on three in not too long!</p>

<p><span>Seems like people aren't understanding the request, so I'll try: your old account got banned and you want its Live tenure added to your current account's tenure. If that's what you're asking, the answer is no, you
 won't get that. You can look at the tenure reset as part of the penalty.<br />
<br />
You later say to "check your achievements" but you're hiding your gaming history. That makes it hard to see how long ago you were earning achievements with this gamertag, so maybe I haven't understood, either. But Support staff have said that this gamertag
 has only 2 (nearly 3) years of Xbox Live Gold tenure, so your current number is accurate.</span></p>
