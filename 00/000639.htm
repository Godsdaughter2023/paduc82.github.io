<h2>            Outlook for Mac &#40;office365&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded the Outlook app for my iPhone. &nbsp;I love the app vs the IOS mail app. &nbsp;So I recently decided I needed to upgrade my office products and elected to purchase Office 365 Home. &nbsp;I was really looking forward to using the Outlook program on
 my mac and so I activated Outlook to begin using it as my sole email program on my Mac. &nbsp;BUT...I have found that I can't use the alias email addresses that I set up with my Mac (iCloud) account. &nbsp;This is a credible bummer as I send 95% of all my emails from
 my personal (alias) email address. &nbsp;Is there a way to bring my alias email address address to Outlook??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Bill</p>

            Hi BillIgou ,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Lucia. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting us.
<br />
<br />In Outlook for Mac unfortunately does not show a list of Aliases that you have in your ICloud account but you can, make the following alternative solution.
<br />
<br />Create contacts with the names of your aliases in Outlook, and when creating a new mail message, click on the From option and select Other Email Address
<br />Another window will open where you would search Press From in the list of contact addresses your Aliases to which you have permission to Send As, adding this to the list as the name to show when sending the email.
<br />
<br />Reaching the message to your recipient with the name of the selected alias.
<br />
<br />I wish I had helped you. Let me know any questions
<br />Regards<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98cc7056-6141-4d08-a99e-d19bd35dd4d3?upload=true" />

<p>Hi Lucia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's a great tip, unfortunately, it also doesn't work in Outlook for Mac where you do not have the option to select other from addresses at all (it looks like your captures are from Outlook for Windows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can tell (and remember), there is no way to use any aliases when you send emails out from Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember using the Send Feedback command in the Help menu ages and a half ago to vote on the feature request on Uservoice, but so far, it hasn't been made a priority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would encourage you to vote on it, but so far, the suggestion is only flagged as "under review":</p>

<p>This would work, though all messages are downloaded in each of the configured iCloud accounts</p>

    <title>What happened to my Bing Rewards&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolffecrowe  say:</h3>
<h2>            What happened to my Bing Rewards&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had nearly 500 saved up, was hoping to get an Amazon Gift Card. Today, I noticed that I no longer had the&nbsp;counter when I made searches. I looked at the rewards page and was told that it was not available in my region.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's up with this? I feel like I've been scammed. Bing rewards was the incentive for me to switch, and now I feel like leaving. I've enjoyed the search engine until now, but I worked hard to save reward points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't changed any location data nor my MS account. I've been a loyal customer for years. Please help.</p>

<h2>            Feedback&#58; Windows Defender asks to scan your computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't submit this via the fedback app as I'm on a university network and assume the connection is blocked to allow the feedback app to access the privacy settings needed for it to function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The feedback I had was why can't Windows Defender scan automatically in the background when a scan is needed, why does it need to ask the user to scan?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should only ask the user if it found something like malware or a virus or even better remove the virus in or malware in the background and notify the user a virus or malware was found and it has been removed or if it's critical and needs the users input.</p>

<p>You could always ask the University Admin to fix that problem and then you would be able to use the Feedback Hub.:)</p>

</p><p>What do you think of my feedback or do you recommend I submit it via the feedback app directly?</p>

</p><p>I have the Windows 10 insider build installed on my MacBook Pro via a virtual machine and could submit the feedback via the feedback app via a personal hotspot from my cell phone if the university network blocks it.</p>

            <p>Some times a Microsoft engineer will see things Posted here but it is kind of the luck of the draw kind of thing.</p>
<p>If you use the Feedback Hub things will always be seen by MS but not always worked on.</p>
<p>You can use most of the feedback links built into most of the Apps to give Feedback also like when you have first started the Feedback hub you can click on the Rate your build or Rate your device.</p>

            I resent that Windows Defender DEMANDS that I 'Submit' to Automatic Sample collection in order to turn off a Threat Warning on my computer. &nbsp;Not having Microsoft continually receive information from my computer is NOT a threat; it is an unwanted intrusion

            <p>So, I had the same issue and figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted my PC(work PC) for the first time in weeks and got this message when opening OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe it has to do with the restrictions on my work network/work laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I logged into my onedrive account on the web and browsed to my notebook locations</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I right clicked on the notebook(s) I wanted to open and clicked open in onenote</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; A popup asking me to allow or not allow the program popped up and I clicked allow.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure this is where the issue was.&nbsp; So once I allowed onenote on my pc to allow access to the onenote notebook file online it worked.

            <p>Hello Megan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Communities.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you will have to deactivate the old installation of Office 365 before reinstalling it on your computer. This is also necessary since you have changed the name of your computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try deactivating Office 365 and reinstalling it and let us know if you need further assistance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook &#40;2013&#41; has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>My company purchased Office 365 last Tuesday and after a few hiccups, on Thursday we managed to&nbsp;get on.&nbsp;I can use the internet version of outlook fine but when I try and use the PC version it won't work .I upgraded my outlook to 2013 yesterday and spent
 all day trying to get it to sync, which it seems to have now done, but.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the program a message comes up saying.... </p>
<p>Your mailbox has been temporarily moved on Microsoft Exchange server. A temporary mailbox exists, but might not have all of your previous data.</p>
<p>You can connect to the temporary mailbox or work offline with all of your old data. If you choose to work with your old data, you cannot send or receive email messages</p>
<p>If I click on Cancel, it obviously closes the program</p>
<p>If I click on Use Old Data, it states... Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. The attempt to log on to Microsoft Exchange failed</p>
<p>If I click on Use Temporary Mailbox, it will go into it for a second with a yellow box at the top stating UPGRADE IN PROGRESS Your mailbox is currently being optimized. Performance may be affected while this one time optimization is in progress.</p>
<p>Then it instantly switches to a box that states... Microsoft Outlook has stopped working, windows is checking for a solution to the problem.....</p>
<p>Then goes to another box that states... Microsoft Outlook has stopped working, Aproblem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.</p>
<p>It then closes the program with no solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up to last week I&nbsp;used Outlook 2007, I wondered if I should delete this program but I can't find it on the uninstall list.

            <p>Are they also using Exchange Online?</p>
<p>If so, ask if your mailbox has been migrated already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you are still connecting to your on-premises Exchange server instead of the Exchange Online one. This could indicate&nbsp;various server-level&nbsp;configuration issues such as with DNS or AutoDiscover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If everything has been set up correctly, then recreating your mail profile should connect you to the correct server. You can do this via the Mail applet in Control Panel.</p>

<p>Windows 10 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 10 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 10 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 10 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if
 you decide to move to Windows 10 64 bit in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recommendation, if you have a 32 bit version of Windows, use 32 bit Windows 10, if you have 64 bit, use 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider dual booting:</p>

This might serve what you want... Sending automated vacation replies</p>
<p>Open outlook.com &gt; top right, next to your name, click the Gear icon &gt; More Mail Settings &gt; under Manage your account, click Sending automated vacation replies &gt; ( see if you want to use this method.) if you do, click Save when done.</p>

<p>Actually a large driverstore is probably due to a different issue from what Tushar describes. There was a bug in how drivers were getting added to the store from Windows Update, but that should be in 10074.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you look in the driverstore\filerepository, find the directories that start with "hdx" and tell me what date they were created?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, try running Disk Cleanup, select Clean Up System Files and have it delete Device Driver Packages. Let me know if that helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem as the OP, my store is 33.6 GB and I have run System Cleanup which has made no difference. I am running build 10074 and have just upgraded from previous builds. Is there a way to get Sytem Cleanup to recognise this large folder as
 currently it says Driver Packages 0KB?</p>

<p>This is weird... Disk Cleanup should be catching this. However...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm more worried about the fact that we're again seeing huge driverstore directories. We fixed that a while ago, but I'm seeing it on my desktop as well to it seems the bug is back.</p>

<p>The short version is that running Disk Cleanup and clicking "Clean up system files" gives you the opportunity to clean this up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The long version is as follows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>These extra driver packages were installed in the driverstore because of a problem in how we were handling the installation. We fixed this problem a while ago for drivers installed via Windows Update. However there is another path for driver installation
 called Dynamic Update, which is sort of like Windows Update that runs during the Setup process. It turns out that the problem existed in that code as well, so we had to fix that separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So going forward we shouldn't see this anymore, and sorry for missing the second codepath when we fixed it the first time. :-)</p>

<p><span>I have my phone to sync with the work Exchange server for my email, calendar and contacts. I also sync<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>I have my home PC setup to sync with my phone, except email, hoping to keep everything up to date.</span></p>
<p><span>The sync at work has no issues. However, when I try to sync at home, I am receiving the support code 0x80070103 for both Microsoft Exchange and Home PC with
 the following message “Exchange ActiveSync has encountered an error. If this condition persists, please contact your Exchange Administrator.” (Work PC displays the last sync while connected at work).</span></p>

            I'm having the same issue.&nbsp; I also sync my phone with Exchange at work (wirelessly) and with Outlook at home (via USB).&nbsp; I also get the
<span>0x80070103 error when syncing at home and have no issues&nbsp;syncing&nbsp;with Exchange.&nbsp; Usually, if I keep trying to sync my phone by plugging and unplugging it&nbsp;the error doesn't go away, but suprisingly the items
 seem to sync.&nbsp; I have tried recreating the partnership several times and the problem goes away for a sync or two, but eventually returns.&nbsp; When searching for answers online I came across this article
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/952032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/952032</a>&nbsp;and it talks about getting an&nbsp;"<span>error 0x80070103 when you use the Windows Update or Microsoft Update Web sites to install updates".
</span><span>Out of curiosity I looked at&nbsp;Windows Update on my phone, which is set to automatically download updates, and saw the same error code.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what to make of it, but there's definetly a problem.&nbsp; My specs:<br />
<br />
Phone: Verizon HTC Touch Pro with Windows Mobile 6.1 Pro<br />
PC: Windows 7 Ultimate with Office 2007<br />

<p>Greetings RonEMc and THamlin,<br />
<br />
Please clarify how you are able to sync when not at home.&nbsp;&nbsp; THamlin says "wirelessly", but I am unclear if this is via a Cellular DataPlan on your phone, or via WiFi at work.<br />
<br />
If it's WiFi at work, then the problem that you are having is likely due to the Exchange server address listed in your configuration being done via your Intranet (aka a "non-routeable" IP address, which is only good within your organization).&nbsp; If you spoke
 with your Exchange Admin, you should be able to obtain the Internet version of the address, which is "routeable" from anywhere on the internet.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps!<br />

            Hi,
<div>If i understand you correctly, you sync your Windows Phone with Exchange directly and sync with your PC at work and cannot sync at home.</div>
<div>This is a known limitation of Exchange sync. &nbsp;When the Windows Phone synchronizes with Exchange, you can only sync with one other PC. In this case it is the work PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, with Windows Mobile Device Center and ActiveSync 4.5 , the Windows Phone cannot use the internet while connected via the USB cable by default. &nbsp;You have to enable the phone to connect to the internet on the phone in the connection settings.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<p>I just discovered that this was very similar to my problem.&nbsp; HTC Imagio, syncing via USB cable to my laptop and Outlook 2010 (everything but emails).&nbsp; No Exchange server is configured on my phone, however (we're&nbsp;a Lotus shop for the moment).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noted that some of my events in Outlook wouldn't sync to my device, and thus wouldn't transfer into my Notes client.&nbsp;&nbsp;I deleted the first event I noted wasn't synching (it was a recurring event I had originally created as an Outlook appointment), copied
 it again from my Windows Live calendar back into my Outlook calendar, and it successfully sync'ed back to my phone.&nbsp; The event was then successfully uploaded to my Notes calendar as well.</p>
<p>I would suggest if you are getting the error code above, look for items that aren't syncing, and recreate them.&nbsp; I originally tried to just just part of the subject line or a note in the event, and that did not work.&nbsp; I had to completely delete it and copy
 it back in/recreate it.</p>

<p>Hi Pranali,</p>
<p>Thank you for raising this issue to us.<br />
Regarding your concern, You are asking about the ways on how to create an Event in Yammer. Unfortunately, Yammer does not have that feature to create and to post an event any longer.</p>
<p>I suggest to just use other Yammer features. One of those features that you can use is through posting an Announcement in Yammer, and the other option that you can use is through creating a group where you can post the information that you wanted your users
 to know on that event.</p>
<p>We do apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Kris<br />

            Hi Eric,
<br />
<br />I would use a little VBA behind a command button or some other event. All you might need is something like:
<br />
<br />Me.[txtLastNameSearch] = Null
<br />
<br />If you have many controls to set to null you could set all of the controls Tag property to "Search" and then use code like:
<br />
<br />Dim ctl As Control
<br />For Each ctl in Me.Controls
<br />    If ctl.Tag = "Search" Then
<br />        ctl.Value = Null
<br />    End If
<br />Next       
        </p>

<p>Hi Duane</p>
<p>Thanks for reply. As I have only one control I use your single line code suggestion but it did not clear the form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My database has names and addresses and some other information in two tables. I have created two queries which give back the information requested.&nbsp; I have then created two search forms. When searched both queries return the correct results.&nbsp; Everything
 fine so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report appears on screen and there is no requirement to save it.&nbsp; I&nbsp; X out of the report and back to the form when finished.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to enter the next search I wish to clear the control by way of a button on the form and there lies my issue.</p>
<p>I have received other suggestions from the community but none have worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My knowledge of Access 2016 is not great and maybe I am making some mistake that I am not aware of.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just need to solve this problem so that my database is complete.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>You'll find an example in DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the section on<em> 'retrieving data from the database' </em>
includes a form in which two methods of restricting a report's output are illustrated, one by means of a multi-select list box, the other by means of two controls, either or both of which can be used to restrict the report's results.&nbsp; In the latter a 'Clear
 Selections' button does what you are aiming at by means of code in the button's Click event procedure, which sets each control to Null.

            As Duane says the control should be unbound, i.e. have an empty ControlSource property.&nbsp; As only one control is involved only one line of code is needed in the button's Click event procedure:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Me.[Last Name] = Null<br />
<br />
Where Last Name is the Name property of the control.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are unfamiliar with entering code into a form's, report's, report section's&nbsp; or control's event procedures, this is how it's done in form or report design view:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Select the form, report, section or control as appropriate and open its properties sheet if it's not already open.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Select the relevant event property and select the 'build' button (the one on the right with 3 dots).<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Select Code Builder in the dialogue and click OK.&nbsp; This step won't be necessary if you've set up Access to use event procedures by default.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; The VBA editor window will open at the event procedure with the first and last lines already in place.&nbsp; Enter or paste in the code as new line(s) between these.<br />

<p>Duane/Ken</p>
<p>Again Guys thanks for all your input.</p>
<p>I have checked the control Source property and it is clear and it says its unbounded.</p>
<p>Ken the instructions for entering code were great and it helped me check that I was doing it correctly.</p>
<p>The name of the field that I am searching is Last Name and a last name has been entered in the unbounded box on my form.&nbsp; A button opens a report which is returning the correct result.&nbsp; I X out of the report and then proceed to enter next search.</p>
<p>I have a command button which has the following code in the event procedure</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Private Sub Command17_Click()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Me.[Last Name] = Null<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;End Sub</p>
<p>the button does not clear the unbound box.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happens.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can go into the box and delete the info out but i do not want my users to do this.</p>
<p>Sorry guys but I am still stuck!</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>I would add a break point to the code or maybe a msgbox to make sure it's being run. You can find some generic trouble-shooting tips on

</p><p><span>The <strong>Change when the computer sleeps </strong>(sleep timeout) setting is in Power Options (right-click on the Start button &gt; Control Panel &gt; Power Options)
</span><span>You can just set the sleep timeout </span><span>to an interval that’s a little greater than the expected time for the Full Scan – and then,
</span><span>if you want your PC to continue to be an energy-saving device, you can
</span><span>set it back to the default when the scan is done. Anyone interested in automating the power configuration changes&nbsp;required for an (eco-friendly) unattended Full Scan can refer to the following thread. The ideal “set it and forget it” solution for
 the power management issue is setting up your own scheduled task:</span></p>

    <title>Problem&#58; Wifi-connection toggles off&#47;on&#47;off&#47;on every - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarasotaslim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem&#58; Wifi-connection toggles off&#47;on&#47;off&#47;on every few minutes, under Windows Preview &#40;build 9841&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I bought this new laptop 3 or 4 months ago...came pre-installed with WIndows 8.1.</p>
<p>[ My previous laptop had Windows-7, which I really LOVE, but Windows 8.1 is still as bad as I feared. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Long story short, I disliked 8.1 so much after a month or two, that when I heard of WIndows-10 (aka this</p>
<p>Technical Preview, I finally bit the bullet and installed that, about 2 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything has been fine for about a month, so I thought I was home free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, suddenly a day or so ago, my wifi-connection became flacky...unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exact symptoms are VERY STRANGE: The network-icon for wifi on task bar still most of time indicates that</p>
<p>nothing is wrong...hovering the mouse shows connection is fine, and clicking it brings up a panel on the right,</p>
<p>where my home-wifi signal's name ("Chloe-11") shows that I'm 'connected' to it. &nbsp;But, brower tabs all die off, etc,</p>
<p>so that's my first clue that something isn't right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I go to 'cmd-line' window and do a ping, such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp; ping www.google.com</p>
<p>and that has always worked flawlessly...get 4 responses. &nbsp;But as of yesterday, nope!</p>
<p>pings all started failing, but intermittently! &nbsp;Arg! &nbsp;Wifi solid for a few minutes, then</p>
<p>gone...pings fail again. &nbsp;A few minutes later, the wifi connection starts working again, then</p>
<p>a minute or so later, gone again. &nbsp;ARGHHHH ! ! !</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Yet all other computers in my household that are on wifi are FINE! Even my Android tablet,</p>
<p>sitting next to this laptop, has a rock-solid wifi connection throughout. &nbsp;So, it's clearly just this laptop that</p>
<p>is flackey on their wifi connections!]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, this laptop is a Lenovo, model G50-70. &nbsp;(It does NOT have any touch-screen capabilities, so</p>
<p>it really didn't need Windows-8.1). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device mgr says the underlying hardware is: &nbsp;Realtek RTL 8723 BE Wireless 802.11n PCI-E NIC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?? (Heard of any problems with driver for this???)</p>
<p>
</p><p>[My "workaround", of course, was to grab an ethernet cable and plug that in, and that of course gets me back online to the Internet.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I can't live this way. &nbsp;I need to solve this soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Ok, maybe the hardware-chip for this wifi-adapter has failed. &nbsp;So, to test that, I'm planning later today, to insert my fav</p>
<p>Linux distro's installation DVD, and troubleshoot this. &nbsp;I'll probably go ahead and 'shrink' the hard-drive down and do</p>
<p>the full dual-boot-layout for Linux, as I know how to do that. &nbsp;I'll reply back later, with results from that, but previous</p>
<p>many years of experience is betting that the hardware itself will checkout ok under Linux.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, any info/ideas on what to try under Window Preview are welcome. &nbsp;I already DID run that</p>
<p>'network troubleshooter' diagnostic, and it brought wifi down and back up, all to no avail! &nbsp;That could NOT</p>
<p>solve the issue. &nbsp;So, something is not right!</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA...</p>

            <p>(Sigh...ok, solved it, finally after having my hair catch on fire, and spending a day and</p>
<p>a half, off and on.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who's wet dream was it, to make the DEFAULT value for:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Allow this device to be SHUT OFF (to save power)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>to be enabled????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shame on someone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would most anyone want this checked (enabled)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choice for INITIAL (i.e. DEFAULT) values has been a pet peeve of mine for decades!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, the power was FINE! &nbsp;(Yeah, the battery power was purposely down to</p>
<p>the 60% level, because Lenovo has an OEM-specific tool called 'Energy Manager', but</p>
<p>I had the power-cord plugged in, so a hover was reporting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Plugged in, but not charging".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect now, that there was some 'OEM-specific" (Lenovo-specific) tasks that needed to</p>
<p>be re-setup/configured, due to my choice of installing this Preview ! &nbsp;So, yeah, I shot</p>
<p>myself in the foot, by not remembering to research all that, before I nuked freak-ing</p>
<p>Windows-8.1. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, damn...one would have to have a PHD in Lenovo-setup, to work</p>
<p>thru all that stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'd argue that all these power-saving DEFAULT values be set so things will always WORK, and</p>
<p>let the users who WANT their wifi-drivers to back off in low-power conditions enable</p>
<p>that themselves later! &nbsp;Let them figure out how/where to do that!</p>
<p>[ Enough said? ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sigh...live and learn, I guess. &nbsp; (sheepish-grin)</p>

            <p>Damn, I stand corrected. &nbsp;That did NOT totally solve the</p>
<p>problem! &nbsp;But, it did work for a while. &nbsp;(Sigh.) So, now the</p>
<p>wifi is back into it's foolish oscillating cycles of</p>
<p>working/not-working/working/not-working, just as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, that tweak may have been "necessary, but not sufficient". &nbsp;Seems like,</p>
<p>as soon as the battery's state-of-charge changed a bit, some</p>
<p>logic in there is still deciding to drop the wifi-connection.</p>

</p><p>So, back to the drawing board. &nbsp;Meanwhile, I've got the ethernet wire</p>
<p>plugged back in, as I write this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else got any idea of how to fix this colossal mess???</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ Maybe it's time to ditch Windows again, as I did during the</p>

<p>
</p><p>ADDENDUM/EDIT ==&gt; &nbsp;Ok, one additional thing I did along the way</p>
<p>(to try to fix it), was to remove the existing driver, and reboot,</p>
<p>so as to get it to fetch the newest driver. &nbsp;But, I now realize that</p>
<p>that MIGHT NOT be delivering me the correct driver!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming that doing that caused it to fetch down the relevant</p>
<p>MICROSOFT driver for this wifi-chip, but maybe there's a Lenovo</p>
<p>driver that is different, in order to implement their OEM-specific</p>
<p>algorithm to be compatible with their OEM-specific "Energy Manager".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yikes...what a can-of-worms! &nbsp;[Guess I need to go off to Lenovo's</p>

            <p>
</p><p>Aha...thanks for THAT, Ganesh. &nbsp;I didn't realize that I was no longer running the latest</p>
<p>build for this Preview. &nbsp;[ Nice 'handle', btw. &nbsp;A wild guess...I see an Acharya of same first</p>
<p>name is a Bollywood actor. &nbsp;'SarasotaSlim' happens to be my handle over at Veetle.com
</p>
<p>(in Palo Alto?) where I've been learning about movie-video for a few years now &nbsp;Small world. :) ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, a question: Is there perhaps now (or soon going to be) a way to 'upgrade' my</p>
<p>installation to newer builds as they come out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was (naively?) expecting (waiting) that 'updates' to my already installed earlier
</p>
<p>build would be coming via the 'Windows Update' mechanism. &nbsp;</p>
<p>[EDIT: I'd be willing to be a 'guinea pig' and accept the glitches, if there is</p>
<p>some feasible 'upgrade' mechanism. &nbsp;Please let me know.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm...duh,,,,I should have realized (as a developer) that a 'beta' level</p>
<p>product such as this preview is more easily re-factored by doing a complete re-build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmmm...since this is my only issue to date, I guess, barring no way to incrementally</p>
<p>bring myself up to this newer code-base, that for the present time, I'll just suffer</p>
<p>along with my ethernet-wire hanging off this laptop, until such time as it</p>
<p>makes sense doing a complete re-installation from a new ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ I'm a relative 'risk-taker',, and I've now installed quite a bit of layered software</p>
<p>on top of this beast. &nbsp;So, doing a full install from different ISO doesn't seem to</p>
<p>be the best way forward for me, at the moment. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ EDIT: Oh, and sorry for the earlier 'shots' about Microsoft products. &nbsp;Sometimes, I</p>
<p>say stuff that turns out to be "not too bright". :) ]</p>

            <p>I am experiencing something similar...</p>
<p>
</p><p>dell alienware R17-2 is my laptop, </p>
<p>my chip as read by lsusb in ubuntu is</p>
<p>Bus 003 Device 003: ID 0cf3:3004 Atheros Communications, Inc. AR3012 Bluetooth 4.0</p>
<p>basically it's the qualcom atheros killer n1525, that's dual wifi / bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps flickering on off every second - not allowing me to connect to the network.</p>
<p>I don't have a lan cable right now, so can't really bypass this... + i only have a mobile wifi network here anyway... so might not help that much if i had the cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the solution?</p>
<p>There has been no response since March 1 - that's a VERY long time....</p>
<p>
</p><p>everything works fine under linux - so i can download there, and then install separately into windows....&nbsp; just let me know - i am a very infrequent and casual windows user - basically, i use it only because garmin sort of forces me to, not making their
 software available in a convenient full featured way under linux - otherwise, i don't see a single reason a switch back to windows...&nbsp; (I joined the insider program precisely because i think windows is no longer a top notch product and given my limited experience,
 maybe i can help some, but apparently, that was a bad idea - i did not expect the wifi to break down on the slow build preview... very poor outcome.&nbsp; When it breaks down under linux, i can tolerate, because they don't get all the firmware etc from the manufacturer
 - but windows does get everything - so it feels / seems just like pure incompetence, no?&nbsp; i might be missing something).</p>
<p>many thanks</p>

<p>Hi EvanPrice1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two options to update your phone numbers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.If you have an alternate authentication phone number, you can use it to sign in your account first (choose
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.If you only have one authentication phone which is not used anymore, you will need to contact your Office 365 admin and let him reset your MFA settings. Following steps are for O365 admin:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Admin center &gt; Users &gt; More &gt; Multifactor Authentication setup &gt;</span> select problematic user account<span style="font-weight: bold"> &gt; Manage user settings</span> &gt;
 tick <span style="font-weight: bold">Require selected users to provide contact methods again &gt; save.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the next logon attempt the users will be prompted to choose their authentication method again and will be able to update their new phone number.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<br />
on open of theFiles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tell application "Microsoft Word" to set theOldDefaultPath to get default file path file path type documents path<br />

                    Greetings,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>every few months my inbox gets "deleted", only no mail ends up in Trash so recovery of deleted items does not work, they are all just gone. Right now i only have mails from the last two weeks, all others disappeared on me for no reason. There was no rule
 set to delete all, there was no action taken. I have outlook setup on Nexus 7 in the Outlook android app, on iPhone and on Mac as POP with "Leave original on the server".</div>

            Sweep rules were setup for incoming mails from my gmail account, it was supposed to delete all mails coming from my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email after one month. And since i deleted checking mail from gmail and setup forward to outlook.com on gmail, it
 was not in use. That was the only delete rule, other few were sorting rules, mark as Shopping if address is, move to folder Photo if address is, three people rules to label according to person if mail is.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>You recommended somewhere that all rules should be deleted as an attempt to stop this behaviour, so i deleted all rules and can't provide you with a useful screenshot right now. :/</div>

            Yes, the emails are in the inbox. I checked the "rules for sorting new messages." There were rules there but they were for junkish mail that I only wanted to save the last message rec'd and delete others. None of those rules applied to emails from friends,
 family and work. I think maybe I need to abandon outlook and go with gmail unless I can solve this.

They are deleted in bulk, all emails in inbox&nbsp;regardless of the sender/content, those in folders and flagged mails are not deleted.

    <title>Cannot be seen on updated Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loveari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot be seen on updated Skype</h2>
                    My boyfriend and I, at the prompting from Skype, recently upgraded to version 10. We were able both able to see one another during Skype chats for a couple of days but now I can only see him and he cannot see me. We don't know what has changed. It is very
 frustrating to say the least as we are in a long distance relationship and this is our major mode of communication. I am not the most tech savvy person but I know how to search for answers. I did watch a couple of You Tube vids that had me going into regedit...then
 various steps that would, supposedly, fix the problem. Guess what? Still have the problem. I miss the old Skype as we NEVER had any issues with it. There are so many features we do not like with this latest version but it's the webcam issue that is now driving
 us crazy. Any information of value would be greatly appreciated!!

            Thank you for your reply...The version is 12.1815.210.0.....I ended up going to the Geek Squad and even they were perplexed by the new upgrade as they could not find the function as to test my laptop webcam/camera which was easily accessible on the previous
 version. They could see the message that my webcam was being run by another program but could not find the running program. Bottom line...a band aid situation. I bought an external webcam and it took care of both audio and visual but still frustrating as it
 did not answer the question as to why this was happening.<br />

            Yes, you are right...I meant version 8, Windows 10. Sorry for the confusion. As stated in another reply, I have band-aided the situation with an external webcam as the computer tech could not figure out the problem. He, too, was baffled by the new Skype
 configuration and how it is not readily apparent as how to test the video and audio.

            If you want to test video and audio in the Skype 8 version, then click on your profile image icon and select "Audio &amp; Video Settings" option.
