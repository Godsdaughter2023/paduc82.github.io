<p>Hi Julie Justman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay reply since I was out of Office in the past few days, based on my test result in Outlook for iOS, Shifts feature now available in Teams for iOS, we can tap the teams button and swipe up to find it, if you can't find it, I suggest you
 update your Teams for iOS version and your OS version to see the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still doesn't exist there, could please provide a screenshot after tapping the teams button and swipe up? in addition, please provide your Teams for iOS version and your apple OS version for us for further investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

            <p>Hi DanK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked your history of threads that you had replied to and found the one that you are refering to. I have also edited your Thread Title to make the issue clearer to get more people to have a look at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume the issue that you are facing is that your reviews that you post for Apps and Games are not showing up on Marketplace, correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, I assume that happens to any app that you try to review?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mind posting us the following information about your phone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone model:
</p>
<p>Mobile Operator:
</p>
<p>Mobile OS version:
</p>
<p>Firmware revision :
</p>
<p>Hardware revision:
</p>
<p>Radio software:
</p>
<p>Radio hardware:
</p>
<p>Bootloader :
</p>
<p>Chip SOC:<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Country: </p>
<p>At this stage, personally I am not sure what could cause the issue. It could be a connection issue between your Windows Phone and Windows Live (even if all other functions are working correclty), it could be a Phone issue in general or even an issue with
 your operator who are blocking certain data transfers (although I doubt that this is the case).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned that your wifes phone works fine. Is the using a different account or the same as you do? Would you happen to have a chance to get a test Windows Phone from AT&amp;T and to login with your Windows Live ID there and post a review? If that one shows
 up, we know it is a phone issue. If not we know it is an account issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I assume you have tried removing your battery for about 2 minutes already?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I have an answer to all that and your phone information, I would look further into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi DanK,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forgot to ask, are you using 3G or Wifi when you post reviews? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens if you use your wifes simcard in your phone and then use her 3G with your account to post a review. Is that going to show up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same with your simcard and her phone. If she uses your simcard in her phone and posts a review, is that showing up?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That way we might be able to exclude SimCard issue from the list of possibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, as I can see your Windows Phone is not up to date. Would you be able to connect your phone to the zune software and update your phone to either version 8107 or if available to Tango version 8773 and check if the issue still persists then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for your answer.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I forgot to ask, are you using 3G or Wi-fi when you post reviews?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><b><i><span>-
</span></i></b><b><i><u><span>In the past I've posted reviews outside of any Wi-fi - across 3g only without incident.</span></u></i></b><b><i><span>
<u>But to answer U'r question - all of my reviews as of the past 2 mos. have all been done within my primary Home Wi-fi intranet environment.</u></span></i></b></p>
<p><i><span>What happens if you use your wife's sim-card in your phone and then use her 3G with your account to post a review. Is that going to show up?<span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>- <u>No.</u><span>&nbsp; </span><u>I switched the Sim-card and tried to review an app. she has called 111Cocktails.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My review still "acted" like it went out - but it still never posted!</u><span>&nbsp;
</span><u>Her posts went in almost immediately like Mine Used to!!</u><span>&nbsp;
</span><u>I know about waiting 48 hours for reviews to post!!!</u><span>&nbsp;
</span><u>Mine always usually go up and post within an hour.<span>&nbsp; </span>

</span><u>They're not posting - Not from within the app., not from holding down on the apps. title &amp; selecting Review either.</u><span>&nbsp;
</span><u>After the 7.5 Mango update - the only way a review would go in and stay in - is when the review is done from within the Windows Marketplace!!!!</u></strong></span></i></p>
<p><span>Same with your sim-card and her phone. If she uses your sim-card in her phone and posts a review, is that showing up?
</span><span>That way we might be able to exclude Simcard issue from the list of possibilities.<span>&nbsp;

</span><b><i><u><span>Pretty sure I did this step after Her sim-card in My phone - I believe the end result was the same.</span></u></i></b><b><i><span><span>&nbsp;
</span><u>My review doesn't even stay locked in after typing it all out.</u><span>&nbsp;
</span><u>After submitting, then backing back out to my Home screen, then go back to my app. review I had just typed &amp; submitted using any of the 3 methods mentioned above &amp; All Gone including the Star Rating!??!</u></span></i></b></p>
<p><span>Also, as I can see your Windows Phone is not up to date. Would you be able to connect your phone to the Zune software and update your phone to either version 8107 or if available to

            <p>Hi DanK,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So just to summarize:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Non of the Reviews show up when posting them using your home WiFi Network</p>
<p>2. Non of the Reviews show up when using your 3G Data connection</p>
<p>3. Non of the Reviews show up when using your wifes SimCard/ 3G Data connection</p>
<p>4. Your Phone cannot be updated since the Zune Software does not show any updates for your phone</p>
<p>5. Your wifes phone is working fine with your/her SimCard and home Wifi Network</p>
<p>6. You already removed the battery several times which did not fix the issue either</p>
<p>7. A HardReset is something you would like to avoid?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all of this is correct, I will need more time to investigate on whatelse we could try apart from a hardreset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will get back to you once I have found something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I increase my Outlook Storage Capacity&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> born billionaire  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I increase my Outlook Storage Capacity&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>When I signed up for Outlook.com, I was under the impression that the storage was unlimited but today I received a notification that my inbox was growing too fast. I know I can upgrade the account and get 10GB, but I would like more. What happens when your
 account reaches 10GB? Is it possible to increase my account more?</p>

            <p>Hello Warren, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you want to increase your Outlook.com mailbox storage capacity.
<span>
Let me assist you on this matter and rest assured that I will endeavor to assist you as best as I can and hopefully we can get this issue fixed for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just to let you know that the s</span>torage space for your Outlook.com email is ever-growing, but if the amount of email in your Inbox and folders grows too fast, it may bump
 up against the account's quota, and you might not be able to send or receive any&nbsp;messages. Also, your mailbox storage space will depend on how you use it on your daily activity. It will automatically increase the storage space after some time if our system
 validated that it was not use for spamming activities. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's really important for you to increase your mailbox storage rapidly, I highly suggest for you to subscribe to our
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/ad-free-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ad-free Outlook.com</a></strong> and experience the benefit of being a subscribed user.

    <title>Excel Conditional Formatting Copy to multiple rows challenges - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Conditional Formatting Copy to multiple rows challenges</h2>
                    <p>All, I've read the posts related to this question, but am unable to apply the recommendations to my document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 32 column document, and two rules apply to all 32 columns (let's start with row 2, row 1 being a header):</p>
<p>=IF(TYPE($A2)="I",IFBLANK($E2),0)&nbsp; formats a special border which is applied to $A2:$AF2</p>
<p>=IF(CONCAT($H2:$R2)="",1,0) formats a light blue cell fill which is also applied to $A2:$AF2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Columns 1, 8 thru 17, and 19 have specialized formats specifically designed to fill cells with certain colors. The document was originally created in Excel 2010, with conditional formatting copied to multiple rows using the standard copy/paste which pulled
 the formatting to rows 3 to 900. The report has expanded to 1201 rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to copy the conditional formatting to rows 3 through 1201, and the relative cell references appear not to work. Row 3 does not get =IF(TYPE($A3)="I",IFBLANK($E3,0) whether I use</p>
<p>&gt; a copy/paste/paste special/format, or</p>
<p>&gt; a copy/paste/paste special/all merging conditional formats, or</p>
<p>&gt; copy/format painter/escape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One MS document indicated that one might have to go to the pasted cells and correct the relative references, but that would mean 36,000 adjustments. Unlikely to be a viable solution. Am looking for a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other anomaly appears to occur. Whenever I change the "applies to" cell ranges from absolute $A$2:$AF$2 to $A2:$AF2, after hitting OK, the conditional formatting returns the range to absolute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Office 2016, Excel 2016, with all recent updates installed.</p>

<p>Murray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just following up. Everything works right now. I got hung up on the command IF(CELL("type",$A2)="I",1,0) which is not correct, since the literal is not a capital "i" but an up-bar, which it took me
<p>
</p><p>IF(CELL("type",$A2)="|",1,0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. I can move on to other Excel challenges.</p>

            <p>Same issue and almost the same computer. I have an a5306. I downloaded the realtek driver from Toshiba and "tried" to install the drivers several different ways and every time it froze up.</p>
<p>However,,,, after making the attempt several times I noticed the audio icon at bottom left lost its red "X". Somehow it all works now (don't know why yet) .&nbsp; Keep trying and I'll post again if soon after I check the logs.</p>

    <title>New hotmail account somehow linked itself to gmail and now I can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marianne_mkz  say:</h3>
<h2>            New hotmail account somehow linked itself to gmail and now I can&#39;t access my emails&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be incredibly grateful for prompt help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work for an organisation that has a gmail account [orgname]@gmail.com with an alias [orgname]@[orgname].org. This was being accessed through gmail.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, logged on a computer with all passwords set in the browser I went to hotmail.com, and set up a BRAND NEW account. During the process I was asked to, from what I understood, to set up a security email alias as otherwise it wouldnt let me go into the
 inbox. Said something about 'we take the security very seriously'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was some code providing too, so I did that with the organisation mobile. Next thing we know is we receive a text saying you have successfully changed alias of [orgname]@gmail.com to this brand new email! Brand new email says it only has one alias (?)
 when I thought maybe I could just remove it, so was advised against by the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't access the [orgname]@gmail.com (nor the [orgname]@[orgname].org gmal alias), but the brand new hotmail account is working. My boss however, on her computer, says has access to the gmail account with no problem. We're not sure how this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried logging in to the gmail account and alias from an incognito tab to avoid password issues, but it's not logging me in. I'm extremely worried that the moment my boss loggs out of her internet browser she will also not be able to access the gmail
 account/alias back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Hello Ron<br />
<br />
I entered entirely a new username and new details, on the hotmail website. No idea how it got linked to the gmail account, think I was just logged in during the internet sesssion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, I sent an email to the [orgname]@[orgname].org alias and my boss could read it on her computer as she still has access. So the account does exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I however, can't access it at all.</p>

            Hi, <br /><br /><br />I need more information before we proceed.<br /><br />1. Does the issue persist with particular file?<br /><br />2. What are the troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?<br /><br />Let's start Excel in safe mode following instructions mentioned below and verify whether issue re-occurs:<br /><br /> <br /><br />* Hold Windows key + R.<br />* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter<br /><br />Excel /safe<br /><br /><br />Note:<br />*There is a space between Excel and '/'. <br />* Add-ins will be disabled in Excel safe mode.<br /><br />If Excel works as expected in safe mode, disable the add-ins by following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:<br /><br /><br />a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />d) Now enable each add-in one at a time, rest

<p>
</p><p>It is global across all files.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>reinstall the previous version of windows you had then make sure its an activated copy of windows... make sure all of its updates are installed then if you see the Get Windows 10 App on your sys tray&nbsp;let the windows update process work or download the windows

<p>

            <p>Was Windows 10 activated before you formatted the disk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The valid upgrade and activation of Windows 10 only needs to be completed one time per device.&nbsp; A clean install of Windows 10&nbsp;in future should auto-activate on that device, as long as you used the exact same edition, but you must not enter any product key
 during the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Directions for a clean install are on the website linked below.&nbsp; If you did not enter any product key during your&nbsp;current install, and yet it still did not auto-activate, then you may have to first install and activate Windows 7 or 8 again and upgrade once
 more to Windows 10.&nbsp; Perhaps you used the wrong edition of Windows 10 (there are 5 editions and you must use the one that matches your prior OS license) or use Reset or a Recovery disk made from within Windows 10.</p>

<p><span>The Home Use Program is a deal where companies with a site or volume license activate part of that license agreement that allows their employees to get a copy of Office to use at home. The HUP is the best discount you can get. The price
 is current USD$9 plus extra for the “backup disks”</span></p>
<p><span>Note: in HUP 2013 it appears that the backup disk is for the CTR installation &lt;snip

<p><span>Ok, I know I can’t run Office on Mac. &nbsp;According to the Apple web page I can “reassign” the program by getting a code and then deleting it from my system. &nbsp;Then to contact the technical manager to check my eligibility and reset it. &nbsp;I
 can then go back in and down load it again by paying the $20 again and install the Mac version. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>

<strong><span>2010 Academic 64-bit</span></strong>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt; </span></p>
<p><span>Just opened my e-mail and had a message back from Digital River:</span></p>
<p><span>“Thank you for contacting the Ultimate Steal online store. </span>
</p>
<p><span>We understand that you would like to have the 64-bit version of your Microsoft Office Professional Academic 2010.</span></p>
<p><span>We would like to inform you that 64-bit version is not available.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>However most users install 32-bit version of Office 2010 on both 32 and 64-bit Operating Systems because currently many common add-ins for Office will not function in the 64-bit edition. The 64-bit installation of Microsoft Office 2010
 products is available for users who commonly use very large documents or data set and need Excel 2010 programs to access greater than 2GB of memory. There may be technical issues with the 64-bit version and in order to install a 64-bit version of Office 2010
 product users must have a 64-bit supported operating system on their PC.</span></p>
<p><span>We are glad to be of service to you.”</span></p>
<p><span>I have yet to reply to it but I’m already annoyed. I ordered this with the impression that there was going to be an x64 installer (just like the retail copies). They can either give me the installer or give me a refund at this point. Yes
 I know I can run the x86 version in x64 (which is what I’m doing now), but I wanted Office 2010 mostly because it was going to be the first true x64 version of Office.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>For some reason I was not presented with an option to download the x64 installer.&nbsp; There was just 1 download link and it was the old X16-32007.exe.&nbsp; However their download link:
<a href="https://www2.buyoffice.microsoft.com/usa/unitdownloader.aspx?cache=XXXXXXX&amp;local_only=true&amp;receipt_id=XXXXXXX&amp;dname=O14.download.name.32&amp;id=XXXXXXX&amp;culture=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 The XXXXXXX are your particular variables in your shopping session</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi all.
</span><span>The Digital River 2010 backup disk DOES contain the 64-bit folder to run from. Remember you need to uninstall all remnants of any Office 32-bit components beforehand. Microsoft has very thorough unique version-specific uninstallers
 at the Office support website you can run if there is any problem with the usual uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried pretty aggressively to get them to e-mail me the 64.bit exe file to run with the download but no one would. I guess you need to get to the right person. All their e-mails that said they didn’t offer 64-bit installation were misrepresentations.</span></p>
<p><span>The trial version workaround solution sounds pretty good if it works for everyone--saves having to buy the backup disk.</span></p>

            <p>I have received with purchase of an Asus laptop the option to try office 365 on trial offer. The download made and office 365&nbsp;had error because it has no activation key. I was directed to repair and re-download and the same error occurred. I have tried repeatedly
 to repair and follow all directions but the trial is a failure since the product can never activate it is like a scam offer. If your really not going to allow us to use the offer don't make it. I will in the end need a window office package but I will find
 one that you cannot stop me using and one that I don't have to pay for just because you made this frustrating, otherwise I would have purchased an office system to go with my new laptop and new windows 10. Perhaps I can find an old office 2000 disc. Thanks
 a Million.</p>

            <p>Don't go with Office 2000 or 2003! They are no longer supported by MS. That means if hackers find an opening MS no longer provides patches for them.&nbsp; Even Office 2007 goes off support in November this year.

</p><p>So, go with a "used" copy of Office 2010 or 2013. Both of them can be bought as "1-time-payment" license that can be installed WITHOUT an email account.</p>

<p>The first thing to look at is what is selected in the Font box in the upper left corner of the Insert &gt; More Symbols dialog box.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Font box says (normal text), the dialog box shows the characters available in the font used by the Normal paragraph style.</li><li>If a specific font's name appears in the box, the dialog box shows the characters in that font.</li></ul>
<p>Some fonts (such as Arial Unicode MS) contain a lot of combining diacritical marks, while others (such as Symbol) don't contain any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After selecting a font, look at the box in the lower right, just above the Cancel button. If that dropdown's list contains "Unicode (hex)", select it. If that doesn't appear in the list, then the selected font doesn't contain any characters other than the
 256 ASCII characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get as far as choosing to show Unicode character codes, then the Subset box in the upper right should allow you to select the Combining Diacritical Marks subset. These characters start with character code 0300 and continue for as many as the selected
 font contains.</p>

            You may need to run OCR on the pdf file.
<br />A pdf can be created from a Word document. Those can easily be opened and edited by Word.
<br />
<br />It can be created from a web page. Those can easily be opened and edited by Word.
<br />
<br />It can be opened from a scan or a picture taken by a phone camera. Those are pictures of words saved as pdfs. Just as you can have a picture of a car. You can see the car in the picture, but you can't change the timing of the engine in that picture. You can't change the order of text or otherwise edit it with a picture of text. Word can open such a file, but it can't edit it.
<br />
<br />There is an intermediate kind of program called OCR. That is optical character recognition. If run on a picture of text, it gives text, more or less accurately (but seldom perfectly). Most scanners come with such software. It is built into Adobe Acrobat (but not Acrobat Reader). It is also in OneNote 2016.
<br />
<br />Once translated into text, it can be edited in Word.

<h2>            nokia fully charged and disconnect automatically feature for E 63&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>i am a Professional Executive of my company,i faced a problem ,based on that. i got an idea about a feature if avaialble&nbsp; so........ Daily Night i reach my home late and my phone charge will down and mandatory for tomorrow conversation.</p>
<p>My Idea is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>put a software upgradation to smart phone of S 60series phones i.e whenever user put charger plug to phone, the phone charges the phone and he cannot remove the phone untill he get need of it(due to at work).at that time the battery will losses it's life.
 so , to prevent this put a option in the phone that if required voltage is obtained to the battery means, automatically the charging should stop by sensing and measuring the volatage (just in fully automatic washing machines , they do not know whether we put
 the jeans or T -shirt&nbsp; nothing but it senses the weight of the cloth and starts the process) like that the user also enjoys this feature even in the busy time. plz avail this option to all existing users first E63 .if u like this idea means reply soon personnal
 email. i am waiting for ur reply</p>

            it does that already. if you plug in your phone overnite, when the battery is full it goes into trickle effect and charges very slowly, there is no way to overcharge your phone. phones and batteries these days are designed to monitor themselves in just
 that way. i always charge my phone overnite. just don't let your battery run too low, that is the problem with modern batteries it reduces&nbsp;their&nbsp;longevity if you let them get too low in charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Although it is not such a great practise to keep your phone plugged in after it has reached its full charge. one is you're wasting electricity. the other is that the heat from the current will cause your battery be damaged over time. my daughters usually
 forget to unplug their phones at night and the result was a swollen battery that proved to be unuseable after a long period of this bad habit.

<blockquote>that is complete rubbish with the exception of using up more electricity then needed. modern day batteries do not behave this way and please do not mislead other users. it is possible to be a defective battery or charger or both and things like
 this happen. i have had 5 n series phones over the last few years always charge them overnite NEVER had an issue. do your&nbsp;research&nbsp;prior to posting. a personal experience is fine to share but that does not make it a rule as to how to handle electronic gadgets

<p>i am on call 24/7/365&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i can't have a phone turned off. my phone is always on unless i am on vacation in Europe ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i always charge my phone overnite so that i do not miss any calls. i use the phone during the day and once you complete full charge/discharge cycles ( by discharge i mean when the battery starts screaming at you that it is low, it is time to plug it in right
 then) approx 3-4 then it does not matter how full or empty your battery is you can charge it as you please. my n97 battery is actually very very good and i can go 2-3 days on one charge which has not happened&nbsp;with&nbsp;any of my n series&nbsp;previously (that is with
 low or moderate use). when i had the n95-3 i had to charge it sometimes several times a day. &nbsp;</p>

            Perhaps, visiting the following site is a good idea to know more about different types and characteristics of batteries, and how we should handle them.

            no worries mate, li-ion batteries and newer behave very different then the good ole times. and nokia care sorry to say does not always know the correct things either. they are not nokia employees they just do the job for them as authorized nothing else.&nbsp;

<p>This has been asked to MS many times by me and never gotten any answers, as I've posted that the Insiders Preview Program has turned into another "free" support site for MS, as most of the older Insiders don't seem to be on here anymore. Part of the problem
 is the name of the forum "Insiders" many people think it's where you can get that so called insiders info and after signing in finding that it is a test site...

<p>Due to the work done by Microsoft in the democratization of technology, operation and administration of a Windows based PC and ancillary devices can be done with no more skills than those provided through a public high school education. Characterizing it
 as any more than "falling off a log" would be extremely generous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be more interested in knowing where the idea that a 'Preview' translates into anything resembling a 'BETA Test' arose from.</p>

<p>I have noted comments by some of them that they joined hoping to learn something/more about computers. Obviously, they failed to read any of the warnings of what to expect, and what they should know and do to be prepared for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think many viewed it as being similar to signing up for a beginners class in ballroom dancing ... as in, "they'll show us and tell us everything as we progress, and it will be so much fun".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft quickly adapted to the idea, thinking that we could lighten the load at the help desk. The help desk trainees could then be given other titles, rather than pay raises, i.e. "engineer".</p>

</p><p>What is the alternative? A skills test to allow entry? Most of the time the basic questions are from people who are not insiders or have just joined to post not to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we are long beyond the pre-releases of the first Win10, the risks are less and the minimum skills, lower. I say live and let live - but back up and be prepared for when you may to find a workaround or do a rebuild - not really that different from how
 you should approach the public releases.</p>

<p>Many people seem to&nbsp;bypass the warnings and disclaimers, sign up,&nbsp;and start installing Insider Preview builds on the fast ring.&nbsp; Then they blame Microsoft when things don't work as expected, posting here and in Feedback Hub things like "I demand you fix
 this immediately!"&nbsp; As we know, that's not how this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go through the latest entries in Feedback Hub several times a day every day.&nbsp; I've seen rants because a new build is preventing the user from completing the daily challenges on one of the apps from Microsoft Casual Games.&nbsp; I've seen others where the poster
 says an&nbsp;issue is happening on both his and his wife's PCs after installing the latest Insider build, and they can't get any work done.&nbsp; The Insider builds are intended for installation on&nbsp;a spare PC that one can tinker with, not the sole PC that one relies
 upon for dependability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So one of the big&nbsp;problems I see is how difficult it is to get Microsoft's attention&nbsp;on genuine technical issues in Feedback Hub when there's so much nonsense to go through.</p>

<p>If they ignore the warnings, so what? They take the risk just the same as we do, just less knowlingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the computer not working as it should less of "genuine technical issue" worthy of reporting just because it is in a game? Surely the OS should work for all, not just the technical elite. One person's nonsense can be a serious issue for Microsoft's
 image and success. If we (together with MS's other testing methods) fail to expose a real operating problem before each public upgrade, then we have failed. This applies whether you consider it be a genuine technical issue worthy of MS's attention or not.</p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a previous Insider build 18362.53 my Windows 10 does'nt get Insider builds.</p>
<p>Theres the option to "get started" but after I go through that procedure theres a prompt to "restart now" or "restart later" - either one I choose it doesn't add the Insider account, only shows the "get started" button again. Even if I manually restart the
 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually installed&nbsp; 18885.1001 but the insider build enabling still is in a loop.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 move Deleted items back into Inbox</h2>
                    In Outlook 2016, I can not move back Deleted emails to Inbox. The "Move to" file folder under the Folder tab won't highlight as an option. It remains gray. How do I fix that. Also, when I right click on a deleted memo and scroll down to the "Move" option
 and choose any folder in my Inbox, it wont move the file out of the Deleted Item folder. I used to also be able to right click and drag the deleted item into Inbox, but now i can't do that either. Any suggestions? Did recent updates change this as i used to
 be able to do all of the above. Thanks&nbsp;

            Switch to the folder list view - ctrl+6 - and look in the sync issues folder.  Each message in the folder is a sync problem - within the message, the problem is red. Do any of the messages reference the messages you are trying to move?

<h2>            How to get rid of the unnecessary &#39;Open&#39; and &#39;change&#39; options</h2>
                    I have just bought a 6630 model and am appalled at the software. In the past Nokia wiped the floor with Ericcson because its software was so simple and quick to use. Now I have to go through all these menus to get to what I want. For instance, why do we
 have to keep pressing 'Open' and 'Change' options when it is obvious we want to use these functions. Any way to customise these and turn them off?

            You can most often just take the default action by pressing the "joystick" center button (without going through the menus).
