<p>#2 - If you're exporting to an existing PST file and it's asking for a password - simply means that the PST file is password protected.</p>

<p>#3 - Two reason why you may not be able to open the PST file on your new machine<br />
1) it's password protected and/or <br />
2) the file's &lt;Read Only&gt; attribute is checked. Outlook requires full read/write access to any PST file</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 sent messages stay on taskbar</h2>
                    When I send mail in Outlook 2010 most of the mail stays open on the task bar even though the mail has been sent. The only way to close all of the taskbar sent is to close outlook then they go but this is obviously inconvenient

<p>As it works in Outlook Safe Mode, you issue appears to be caused by an add-in; most likely the issue is caused by your virus scanner. Disable/Uninstall the Outlook integration component of your virus scanner and try again.<br />
See; <a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msoutlook.info/question/20</a></p>

    <title>Excel Date Question - Incorrect Date Displaying&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dylan_audit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Date Question - Incorrect Date Displaying&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to format dates in one of my columns to where the user enters the date as a two-digit month, two-digit day and two-digit year in the cell (without dashes or slashes) where Excel will automatically format to include dashes and/or slashes in between.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I am trying to set up the column to when the user enters today's date for instance as 082418, Excel will automatically format this input in the cell as 08-24-18 or 08/24/18. I have tried to set this up on my own by formatting the column as a
 "Short Date" with format "03/14/01"; however upon doing this and entering "082418" I am receiving the output of 08/25/25 (August 25, 2125). It almost appears that Excel is performing some type of behind-the-scenes multiplication to this input that is causing
 the output to be incorrect as a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this using basic cell formatting? If not, what would be an alternative way to correct this? As the user needs to type directly into the cell, writing a formula in the cell will not work as the user will be overwriting the formula every
 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Can be done with Event driven VBA code (Macro) as per the code example below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The columns/cells where the date is entered as numbers without delimiters <em>
<strong>must have Number Format set as General.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The code will convert it to the required Date Number Format after the conversion to a date. Reason for this is if Number format is set to a Date then Excel will convert any serial number to the equivalent date and the code will not run. This is the reason
 that your serial number was converted to August 25, 2125.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The number can be entered as 082418 and it will be converted to a date.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Caveat: If a date needs to be edited at a later time then it must be entered properly as a date. Entering as numeric will not work because the cell is formatted as a date and not General.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>To install the Event VBA code:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click the worksheet tab name</li><li>Select "View code" (will open the VBA editor window at worksheet's module)</li><li>Copy the VBA code below and paste into the VBA editor.</li><li>Edit the code where I have indicated that you need to set the column where the numbers are entered for the dates.</li><li>See the comment where I have indicated to edit the required Number Format for the date,</li><li>Do not rename the sub.</li><li>Close the VBA editor (Cross very top right of VBA editor window)</li><li>Save the workbook as Macro enabled.</li><li>Ensure macros are enabled. See help for how to do this. (Option to "Disable all macros with notification" should be OK.)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The code should automatically run each time you make an entry in the required column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to me if any problems encountered with the code.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have few questions about the issue which you're experiencing...</p>
<p>--&gt; Is the senders receiving any errors ( ndr ) &nbsp;or Bounce back messages. when they tried emailing to those addresses? If so, kindly share it with us so we will be able to diagnose the cause behind the issue.</p>
<p>--&gt; You can also perform<strong> message trace&nbsp;</strong>on your office 365 tenant to confirm the status of those email transaction. ( if Microsoft&nbsp;received&nbsp;the emails and routed it to the quarantine or deleted it suspecting it as a malware - message trace
 will be the right place to start the investigation )</p>
<p>How to do a message trace in office 365?</p>

<p>To access the private message: <br />
1). Go to your details section on the right side of the community site.<br />
2). Click Private messages.<br />

<p>Hi JZFGROUP,</p>
<p>Based on the description, I understand that you want to send emails from a Gmail account to an Office 365 account.</p>
<p>After checking the non-delivery report and the status of your custom domain, I have found the following:<br />
1. The custom domain has been verified in Office 365.<br />
2. The DNS records include two MX records: one is the standard MX record ‘domain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com’ and the other one points to smtp.secureserver.net. They both have the same priority 0 so that emails sent to the custom domain are rejected.<br />
3. The NDR shows that the email has not been delivered to Office 365 servers, and it was rejected by “smtp.secureserver.net”, the GoDaddy mail server.</p>
<p>According to my findings, actually this email has been delivered to GoDaddy and then rejected. I suggest you contact the GoDaddy support to do troubleshooting. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you want Office 365 to host your mail services, please point the DNS records to Office 365. For the detailed steps, please refer to this article: :
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/office365-suite-help/create-dns-records-at-go-daddy-for-office-365-HA103106254.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create DNS records at Go Daddy for Office 365</a>. After doing this, you will be able to receive emails from external addresses in Office 365.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 301 has a 1-day battery life, even on 9.04 firmware</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a Nokia 301 because it was advertised to have a maximum standby time of 39 days. &nbsp;Now I know that's under ideal conditions, but I thought it would be reasonable to assume that I would get at least maybe a week?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no data plan, use calling and SMS only, and make maybe two 2-minute calls a day, and 5 texts a day. &nbsp;The battery doesn't even last two days! &nbsp;I don't use any apps, and I have turned off every single feature that I can. &nbsp;<span>I updated to version
 9.04, and I've tried basically everything I can find online.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know I'm not the only one with this issue. &nbsp; Is there anything that can be done? From what I've read, it sounds like either the battery isn't getting charged properly, or there are programs running in the background that drain all the power. &nbsp; I
 would've thought these firmware updates would've fixed it by now though.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I bought the phone during a trip overseas, so I can't really return it. &nbsp;Nokia, can you offer any sort of hope for me regarding this issue? :(</span></p>

            Hey Lifeformed, the battery problem is very common in most of the new nokia phones. If you have a option of adjusting the brightness in your phone, adjust it to 10% so that the battery lasts for two to three days.<br />
<br />
CHECK WHETHER YOUR BATTERY IS NOT SWOLLEN. You can see if your back case is fitting properly or not. If not, the battery is damaged and you have to replace it.<br />
<br />
Try not using any apps or using the phone for long time. This saves the battery. :)<br />
<br />
Was my answer helpful :)

            Hi Sharloyn, thanks for the response. My battery isn't swollen, I've been very mindful about how I use the phone (no apps, no heavy usage, low backlight). I don't want the phone to last 2-3 days, I want it to last 20+ days.<br />
<br />
I don't see why Nokia would advertise a THIRTY-NINE DAY battery life if it can't even make 3% of that claim! How is that even fair? :(

<p>Right on the Nokia website it says 39 days: <a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/301/#ProductSpecsWidget" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/301/#ProductSpecsWidget</a><br />
<br />
Of course I don't expect it to last 39, but I expect it to last something <em>reasonably</em> close to that number! Maybe something more than one or two days?<br />
<br />
My old phone is advertised to last 26 days, and in my use of it, it lasts about 10-14 days. That's pretty reasonable. So if this Nokia 301 is advertised to last 39 days, shouldn't it last around 10-20 days? Shouldn't it last more than a week at least? More
 than <em>two days</em>? Why didn't they just advertise it as lasting for years then! It'd be just the same amount of truth.</p>

            Nokia says that asha 301 has a standby of 39 days.<br />
<br />
It means to say that the device has the capacity to consume its energy power for 39 days while it is switched off and not switched on.<br />
<br />
If you keep your device switched off, the power would stay for 39 days.<br />
<br />
You cannot have its power consumed for 39 days while the phone is switched on. :) ;).<br />
<br />
Was the answer helpul?

            But that 39 days standby is said to be when the phone is switched off.<br />
<br />
Old Nokia phones are much hardy than the new ones.<br />
<br />
Though Nokia phone lasts longer than any other phone.

<p>Hi DKb170,</p>

<p>If it works fine in private mode, you may not have completely cleared the cache of your browser. For example, if you’re using Chrome, click the three dot at the upper right &gt; More tools &gt; clear browsing data. You can choose the time range or some entries
 of the browser’s cache. Try clear all the cache and check if the issue persists.</p>

    <title>Battery will not charge after installing Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cavyred  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery will not charge after installing Office 365</h2>
                    I installed Office 365 for students and now my battery says 0% available (plugged in, not charging). The computer only works when it is connected to the charger. The battery report shows that the battery stopped charging after Office 365 was installed.
 Help! I tried reinstalling the battery driver and the other common suggestions online and nothing has worked. Thanks very much for any assistance!

<p>Hi CavyRed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To properly identify if this issue is caused by installing the Office 365, I suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the application. Kindly check this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the steps on how to uninstall Office 365. To reinstall Office 365, please access
 this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-a-PC-or-Mac-4414EAAF-0478-48BE-9C42-23ADC4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. I would also appreciate it if
 you can provide us a screenshot of the battery report. This will help us validate the result where it says battery stopped charging after Office 365 was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your message. I uninstalled and reinstalled the application and the battery still is not charging. This is the history of installing the application:</p>
<p>* Installed Office 365 (64-bit student version) late morning on 6 May (which is when the battery stopped working--see screen shot of battery report)</p>
<p>* Uninstalled Office 2013 which had been on the machine, in case that was causing conflicts</p>
<p>* Uninstalled and reinstalled Office 365 (64-bit)</p>
<p>* And then last night, per your message, uninstalled Office 365 (64-bit) and installed Office 365 (32-bit, student version) just in case that might make a difference.</p>
<p>I've also uninstalled and updated the battery driver several times, as well as taken out the physical battery and restarted the laptop with and without the battery following the various suggestions found in the online forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of ideas at this point and really need to be able to use the laptop on battery, not just with the charger, so any help would be very welcome.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us and for providing the screenshot. You mentioned that you have uninstalled and reinstalled the Office 365 and test the battery. Let us try to uninstall it again and then observe the battery performance. Do not reinstall it
 yet. I would want to verify if the issue occurs without the Office 365 completely.</p>

<p>Keep us posted for us to assist you further.</p>

            NOTE: when I set up Outlook for some reason the Outlook Files folder was not created automatically.<br />
I suspect it was when asked if a new Data file should be created I selected the "use existing data file" which required that I browse for my outlook.pst file which I had on a thumbdrive. I now wish I had copied the thumbdrive files to the Outlook Files folder
 that I had created instead of using the thumbdrive files during setup.<br />
As it turns out, when I have my thumbdrive plugged into my laptop, Outlook Send/Receive works.<br />
I have now copied the thumbdrive files to the Outlook Files folder that I created on my laptop.<br />
AND now Send/Receive works using the laptop "c" drive files.<br />
I got a few more grey hairs working thru this but I believe my problem is finally resolved.<br />
THANKS to everyone who responded with info and suggestions.<br />
Tom

<h2>            May I get help for my exchange office 365 email account from DeVry&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm looking to be able to use my DeVry email with my Android phone, and for that I need the correct email settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I did so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to settings - general - accounts - add account - Microsoft exchange</p>
<p>
</p><p>And these are my settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Email:</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Server address:</p>
<p>outlook.office365.com</p>
<p>Domain:</p>
<p>[blank]</p>
<p>Port:</p>
<p>443</p>
<p>Username:</p>
<p>[I tried my email without the domain and my student id]</p>
<p>Password:</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click next it says wrong sign in info and to try again. But I know I have the right credentials at least because I can still log in to DeVry's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried contacting DeVry themselves to get the email info a while back but they were of no help because they were transitioning out of pop3 and into exchange. Could someone help me, either someone who has done similar or someone from the Microsoft team?</p>

<h3> laythsaid  say:</h3>
<h2>            On Track button does not work</h2>
                    In some of my projects, I have all the tasks created as auto tasks. When I click on the "On Track" button, then I expect that the task % complete is updated to mach the expected % complete to be on track today.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This works very well for one project file, but it does not work for other project files. Pressing the "On Track" button on the other files does not change anything on the % complete (just like the button is not working or not implemented at all).</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Office 365 University Subscription - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasseymour18901  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 University Subscription</h2>
                    <p>I do plan on ordering the Office 365 University Subscription off of Amazon on January 1, 2016. I could buy it the day I start my college career at Bucks County Community College, but I want to activate it on January 1, 2016 for two reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I'm thinking about asking for an iPad for next Christmas. I don't want one this Christmas or on the day of my high school graduation, because since 2012, Apple refreshed the product in November of each year. Apple will likely release a third generation
 iPad Air and iOS 9 by the time we're getting ready for Christmas of 2015. We don't know about the second generation iPad Air just yet, but we probably will in five days. I really do need 2GB of RAM in a tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I want my 1TB of cloud storage to last me all through the year 2019. I already have Office 2010 Professional Plus installed on my Windows 8.1 laptop which I got on Christmas of 2013. I just want Office 365 mostly for the cloud storage. For this reason,
 Office 365 is a much better deal for me than the boxed edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few questions about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Would I run into any problems if I bought the license on January 1, 2016 instead of the day I start my college career at Bucks? As previously stated, I would like the license to last me all through 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Bucks is a two-year community college in Newtown Township, Pennsylvania. I do plan on transferring to a four-year college for my junior and senior years, and eventually go to graduate school for my Ph.D. in Computer Science. I am allowed to renew my license
 once if I'm still eligible, which I plan on doing when I go to graduate school. Would I be able to do that if I went to graduate school for my Ph.D. in Computer Science? If so, I'd have Office 365 all the way until Windows 8.1 goes out of support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping the answer to my first question is no and the answer to my second question is yes. If they are, then the university license sounds like a great deal to me. Imagine how much free cloud storage Microsoft will offer for everyone in 2023!</p>

            <p>You're not understanding what I'm asking. Let me be more clear about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not interested in the features that would be available in January 2016. My question was: If I were to purchase the license on the first day of a calendar year instead of the first day of my freshman year of college, would the license last me all the
 way through the last day of the fourth year? I meant if I were to activate Office 365 on January 1, 2016, would I be able to use the program all the way until December 31, 2019 before I have to renew my subscription? I want Office 365 mostly for the 1TB of
 cloud storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other question was: If I were to start my college career at Bucks for two years, then transfer to a four-year college for my junior and senior years, and finally complete my education at graduate school for my Ph.D. in Computer Science, would I be able
 to renew my university license for four more years?</p>

    <title>Definitions for Paste Option Icons in Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbi hawkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Definitions for Paste Option Icons in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I cannot believe how impossible it has been to find an answer to this question; I assumed I would be able to look it up on the web in just a few minutes as it seemed to be so basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2016, in the Paste Options box when you want to paste something, you get four or five different icons. That may not be all of them, but I know there is a blank clipboard, a clipboard with text on it, a clipboard with a paintbrush, a clipboard with
 a curved arrow, and a clipboard with a capital A.&nbsp; What do each of these icons represent??&nbsp; I have tried hovering over each one, which is usually how you discover this, but no explanation/description comes up.&nbsp; I have searched using
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>every</strong></span> keyword I could think of ("Paste Option Icons", "Word 2016 Paste Definitions", etc., etc.) and I get pages and pages of results but they all have to do with removing/hiding the Paste Options
 box itself and that is NOT what I want to do.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried selecting each of the icons in turn, but it just isn't clear to me what effect any particular choice is having.&nbsp; I have even purchased two different electronic quick start guides hoping to find the answer to this question, but they have been
 no help either (and I refuse to buy an entire book just to find out this one minor thing)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please</strong> can someone tell me, what ARE the various Paste options and which icon applies to each option??</p>

            <p>Thanks Suzanne.&nbsp; That was helpful.&nbsp; I guess the difference is that you Googled "Paste Option Buttons" -- when I Googled "Paste Option
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your link provides exactly what I was looking for; a picture of each icon together with a definition of what that icon represents.&nbsp; That's great.&nbsp; However it provides this information for a total of only four different icons.&nbsp; I used a link from YOUR link
 to get here:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>THAT is what I was looking for; it provides the information for *eight* different Paste Icons and I can't imagine there are too many more than that.&nbsp; I might possibly have missed it when I was searching because I frequently included "Word 2016" as one of
 my search terms, and this article <strong>says</strong> it refers only to Word 2010 (I should explain that I went directly to Word 2016 from Word 2007, so I wouldn't necessarily know in which release some of these additions/enhancements first appeared.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy now.&nbsp; Not quite sure why it was (for me) so difficult to get this information, but I am off to make myself a Cheat Sheet so that I will never have to wonder.&nbsp; Thanks again; I very much appreciate your help.</p>

It still sounds like a Windows access rights problem.<br />

Please expand on your answer.<br />

Do you still have more than one version of Office installed?<br />
<br />
If YES you had more than one office installed, do you "need" both?<br />

If NO you don't need both, use method 2 3 or 4 of this tip to remove all of Office 2007<br />

<div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are no other Office versions installed in the computer other than Office 2013. There is a
<a href="http://www.sigmaplot.com/products/sigmaplot/sigmaplot-details.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sigmaplot</a> Excel Add-in for Microsoft Excel in the Office12 folder in 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office'.</div>

<div>I used the Office 2007 remover Fix-it from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928218 to remove any Office 2007 components. After running this fix-it, I rebooted the computer twice and ran Word 2013 as administrator, then it again showed 'configuring' window.
 I waited till it is 'configured' and rebooted once more. Then opened the word again as admin, but STILL it didn't solve the issue.. :(</div>

            OK, now that you've confirmed there are no other office installations we can rule that issue out. That leaves Access Rights.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Windows has been tightening up granting of "access rights", starting in Vista and they get tighter in Win7 and Win8.
<br />
<br />
Windows apps run from a "generic" registry key called "Current User" to make programming easiers. When you log in to a specific ID, your registry settings are copied to the "Current User" key.&nbsp; When you shut down, if there have been changes, like installing
 Office, the current user settings are copied back to your specific ID in the registry.&nbsp; What appears to be happening is that at shut down the settings are not being copied from current user to your specific ID. Therefore they have to be recreated each time,
 and you see the "configuring" message.&nbsp; There are also specific folders and files setup under your specific user profile but they are less of a problem.
<br />
<br />
Here are some more tips on access rights:<br />
<p><a href="http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Why-Applications-Dont-work-standard-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Why-Applications-Dont-work-standard-users.html</a>

<p>This is a good tool for reporting on file access rights</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Sometimes the problem has been that Windows has had problems granting the right access to files, folders and the registry. The following tips provide some workarounds.</p>
<p>As you go from XP to Vista to Win7 certain operations require higher access rights to perform. These access rights are “higher” than even those granted to the Administrator ID by default. These “elevated” rights are accessed by way of
 the UAC confirmation dialog which is invoked when you select to “Run As Administrator”.</p>
<p>In theory, any one of the following tips should work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The process is: run one of the fixes, run each affected Office app, reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!) TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo”
 at play here. We do it because it works!), try the office apps again to confirm the fix worked.</p>

<p>If you run a Setup program without starting the Windows Installer service, you may receive the following error message:</p>
<p><i>The Windows Installer service could not be accessed. Contact your support personnel to verify that the windows Installer service is properly registered.</i></p>
<p>The Windows Installer service does not start if you clear the
<strong><span>Load system services</span></strong>&nbsp;check box in the System Configuration utility. To use the Windows Installer service when system services are not loaded, you must start the service manually. To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Click <strong><span>Start </span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong>, right-click
<strong><span>Computer</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>Manage</span></strong>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In the console tree, click <strong><span>Services and Applications</span></strong>, and then click

<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In the details pane, right-click <strong><span>Windows Installer</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Another option to try is simply creating a new (user class) userid to see if that will avoid the access rights problems you are having now with the current ID.<br />

<p>Rich, I don't work MS, I don't have contact "some other fellow in MS". I am NOT PAID to provide this help! I am just another user like yourself. This is primarily a user driven forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Support", especially remote support like this at it's core IS GUESSWORK! I am not sitting the problem computer, so I cannot see the symptoms. I have to GUESS at the cause of problem, and therefore the possible solution(s) based on the descriptions that
 the user provides.&nbsp; In response to our questions, Kart provided some additional information that suggested to me that the problem was "Windows Access Rights". Sorry, that is not a simple issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for MS providing "better support", I agree. But they don't. So deal with it, or like Kart, "vote with your feet..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes this software is difficult:</p>
<ul>
<li>Word has over a thousand commands.</li><li>that requires millions of design decisions</li><li>Word has a history of over 30 years of development<br />
</li><li>that means there have been thousands of different programmers coding in it, adding to complexity</li><li>"Office" is a bundle of several program of similar size and complexity as Word, making for a complex install process<br />
</li><li>each "Office" program was developed separately, adding to the complexity of the install process</li><li>these programs have evolved from running in DOS, to 8bit Windows to 16 bit Windows to 32 and 64 bit Windows "NT"</li></ul>
<p>At the other end from "MS Word", if you want a simple "word processor", use Notepad. It has no features, so it is very simple to use. Just type and hit enter at the end of each paragraph.&nbsp; No install required, it "comes with" Windows, free!</p>

    <title>Micro-freezes in Outlook 2011 with spinning wheel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Micro-freezes in Outlook 2011 with spinning wheel</h2>
                    Since a few days I'm experiencing the "micro-freezes" with Mac's spinning wheel in Outlook, and it is making it almost unusable.
<div>Every few minutes, Outlook completely hangs and displays the spinning wheel for 3-4 seconds, during which anyway it buffers what I'm typing or clicking.</div>
<div>The issue does not happen when "Work Offline" is selected.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It worked quite well for about 6 months. Other colleagues had the same issue after a similar amout of time and switched to mail.app.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am only using an Exchange account, over https. No pop, no imap.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've read somewhere about problems with signatures, and I've tried to disable it: no changes.</div>
<div>I've disabled any Sync Service in Outlook: no changes.</div>
<div>I've rebuild Outlook's database: no changes.</div>
<div>I've looked at Wireshark while Outlook was running and didn't noticed anything strange before or after the freezes. Outlook's network activity stops during the freeze.</div>
<div>Outlook's Progress window doesn't show anything before, during or after the freezes.</div>
<div>I've enabled Outlook's Error Logs: nothing is shown.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Did anybody manage to solve the problem, or everybody just switched to mail.app?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'll try to create a new Identity and start from scratch with it; I'm also going to try and switch from https to http. After that, I'll move to mail.app.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<h2>            Bitlocker problem with 10066 preview build</h2>
                    I am in the fast track and received the latest build via update. Update installs fine and appears to work fine until I shutdown my Dell&nbsp; Venue 8 Pro. On restart the bitlocker repair starts and asks for a pin. I have the pin but can't enter it because the
 onscreen key and my blue tooth keyboards cannot &nbsp;enter the data. The only thing I could do was use my factory recovery USB to restore the original 8.1 operating system and start over. Since a large part of Windows 10 is targeted to tablets, I think this is
 a major problem.
