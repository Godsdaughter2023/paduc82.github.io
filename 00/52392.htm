            <p>Put SD card in slide on laptop.&nbsp; Go to Search the web and Windows bar (on bottom left of taskbar) and type in the word Photo.&nbsp; Go to Best Match and click on PHOTOS (Trusted Windows Store App).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the window opens go to the top right of the page and locate the icon that that is square with a downward arrow (the word IMPORT will pop up).&nbsp; Click on it and then you will see your pictures from your SD Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can put a check mark on the photos that you want to import into your computer. &nbsp;Click Continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next screen says: Start Importing?&nbsp; Now if you want to put the photos in a specific folder you will need to click on the words: change where they’re imported.&nbsp; For example: you want to put the photos in Pictures.&nbsp; Click on Pictures and click on New Folder
 and name your folder.&nbsp; Then click twice on: Add this folder to Pictures. (you will see that the address above “change where they’re imported” has now changed to where you want the pictures to go).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if you wish to delete the pictures from your SD card put a checkmark in the box to delete the pictures from your SD card otherwise leave unchecked if you wish to leave them on your SD card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then click on IMPORT.&nbsp; You are done!!!&nbsp; Yeah!!!</p>

<p>gostaria da ajuda de vocês !! &nbsp;pois estou já desanimado com o jogo &nbsp;!!! eu comprei o Batman Arkham Origins original para o xbox 360 nas americanas mas a cada 30 ou 40 minutos no maximo ele trava o console todo &nbsp;!!! assim é impossível zerar , pois tenho que
 ir desligar o console ou ejetar o jogo do console !! isso é um erro na minha versão do jogo ?? ou no console ?? se o HD tem pouco espaço &nbsp;causa algum problema ?? &nbsp;mas isso só acontece no Batman , eu tenho GTA &nbsp;V que estava tendo erros no xbox e o meu roda
 normal !!! o meu xbox é o slim com 250 Giga de HD mas só tem 32 Giga livres</p>

<p>esse risco redondo é característico de quem movimenta o console com o jogo dentro, a única coisa que vc pode tentar fazer é instalar o jogo no HD, caso não consiga, arrume alguém que tenha o mesmo jogo e instale e use sua mídia arranhada apenas pra dar entrada
 no jogo</p>

<p>No Batman Arkham Origins, não consigo passar a fase "Detenha o Coringa" no objetivo "Derrote o Bane", pois apos o trailler de inicialização, a tela fica cinza impedindo a continuidade do jogo. Alguem sabe como resolver o problema?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update 1809 - Blue Screens</h2>
                    <p>I've gotten at least 20 blue screens since I updated to 1809 on 1/10/19, ranging from IRQ not less or equal, Kernal Security Check Failure, Driver Verifier Detected Violation, Unexpected Store Exception, Bad Pool Caller, and Store Data Structure Corruption.
 I've tried everything to fix it (specific fixes for specific blue screens, updating my drivers, re-downloading drivers, deleting updates, resetting my entire computer) and nothing works. Nothing specific seems to set a blue screen off so I never know when
 to expect them.</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

            Hi Megan
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />If its a custom built computer, what is the make and model of the motherboard?
<br />
<br />Its possible you might need to update the BIOS.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

            There are some important updates I see for this model I recommend you apply:
<br />
<br />BIOS update November 2018

<p>I will assume these are on-line games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Buffering usually occurs if the internet connection is slow and the computer is waiting to get enough data to continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What internet connection do you have?&nbsp; How fast is it.&nbsp; Are these games form one site only?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply - But this is not a on line game as you call it. </p>
<p>This is a&nbsp;simulation game but over a period of one hour this game goes into buffing between 7 and 10 times&nbsp;and everything freezes up for 5 minutes at a time before freeing itself again while this game is played &nbsp;it is not connected to the internet at all,
 this buffing also occurs when using Word but not so regular hope the helps a little more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div>This may have been annoying and I appreciate the efforts that you’ve made to resolve the issue.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>The probable cause for this issue could be due to&nbsp;incorrect proxy settings on internet explorer or could also&nbsp;be due to&nbsp;the internet connection issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To understand this issue better, I would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Which browser are you using, is it Internet Explorer or any third party browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox etc..?</p>
<p>2. What type of internet connection are you using, is it wired or wireless?</p>
<p>3. Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Let’s follow these methods and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>If you're using Internet Explorer, then we recommend you to check if proxy server settings are enabled. To do this, try these steps:</div>
<div>Disable proxy server on Internet Explorer (IE):</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;Click Start, type inetcpl.cpl and hit Enter.</div>
<div>b.&nbsp;Click Connections tab, click LAN settings button.</div>
<div>c.&nbsp;Uncheck "Use a proxy server for your LAN" under proxy server and make sure to check “Automatically detect IP address.”</div>
<div>d.&nbsp;Click Ok to apply the changes.</div>
<div>e.&nbsp;Open Internet Explorer and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>If you still facing the issue, I suggest you to reset Winsock.<br />
<br />
This will take care of any winsock corruption that can lead to connectivity issues.<br />
<br />
To reset Winsock, follow these steps:</p>
<div>a. Click Image and typecmd in the Start Search box.<br />
b. Right-click cmd.exe and click Run as administrator.<br />
c. Press Continue.<br />
d. Type "netsh winsock reset" without the quotes at the command prompt, and then press ENTER.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> If the command is typed incorrectly, you will receive an error message. Type the command again. When the command is completed successfully, a confirmation appears, followed by a new command prompt.</div>
<div>
<p>e. Type exit, and then press ENTER.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. Unfortunately the procedure s were unsuccessful. I was able to access certain website s through safari, but aol, explorer and Google Chrome no luck. I believe it is some type of security issue. For example I can get on amazon no
 problem. But if I try to make a purchase , going to the checkout page it says page cannot be displayed. Same problem with numerous other pages. In fact I'm responding to this on my phone. The Microsoft sign in page would not display. So I don't know? &nbsp;I'm
 not very computer savy. Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            <div>Hi Chrismineo,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You are Welcome, thank you for replying with the status of the issue and the required information.<br />
Sorry for delayed response.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Based on your reply, I understand that you are getting This Page cannot be displayed error for certain websites you try to visit on the Internet Explorer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let's try the following methods and check if it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>Run the Internet explorer performance troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Open the Internet Explorer Performance troubleshooter by </div>
<div>1. Click on Start button.</div>
<div>2. Picture of the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. 3. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting.
<div>4. Click View all, and then click Internet Explorer Performance. </div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> Troubleshoot the "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" error in Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to follow all the troubleshooting steps given under “Windows 7” from this link and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>"Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" error</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956196</span></a>
<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Important: </strong>The System Restore restores the computer back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers and also reset the recently
 changed settings on the computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Volume keeps decreasing to zero automatically</h2>
                    <p>The volume icon is stuck on the top left of the screen, and whenever I increase the volume using the display or keyboard it keeps spiraling down to zero/mute. I have run my anti virus program, malwarebytes, and audio troubleshoot but they all detected nothing.
 I have updated the realteck high definition audio driver, rolled it back, even unistalled it and rebooted my computer, but the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strangest thing is when I switch my laptop to tablet mode the volume becomes stuck at 100 and increases automatically to 100 whenever I try to decrease it.</p>

            That's a weird issue you've got. But based on your claims, I instantly thought of a possibly stuck volume button. Have you tried to check if your Volume down key is stuck? I'm not sure what model of laptop you have but if you have Volume buttons on either
 your keyboard or at the sides of your LCD screen (since you stated that you can turn it to Tablet mode), it would be best to check those out for any dirt stuck in the sides which could cause such.

<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some older programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

<h2>            How to recover boot sector or how to recover Windows PID when you can&#39;t get into Windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a Lenovo G780 laptop that came pre-installed with Windows 8 and I upgraded to Windows 8.1. After moving a partition, my computer does not boot at all, including the recovery partitions. It eventually goes to a blank blue screen and hangs after
 failing to boot the OS or recovery partitions. I have a couple questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there any way to 'redirect' the computer to boot properly again? (see details below)</p>
<p>2. If not, is there any way to retrieve my PID for Windows 8.1 from outside of Windows (like in a Linux LiveUSB environment) so I can just reinstall with a friend's disc and reactivate without having to buy a second copy of Windows (which I can't afford!)</p>
<p>3. If not, is there any way to create a recovery USB from outside of Windows so I can use that to recover the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>More detailed information and questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had about 50GB of unallocated data in between my primary partition where Windows 8.1 was installed, and some little partition after it that I think was related to Win8.1. It was there because I shrunk the primary partition. This has never caused a problem
 before, but then I decided to move the little partition to the other side of the unallocated data using 3rd party software. Afterward, I restarted my computer, and now I can't boot into my operating systems (I also had Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon installed, which
 also had never caused a problem. I moved the partition because I was trying to get the unallocated space on the other side of my Linux partition to expand it. I clearly did not understand the dangers of moving partitions!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am using my Mint 17.1 LiveUSB installer to run a temporary version of Linux Mint so I can at least access a web browser easily. I am able to mount the partitions on my HDD and look through the files -- everything seems perfectly in-tact. All of my
 files and Windows 8.1 and the recovery partitions seem unharmed on the drive, of course... the computer just doesn't seem to know how to boot anymore because the partitions are "mixed up" now I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do is just get the boot sector up and running again without having to lose my Windows. I have all the files I care about backed up on OneDrive already, so losing other data is not important. Plus it's all still there so I can still access
 it from my Linux LiveUSB. But I just don't want to lose access to my Windows, because I don't have an install disc and even my PID and stuff is stuck inside that installation. If I wipe the drive, I essentially completely lose Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't do that, I would like to somehow retrieve my PID and stuff so I can reactivate Windows again. My friend has a Windows 8 install disc she bought through her school. I feel like there might be a way to recover this somehow -- not only is the data
 in-tact on my drive, still, but I also sign in to my Microsoft account every time I log into Windows and have registered the software, as well as many other softwares like Visual Studio. Perhaps there is some way I can use my Microsoft account to activate
 a fresh install of Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I can't do that at all, is there some way I can create a recovery USB from the partitions while in Linux? I can access the data by mounting the drives easily. But I'm not sure where to go from there. Will this even work? I'm assuming I'd have to restore
 the PC with the recovery USB if this was the case.</p>

</p><p>I doubt if you can recover your partition.</p>
<p>To find out you would have to contact the 3rd Party Partition Support group</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can contact Lenovo and order Recovery Media from them for a small cost.</p>

    <title>Problem connecting to the Windows Error Reporting service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alsmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem connecting to the Windows Error Reporting service</h2>
                    
<p>I get this error when checking for solutions to problems in Windows 7 Reliability Monitor.&nbsp; As discussed in a similar thread, solution posted was to purge all reports using disk cleanup.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;this just removes the error being reported that is causing
 the problem.&nbsp; I don't want to delete my problem history because it is valuable information for debugging, etc.</p>
<p>It seems to be certain problems that cause the issue whereas other errors in error log are able to upload information.&nbsp; The errors that remain in bold type are the ones that can't be reported.</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to fix this.&nbsp; It seems to be&nbsp;errors that have a MEMORY.DMP and&nbsp;Win7 doesn't want to upload hundreds of MB.&nbsp; I've checked and each MEMORY.DMP also has a corresponding minidump.&nbsp; Why not upload that one?&nbsp; Still too big a file?&nbsp; Maybe just the
 wording of the error message needs to change?</p>
<p>Posting this mainly to suggest fixing this in SP1 (or sooner) and also to let others know more about this issue.&nbsp; At least for me, it isn't a network connection issue, firewall issue, etc.</p>

<p>hi ALSmith,</p>
<p>hope you are well,</p>
<p>just wanted to confirm, that you say&nbsp;this erorr&nbsp;it is not a firewall issue,</p>
<p>so that would mean that you do have windows firewall check box selected for performance logs and alerts allowed.</p>
<p>the only reason i ask is due to the fact that i myself had the same issue.</p>
<p>untill i allowed performance logs and alerts through my firewall then every report went through to Microsoft afterwards.</p>
<p>hope this helps.</p>
<p>please do&nbsp;let me know.</p>
<p>yours</p>

hi alsmith,</p>
<p>thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>a little confused as to your statement quote&nbsp;" it seems that the firewall setting you mention would block reporting any issues that required sending information " the only setting that i suggested was to allow performance logs through windows firewall. this
 does not in any way pervent the report from being sent.!</p>
<p>have you also checked your action centre settings in regard to how reports are sent and what information is sent along with who is allowed to send the reports.?</p>
<p>as i myself have everything set to automatically check and send extra information if needed along with allowing all user's to check for error's.</p>
<p>i do refer you back to my last thread as like i said, i did have to set performance logs in windows firewall to allow the reports to go through.</p>
<p>however as you have thrid party software installed, i wouls suggest to perform a complete external back up and disable/uninstall all thrid party software. then perform an upgrade install. then set performance monitor settings and then check for solutions
 for&nbsp;error's. to see if that repiars the issue.</p>
<p>this way you will&nbsp;know if is is due to a corrupt/missing file or an network issue due to your thrid party software</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>
<p>yours&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let me rephrase to make it more clear (the italics are the added part.)</p>
<p>. . . . Also, it seems that <em>if </em>the firewall setting you mention <em>was not&nbsp;enabled it</em> would block reporting any issues that required sending information.&nbsp; That is not the case for me.&nbsp; As mentioned above, many&nbsp;problems do get reported; the
 issue lies with problems that I believe are trying to upload a MEMORY.DMP file.&nbsp; . . . .</p>
<p>In other words, not having performance logs and alerts enabled in Windows firewall would block all problem reports that want to upload data, not just a select few.&nbsp; So, that can't be the problem.</p>
<p>I did try allowing performance logs and alerts in Windows firewall as you suggested, it didn't help.</p>
<p>There is only 1 user account on this HTPC and it is set to automatically check for solutions.&nbsp; Win7 was asking if I wanted to send more information about the problem.&nbsp; After I click "Send Information" is when I get the error.&nbsp; I tried setting it to automatically
 check for solutions and send additional report data if needed; now I get the error without being asked to send additional information.</p>
<p>Since this is a trivial problem I am not going to spend the hours required to implement your other suggestion.&nbsp; However, I have tried something that is probably just as good:</p>
<ol>
<li>I did a <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> check and no problems were found.&nbsp; This should find any missing/corrupted files for the OS.
</li><li>I updated Zonealarm since they just released an update and then completely reset it (shift-ctrl-right click then choose reset from menu).&nbsp; This should take care of any missing/corrupted files and/or setting for ZASS.
</li></ol>
<p>Problem is still there.</p>
<p>Since your problem reporting seems to be working here is an experiment you can try&nbsp;-- see what happens if you have a problem where you get a BSOD and have a memory dump.&nbsp; Then see if the problem is reported without error when Win7 tries to upload the memory
 dump file.&nbsp; Here is what you need to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>In advanced system properties set Write Debugging Information to Kernel Memory Dump.&nbsp; This will give you a big MEMORY.DMP file in the Windows folder along with a minidump in Windows\minidump.
</li><li>Create a BSOD.&nbsp; From experts exchange website I found this trick - "in the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt\Parameters, create a DWORD value called CrashOnCtrlScroll, and set it to 1. Then reboot, and after that,
 you can cause a crash by holding the right Ctrl key, and pressing the Scroll Lock key twice."
</li><li>Check to see if problem is reported.&nbsp; You can manually check for solution so you don't have to wait for automatic check.&nbsp; If the entry stays in bold face type then it isn't being reported completely.
</li></ol>
<p>Let me know what you find out.</p>

<p>hi alsmith,</p>
<p>thank you for getting back to me,</p>
<p>due to the fact that i myself have windows 7 ultimate and have performance monitor reporting set to automatic and have all the check boxes selected in windows firewall set to allow...and no error's in reporting regardless of the size of the file (i.e memory.dmp).
 it is safe to say that this error that you have is not a windows 7 error, unless you have missing/corrupt instailation. which could be repiared in about 1-2 hours with an upgrade. sfc/scan will not always detect all error's, i had ran the same scan over five
 times in the past to attempt recovery of bad files and sfc/scan still reported no error's. evan though i could see them myself. however considering that you do not wish to perform this recovery operation, and the fact that you do have thrid party software
 managing your os. then the only other option open to you is to establish if it is a corruption/interferance of those said third party programs.(i.e a network issue)</p>
<p>you also say the problem is "trivial", please do not class an error as trivial. (remember the snowball effect) my own system took 3 install's but i did also wait and check everything before i reinstalled all my other software. i would strongly recomend that
 you complete an upgrade now before issue's become worse....evidently.</p>
<p>yours</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. I tried many of the proposed solutions, but I am not ready to try a complete upgrade as ashley suggests. I think ALSmith is correct in that MS just doesn't want to accept those large memory dumps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>@ashleytalbot, did you try ALSmith's experiment? You may help confirm that ALSmith's theory is correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had win7 "shut down unexpectedly" five times in the last 3 weeks that I have had win7, and the only reports that can't be sent to MS are the ones with memory dumps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft really needs to fix this error sending issue and then fix the BSOD issue that causes the error in the first place.&nbsp; I thought Windows 7 was supposed to be 'more' stable than XP?</p>

hi hermetic,</p>
<p>thanks for joining this thread sorry to see that you are having simalar issue's. i have outlined steps above to repiar the instailation of corrupt/missing files, as that is the quickest and safest opion to complete. any information given in any thread is
 only a suggestion you do not have to follow any of the points that i have made. as you have stated that you do not wish to follow the steps outlined above then there is no further assistance that i can offer you. in regard to your suggestion, that i follow
 alsmith's expeirment. i would strongley suggest to anyone NOT to follow that idea as it is not good practice to have a fully operational pc and force a crash.(next your be asking me to crash my porsche to check its safety record)&nbsp;the correct procedure is to
 repiar. to prevent further issue's developing. fix now or fix later your choice.</p>

<p>hi ashleytalbot</p>
<p>Wow!&nbsp; You had to do 3 repair installs to get Win7 running properly??&nbsp; That's too bad.&nbsp; My five installs of Win7 (3 Ultimate, 2 Home Premium) went very smoothly -- much faster than XP install, no drivers needed to be added for initial install, etc.&nbsp; Evidently,
 the snowballs are in your computer room!&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>I've really only had 3 glitches - the Windows Cardspace error it seems everyone had (I disabled&nbsp;the service, I don't use it), this issue, and one more that I will start a new thread&nbsp;for - 0x9F BSOD which is a DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE.&nbsp; This also seems
 to be a very 'popular' issue with many people's network drivers.&nbsp; I've gotten that one to settle down but it still happens every couple of weeks.&nbsp; And no, it doesn't affect network communications, just going into/out of standby.</p>
<p>So, all five of my PC's with the two flavors of Win7 have this same issue with problem reporting.&nbsp; I can't imagine that all 5 of my computers have been corrupted in such a way&nbsp;that they all produce the same error.</p>
<p>Well, just to be safe I tried the BSOD experiment myself.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it seems that it only works in XP.&nbsp; No BSOD occurred in Win7 so this test method must have been removed from the driver.&nbsp; For anyone that might be interested in using it for XP here
 is more info:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.tomstricks.com/how-to-manually-force-windows-xp-to-generate-a-stop-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.tomstricks.com/how-to-manually-force-windows-xp-to-generate-a-stop-error/</a>&nbsp; All this does is create a stop error.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, it's safer than pressing the reset button; for the stop error the OS does a protective shutdown and gracefully restarts
 whereas for a reset button press the OS gets stopped in its tracks.&nbsp; Just make sure no files are open, OS isn't doing update in background, etc. and you should be fine.</p>
<p>I wouldn't compare inducing a stop error with a driver test routine to crashing a car; its more like the technician at the car dealership invoking one of the built-in diagnostics in the engine control module with their test tool.&nbsp; No harm done, the problem
 is diagnosed and they fix your car.</p>
<p>Well, I think I'll wait a few more days to see if anyone else has any other ideas -- if not, I'll ask to close this thread with 'no solution found.'</p>

<p>hi alsmith,</p>
<p>thank you for your feedback, not as smooth as you say or there would be no thread.&nbsp;just cause you can not imagine something does mean that it can not happen. to make sure its got to be worth an hour of your time to complete an upgrade install, after all,
 it will not do any harm. at least then you can positively rule that out. as you have to agree if one user has this issue with the same os as another user that does not, (i.e windows 7 ultimate)&nbsp;then it is fair to say that it is not a os fault but either a
 configuration,network,third party interferance or install error by the user (installer) this is why i suggested that you have the os cleanly installed and fully tested before you then install your thrid party software. as from experiance having microsoft's
 settings first, fully established is best practice, with nothing else connected or installed. then build up from the foundations.</p>
<p>yours</p>

            <p>Hello Nova,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the model number of gateway computer?</p>
<p>2. Do get BtvStack.exe error on any particular application?</p>
<p>3. Which version of internet explorer is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What is btvstack.exe?</strong></p>
<p>Extension Core is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth software suite that manages installed devices with the integrated combo WLAN and Bluetooth chips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>“Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth technology. It’s a great way to sync and share files, photos, music, games and videos at the speed of Wi-Fi, but with the ease of Bluetooth. It’s also a great way to extend and enhance the usability of small mobile devices by
 connecting to external headsets, keyboards, mice and printers. Such efficient, very low-power connectivity brings devices together and transfers content at close range. And, it cooperates with Qualcomm Atheros’ Wi-Fi in versatile combos that deliver the best
 of both wireless technologies.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btbip.dll is a type of DLL file associated with Bluetooth Software developed by Broadcom Corporation for the Windows Operating System. The latest known version of Btbip.dll is 6.5.1.3700, which was produced for Windows. This DLL file carries a popularity
 rating of 1 stars and a security rating of "UNKNOWN".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What Are DLL Files?</strong></p>
<p>DLL ("dynamic link library") files such as btbip.dll are small programs, similar to EXE ("executable") files, which allow multiple software programs to share the same functionality.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1. Run system file checker to fix corrupt system files.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes this kind of unexpected behavior shown by Windows due to some missing or corrupt important system files. I would suggest you to rum Microsoft Safety Scanner SFC /SCANNOW to scan the system integration and fix system file corruption (if any).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sfc /scannow (System File Checker) command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2. If the issue does not resolve run Microsoft security scan for virus issue.</strong></p>
<p>Run Microsoft Security Scanner as there can be possible virus on the computer</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3. If the issue does not resolve try to install latest Bluetooth drivers from manufacturer website.</strong></p>
<p>Try to install latest Bluetooth drivers from manufacturer website and check the issue.</p>

<p>I have a friend on live, gamer tag- <b>[Mod Removed]</b>&nbsp;who keeps booting me offline, which not only affects my xbox but other devices to. I'm not sure how to get round it effectively as i want to stay in parties with him because we want to talk to other
 people (that can't boot me offline), i was just wandering if there was a way to stop him from doing it in the future...</p>

<p>It needs to be reported to your ISP as what they are doing is illegal.</p>
<p>Meantime if you are going to continue to game with him then i would imagine he is going to continue to do it.</p>

<p>Indeed, WHY would anyone want to play with a person booting people offline??? &nbsp; &nbsp; No message needs to be sent for a report to be filed but, contacting your ISP is a good idea. &nbsp; &nbsp;You could try changing your IP address aswell---- REMOVE this member from your
 friends list then Block communications, Avoid, and Mute. &nbsp; &nbsp;Please file a report through your console and DO NOT send a message to this user again. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GOOD LUCK!!!!</p>

<p>Hey guys, I think I hold the record of getting kicked offline myself, but now I do not have that problem. Chances are your ISP gives you a dynamic IP address, so in most cases the advice in the following youtube video I made could most likely be of some
 assistance.</p>

            Sorry for the late response I had to reinstall windows because of how much it was freezing. I recently replaced my motherboard, cpu, graphics card, and hard drive because a shock or something went through my motherboard and made every part in the pc not
 work right or at all.

<p>HI Raiden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information you have provided since you have already replaced the parts of the device, and the old ones are not working, it is not possible to retrieve/transfer the license. And take note that transferring license has some restrictions. We suggest
 that you visit/contact your local technicians and see if they can repair/recover the old parts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Since the latest dashboard update last year, I've been randomly disconnecting whenever I'm not playing games online. Like, when I play GoW or Halo I have no issues but if I'm talking to my friend whilst I'm on the dashboard or I'm watching a movie while
 downloading an arcade game it just disconnects.</p>

<p>Not once have I every had this and now it's really starting to irritate me because I'm trying to download Toy Soldiers: Cold War and it just keeps on disconnecting me even if I pause the download.</p>

<p>Hey oSPo III Towlie! The dashboard update is rolling out in waves, if you haven't been prompted to do the update, don't worry it will happen over the next week! Regarding your connection issues throughout the last year, can I have you please go to
<a href="http://speedtest.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://speedtest.net</a> on a computer on the same network as your console, take the test there, and post the result image back here. Thanks!<br />

<p>My net is capped at the moment so I can't really do much activities but even when it is not capped it has this issue. And it's nothing regarding my system because it happened on my old Xbox after the update.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 --- Airplane Mode Will Not Turn Off &#47; Wi-Fi will not turn on</h2>
                    Since I upgraded my Dell laptop from Windows 8 to Windows 10 on July 29 Airplane Mode will not turn off and Wi-Fi will not turn on. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The button recognizes the cursor but will not change. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;How do you fix this or is Microsoft working
 on a fix for this? &amp;nbsp; My Ethernet connection to the router works. &amp;nbsp;

            Don't release something if it isn't working correctly.&nbsp; You have had a year to get these normal everyday bugs out before its release.&nbsp; Windows 10 is more like a virus it is destroying more normal functions on my computer with every day's use.&nbsp; Beginning
 to really hate this.
