    <title>.NET Framework version 1.1.4322 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            .NET Framework version 1.1.4322</h2>
                    When attempoting to install a pre-Windows 7 product, it says .NET Framework 1.1.4322 must be installed first. I have gone to the relevant download page and tried to install it, and it appears to have been installed, but the program still says I need to
 install it. I am guessing that this version is not compatible with Windows 7. What is the equivalent framework? Is there any equivalent way I can run the program without using NET framework?

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Windows 7 comes with 3.5 version of .NET Framework and all the earlier versions of .NET Framework is pre-installed with the same. As you are saying
 that the program that you are installing is a pre-Windows 7 program, it might not be compatible with Windows 7. I would suggest you to check the compatibility of the program in the below given compatibility link.</span></span></span></p>

            <pre>Hi!
Welcome to our community.
This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
Yes, it's possible!
Here’s how to create a slideshow with Microsoft Photos in simple steps:
 
Step #1 – Create a New Video Project
When you open the Microsoft Photos app, you will see the photo management interface organized with either Collection, Albums, People, and Folders, or (if you have the most updated version) Collection, Creations, and Folders.
    Collection includes all your media organized by date.
    Albums / Creations shows your albums and video projects.
    People helps you to tag and organize photos accordingly.
    Folders shows media in a folder structure.
For video editing features, you should click on Create, which offers three options: Automatic video with music, Custom video with music, and Album. With the recent update, this menu has been replaced with Video Remix, Video projects and Album, so which menu you see depends on your version of the app.
    Automatic video / Video remix: You select photos and videos, while the app arranges the content with a theme, effects and background music. You can edit it afterwards.
    Custom video / Video projects: You import your photos and videos, arrange the order and duration of each item, and add music and effects yourself.
    Album: This is available to organize your photos and videos into different albums.
Click on “Create” and select “Custom video” to start creating your slideshow.
 
Step #2 – Import Your Photos and Videos
Once you select the Custom video / Video projects option, the Microsoft Photos app will ask you to select what you’d like to add. That’s when you upload the photos and videos from the dedicated slideshow folder.
Go to Folders and click on Add a folder. Once you find and add your slideshow content folder here, you’ll see it under Folders from now on. Here, mine is named Weekend Slideshow.
Add your content folder to the project.
When you are in Folders, click on the folder where you have the slideshow content. Select all the photos and videos you want to include in your slideshow and click on Create. Then you will see a blue screen telling you that the app is creating a video from the selected items.
Microsoft Photos creates a new video from your content folder when you click Create.
Once the app creates your video, you will see a new screen with a Project library on the top left, Storyboard at the bottom, and Preview on the top right. The app will immediately ask you to name your video.
Name your new slideshow!
From now on, you don’t need to save your project as the app will automatically save it for you throughout your editing process. If you want to leave your video project and continue later, no problem, you can always find your video project under Albums.
 
Step #3 – Set Your Picture Aspect Ratio
The [picture aspect ratio defines the shape of the video display. The Microsoft Photos video editor offers three picture aspect ratios to select from with “width:height” format:
    4:3 (standard TV format)
    16:9 (widescreen TV format)
    Portrait (handy for social media shares)
For this tutorial, I selected the widescreen TV format.
You can adjust the picture aspect ratio of your video from the top menu of the preview window.
 
Step #4– Arrange Photos and Videos
Once you add your photos and videos, check to see if your storyboard is in good order. The Microsoft Photos app adds your content to the video project in chronological order – newest to oldest, or oldest to newest. If you have sorted your content based on the file name in your dedicated folder, then your order will be mixed up here. You’ll need to do a little manual work by dragging and dropping your photos and videos from one point to another on your storyboard.
The Microsoft Photos app automatically adds your content to the storyboard with chronological order. Check if everything is in the right order, especially if your folder was arranged based on file names.
Want to get rid of a photo or video? Simply right click and select Remove it.
Want to add new content? Go to Project library and click on Add photos and videos. Add new content to the Project library. Then drag and drop the new content from the Project library to the Storyboard.
Step #5 – Edit your photos
There is only a few smaller editing functions available in Microsoft Photos, so if you need more, I suggest you edit your photos and videos according to your usual workflow before starting the video creation process. 
 
Once you click on a photo on your Storyboard, you will see six editing options: Duration, Resize, Text, Filters, Motion, and 3D effects.
 
Here are the editing features you can expect to see in the Photos app:
Duration
When you upload your photos and videos, Microsoft Photos will automatically decide on their duration. To be able to synchronize your music with the content and do some fine-tuning for the flow of your slideshow, you’ll need to adjust the duration of your photos manually. Click on Duration and either select a timing from the available menu, or add number of seconds manually. You can’t select multiple photos and adjust their duration with a single click; the app doesn’t offer that feature at this time. Instead, you have to adjust photos and videos one-by-one.
Try adjusting the duration of your content manually!
 
Resize
Click on Resize. It’s by default in the Shrink to fit mode, which scales down your photo or video to fit the screen size you selected, all the while preserving the aspect ratio of your original content. As a result, you see two black bars on the sides. If you select Remove black bars, the app will crop your photo or video in such a way that you will not see black bars anymore. This achieves a more professional look. However, note that you can’t adjust which part of your photo will remain on screen when you remove the black bars, so occasionally the end result is undesirable because it doesn’t cover a meaningful portion of the photo. In case this happens, you’ll either need to leave the black bars intact, manually crop your photo to have the right size for your screen, or drop that photo from the composition altogether.

Decide how you want to handle sizing issues!
 
Text
When you click on Text, you’ll be able to add text to your photo, with different animated text styles and layout options.
 
How to Create a Photo &amp; Video Slideshow with Microsoft Photos| OrganizingPhotos.net
You can add text to your photo or video.
 
Filters
Click on Filter to be able to choose from a variety of filters. You don’t have to use one if your content is fine the way it is, but it’s helpful if you want to adjust color balance or saturation with one click.
 
How to Create a Photo &amp; Video Slideshow with Microsoft Photos| OrganizingPhotos.net
Use filters sparingly!
 
Motion
When you select Motion, you’ll see some basic panning and zooming options to add some motion to your stills. In more advanced video editing tools, you would select where to start and end this effect on your photos, so you’d have more control on the position and timing. In Microsoft Photos, however, you select the effect and it’s automatically applied by the video editor in a default way.
 
How to Create a Photo &amp; Video Slideshow with Microsoft Photos| OrganizingPhotos.net
You can add motion to stills on a basic level!
 
3D Effects
The video editor also has some 3D effects and objects that can be used for your slideshow. I would suggest not using these unless you have the intention of creating a more informal story. Nice and elegant looking slideshows usually have a cleaner look.
Select 3D effects and then Effects, and you’ll see several effects that you can add to your photos or slides.
 
If you select 3D effects and then 3D library, you’ll find a variety of 3D objects that you can insert onto your photo slides.
Step #7 – Editing Videos
Once you click on a video on your Storyboard, you’ll see similar editing options as those for your photos, except that Duration is replaced with Trim.
How to Create a Photo &amp; Video Slideshow with Microsoft Photos| OrganizingPhotos.net
Once you click on a video on your Storyboard, you’ll see the available editing options for videos.
When you click on Trim, a new screen will appeari with two slides on your video timeline. You just need to select the portion of the video you want to keep by moving the sliders left or right. You can see the trimmed video length at top right. In all editing modes, don’t forget to click Done once you have adjusted your settings.
Step #7 – Import Music 
You music choice is very important. It’s one of the main aspects that will help you to connect emotionally with your audience. In other words, the wrong music can spoil the show. If you aren’t sure how to make your choice for the right type of music (something that matches the style and length of your slideshow and that is royalty free), have a look at the tips in my previous blog post.
Click on Music (top right menu of the Microsoft Photos app), go to Your music and select your own music file to add it to your slideshow. You can also find a selection of built-in music offered by the app under the Recommended tab. For this tutorial, I selected and downloaded a fast music by audionautix.com (“Latin House Bed”) with bright and uplifting tunes to match with the weekend fun effect.
Import your own music or select something from the library!
Step #8 – Synchronize Everything
If you select music from the built-in library, the app offers you the choice to automatically sync your video to that music’s beat.
On the other hand, if you import your own music, you’ll need to work on synchronizing the music and content manually. To be able to handle this in a practical and quick way, play your slideshow background music and identify the intervals of strong beats – basically where you would want to have your transition between photos and videos.
 
Step #9 – Export and Share 
Finished with your video editing? Click on the Export or share button to export your video and pick from the three possible options:
    Small (for email and small screens)
    Medium (for sharing online)
    Large (for big screens)
When your video is ready, it will be saved as an mp4 format in your Pictures folder under Exported videos. On the next screen, you’ll have sharing options for Mail, Skype, YouTube, and OneNote.</pre>

                    Please can someone advise me how often the thumbcache is deleted in Windows 7. Is it a set number of days or is there just a limited amount of space set aside for it so that the contents gets regularly overwritten?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>By default, Windows 7 will delete and rebuild the thumbnail cache each time something is changed in a folder. For example,
 if a folder has 10 pictures in it and you make an edit to that folder, Windows will delete and rebuild the cache for all 10 the thumbnails within that folder. However, it does not change the entire cache for the system, just the cached thumbs within that specific
 folder.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to delete the thumbcache_*.db files in the following folder (you can copy the following location in
 to the Search box directly)<br />
<b>%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>Please note after deleting the thumbcache you need to reboot your computer, so that the thumbcache will be rebuilt.</span></b></p>

<p>Hello KeithMessinger1, <br />

The warranty is linked to the device serial number, not the purchaser. With that said though, your granddaughter can register the Surface using her Microsoft account. If you currently have your account attached to it, simply sign out from it.</p>
<p>

<br />If your system can't be upgraded to 64-bit, apparently, you cannot download Skype. Otherwise, using a supported device is an option.

                    I installed some programs and remove them. Recently, I was trying to re-install them. During the process, I encounter one error " The following files did not self-register or unregister": reg_siwave.exe 已逾時，因此傳回此操作。" One of the program installed is siwave.
 I am using Win8. Can anyone help? Thanks

<h2>            Stuck as standard user with no admin rights - help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I foolishly changed my account from administrator to a standard user and now I have absolutely no rights to anything on my computer including the more nuclear option of a fresh restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at various forums and tried to see what to do but I am completely stuck. I am currently following this option:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option1:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the login screen, click Shutdown, then hold down the Shift key while selecting&nbsp;<span>Restart</span>.</li></ul>
<p>Option2:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Windows 10, select&nbsp;<span>Start</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Settings</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Update &amp; security</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Recovery</span>&nbsp;&gt; under&nbsp;<span>Advanced Startup</span>, click&nbsp;<span>Restart now</span>.</li></ul>
<p>Option3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot to recovery media.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>But is there another way? I'm the only person who uses the computer and right now it's basically just expensive junk!</p>

<p>Thanks Kapil</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problem is, when I get to the command prompt part, there's only one administrator and - soo frustratingly - I can't remember the password so I can't get through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could I would just use it to reset the system. I'm at my wit's end.</p>

<br />Please download latest Windows 10 ISO file and create bootable USB using it (of course using another device). Boot from this USB and try steps mentioned in article to access Command Prompt. See if it works that way.

            try going into recovery mode from the login screen or turn your sys on and as soon as the boot screen appears turn off the power, repeat this around 5 time till u get in the recovery menu and perform a clean up (or wat ever that is called) , will reset
 your system right to preset but will delete all your data better back it up

<p>When I go to get updates, I am advised that I have the latest version.&nbsp; BTW, if there are different interfaces, why does mine have options that aren't relevent to my version?&nbsp; I am offered the choice, but there is no choice?&nbsp; Maybe not Skype retarded; maybe

<h2>            Unable to connect to the internet and unable to connect  iphone after Windows update.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Disabled Internet access and iTunes cannot see my iPhone - possibly disabled by Windows Updates 15AUG2012 ?</p>
<p>My Sony laptop will no longer access the internet. The problem occurs whether I connect wired or wireless. At the same time as this problem has arisen iTunes no longer sees my iPhone when connected via USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Although it appears to&nbsp;connect to the local network it won't access a networked drive (which it would before). Other devices on that network connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this made sense as nothing had been changed. However I noted that there had been a batch of Windows updates (the 15 August set - but installed initially on 19 August). So I uninstalled these, but that has&nbsp;not fixed the problems, and I have no internet
 access on that computer.</p>

<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are still facing the issue then you may start the computer in safe mode with networking and perform a

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could be happening if any of the background programs is conflicting with the smooth running of your computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can
 start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<b>clean boot</b>." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

            Hi Pandit.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See the steps here:  <a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/windows-10/locked-out-of-microsoft-account-on-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/windows-10/locked-out-...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are the owner then operate under the Admin account which is what is assigned when WIndows is installed.  Otherwise you're having to approve with Admin password everything you're trying to do for no good reason, since UAC is going to block anything from outside anyway.  
<br />
<br />You wouldn't need to enable the Built-in Admin Account unless you can't access the Admin account by any other method, and then you should only use it to set up a new Admin account and then hide it again since it's for emergencies only.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you purchase a Windows 10 retail license, it is automatically a full version, so, it would transform your previous version license into a full retail upgrade, whether it is OEM or retail.

<br />If Windows 8 came pre-installed on that system, that Windows 10 licence is a OEM-DM licence and as such does not have transfer rights to another Motherboard or PC . .

            HI Saeed.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When you Upgrade to WIndows 10 it assigns a permanent Digital LIcense to the PC which inherits the rights and restrictions of the WIndows license you upgraded from.  
<br />
<br />If you ever need to change hardware the procedure to move your WIndows 10 Digital license is here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />It is possible to do yourself if you'd previously signed in with your Microsoft account and it linked to the Digital License as shown in Status at top of the Activation Settings page.  Then when you change motherboards, you'd sign in again and run the Troubleshooter.  We recently learned it will even make an exception for OEM if all else is proper.  So that's your best bet.  
<br />
<br />If not contact Microsoft Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>

</blockquote>
<p>Neither, it's a&nbsp;<em>digital</em> license, but that's only a name. A digital license is actually no license at all. I'll explain:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install Windows 10, you must have a license. But during the first year after Windows 10 was released, if you upgraded a copy of Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, Microsoft let you upgrade&nbsp;<em>without</em> a license. Microsoft called that a
<em>digital</em> license, but really, it's no license at all, even though it has a number attached to it. It's a permission slip to install Windows 10 without a license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that reason, you can't transfer your 'digital license' to another computer. Can't transfer a license you don't have in the first place.</p>

<h2>            missing bluetooth file transfer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have updated my Asus UX31A laptop from windows 7 home premium to windows 8 pro.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was trying to send a file from my pc to my phone but alas I cannot find the bluetooth file transfer wizard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am exhausted on finding the solution on the net and I cannot find one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What did I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charm bar + Search + bluetooth file transfer&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; no results</p>
<p>right click on the bluetooth icon on the system tray -&gt; no option of send file!</p>
<p>right click on the file + send to -&gt; bluetooth option not included!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the bluetooth services and its on automatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sent a file from my phone to my pc and it worked!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what's going on here? please help..really frustrating..didn't have much trouble in windows 7..do not want to revert back to windows 7 since I am kind of loving windows 8 for the moment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Update on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried removing the bluetooth driver from intel and then the send to file options in the right click+bluetooth on the system tray now exists!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however the high speed settings (bluetooth 3.0 + HS) and the wireless toggle is gone!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I tried putting back my bluetooth driver..and indeed the send to file options again is gone..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried again adding my phone as a bluetooth device and now I noticed that my phone is in the start&nbsp;panel of windows 8 and it also exist under bluetooth device when you charm bar+search+device name</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now when you click on the device it will prompt a panel I never seen before and there it is!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the send to file option is there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Mickey, </p>
<p><br />
Thank you for the post on Microsoft Community. <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description of the issue you are unable to send files from your computer to your phone through Bluetooth file transfer after you installed Windows 8.
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write to us with the following details. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
1) Do you get any error when you transfer the files from your computer to your phone?<br />
2) Is your computer able to detect your phone? Was it paired successfully?<br />

4) Did you install the Bluetooth driver after you installed Windows 8?<br />
5) Do you have any third party antivirus or security soft ware installed on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
This issue can occur if the Bluetooth drivers are not installed or if they are corrupt. Let’s try the troubleshooting method given here.
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that the both the devices are in range and discoverable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1: Ru</strong><strong>n the Hardware and Device Troubleshooter.</strong>
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer
 was installed correctly.<br />
Follow the steps given below:<br />
<br />
a) Press <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>W </strong>together.<br />
b) Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box right up corner and hit enter.<br />
c) Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>tab. <br />
d) Click on <strong>view all </strong>option on the upper left corner. <br />
e) Select the <strong>Hardware and Device </strong>options from the list. <br />
f) Click <strong>Next </strong>to run the Hardware and Device Troubleshooter. </p>
<p>Please move to the next method if the issue persists. <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Update the Bluetooth Driver from the manufacturer’s website and check for the issue.
<br />
F</strong><strong>ollow the steps given below:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>X </strong>key when you are at desktop.<br />
b) Select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
c) Find and double-click Bluetooth driver from the left panel to uninstall <br />
d) Right-click the device, and click <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.<br />
e) Select <strong>Search Automatically for Updated Driver Software</strong>.<br />

</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 3: Temporarily disable&nbsp;Windows firewall&nbsp;and Place the computer in Clean Boot then check if this fixes the issue.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Disable Windows Firewall temporarily.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can follow the steps given below to turn off Firewall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Please follow the steps given below to place the computer in Clean Boot

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>I am having a problem with the Bluetooth device. The Bluetooth will be turned on and it also will successfully pair with other devices. But in windows explorer whenever I want to send a file, there is no option for Bluetooth in "Send to" option when I right
 click the file.</p>
<p>Also I saw that the paired device names are visible in Startup window in Win 8 alongwith other applications. When I click the name of the device to which I want to send a file, a window opens as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10990234-08ac-4d59-ac32-530719888c2c" /></p>
<p>When I click on send file the dialog box asks to select a file and then there is next option. After that it shows file transfer aborted. When I click on browse remote folder it shows following dialog box<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2665301b-2c3b-43a7-8490-d78fe53f2a5a" /></p>
<p>I also updated the driver and ran the trouble-shooter which is showing no problems.</p>
<p>Please help me with this.</p>

            <p>Good luck sir! &nbsp;I have had tremendous difficulty with bluetooth configuration with my new laptop and windows 8 and 8.1. &nbsp;We are talking about 100's of hours with the manufacturer via chat, phone and in person. &nbsp;I can not find the bt functions on my laptop
 at all today and boy i am one angry dude! &nbsp;Good luck. &nbsp;Do a little surfing around and you will get an idea of how widespread the problem is. &nbsp;Try checking out Dell Inspirion 3521 bluetooth problems. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Check whether system is new, refurbished, or used</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently bought an Xbox One from Amazon. While the item I ordered was listed as new, I would like to make sure this is the case. Is there some place I can enter the serial number and check the condition of the system?</p>

<p>How did the console look when you opened it? Was everything neatly packaged? Was the plastic/foam piece that the console came wrapped in free of wrinkles? Hard to repackage to make it look perfect. Did the listing say new or refurbished? Items sold legitimately
 as refurbished have to be in different packaging or stamped/sticker ed on the box; at least here in the U.S.. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Having a sealed box is the first place to start, resealing a box is easy enough, but actually is unlikely for a retailer to be able to reseal for a lot of reasons, not saying it doesn't happen, but it doesn't happen often.</p>
<p>Also amazon aren't the only people that sell on amazon, and the number of people that don't know this is unbelievable.</p>

<p>"But Amazon is too big an online retailer to be attempting blatant scams such as reselling 2nd hand XBoxes as new."
</p>
<p>Probably true, but the same cannot be said for most of the 3rd party sellers who use Amazon as a storefront. Not to mention, even companies like Amazon could make a mistake and send out the wrong box. Unlikely, but it does happen.

Simple solution would be to download and install <br />
a media player the can play the files:<br />

One of the following freeware media players may<br />
be worth a try...they will play just about anything.<br />

    <title>Xbox One S Controller Needs PIN For Bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nxzd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One S Controller Needs PIN For Bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>So recently, I purchased an Acer laptop with Windows 10 on it. I went to pair my black Xbox One S controller to my laptop via Bluetooth, however, the controller needs a "pin" to connect to it. Any recommendations? I've tried turning the controller off/holding
 the&nbsp;Xbox button for 6 seconds, shutting down my laptop, and even checking I own the latest updates for Windows and the controller. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you haven't set up a PIN code and you're asked to enter a PIN when connecting your Xbox One controller, it may be due to an outdated Bluetooth driver. Here are the troubleshooting methods that we recommend that can help resolve this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Run the Windows troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to use Microsoft easy fix solutions</a> and run the Windows troubleshooter for devices and hardware. This automated tool can help resolve issues with connecting external devices on Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use the default PIN code</strong></p>
<p>Usually, an accessory's default PIN code is located on the controller's package.
<span>(Often, the PIN is "0000" or "1234.") </span></p>
<br />
<p><span><strong>Solution 4: Uninstall and reinstall the Bluetooth driver</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</span></li><li><span>In Device Manager, select <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Show hidden devices</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In Device Manager, select <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices by connection</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Find your Bluetooth hardware. </span></li><li><span>Right-click the Bluetooth device then select </span><span><strong>Uninstall device</strong>.</span></li><li><span>To restart your PC, select the <strong>Start</strong> button &gt; <strong>

                    I installed Win7 using a .wim that I have used successfully several times before. The .wim is on my usb drive and the computer is not connected to the network. Using a Windows PE boot disc and imagex, I applied the image. When Windows 7 started started
 for the first time and prompted me for a computer name, I entered a name with only lower and upper case characters. An error message told me that some characters I had used were not valid, and listed invalid characters, non of which I had used.<br />
<br />
What is my next course of action?<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - How can I know how much disk space each of my installed applications are using&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a two-disk system, and I prefer to let Windows use the faster, smaller&nbsp;solid-state drive (C:), whereas storing my regular applications on the conventional hard drive (D:).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I can view my installed applications from the Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features, but some of my installed applications do not list how much disk space they use.&nbsp; Just as bad, even those that do list how much space they use do not say where
 they are installed.&nbsp; It's also possible to go looking under Program Files and it's little brother to find installations, but then tracing these back to know precisely which application is using the said drive becomes tedious.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has got to be a better way!&nbsp; Isn't there?&nbsp; A program must register some sort of information in order for uninstallation to be possible in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Windows give us a way to know which folders a program SAYS it is using (i.e., in order
 for there to be an uninstallation)?&nbsp; How can we know whether the program is using&nbsp;space on C or D?

            What you see is what you get from Windows.  Some applications simply supply an uninstall application that Windows triggers. 
<br />
<br />There are two ways I can think of to get the information you want.
<br />One is "uninstaller applications". They collection information about installed programs for the uninstall process. They may be able to report the information you are looking for.
<br />
<br />For "real" / traditional applications (like Office) you can right click on the tile in the start menu, Select "More" then "Open FIle Location". This will give you the folder the application is installed in
<br />
<br />The other is a "tree mapping" application. These tools report on file space used, some do it in a text format, some in a graphical format.

<br />( Ron) I have played with it I like that you can filter out files &amp; folders as you identify you can’t touch them allowing you to focus on remaining space.  I also like that it redraws space allocations in real time as files are deleted.
<br />
<br />Locate Large files to delete
<br />Find a “tree space” type disk mapping utility. They display file and folders sizes as relatively sized boxes. This makes it easier to identify places to focus on because they have the largest impact. Here are some examples:

<p>For some reason, you hesitate to state the much-apparent truth: you have no idea.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, there is no way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, you begin offering the extremely weak statement "Some applications simply supply an uninstall application that Windows triggers", which does nothing to answer&nbsp;my question, doesn't even have the virtue of offering meaningful information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming
 the statement to be true,&nbsp;one may&nbsp;confidently infer&nbsp;that some program, somewhere, uses the technique you mention as&nbsp;a means of uninstallation.&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that's not what I asked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also disappointed by the answers you linked.&nbsp; The applications suggested only show
<strong><em>which folder are using the most space.&nbsp; </em></strong>Utilities that find which folders take up the most room does not tell me what installed programs will be linked to them, and thus offers no tangible help for my question.&nbsp;

            I do not not know of a simple answer to your question. And apparently no one else here does since no one else has chimed in. 
<br />
<br />Since that information may or may not be in Programs and Features, my best guess / deduction is that the information is optionally provided by the application to Windows during the install process, and is not gathered by Windows itself.  (not my fault it is designed that way).  Interesting, I just looked and noticed that MS Edge does not provide size information ... &lt;grin&gt; 
<br />
<br />So then (as I said), if you want that information, you have to collect it manually.  You have to identify the location the program is installed, ie by looking at the program shortcut. Then you can use any number of tools, like the folder Properties dialog, or the DIR command or even a treemapping utility to find out how much space is used by that folder, and it's subfolders. Of course that is not the full installation size, because some files can be are moved to various Windows system folders. 
<br />
<br />Since yesterday I thought of another option. There are some "uninstaller" programs that track a program during installation. One of them MAY be able to report space used by the installation. I haven't checked to confirm if they can. I'll leave that to you.

<p>Hi Constance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verification or authentication failure can lead to issues in accessing or signing in to your newly added accounts. For us to properly assist you in rectifying this concern, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from getting signed out of these accounts, are you receiving any error messages? If it's possible to send screenshots, you can attach and send them on your reply.<br />
</li><li>What specific troubleshooting steps have you taken so far?</li></ul>

<p>No error messages.</p>
<p>I had to skip the verification by an adult with debit card at first so once I had my card handy I created a dummy kid profile to verify since it said once one was verified you didn't need to do it for any others. I'm wondering if maybe that's the issue?
 I can't sign into the dummy profile either and the payment has gone through.</p>
