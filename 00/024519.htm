    <title>Migrating from Outlook 2007 to Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Migrating from Outlook 2007 to Outlook 2010</h2>
                    I have 7 email accounts under one profile in Outlook 2007. I exported all of my *.PST files hoping to use them (especially so I would not lose "sent" messages) to re-establish email accounts under Outlook 2010. But all the instructions seem to indicate
 that for each *.PST file I need to create an entirely new Profile to use the existing *.PST. How can I recreate under one profile all seven of my email accounts. If after the first profile is linked to one data file. How do I create the next? I've tried adding
 data files first but then there is no email account linked to the data file so email is not gathered. When I try to creat the email address first it then is impossible to direct the "default" to be for the email account without breaking the "default" link
 to the original profile account. Please help!

<p>First, exporting a PST is completely unnecessary and it counterproductive.&nbsp; Exporting and importing always loses data.&nbsp; If you simply uninstall Outlook 2007 and install Outlook 2010, the new Outlook should pick up your existing mail profile and its associated
 PSTs.&nbsp; If it doesn't simply add your existing PSTs into the mail profile the Outlook installation creates using the Mail applet in Control Panel.</p>

    <title>Trouble opening a Word 2013 document with Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trouble opening a Word 2013 document with Word 2007</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[Edit: If the likely source of the problem isn't version compatibility or you've never heard of such a conflict telling me that would be appreciated too]</p>
<p>
</p><p>A client that sends me documents to work on recently switched over to Office 2013 (we’re on Word 2007). Since then (or perhaps somewhat since then; this may be a correlation/observer bias problem on my end), I've had trouble opening some Word documents.
<br />
<br />
When I try to open a document, I get the generic "The file xxx cannot be opened because there are problems with the contents. There are no error details available.
<br />
<br />
Here’s where it gets a bit weird. I can change the extension from .docx to .zip and see the contents of the archive and open/view various xml files. Furthermore, I can paste it into a shared directory with a Linux VM and open the files in LibreOffice without
 a problem (I have to work in Word though, so that’s not an easy way out). <br />
<br />
I’m on a Win 7 machine running Office 2007. The files have come/created by different machines on the client's end without any discernable pattern—some files have opened fine. We asked on client to back-save and that seemed to work, but we can’t really keep
 asking them to do so. <br />
<br />
I’m kind of at an abrupt dead end diagnostics-wise. In a pinch I can save the LibreOffice as a Word doc and move forward, but I’m not comfortable with that as a solution—these are 200-page books with lots of graphics, formatting, tracked changes and comments;
 I’d hate for something to get lost in the transfers. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks~ </p>

            <p>In theory, you should be able to open 2013 DOCX files in 2007.&nbsp; If they use features that are not supported in 2007 those features/effects will be degraded into something that 2007 can handle. Sometime the effect/feature is simply stripped out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are concerned about 2007 vs 2010/2013 file structure issues, you can provide the customers with a 2007 NORMAL.DOTM or&nbsp; 2007 blank.DOCX for them to use as the starter for files they submit to you.&nbsp; When they use these files their copy of Word will
 start in "Compatibility Mode" and disable all features that are not supported by 2007.&nbsp; That should reduce the version conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The error message indicates some sort of "corruption", or at least a condition that 2007 cannot handle.&nbsp; Too bad they don't bother sharing the 'secret' details.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the file extension to ZIP (personally, I prefer to do this simply by appending .ZIP after .DOCX.&nbsp; That way there is no question about the correct original file extension.) simply enables Explorer to treat the file as a zip container. It is normal
 for you to be able to view the structure and to open the various XML sub files.&nbsp; The XML files are just text only format so they are simple and can be read by almost any text editor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, using an alternate Office suite is often a valid way of handling file corruption.&nbsp; But since your content is so complex and sensitive, I would personally prefer to ask for the file to be resent. It is a bother, but safer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried doing an Office Repair of your Office installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have all Windows Updates applied?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the direction. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I like your idea about naming conventions. My way is a bit more clumsy--I have an 'experimental' subdirectory in my personal temp folder. I copy things over there to manipulate. That way I never worry about overwriting original files or whatnot. I also have
 instantaneous backups running, etc., but I'm paranoid like that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are bureaucratic and pragmatic blocks to sending them templates, so I'm hoping that it's a compatibility quirk or something I'm overlooking (e.g. an odd issue with deletions within tracked changes). I can't guess what that issue is, but I'm short on
 diagnostic issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking of which, neither CAT or a repair install had any effect or showed any errors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another data point, Office for Mac 2008 wasn't able to open the file either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Barring any suggestion, my next step seems a bit laborious, and would appreciate any feedback:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Verify that the file won't open on a Win 7 laptop equipped with an identical version of Office 2007;</li><li>Install the trial version (or trial equivalent) of Office 365 on the laptop; </li><li>Try and open the file from the laptop</li></ol>
<p>If the file opens, I know it's some clash between 2007 and 365. If it still won't open, I'll know that the version conflict is barking up the wrong tree and I'll have explore other issues--or ask them to investigate on their end; I don't want to do that
 until I'm sure it's nothing on our side of things. That it won't open on a PC or Mac (but will on a non-Office Linux) machine suggests that if it won't open on the laptop the problem is coming from them.
</p>

<p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>I am&nbsp;aware of Windows 7 &amp; existing tools using OWC breaking, see (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Web_Components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Web_Components</a>) &amp;&nbsp;quotes from the link:<strong>The Office Web Components have been discontinued
 in </strong><strong>Office 2007</strong>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<strong>The Pivot Table and Spreadsheet web components do not function on Windows 7</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>End users have lots of tools using OWC9/10/11 rendering Spreadsheet/Pivottable charts using the former windows versions (97, 2000, XP, Vista, etc), but tools are breaking when move to Windows 7.&nbsp; In my case, I have Access 2003 and VBA scripts generating
 Spreadsheet web components and it errors out with error "Object variable or With block variable not set".&nbsp; The error is a bit misleading but simply it cannot find the OWC component.</p>
<p>Does Microsoft have a BKM on resolution?&nbsp; Will installing Office2003 solve the problem, or Windows 7 will not even allowing the registration of the OCXs?</p>
<p>Pls, any help is appreciated as many tools are breaking today.</p>
<p>thank you, anthony</p>

            It is indeed Latin :-) &nbsp;It's excerpts from a speech by Cicero. &nbsp;See&nbsp;http://www.lipsum.com/

<div>If you type even one character where it appears, the Latin will vanish and what you type will appear instead.</div>

<p>So people with apple products, laptops ECT can easily connext.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itd the type of connection that brings up an accept screen for the terms when you connect to the WiFi. So my phone, after selecting the WiFi will bring up this screen but it won't load the text in the text box. So when you press accept it won't work. And
 it will only work if the text appears. Last year I had to press reject, then reload and them it would appear and I could accept. But now it won't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also sometimes when I relod the page it says invalid security certificate. Continue to page or go back it asks. This is where last year I could press go back and then refresh and press continue and it would work. If I can I will attach pictures of the screen.</p>
<p>Also the other day I got it to connect but I dont know how. I deleted history and cookies and stuff and it worked right after that, but since then I've tried that at different times in the prossess and it hasn't worked. So I'm confused.

            You might try accessing that acceptance page after you've set the phone's browser option&nbsp; to view websites via the "Desktop version" and then see if you are able to accept the terms of service.<br />
<br />
Open up IE on the phone, tap the three dots in the lower right hand corner of the screen, select "settings" &gt; tap the area under "Website preference" and change the setting to "Desktop version"<br />

<p>
</p><p>So heres the deal, its like the surfaces default settings are different from the average defaults of everyone else. Its very confusing stuff.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a surface 2 and couldn't connect, my Physics teacher who has a PhD in computer science went deep into the surface settings and changed some stuff and now everything works fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a Surface Pro 3 i5, I will be going back to him so he can do that again. When I do ill record it and post the video to YouTube and post the link here!

            What I've suggested earlier does exactly what you seek, a compact ("packed at the top") set of results which meets your specifications. The&nbsp;problem(s) you're facing&nbsp;are possibly some&nbsp;modifications to suit your actual layout, or some data consistency/quality
 [eg text vs numbers] or calculation rounding&nbsp;issues in your spec: &gt;0.25. Why not you try setting&nbsp;up the simple example layout as suggested in my response and see it working properly first?

<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I have had this issue for years.&nbsp; If you are typing a series of lines, for example to make a section for notes, and you hit backspace, it will make the line bold, and it's almost impossible to remove/delete.&nbsp; I hadn't done it recently
 and seemed to forget how I had corrected it in the past, but it has been in many versions of Word.&nbsp; I did some searching online and think I found a section in "Tell Me . . . " that said to treat it like a border.&nbsp; Put cursor above the line and select No Border.&nbsp;
 It worked! &nbsp;</p>
<p>What is Track Changes????</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Best way to replicate forum functionality using Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Best way to replicate forum functionality using Office 365 programs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Currently we are using OnlineGroups.net for collaborative persistent discussions within our company of about 100 staff. &nbsp;We use it to extend our ability to "Call out for help around the &nbsp;office" to the wider pool of consultants globally - &nbsp;to share experiences,
 &nbsp;find out how other people have handled similar situations, and help identify expertise and resources in various areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People really like the functionality, especially that they can </p>
<ul>
<li>just post, read and reply direct from email (Outlook) where most communications with clients happens too and always open - not needing another program open too.&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are threaded by subject line for easy identification of topic</li><li>All past conversations are viewable and searchable online e.g. so people can say already discussed before , look it up... &nbsp;And people know they can delete forum emails and still have access to the discussion.</li><li>You join only those forums you want to be part of actively part of discussions in, and get notification emails only for those groups,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">but</span> if wanted can go to the website to see all other discussions in all forum groups (e.g. if you aren't normally working in one area but for one job you are)</li><li>You can choose to get digests of discussions (and specify how often for each discussion group) so you aren't bombarded by every reply and can read/reply later in the day, not necessarily instantly.</li></ul>
<p>However onlineGroups.net does not integrate with our older intranet so intranet searches don't pull in results from these Forum discussions which was seen to be a useful option - and there is a desire to integrate all our various collaboration tools into
 one place so there isn't lots of different passwords, programs open etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are currently investigating options for replacing our intranet and are considering using Sharepoint as we have Office365 licenses already. &nbsp;I see there are Microsoft Groups, Teams, Yammer but am not quite clear on the functionality for each, but from
 initial probes it doesn't seem they provide all the above forum type functionality. &nbsp;What would you suggest as a good approach to meet the same functionality plus integration for search?</p>

<p>Hi Tessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given your description, I think you can try Microsoft Teams:</p>
<p>1. It can be used in browser such as Chrome, Firefox and Edge. It means users can use it at wherever has internet connection. It also has a desktop application. Some users may like to use desktop app rather than browser version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create a team for all users in your tenant. And then they can create channel under this team. All users in the team can see those channels and join the discuss. We can add a channel to favorite and follow it. Meanwhile, we can create other teams for some
 small project groups. So, only users in that team can see all items in their team.
</p>
<p>3. Teams also has a file storage. It means users can upload some files to the site collection which is related to the team.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be cannot fully meet your requirement, you may firstly test with it and find more function of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>About Office 365 Group. It doesn't have the channel function. That means you may see many groups in your tenant. And for some private groups, not all users can access it. For Yammer, it's more like Newsfeed in Office 365 portal. We can use it to post some
 information and start some conversations. In these three products, I will suggest you try Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are some articles for your reference:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have some detailed questions about Teams, please feel free to post new threads in our forum. Our engineers will discuss further with you in the new thread.

<h2>            Onenote sync error and unable to open Notebook.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We have number of folder and files saved and shared in dropbox. recently someone moved the folder to a different location and things started to happen. We restored the folder back to its original location but still getting error message "We can't sync the
 notebook because you're offline or because the network location is unavailable. (Error code: 0x3)"</p>
<p>We are able to open the sections separately when clicking on the files directly within Windows explorer though.
</p>
<p>Is there any way to solve this issue or create a new notebook and merge all the sections to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you </p>

            Hi Akram,<br />
<br />
Please try the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Close all notebooks in your OneNote client.<br />
2. Open the notebooks from your dropbox, this will open OneNote Online page.<br />
3. Click "Open in OneNote" button to sync the notebooks again.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
James

<h2>            Windows Defender settings are all greyed out</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've upgraded to Windows 10 Home edition build 10240, I've all updates up to now (september, 20th).</p>
<p>I've not any AV, FW programs coming from 3rd party: just vanilla Windows Defender AND Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem: all Windows Defender related settings are greyed out and I cannot modify any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I need to add some exclusions to the related WD's list but beeing impossible 'cause the bug above I've been forced to definitely disable WD using the registry trick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very annoying and I can't figure out any sensible reason why I can't do it from the ad hoc settings menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise, thx in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p><span>Hi Maurio,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to understand the issue in a better manner, please share the details.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Since when did the issue started appearing?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you made any changes in settings prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you see any error code or error message on the screen?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue usually arises when you have installed a security software on your computer. From Windows 8 onwards, the Windows Defender is equipped with all the functionalities
 of an anti-virus software including real-time protection which was not present in Windows Defender in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any third-party security software installed, I would suggest you to uninstall that software and then upgrade to Windows 10. As it is not recommended
 to keep more than 1 anti-virus software with real-time protection.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer
 against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable/uninstall your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable/uninstall it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected
 to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform a clean boot and check if there is any third party software causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To diagnose the problem whether any third party program or application is causing the conflict, I would suggest you to try “clean boot” and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>Placing your system in
<strong><span>“Clean Boot”</span></strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform
 a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I upgraded in August and everything was fine until last Thursday (September 17th).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings are greyed out and I cannot not run the Windows Defender app manually; the error message is shown below :-</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/979862c9-399f-4700-9eec-2a647e70e2e8" /></p>
<p><em>This error pops up each time I attempt to run the app.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I tried clearing the history and rebooting the computer from the cold and dark state. The result&nbsp; has been no change.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no third party security software installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly suspect this is a bug because it shows the settings indicate that Windows Defender is on even though they are greyed out.</p>

            <p>The error message translates to ERROR_MP_BAD_GLOBAL_STORAGE&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's not clear is if it refers to internal storage (the database) for Defender (or MSE) or if it is a disk issue. I presume the former.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try using ccleaner - <a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner</a></p>
<p>Don't use the registry cleaning function, but use the cleaner function -- cleaning log files and such.
</p>
<p>On the cleaner/applications tab, scroll to Windows Defender and place a check next to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de6c606f5-c135-45bd-88ca-151bb728f138" /></p>
<p>Normally, we advise people to uncheck this option as it causes Defender/MSE to report that a scan has not been run in a while.</p>
<p>See if the helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, try replacing the engine/definitions:</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>"Since when did the issue started appearing?"</span></p>
<p><span>Usually I don't care about the security settings, I just let them always ON: let's say that the problem is present since the beginning.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>No,&nbsp;settings are just greyed out, if I click on&nbsp;the controls nothing happens and I can't change any value.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I don't have any third-party security software installed, neither in Windows 10 nor in the previously installed Windows 8.1</p>

</p><p>thx for your suggestion, however the issue I see, if on one hand leads to the same effects (greyed out MD settings) on the other it seems differently rooted: the system is all ok, no errors, no messages, nothing. I'm completely clueless.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">I'm happy to report, whether through the following action or by software pushed directly by Microsoft to my machine via the cloud unbeknownst to me , the issue of Windows Defender's settings being 'Greyed out' for my Windows 10

</p><p class="contentStandard">As the tool ran, I noticed its reference to Windows Defender in the instructions and while it was running in the background, I decided to check to see if Windows Defender was still non-functional (just out of curiosity). I activated
 Windows Defender from my " Start/All apps/Windows System " Start menu option and it began to run (the red colour was indicating that my PC was still in the 'At Risk' category).</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">After many hours of both the Security Scanner and Windows Defender both running in the background
<em>(the total runtime for my Acer notebook with a dual core 1.6GHz processor and 2 Gig of RAM was in excess of 26 hours to completion ! )
</em>a message appeared in the Windows Defender window about 'missing history' and I continued to let Windows Defender run (this was probably over 2/3 of the way through the full run). The Windows Defender window then returned to 'Green' from 'Red' (indicating
 that my PC was no longer at risk). I allowed both the security scanner and Windows Defender to complete running; as mentioned earlier it took in excess of 26 hours for the run of each to complete - some 3.3 million files were scanned during this time.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The final result was that no spyware, Viruses, etc. were found and my Windows Defender settings are now again accessible :-</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">I cannot rule out the fact that Microsoft may have pushed a fix to my machine while the scans were being performed but at the very least, the exercise of scanning my machine and finding no security problems offered a measure of
 peace of mind.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I'd recommend downloading the security scanner directly from Microsoft's security website and running it - even if it takes a day or more to complete its run - as a possible way to resolve the ' Windows Defender Greyed out issue
 '.</p>

            <p>Hi Mauro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy to report that the problem has been resolved. Not sure about the specifics, I just went to Microsoft's security website and downloaded and ran their scanner. At some point during the 26 hour run, Windows Defender - which I'd also executed thereafter
 - reported a ' missing history error ' and once I continued its execution, it changed from its 'Red' status to 'green'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On completion of both scans, I checked my Windows 10 settings and the Windows Defender settings are again accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scans found no threats amongst my 3.3 million files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The conclusion is either Microsoft pushed a fix to my machine from the cloud during the past 24 hours or running the scanner and Windows Defender resulted in a repair to Windows Defender somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result appears to be a return to normality. I'll keep on monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Very interesting solution.</p>
<p>I would not recommend doing this exactly as you did -- for anyone following this thread.</p>
<p>The engine used by the Safety Scanner and Defender were both active and scanning at the same time, hence the terrible performance you encountered. I would suggest trying just the Safety Scanner alone first *or* performing a scan with Defender alone to see
 if the completion of a scan sets things to right.</p>

<p><span>I have Active X filter enabled and tracking enabled. When this interferes with webpage content I click the blue icon in the address bar to turn off the filtering

 down menu and untick it.</span></p>

<p><span>I don't know why the blue icon has stopped working and I can no longer just turn off Active X filtering and tracking for a particular webpage but continue to have

            <p>I have not made any changes to the computer and am familiar with the info you suggested.</p>
<p><span>After I close IE 9 and reopen a new IE 9, the blue icon will work, turn grey and allow Active X for a particular web site.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also, because I have IE 9 set to delete all when it closes, tracking starts all over populating the websites where tracking is blocked.</span></p>
<p><span>It seems once tracking starts blocking websites, it is more difficult to stop filtering for both tracking and Active X.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Another possibility is, if more than one tab is open, the blue icon becomes ineffective to turn off filtering.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In any event, after a point, no matter how many times I clicked the icon and selected to turn off filtering (tracking, Active X or both) it comes back blue and will not turn off.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I have to close and reopen IE 9.</span></p>
<p><span>I was just getting annoyed that I had to keep closing and reopening IE 9 to restore functionality to the blue filter icon.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your response.<span>&nbsp;

<p>You don't have to close IE when you click on the blue circle or when you disable tracking protection. All you have to do is press F5&nbsp; or hit the circle with the arrow in the address bar those 2 methods will refresh IE for you.</p>

            <p>Refreshing does not restore functionality to the blue icon to turn off filtering.&nbsp; IE 9 has to be closed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Then when new IE 9 is opened the icon functions for a while until it decides to stop working.&nbsp; When I close IE 9 I have it set to delete everything. So when I open new IE 9 it's all clean until stuff starts to accumulate again.</p>
<p>I think it has something to do with tracking.&nbsp; As the Personalized Tracking Protection List is repopulated the icon won't turn off tracking filtering and then I also can't turn off Active X filtering.</p>
<p>Either that or it has to do with tabs.&nbsp; Maybe if one tab is filtered you cannot turn&nbsp;off filtering on another tab.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Don't know what it is, wish I was a better explainer.&nbsp; </p>

            I have finally decided it has to do with tab browsing.&nbsp; The blue icon to turn off filtering for Active X and/or Tracking seems to loose functionality if there is more than one tab open.&nbsp; When there is only one tab open&nbsp;I can turn it on and off.

<h3> markmiller_co  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access image control distorts picture</h2>
                    Our Access HR application was enhanced to allow the user to store employee photos; we retain the path to the image file in a table, then adjust the Picture property of the image control to point to the desired file for each employee.&nbsp; We found that with
 Access 2003 or 2007, certain Jpeg images will be flipped and/or distorted when brought into the image control.&nbsp; Running Access 2010, the same image file displays correctly in the image control.&nbsp; Is there a fix available for this issue for Access 2003 or Access
 2007?

            <p>OK, next is to check those "certain" jpgs. That seems to indicate some are fine and others are not. jpg, just like any file format, is open to interpretation and perhaps certain jpgs are a bit out of spec. As a test, I would open a bad one in PhotoShop or
 Paint.NET and re-save it.</p>

<p>I don't have a copy of PhotoShop, but I've checked these images using MS Office Picture Mgr and some other tools, and they appear fine when opened with these.&nbsp; I've done some research on tags in .jpg files, and supposedly there's an 'Orientation' tag, but
 I have not yet found a tool that shows this value.&nbsp; The other point is that the same file displays correctly when using Access 2010.</p>

            <p>I don't have answer, but maybe someof this will clear up a the point about&nbsp;earlier versions&nbsp;vs Access 2010.&nbsp; The way access used to handle image files was to convert them to BMP.&nbsp; This is likely where the distortion comes in.&nbsp; Things were changed in A2010
 so the image control could use jpg (and other?)&nbsp;files directly, so there sould be no distortion as you are seeing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if it can be done, but if you can load your jpg file into Paint, you should probably see the same distortion and maybe figure out how to fudge the jpg image so it doesn't happen when Access processes it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTOH, it might(?) be simpler to just convert all the jpg files to BMP or recreate the images as BMP files and be done with it.</p>

            <p>Marshall,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've opened these problem .jpg files with Paint, and the image displays correctly, so there's some problem with Access when it converts .jpg to .bmp (a very useful piece of info to know).&nbsp; I've also verified that if the .jpg is saved as a .bmp (24-bit option
 works best), that file displays correctly (more or less)&nbsp;when opened using the Access application, so this is definitely a workaround.&nbsp; BTW, I also found that if a .jpg file is too big, Paint chokes with message "Paint cannot read this file.&nbsp; This is not a
 valid bitmap file, or its format is not currently supported", but Access tries to load it and displays a distorted image (it's squished vertically).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well an acceptable workaround is better than nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;just had another thought,&nbsp;maybe the proportions of the image control cause rounding ussues when access tries to squeeze/zoom the jpg and some columns of pixels are just left out of the result.&nbsp; Check the proportions of the image control and compare them
 to the jpg proportions.&nbsp; Ideally the vertical and horizontal ratios&nbsp;should be&nbsp;fairly simple&nbsp;and fit into a Single type value with no rounding.&nbsp; I susspect the "problem"&nbsp;jpg files have different ratios from the ones that are ok.</p>

That's why I added the free Paint.NET suggestion.<br />
Also note I asked to re-save the files, not just to view them and decide they look OK.

            <p>All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per Tom's suggestion, I downloaded Paint.net and tried it out.&nbsp; Whether I save the image as a new file without resizing or with resizing, I still see the same issue; it's flipped when brought into the Access image control.&nbsp; If I do the same thing with MS
 Office Picture Mgr 2003, the image is not flipped, but is squished vertically.&nbsp; Finally, I tried my old favorite, Paint Shop Pro 4.&nbsp; If I save the image as a new file with or without resizing, the image comes into the Access image control correctly.&nbsp; This
 is all very confusing, but it would appear that how the .jpg is saved has a lot to do with this.&nbsp; Here are some details about 4 .jpg images I've been testing with (width x height):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Image&nbsp;A - 480x640 - flips</p>
<p>Image&nbsp;B - 336x448 - works</p>
<p>Image&nbsp;C - 480x640 - flips</p>
<p>Image D - 640x480 - works</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The image control on my form is 2.0521 wide by 2.2972 high, if that matters.&nbsp; Is it just coincidence that the two images which don't work have the same dimensions?&nbsp; I suspect not, since the images saved with Paint Shop Pro without resizing retained those
 dimensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;
<div>I've sorted it now , cheers&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;The error msg was "unable to mount file"&nbsp;</div>
<div>So I could not open the file to install it , once I had downloaded it (electronic delivery).</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I noticed after the error msg appeared, a dvd drive &nbsp;or some sort of virtual drive opened in my CPU &nbsp;and when I clicked on it , &nbsp;the office file opened and I was able to click on &nbsp;set up &nbsp;and eventually use office 2013. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Still not sure why it could not be opened by simply clicking on it, as I've never downloaded any 3rd party software, I turned off firewall / spyware &nbsp;and did not have another version of office on my CPU .</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway I can use it now which is the main thing ...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Well at least until the next time I attempt to install something on my CPU</div>
<div>cheers</div>

<p>A key question is: How did you "split" the document? The program provides no specific means of doing so. I can only assume that you used Cut/Copy - Paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another key question is whether the original footnotes were created using the <strong>
Insert&gt; Footnote</strong> feature provided in Word or whether they were manually added. Without seeing the document or having complete specific details all I can say is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <em>former</em>, the footnotes should have updated automatically to begin at 1 in the new document.</li><li>If the <em>latter</em>, however, each will have to be manually edited.</li></ul>

    <title>How to remove all my duplicate contacts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to remove all my duplicate contacts&#63;</h2>
                    I don't know how this happened exactly, but I have somehow ended up with TWO of every contact in my Contacts list.<br />
Is there a quick and easy way to delete all duplicate contacts?<br />
The tedious way is to scroll through the entire contact list (&gt;4,000 names), highlight all the duplicates, and click delete. But that will take a long time.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Robert<br />

<ul>
<li>Sync to the Apple Address Book and use it’s “look for duplicates” under Card in the Menu bar. The fixes will sync back to Outlook.</li></ul>
<p>Try one of these third party applications.<br />

Chase Smith offered this suggestion:<br />
 merging/de-duping and syncing across my devices. They have a trial for 250 contacts as well I believe.</span><br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Is this an operator-branded version of the Touch HD ?<br />
Some providers have left out these options.
