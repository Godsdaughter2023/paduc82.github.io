<h2>            QuickBook Pro 11 not compatible with Internet Explorer 9.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Programs Compatibility QuickBooksPro11 Windows7 IE9</p>
<p>QB starts, then ends with a message regarding IE8.</p>
<p>I followed Intuit's advisory regarding Windows compatibility feature being set, it did not cure the problem.</p>
<p>Intuit's focus seems to be focused on IE8, I use IE9.</p>

<p>Original Title:&nbsp;I cannot start c:\windows\system32\services.msc, (services from start menu search bar) as I get the error "The service could not be started either because it is disabled or it has no enabled device associated with it."</p>
<p>I found this by identifying that I cannot start anything that requires me to run it as administrator. Upon investigation, it was suggested that a service is not started. When I try to open the services list to identify the issue, I find that the service
 required to view the active services is disabled, a catch 22! I attempted a system restore, but that requires admin auth, which isn't working at the moment. Help!</p>

<h2>            Deleted my admin account and now I can&#39;t log in my laptop at all.</h2>
                    Okay so, I only had one account on my laptop and it was the admin account. Like an idiot, I deleted it by mistake. It logged me off and my login popped up but it said my password was wrong. I've tried to log in with safe mode but it wouldnt even pop up.
 Hit the esc key when i restarted and then hit f11 but it just took me back to my login. F8 wouldn't pull anything up either. Did i totally screw myself? I mean I dont have anything important on there im just mad i cant log in at all .

            Do you have win 10 media? Usb or DVD? I think if you were to boot to that, go into recovery options, and launch a command prompt, you can probably add a user account there. <br /><br />Check out this link - <br /><a href="https://operating-systems.wonderhowto.com/how-to/create-admin-user-account-using-cmd-prompt-windows-0125689/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://operating-systems.wonderhowto.com/how-t...</a><br /><br />It has instructions on how to add a user account via cmd prompt. I think that’s your best bet!<br /><br />- C

    <title>Volume in Skype is too Low - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suneelveeluru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume in Skype is too Low</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recently bought Surface 2 RT tablet. I could find a problem with volume while using Skype. I am not able to hear the caller voice ( video call ) clearly and the other party is also not able to hear my voice as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have asked my other party to use another device and tested with Apple iPad, Samsung mobile ( S3 ) and Windows laptop however same result. When I changed my device ( to normal Laptop or Ipad) voice is too clear and loud.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I assume its an issue with Surface 2 only and not sure whether its with My Surface or all surface tablets are like that. I have changed the settings as shown in support site however no improvement.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Looking forward for a response </p>

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Appreciate your detailed response on this. I have done the changes as per trouble shooting guide and still no further improvements.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Lastly, when I was going through the&nbsp;Surface 2 features&nbsp;I have noticed that I have covered the Front microphone with screen protector and causing this issue and the tablet cover blocking some portion of speaker.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I just get rid of these and makes my surface 2 better now. Looks like no official screen protectors &amp; cases which will fit for surface 2 design.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your support and sorry for inconvenience as this is issue&nbsp;due to&nbsp;my additional costume on Surface rather than technical issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thanks Suneel V</p>

<p>So i did the "Undo Immunization" and deleted the HOSTS file and it fixed it. Issue Solved.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Burn CD now&#59; Perhaps related to Updating to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>1) In windows media player I am not able to burn music files to a CD. &nbsp;Previously, I did this without difficulty. &nbsp;The process starts, spends several minutes trying, shows progress, and then all of a sudden moves from say 18% completed to 99% completed and
 then stops. &nbsp;Then the following error code is displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Media Player cannot burn the files. If the burner is busy, wait for the current task to finish. If necessary, verify that the burner is connected properly and that you have installed the latest device driver."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Same problem occurs with Apple's Itunes, except that it displays the error code as 4000</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I have tried using both the built-in CD drive in my laptop and also an external CD drive; I get the same error with both so I think it must be a software issue and not a hardware issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) The machine originally came with Window 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I found on this Windows site a FixIt program that I downloaded and ran. &nbsp;It said it found a problem, fixed the problem, but still I am unable to burn a CD and I get the same error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can play CDs properly, it is the burning of CDs that is the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>This issue could be due to corrupt Media Player settings.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In order to help you better, could you please confirm a couple of things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you able to burn CDs or DVDs using Windows Explorer?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any third party CD/DVD burning software installed on the computer?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Let’s run the Windows Media Player settings troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + W to search Settings.</span></li><li><span>Type “Troubleshoot” without quotes and click on Troubleshooting.</span></li><li><span>In the new windows click View all on the left pane.</span></li><li><span>In the list of options, click on Windows Media Player Settings and Windows Media Player DVD.</span></li><li><span>Click Next and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: :</span></strong><span> If still the issue persists then run the [System File Checker] SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></p>

<p>Answers to your questions:</p>
<p>1) I am unable to burn a CD using File Explorer; also Formating does not seem to work</p>
<p>2) There is a program called Power2Go that appears to have the ability to burn CD/DVD in addition to windows media player and itunes</p>
<p>3)The computer is set to automatically perform microsoft updates, Itunes has been updated, i have updated from Windows 8.0 to 8.1. &nbsp;I have not tried to burn a CD in perhaps 4-5 months and so a lot of changes have occurred since I was last able to burn a
 CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: I did this, it said it found an error and fixed it. &nbsp;However, if I perform Method 1 again it says it finds the same error again and corrects it. &nbsp;It seems to keep finding the error and correcting it no matter how many times I run method 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: I performed this and one error was found. &nbsp;I have not attempted to correct it because I don't know if it has anything to do with my problem and because I don't have another computer in my home running Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem found by the system file checker.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the suggestions. &nbsp;Here is what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Ran the DISM.exe &gt;&gt; The result was that the restore operation was completed successfully. &nbsp;The component store corruption was repaired. &nbsp;The operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Ran the scd /scannow &gt;&gt; The result was found corrupt files and successfully repaired them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Restarted the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Windows media player would not burn an audio CD. &nbsp;Same error as described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I did (1) and (2) again. &nbsp;Interestingly, the "corruptions" were found again and corrected again, suggesting that whatever they are they return when the computer is restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Tried both itunes and windows media player, this time without restarting the computer. &nbsp;Same errors as before and I was unable to burn CDs with either program</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion of VLC, but VLC does not have the capability of burning CDs, so it would not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions would be appreciated. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

            Make sure you have the latest drivers from your manufacturer on there and try installing all of the optional Windows updates. &nbsp;Something seems to be hogging your burner, so try uninstalling and crapplications that may have sneaked on there. &nbsp;It could be
 a virus or maybe even an issue with your antivirus application! &nbsp;I had issues with antivirus in the past when upgrading. &nbsp;I recommend just updating all of your apps to make sure nothing is conflicting with your actual media apps. &nbsp;Just because they are compatable
 with Windows doesn't mean that they work with each other!

            <p>I have exactly the same problem originally described above. &nbsp;Same conditions with windows 8.1 &nbsp;Also, went through the process of trying multiple programs to burn CDs (windows media player, itunes, foobar), which all failed in the same way described above.
 &nbsp;Replaced the optical drive. on the PC. &nbsp;Then tried microsoft fixit and system repair. &nbsp; Fixit and system repair found problems and applied repairs but nothing worked - cd burning problems continued, as before. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried a second windows 8.1 PC at home, which failed, too, in identical fashion. &nbsp; Would appear that this is not related to a bad optical drive, not related to bad burning software programs, not related to one PC with corrupt operating system ... but endemic
 to the latest windows 8.1 updates - causing the burning application to halt mid-point, when writing to the CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will have to fall back to windows 7 until this is fixed.</p>

    <title>Save Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bru74lbutt3rf1y  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save Issue</h2>
                    
<p>I'll get straight to the point:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I start a new game with Mass Effect 2, it resets itself. This has been going on for a long time, and I thought it was due to the face that I don't usually play the game online when I'm at home. I've beaten the game, so no worries there, but after
 the first few times I beat the game, I started to notice that some of my achievements were gone; almost like I never did them. I find that hard to believe because a lot of the achievements that were missing are hard to not get since you have to recruit the
 majority of the characters you run by to get the achievements. I can't tell you how many times I've played this game over and it still won't give me the last achievement for completeing the game twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm only concerned that there is something actually wrong with the xbox since it won't save my data either. I completed the game about three months ago and only recently (in the past two weeks) tried to start a new game to see if I could get the achievements
 back and maybe the problem would fix itself. It didn't; my save data is gone and it reset itself to after I completed the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will state that i have downloaded a lot of the content that goes with the game, so I'm not sure if that has something to do with it, but that's my issue. Unfortunately, that is not the only game that has been affected in that way. I have a few other games
 that do the same thing, and all my save data keeps disappearing and my achievements are missing with the save data. Since my save data is messed up then my gamer points keep getting reset as well.</p>
<p>Even when you look on my profile and view my achievements for ME2, you will see where I have some of the achievements for the end of the game, but not from the beginning. I understand that it could be mistaken for me restarting the game, but I know that's
 not the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the long winded question, but I just want to know what's wrong with my xbox; it pretty much runs fine other than the save data, and I don't like playing it recently because I have to play through the game again without being able to get to the
 end of the game.</p>

<p>Did you ever recover your GamerTag on another Console?</p>
<p>To me it sounds like your Profile somehow got corrupted, I would copy saved games data on a USB and reset your xbox360, then recover your GamerTag and then save the games data back on your 360.</p>

<p>I have recovered my GamerTag on another console, but would that really mess up the profile that bad?</p>
<p>But if I reset my console then wouldn't that delete all of the DLC I had on it before? I don't really want to have to pay for that stuff since there's a lot of DLC I have there.</p>

<p>From the Xbox Support page:</p>
<p>"Do not recover your gamertag to a friend's console as a convenience. You might lose your saved games."</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-ca/pages/xbox-live/how-to/xbox-live-account-management/gamer-profile.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../gamer-profile.aspx</a></p>
<p>I wouldn't go so far as to "Reset my console," but you may want to check your profile to see if it is corrupted. &nbsp;On your Dashboard find: My XBox &gt; System Settings &gt; Memory. &nbsp;If you see a yellow triangle with an "!" inside of it, your profile is corrupt.
 &nbsp;You should delete your profile (ONLY YOUR PROFILE) and then recover it.</p>
<p>Any DLC you have previously downloaded is yours for the life of your account and will not need to be paid for again. &nbsp;You can find a list of your DLC in your Download History and you can re-download it from there if necessary.</p>

<p>I've never seen anything like that when I was looking at my memory to see if the data was corrupt. Even if recovering my gamertag was the problem, it wasn't this bad when I was in the US and I moved my gamertag from my console to my sister's console.</p>
<p>I did check again to make sure I didn't see the caution, but it's not there. So it's either a deeper issue or that caution icon isn't showing up for it. So it'd basically getting to the point that I'll probably have to reset or send my xbox in, then?</p>
<p>If it's not a good idea to recover my gamertag on a different console, then why give the option in the first place? I only did it to get my friends and family to sign up for XBL so we can play together and that was the only option they were comfortable with.</p>
<p>@VernirSlake: I didn't see your response before posting, but to answer your question, yes. When ME2 came out, I was out to sea with my ship and I figured I'd take my xbox with me. I was gone for over a year and a half and I wasn't able to connect my xbox
 with XBL till I got back to the states. When I got back I had to do a massive update on my console and that's when they switched to the new dashboard. After the update, we have to set sail and I was gone for another six months before I was able to update my
 console.</p>
<p>Since then it's been acting weird.</p>

<p>"Recovery" was designed for the purpose of replacing things such as a corrupted profile. &nbsp;If you need to move your profile around it's best to keep it on a storage device like a USB flash drive. &nbsp;You'd be amazed what can happen to your profile in between
 the time it's been recovered to another machine and it getting back to your machine. &nbsp;There are many horror stories about it in the Accounts Suspensions and Console Bans forums.</p>
<p>Anyway, did you try deleting and recovering it? &nbsp;This is much easier and less invasive than resetting or sending your console in, especially if there isn't anything wrong with it.</p>

<p>That'll be the problem then. When you recovered your GT XBL downloaded the last record it had of your account from when you last connected to XBL which also didn't have the achievements you got while out at sea. As such the service wasn't aware of you getting
 those achievements and scrubbed them. Your only option is to do them again which is either a blessing or curse depending on how you view ME2.</p>

<p>@Knowitall: I'll try that because I would hate to have to ship my xbox all the way to the states just o get the thing looked at; it that were the case it's easier to just buy a new one. I just figure there's nothing wrong except it's having issues with the
 save option.</p>
<p>@VernierSlake: Let's say that might be the case, before I got an XBL account I played my other game on my xbox and they all updated with my account when I logged online; so that would still make it suspicious that it wouldn't transfer over to my XBL account.</p>
<p>ME2 is one of the few games that I don't mind playing many times over, but since I know I'm getting ME3, I don't want to get shortchanged when I buy the game and I can't even use the save data that I currently have on my xbox. That's a -lot- of hours that
 would go to waste if this issue isn't cleared up by then.</p>
<p>I will check this forum again later but it is late for me and I have work in four hours, but I'll try it and get back to you.</p>

<p>As VernierSlake said in his last post.</p>
<p>I think this from the Support page confirms what he's saying:</p>
<p>Recover your gamertag from Xbox LIVE</p>
<p>You might need to recover an Xbox LIVE gamertag in the following situations:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* You have a Zune or Games for Windows — LIVE account and want to join Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* You accidentally deleted your profile, or you want to move your profile to a new console.</p>
<p>Important</p>
<p>&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;* Any achievements or changes that you have made since the account last connected to Xbox LIVE will be lost during the recovery process.</b></p>

<p>That'll have been because you promoted your offline account and since that'll have been the first record the service had of your account nothing would've been overwritten.</p>

As the issue started recently, I would suggest you to perform system restore to the date it was working fine.<br />
<br />
1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.<br />
2. Enter Control Panel in the search box, and tap or click Control Panel.<br />
3. Enter Recovery in the Control Panel search box, and then tap or click Recovery.<br />
4. Tap or click Open System Restore, and then follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</span>

<h2>            Skype4B does NOT invite Skype Users on any Apple devices&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi "Skypies" ...</p>
<p>(.: background:.)<br />
we are operating an "Skype4B" onprem solution for 600 Users (starting with OCS 2007 years ago)<br />
All Skype4B features are used and they are also fully functional for us. <br />
For example: We use mobile devices, we use PIC federation services, we use XMPP federation with CISCO, we use Polycom conferencing Solutions on different locations, usw. Skyp4B is working fine ....</p>
<p>(.: problem :.)<br />
Sometimes we want to contact a single persons on Skype (consumer Version) which also works fine as long as the user is using the Windows Version of Skype (for example Version 7.17.85.105).
<br />
The Invitation is send to the user correctly, the user can accept it ... communication between Skype4B and Skype is working fine!</p>
<p>Often the external user is using Apple devices (MacBook / iPad / iPhone) ... If so, the user does not get an invitation from us and also can't accept it. Finally we can't communicate with these APPLE based user at all!<br />
That's a problem for us and we need to no why and also when there will be a fix for this. In the meantime a workaround would be welcome.</p>
<p>(.: even more :.)<br />
Of course we have done a lot of testing and even found out more curios things on (the latest) apple based Skype versions.<br />
If the user XYZ is accepting some Skype4B contacts on his Windows Skype Version (they are added in his contact list) is signing in on an MacBook Skype Version later -&gt; ALL the Skype4B contacts are missing!?</p>
<p>(.: outro :.)<br />
would be nice if someone has some ideas ... a deeper look behind the actual handling between the different worlds (Skype4B Win/MAc and Skype Win/Mac) would also be nice.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi OnPrem,</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand that you operating an on-prem solution and have issue of communication between Skype for Business windows users and Skype Mac users.<br />
Since our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business online services and has lack of knowledge about on-premises Skype for Business . We suggest you seek help from the link below.<br />

<p>Hi Poppy,</p>
<p>thanks for your comment on this. I know that we are using an onprem Skype4B Server and therefore the office365 community isn't the first paltform putting these questions. Nevertheless we also use small office365 enviroment (testing hybrid solutions for future
 use). Also the office365 users are affected by these problems ...</p>
<p>As requested I have opened the same case on the Lync forum as well:<br />
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-US/4a8802e3-44d1-4390-840f-048eb4230e5d/skype4b-does-not-invite-skype-users-on-any-apple-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-US/4a8802e3-44d1-4390-840f-048eb4230e5d/skype4b-does-not-invite-skype-users-on-any-apple-devices</a></p>
<p>Also I have opened a regular MS&nbsp;case becuase the problem could also be reproduced by MS Support employee today.<br />
Furthermore the problem also exists on the android platform as well.<br />

<p>Hi OnPrem,</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarification. <br />
<br />
For the issue of your onprem Skype for Business, I would suggest you look for expert help form the Lync TechCenter forum which you have already posted a thread as mentioned above.</p>
<p>For the issue of the Office 365 account, please help us collect the information below:<br />
1. Since you mentioned test hybrid solution, may I know if you have deployed hybrid environment or on-premises and Office 365 are still separate environment?<br />
2. About “I have opened a regular MS case”, do you refer to open a MS case for on-premises or Office 365? If you opened an Office 365 case, please send the service request to us via Private Message.<br />
3. About “the problem also exists on the android platform”, do you refer to Skype users on the Android platform cannot add Skype for Business contacts? Please give more detailed description.</p>
<p>To protect the privacy, I have sent you a private message for the information. Click the link below to access the private message:<br />

<p>thanks again for your help. Yes the Lync/Skype4B TechCenter seems to be the best platform for my (onprem) questions.</p>
<p>In our Office365 account which is still separated (not hybrid) at the moment we are doing some certificate based authentication testing.<br />
As soon as this is working as it should we are planing to test some SharePoint extranet scenarios.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Nevertheless the office365 users are also affected by the problem beacuse they are also not able to send invitation to apple users.<br />
The MS support case is already covered by a "Lync CTS Engeneer" from Covergys (we have already worked together in some other cases in the past)<br />
I am not rally sure which kind of team this is (office365 or onprem). As far as I understand, the LYnc/Skype4B Team is a part of the office team.<br />
Which kind office (office365 or onprem) .... I have no idea anymore? <br />
My engineer (on this case) confirmed, that also he can reproduce this on android phones by himself.<br />
So I believe that this is not only a problem on apple devices?!</p>
<p>Finally I would prefer to close this conversation here and proceed with some more detailed informations on the LYNC TechCente:<br />

<h2>            8.1 does not recognize Canon Powershot A590 IS</h2>
                    The camera image shows up in "Devices and Printers" under "Unspecified" but Faststone doesn't recognize. I need to transfer pictures from my camera to my computer. This seems to be a common problem for 8 and 8.1. Never had a problem with 7. All the "fixes"
 are for people with no computer knowledge and/or are endless circles with no results. Tried to download a driver and even the driver install program doesn't recognize the camera<br />

            <p>The failure I see in the picture is that the device failed a request to get descriptor. This is a HW issue and it manifest very early in the enumeration process. Software involvement at this stage is very minimal. The reason for the failure and what you
 can do to fix is given in these blog posts. Please try it out.</p>

            One of the times I looked at "computers &amp; printers" I saw an "Error 43" so knew it was likely the USB cord. I unplugged from the Tower and plugged back in and it works fine now. Thanks! I might add FastStone is an awesome app. Downloads into one folder
 and then separates the folders by date<br />

Thanks!<br />

            You need to turn off UAC (User Access Control) temporarily to make such changes. You might then find that the changes you make do not affect access to these folders because access is controlled by UAC. have a look here for further details on UAC: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951016/<br />

    <title>VirtualProfile Keeps Re-Appearing After Being Deleted - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            VirtualProfile Keeps Re-Appearing After Being Deleted</h2>
                    I am connecting my Windows 7 pc to the internet using a Netgear WPN111 wireless USB adapter connected to a D-Link Router. I have setup a Wireless Network Connection called "D-Link Router" which works fine. However, each time the pc starts-up instead of
 using this profile it creates a new one called "VirtualProfile" and tries to connect with this which fails. I then delete this profile and connect with the D-Link one. Next time on start-up the VirtualProfile is created again.<br />
I have even tried changing the settings of the virtual profile to be the same as the d-link profile. This works until the pc is re-started when it reverts to the old settings and fails to connect.<br />
Can you help me delete this virtual profile once and for all please?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p><span>Hello GlynAJones,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Answers Forum! I would suggest you go to the manufacture of your network card and download /install the latest drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Also I would suggest you check your system for corrupt files. You use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to check and fix system corrupted files. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1. Open an elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><em><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></em></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>3. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let me know if this helps </span>
<span><span>J</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 file system error &#40;-1073741792&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since a few days ago my computer has refused to let me perform any tasks that are administrator related(my profile is an administrator).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot run anything as administrator, and cannot run or install programs that require administrator permission from my account. Everything works in safe mode and when I activate the elevated admin account, but otherwise it shows this:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e779910-028a-4abe-8bb7-0245be155b99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e779910-028a-4abe-8bb7-0245be155b99" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've researched as much as I could about this issue, but the only sources I have found were on windows 7(I'm using windows 10). These sources recommended I run SFC through the console, but I've done this many times and nothing was found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I stayed up trying to troubleshoot again, and I ended up resetting my computer, which uninstalled all of the applications I had and the problem still persists.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue here. I literally can not run anything except my web browser and office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Using local account</p>
<p>- Have other accounts, they all have the same issues</p>
<p>- The only change that was made was the big windows update that lied to me and said "all your files are exactly where you left them"</p>
<p>
</p><p>List of features that aren't working:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- sfc /scannow</p>
<p>- task manager</p>
<p>- sound control panel</p>
<p>- Anything that requests a UAC popup</p>
<p>- I can't use the boot cd to: system restore, system wipe (both remove files or keep files wont work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solutions to this error online usually suggest turning windows sounds off, but I can't get to that control panel system. I get the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting to seem like the only option is to completely format the system.</p>

<h2>            WMI Provider Host - High CPU usage and BSOD crash due to Photoshop software on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: WMI Provider Host - High CPU usage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find a solution for this but let me explain, my case is a little different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what exactly is causing my performance to be significantly slower than it was before. My laptop takes longer to boot up, things take longer to open, games take much longer to load. Heck, when I log in, it even takes a second or two for all the
 taskbar icons to appear whereas before they have already been there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HAVE noticed WMI provider host at the top of the CPU usage in the task bar, sometimes reaching up to 30%, although it's not always this high, therefore, I'm not sure if this is the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried Safe Mode and Clean boot. In safe mode, everything works smoothly, and the issue is not present. However, the performance issues persist while performing a Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, I don't have "Conduit search" or whatever. I can't seem to find the source of the problem :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I CAN say... Is that before I got the issue, i had several BSOD upon trying to open Photoshop CS6. I read something about Nvidia or DirectX's newest driver having some sort of conflict... I had at least 7 crashes before I concluded that photoshop
 was the issue. Ever since then I've been having the performance issues, and I've had PS for a long time now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! Thanks ^^</p>

            <p>The error I get is "DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION". It used to be something similar but I removed a file called "Sniffer.exe" from Photoshop, which prevented from always using the dedicated Graphics card that is supposedly conflicting with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fairly certain that I've installed updates. Photoshop was working entirely fine on this version a while ago, at least until before i installed the latest NVIDIA driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid I don't have a disk to perform the boot. The laptop came with Windows 8 preinstalled and I don't recall seeing an included disk.. Yes, it IS running on Windows 10, all latest updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further describing a few issues: Usually it would boot up in just under 10 seconds. Immediately after the manufacture logo shows up for a bit, the screen fades to back and rapidly presents me to the login screen. Now the screen will remain black for at least
 another 5 or 10 seconds before displaying the loading circle against a blue background, and THEN showing the login screen after 20 seconds total approximately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usual startup programs also take much longer to to startup. The keyboard takes a minute or two to light up. And well... Yeah, it's really starting to worry me :/</p>

            I have created a Windows 10 boot drive using my USB stick and have performed the Startup repair however.. There doesn't seem to be that big of a difference? At first I thought I noticed that it booted up more quickly but everything else still seems to
 be the same.

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the issue started to exist after installing the latest NVIDIA driver, I suppose the issue could be due to the driver conflicting with the operating system on
 your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When a driver is faulty or not working properly, it can be identified by the
<strong>yellow exclamation</strong> over the device driver in <strong>Device Manager. Updating
</strong>the faulty drivers mostly resolves the above issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Check if you have any faulty drivers from the
<strong>Device manager</strong> by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>Windows icon + X</strong> keys on the keyboards and select
<strong>Device manager</strong> from the options.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Expand all the driver options and check the driver showing yellow exclamation icon on the driver.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Right click</span></strong><span> on the faulty driver (driver with yellow exclamation), select
<strong>Update</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Close the window after the update is complete and check if the changes are effective.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue persists, uninstall and reinstall the NVIDIA driver from
<strong>Device manager</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>Windows logo + X
</strong>keys on the keyboard and select <strong>Device Manager</strong> option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Expand <strong>Display adapters
</strong>and locate NVIDIA driver on the window.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the graphics card driver and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong> option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> the computer to reinstall the driver automatically and check if the changes are effective.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link below on
<strong>DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION</strong> for more information:</span></p>

            Already tried all of those. No yellow exclamation mark, and I've already reinstalled the drivers, and even updated/reinstalled several other drivers as well. Still, the drop in performance persists with WMI provider host still at the top of CPU usage.

            <p>Another thing that I forgot to mention ( Although I'm not sure if it may be related to the problem. I had this issue once and it went away after a while). Sometimes the keyboard keys will repeat as if I'm holding them down, after a second or two after I
 stop typing. The problem has returned ever since all this began. It doesn't always happen, only sometimes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes i have checked the keyboard drivers.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for responding with the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the issue persists even after trying the above methods, I suggest you to

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have problems with your PC, you can reset it. Resetting will re-install Windows but deletes your files, settings, and apps except for those apps that came with your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to <strong>

            <p>Apologies for the later reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I've already considered resetting before but.. I'm not sure. I'm in school right now, and I can't really afford having to reinstall most or all of my programs. That would require a lot of time and patience.. I'm afraid I don't have a backup PC or anywhere
 to backup these programs. I have quite a bit of things installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can do for the meantime?</p>

            Also, NVIDIA released a new driver update, and Photoshop no longer seems to crash the PC anymore... However, the slow performance continues, as well as the keys sometimes getting "stuck".

<p>Hi Allanon04,</p>
<p>Many programs refuse to run, or they run with limitations (for example, they might not display all settings, or they might not save settings you make). On those occasions you do need to use such a program with full capabilities.</p>
<p>To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a local administrator or provide the credentials of a member of the local Administrators group.</p>
<p><strong>To run an application one time with a full administrator access token</strong><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the program icon or a shortcut in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the program icon or shortcut, and then click <strong>Run as administrator.</strong></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the UAC message is displayed, do one of the following:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are logged on as a standard user, or if UAC is configured to always require credentials, enter the appropriate administrative credentials, and then click OK.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are logged on as an administrator and UAC is not configured to always require credentials, click Yes to start the application.</p>
<p>Refer the following link for more information:</p>
