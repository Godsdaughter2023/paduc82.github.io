<h2>            change from composite to HDMI issue</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently updated my tv and have more HDMI slots to plug in the xbox to HDMI. I have previously run the xbox with HD via the composite cables in 1080i, I have plugged in a HDMI cable but the TV isn't picking up the xbox. The TV is capable of 1080i
 and 1080p, the HDMI cable functions with other devices like Apple TV and Cinema Surround System. I have had issues with a PS3 needing configuration before you change to HDMI, what is wrong here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Open Chrome Because of Family Settings, Having been kicked from Microsoft Family</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I use this Microsoft account mostly only for my laptop, but the one time I logged into a friend's Xbox, it put me into his old Microsoft Family settings, So now I have restrictions and have to send emails to open chrome, I tried sending an email to his account
 to get it sorted, but he didn't get an email, so he kicked me from the family, now he has no way of seeing my account on any device, I appear nowhere linked to his account, but I still can't open chrome without sending an email, if I try to launch it, the
 following happens<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91bf38b2-7b2e-44d3-8d84-934d14cef788?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91bf38b2-7b2e-44d3-8d84-934d14cef788?upload=true" /></a><br />

<p>I click the ask by email button, and it just loads an error message, no email has been sent, and I've sat on this issue for a while, but I still can't find a way around it, and yes I know it's weird asking on a Microsoft forum how I can stop using their
 browser, I just prefer chrome...</p>
<p>
</p><p>How on earth can I stop this loop, once again, my friend cannot access or see my account&nbsp;<em>whatsoever</em> The only way my family settings can be changed is by changing them on a browser, which just so happens to be chrome, but when i open chrome to change
 my settings, <strong><em>IT ASKS FOR PERMISSION TO OPEN CHROME</em></strong>. </p>

            Hello JamieBerry1 
<br />Try To remove a member from your Microsoft family, you must have an adult account.
<br />
<br />Go to account.microsoft.com/family and sign in with your Microsoft account.
<br />To remove a child, find their name, then select Content restrictions. Turn off any settings you may have enabled. Then go back to your family’s page, find the child’s name again, and select More options &gt; Remove from family.
<br />This is a screenshot that shows an example of an adult account removing a child account from their Microsoft family.
<br />If you want to remove a child because they’re now an adult, or if an adult account has been misclassified as a child account, they’ll need to verify their account.
<br />To remove an adult, select Remove from family under the name of the person you’re trying to remove.
<br />If you’re the only adult in the family and wish to leave, you’ll need to remove all kids first, then find your name and select Leave family.
<br />
<br />Also you can see more information in this link below

<p>Pedro V Flores,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help, but the account my friend was using is the adult account in his Microsoft family, and whenever he looks at his Xbox account or his computer Microsoft account, my profile shows up nowhere, and therefore he cannot remove me, his computer
 seems to think that I have been removed whereas my computer hasn't received the message, I have attempted this before, and I have seen the page for removing a member from the Microsoft family,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry but this didn't Help</p>

    <title>Force install Windows 7 Service Pack 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firebatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Force install Windows 7 Service Pack 1</h2>
                    I installed SP1 via Windows Update but upon rebooting, it&nbsp;encountered&nbsp;a fatal error 0xC0000022 while installing the files and froze.&nbsp;After a couple reboots, I got my Windows to start. But my Windows version is now changed to SP1 and the update is listed
 in "Add or remove programs", even though the update failed and is listed as such in the update history.&nbsp;I rebooted into safe mode and tried a system restore which failed with error code 0x80070005.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I can't even install SP1 via Microsoft Download Center because the updater thinks it's already updated to SP1, and I also can't go back using System Restore. Uninstalling SP1 also fails with no error. So I'm stuck with a half updated version of Windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to trick Windows into thinking that it's version is not SP1? so I can force another install? Alternatively, how can I restore the updated system files with the original ones via System Restore? And are there are any other methods to manually
 install the files?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, please don't reply with "reinstall Windows". I'm aware that's an option which will almost always work, but I want to try less destructive recovery methods first.</div>

            <p>You are not gonna like hearing this, but since you have exhausted all options, your best option is to do a custom clean install.
</p>
<p>The reference the following Troubleshooting tips for installing Windows 7 SP1:</p>
<p>Which method are you using to install the Service Pack, Windows Update or .exe download from Microsoft Downloads?</p>
<p>If possible, boot into Safe Mode, and do a System Restore before you installed the Service Pack and reference the information I have provided below with instructions about how to install Windows 7 SP1.</p>
<p>Microsoft released the first beta back in June 2010 followed by a Release Candidate late October 2010 and the final RTM availability (February 16 2011 MSDN/TechNet subscribers) and public Availability (February 22 2011). Unlike previous Service Packs, Windows
 7 SP1 does not contain any major improvements; it’s basically a rollup of updates that have been released for the operating system since it went to manufacturing July 22 2009. If you have been diligently updating your computer through Windows Update since
 then, you basically have all that SP1 has to offer.</p>
<p>Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
<p>* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix: http://is.gd/22brle</p>
<p>* 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.</p>
<p>2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.</p>
<p>4. Type CD\ and press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.</p>
<p>Other solutions:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>
<p>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</p>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<p>* Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>* Accept User Account Control permission</p>
<p>* If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>* On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>* Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>* Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>* Click OK.</p>
<p>* When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>* After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<p>* Click Start</p>
<p>* Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>* Click ‘Run as Administrator’</p>
<p>* At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

<p>Check your hard disk for errors, Another obscure thing you could try is disabling User Account Control temporarily.</p>
<p>Install the drivers for your LAN adapter (Wireless, Ethernet or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Its possible you might need to do a BIOS update if one is available for your computer. Also, check for any updated chipset drivers.</p>
<p>Also, disconnect any non-essential devices you might have attached to the system.</p>
<p>Its possible the SP1 download might be corrupt, I would download another copy and try again.</p>

<p>Hi Mick</p>
<p>Thank you for your help</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used Revo Unninstaller to remove all the files in the order you suggested. I then reinstalled ITunes 9.2 only to receive the same message as before.</p>
<p>I am really hacked off as the whole procedure took nearly two hours.</p>
<p>I have never has a problem installing ITunes before (including the 9.2 version). However, this has been on laptops with XP Professional which is a super system. I am wondering if the problem is with Vista which is on this current laptop.</p>
<p>You suggest contacting Apple but the problem is with this operating system as it clearly says "the system administrator is preventing the installation"</p>
<p>Any more ideas please ?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have followed the instructions on Apple Support and entirely removed all the part installed programmes for ITunes. They also advised I deleted the Temp folder but this has not been possible because the message comes up "open in other programmes" despite
 nothing being open except Explorer.</p>
<p>Apple then advised some major changes to MSCONFIG which I felt was not advisable since these were serious sytem changes which are beyond my skills to correct if anything went really wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Is it not possible for Windows to have an answer to what seems a common problem - many people on the Internet are saying they can't install Itunes 9.2 because of the message "Windows Installer has set policies to prevent the installation of this
 programme"</strong></p>
<p>As I said before, I had no problems installing ITunes 9.2 on my last laptop which is no longer available. I have now got a new model with Vista</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p><span>You will ususally get the error message when a system administrator has set up a group policy to prevent applications from being installed.<br />
<br />
You can look at the following link that may help with your issue but it involves&nbsp;changing the registry with regedit.<a href="http://www.appdeploy.com/messageboards/tm.asp?m=8872&amp;mpage=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.appdeploy.com/messageboards/tm.asp?m=8872&amp;mpage=1</a><br />
If you are not comfortable in changing the registry you can take it to an computer repair shop for assistance or ask a friend for help.<br />
<br />
</span><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be

    <title>Windows Media Player &#38; Total Video Converter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kos871  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player &#38; Total Video Converter</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I regularly use Windows Media Player (or occassionally Windows Media Center).&nbsp; My problem is that when I install Total Video Converter (a 3rd party software I use to convert my videos), the video that comes out of Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center
 becomes inverted (upside down).&nbsp; I'm not sure if anybody else has encountered this but I can't seem to fix it and the only recourse is to uninstall Total Video Converter to restore it to normal running state.&nbsp; I really need to use Total Video Converter so
 any help would be very appreciated.&nbsp; I have the latest video drivers already from ATI for my X2300 Mobility Radeon.

<p>
A codec is software that is used to compress or decompress a digital media file, such as a song or video. Content creators use codecs because a compressed file takes up less storage space on your computer and can be transferred across the Internet more quickly
 and smoothly. When you play a digital media file, Windows Media Player uses a codec to decompress the file. Codecs are used to create and play nearly all music or video files on your computer or on Web sites.</p>
<p>
A codec can consist of two components—an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses a file during creation, and the decoder decompresses the file so that it can be played. Some codecs include both components, while other codecs only include one. For example,
 if you install a DVD playback program on your computer, the program will likely install a codec that only includes an MPEG-2 decoder, which allows you to play the DVD on your computer. You would not be able to use the decoder to create your own DVD.</p>

<p><span>You are probably trying to play a file that uses a codec that is not on your computer. When you try to play a file that uses a codec that is not on your computer,
 the Player tries to download the codec from a Microsoft server. If the codec is available, the Player installs it on your computer and then plays the file. If the codec is not available on the server (for example, because the codec wasn't created by Microsoft),
 the Player displays a message that your computer is missing a codec. If you are connected to the Internet, the message usually has a
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Web Help</span><span> button that you can click for more information. If the Player can determine which codec you are missing, when you click that button, a Help topic is displayed that
 contains a link to WMPlugins.com, a Web site that lists a number of codecs that are available to download. The MPEG-2 and DivX video codecs and the ACELP.net and Ogg Vorbis audio codecs are examples of codecs that are not included in the operating system or
 the Player by default. For more information, see </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/faq/codec.mspx#q14_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I find a codec?</a></p>
<p>
In some cases, the file you want to play uses a codec that isn't available or compatible with the Player. When that happens, the Player won't be able to play the file.</p>
<p><span>For information about how you can ensure that the Player will try to download codecs automatically, see

<p>
When trying to find the right codec for a particular file, you can use WMPlugins.com or other Web sites. Typically, you should start with WMPlugins.com first. Note that if you aren't able to find a codec on WMPlugins.com, it is possible that the codec you are
 looking for is not compatible with the Player, so you might not be able to use the Player for this particular file.</p>
<p><span>We recommend that you use caution when installing codecs that aren't listed on WMPlugins.com or Microsoft.com, such as the DivXNetworks Nimo or Tsunami codec packs.
 Incompatibilities are known to exist with some of the components in these codec packs that can cause serious playback issues in the Player and other players, lead to system corruption, and make it difficult for Microsoft Support to diagnose and troubleshoot
 playback issues. For these reasons, we strongly discourage you from installing these codec packs, and recommend that you remove them if you have installed them and are having problems with the Player. We recommend that you only install codecs, filters, or
 plug-ins from trusted, authorized sources, such as the Web site of the official supplier. Even then, we recommend that you use caution, because many codec suppliers offer minimal customer support. If your computer is running Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition
 or Windows XP, we recommend that you set a system restore point before installing any digital media components. This enables you to return to your original system configuration, if necessary. To learn more about security, see the
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/security.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Media Player 11</a><span> or

</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Why do I need a codec to play files in the Player?<br />
</span><span>Generally, Internet content providers compress the audio and video content in files or streams to make them smaller or use less bandwidth. This allows you to quickly download files or stream content. Media players, however,
 can't play compressed files or streams, so you need a codec (compressor/decompressor) to decompress the audio and video data so that it can be played.<br />
For video that contains audio, you will need two different codec's installed on your computer to play back the content correctly—one codec for the video and the other codec for the audio.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Where can I get codec's for the Player?<br />
</span><span>If you have the latest version of Windows Media Player installed, the latest Windows Media audio and video codec's are included so you can play Windows Media files—Windows Media Audio (WMA) and Windows Media Video (WMV). If
 you have an older version of the Player, its codec's may not be up-to-date. To acquire the latest codec's, just set up the Player to download the codec's automatically by doing the following:</span></p>

<h2>            Allow Remote Desktop connections from outside your home network</h2>
                    <div>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/allow-remote-desktop-connections-from-outside-your-home-network</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I've got a question regarding this. Since the default port of RDP-tcp on every pc is 3389, what happens if U have multiple pc's in ur homenetwork (which is standard behind a router) and I try to connect to my router's public ip adress:3389. RDP doesn't know
 what pc to connect to right? (If all settings are made correctly in the router and on the pc's). So if I have multiple pc's in a home network do I have to give every pc a unique port number before I can get started? Or just give the PC I'd like to connect
 to a different number then 3389?
<div><br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is a very good question about assigning RDP connections.</p>
<p>As per my knowledge the answer is NO, you don’t need to assign a unique port number to a different PC which is connected in a Home Network just connect the PC to
 the router, because in RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) Architecture, terminal services are connected or consist of 4 components that are multi-user kernel, the Remote Desktop client, the Terminal Services Licensing service, and Session Directory Services.
</p>
<p>When you connect
<b>router public IP address: 3389</b> in a Home Network, the IP (Internet Protocol)
<span>&nbsp;</span>address of the each computer differs but <b>subnet mask</b> and
<b>default gateways</b> remain same because it is connected to a router which has public IP address.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer the article to know Terminal Service Architecture works.</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755399(v=WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755399(v=WS.10).aspx</a></p>
<p>Note: Ignore the Operating System; just refer the Terminal Service Architecture.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you say it appeared in a scan and as&nbsp;Google&nbsp;information&nbsp;points to it being associated with&nbsp;Malware,&nbsp;it is probably&nbsp;a left over Startup Entry from Malware that has been removed by your Security Programs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <span>runtime error</span> is a software or hardware problem that prevents a program from working correctly. Runtime errors might cause you to lose information in the file you're working on, cause errors in the file (corrupt the file) so you can't work
 with it, or prevent you from using a feature. Unlike <span>stop</span> errors, runtime errors don't typically cause
<span>Windows</span> or a program to stop working.</p>

    <title>Unable to sign into other user accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superspades  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to sign into other user accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8 Pro on my pc. Mine is the admin account and I have my daughter set up with a user account as well as a "visitor" account for other infrequent users. The other day I lost access to being able to log into these accounts on the PC. Usually
 where there is a small arrow to the left of the users log in picture that allows for showing other accounts to select and log into. There is no longer an arrow or any other visible way to switch accounts. The log out option for my user is gone and replaced
 with a sign out, my admin account is the only one available to log into now. I tried deleting the other accounts and setting them up again thinking maybe they had become corrupt, but am unable to get any newly created account to show up as a log in option
 either.</p>
<p>Is there a setting somewhere I have accidentally switched that has disabled multiple user log in options or have I run into some sort of Windows corruption? I am able to completely reinstall from scratch if need be, but thought I would ask before going through
 that! Oh and I tried running system restore but it fails, virus/malware scans not finding bugs either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Eric, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What happens when you try to create a new user account? Do you get any error message?
</p>
<p>2. Have you try to boot the computer to safe mode?</p>
<p>3. Were you using Microsoft account as the administrator profile? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the administrator&nbsp;user profile is corrupted. You may create a new user account&nbsp;and check if you are ablel to login to the other account directly from the start screen. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
<br />
Step 1: </strong>Create a new user account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Create a user account </strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a.<strong> </strong>Press <strong>Windows Key</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. On the top right corner of the <strong>start</strong> <strong>screen</strong> you will find the account you have logged in.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span><strong> </strong></span></span>Click on the <strong>User</strong>
<strong>name </strong>and you will find all the <strong>users</strong> listed or accounts made by you.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span>Try accessing the accounts and let us know what happens.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may check the issue in safe mode and check. </span></p>

            <p>I attempted to create another user account and still nothing is happening. I am not getting any failure notifications during set up. The users also appear in the list when viewing users in the PC Settings menu. However the system is not actually creating
 any corresponding user files. In file explorer under the users folder there is only my user, public, and guest folders. Two of the "new" accounts I have attempted to create are attached to Microsoft accounts and one is a local account, none of which are selectable
 to log in to or have user folders. </p>
<p>I think you probably have the right idea, it appears my admin account is corrupt. And it is a Microsoft account. I am also able to start in safe mode but there is no change in displayed accounts. Something else strange that I'm not sure is linked or not
 is that in the msconfig start up it is always selecting "selective boot", I can change it to normal boot mode, restart, check again and it will be back to selective boot mode.</p>
<p>I am guessing that I will need to delete my own account and force a new set up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for your reply!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span> </li><li><span>Do you have an Anti-virus program installed in your computer?</span> </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to boot your computer to the desktop, follow the instructions in the thread below which has fixed the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system/windows-failed-to-load-because-the-system-registry/7a529e93-0397-478d-974a-129e11aebac5?page=2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system/windows-failed-to-load-because-the-system-registry/7a529e93-0397-478d-974a-129e11aebac5?page=2</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not able to boot, follow the methods below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Start your computer in safe mode with networking</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn't occur while in Safe Mode with Networking</span><span>, we can use 50-50 approach to narrow down the root cause of the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Step 2: &nbsp;Refer to the article below for steps about how to start your computer in clean boot state.</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note: </span>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to boot to the desktop, perform System File Checker [SFC] scan on the computer which will replace the missing or corrupt files &amp; check if the issue persists.</p>

<p>Change your BIOS settings to CD/DVD as the first boot option. (Check manufacturers manual or website for instructions on how to set the first boot device)<br />
Insert your disc and try to follow the steps in the articles mentioned in the previous thread.</p>

    <title>Lenovo Idea Pad sound driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dajohnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Idea Pad sound driver</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Lenovo 3000 Idea Pad Y410 to Windows 7 Professional 64 bit.&nbsp; Everything works great except I get no sound from the speakers or audio jack.&nbsp; When playing a video from a news feed I see the sound in the volume control bar but I hear
 nothing.&nbsp; One support team I talked to said there were no 64 bit device drivers for my RealTek High Definition Audio Device.&nbsp; Other device driver management packages say I have an old version of my "Base System Device" (not sure what this is).&nbsp; One of the
 posts here indicated that it might have something to do with the touchpad.&nbsp; Presently I have no driver loaded for my touch pad.&nbsp; Any help would be much appreciated.

            I tried the Lenovo site.&nbsp; They had a 64 bit driver which I downloaded and attempted to install.&nbsp; A prompt came back indicating some error with the driver.&nbsp; It may be that they don't support my Idea Pad any longer.&nbsp; The curious thing is that I've been downloading
 other&nbsp;drivers from DriverNavigator from Easeware.&nbsp; Audio did come up for a short time but then went away again.&nbsp; I have not been able to recreate what happened.&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp; I still am not clear about the "Base System Device".

            <p>Hi Alex -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your Disk Mgmt shows an EFI System partition, we know now that you have the new generation UEFI BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI install requires the flash stick to be even more specially formatted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Easiest is to use <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Rufus - Create bootable USB drives the easy way</a>&nbsp; to format the bootable stick for UEFI/GPT, load the ISO at the button at bottom to let it write the stick.&nbsp; Please note that you need a reliable, fully intact ISO for your licensed version.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eightforums.com%2fattachments%2ftutorials%2f22850d1370831533-uefi-bootable-usb-flash-drive-create-windows-rufus_done.jpg" height="393" width="233" /></p>
<p>Make sure the settings for Rufus are exactly as shown in this picture, even afte ryou load the ISO image from the disk button shown.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then reboot and tap the ESC key to get a Boot Menu, boot as a UEFI or EFI flash stick.&nbsp; See the difference in the example below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fencrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com%2fimages%3fq%3dtbn%3aANd9GcTDReYTliDwS_1C4g_EM1J_ZmUXnBUazw5TE5niJ8LUUuGfFTOw" height="314" width="505" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours will read slightly different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Continue with the steps for <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/how-to-clean-reinstall-windows-7/d63ef6b3-2949-41f9-bdf2-99a168c552ac?tm=1440439034565">
Clean Reinstall Windows 7</a></p>
<p>which shows the important steps about drivers printed in red.&nbsp; Go to the HP Support Downloads webpage for your exact model to download and extract the Windows 7 Network LAN driver to put it in your backup, so that if Win7 doesn't start up ready to connect
 you can install it to get online, install all Important and Optional Windows Updates which will deliver most other drivers.&nbsp; Later after all Updates are installed you can come back to this location to get any drivers still missing in Device Manager.&nbsp; You can
 check in your Device Manager now to see which model Network Adapter you are using, to help find the Win7 driver for that model.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now continue with steps until you get to "Where do you want to install Windows?" screen.&nbsp; I would delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space, then click Next to have the installer create and Format your partitions for you to avoid mistakes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if you want to save your OEM Recovery partition on the end of the drive, it may still run later from the HP F11 key, or there is a way if the OS will still start that you can
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/installation-setup/233460-problem-my-partners-advent-roma-1001-laptop-oem-slp.html#post1952871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Boot Recovery Partition using EasyBCD</a> to add it to a Dual Boot menu.&nbsp; So you might want to leave only that partition, delete the others to Unallocated Space, highlight that space to Create your install partition along with the multiple small boot and Recovery
 partitions that will come along with it, select the largest partition to Format and click Next.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to ask back any questions, and be sure to answer where you got the ISO, providing a link if necessary.&nbsp; If you have a retail Product Key you can obtain a safe download from

<p>That's the link of the Windows 7 iso file. I followed literally all of the instructions, it may still be to my fault, but I could be wrong.</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect Android Phone to computer</h2>
                    
<p>original title: Android Phone</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am having a problem with my new laptop. I am not sure what happened but I have a T-Mobile G1 android phone and I often use it to connect to the computer to download or upload music, pics, etc., and for some reason, when I selected the USB option on my
 G1 phone to mount on my computer to copy files and my phone's SD card, it should usually show up a dialog option for import pictures or open files, etc., and I also look in My Computer and I don't see the removable drive for my phone like it should. I can
 see in the Devices and Printers window that my android phone is already there, it simply won't mount my phone to the computer in order to copy files and pictures from my phone and I have no idea why. My friend have a computer with Window 7 program just like
 I do and it works fine on her computer. Her computer is HP PC and my computer is HP Laptop. My phone is able to mount on her computer and it won't mount on my laptop. I thought maybe it something wrong with the driver, so i uninstalled it, disconnected my
 phone and reconnected again to download the driver again and it still repeating the same problems, it simply won't let my phone mount to my laptop. Let me know asap if any solution is available for this problem.</p>

<p>If your friend's phone works on your notebook, then you should contact HP as you may have a problem with your USB port.&nbsp; Have you tried another port?&nbsp; Another cable?</p>
<p>From your description it's clear Friend's phone works on Friend's PC and your phone works on Friend's PC but your phone doesn't work on your PC... so the only thing you haven't told us is whether Friend's phone works on YOUR PC.&nbsp; Once we get this sorted,
 we'll find out where the issue actually lies, but at the moment, it's clearly your notebook.</p>

            After deleting the account through two different methods suggested and it still reappeared when I started it back up, I finally decided to try logging into the account. I immediately got a message that there was suspicious activity from someone trying
 to log into my phantom account. &nbsp;A few months ago when I set up security on my desktop I had the option to set up a phantom account to protect it. Is it possible that my laptop local account is the phantom account?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
To help us identify the cause of the issue and then find the proper resolution for it, let us know if you are you still able to access your Windows computer after the BSOD occurred. Also, what is the exact error message? Please send us a screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, we suggest that you follow these methods:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: Find and fix error with corrupted drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
If you are still able to access your Windows computer after the BSOD occurred, follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key</strong> + <strong>X</strong> and select <strong>Device Manager</strong> to check and find error with corrupted drivers.</li><li>When an error is detected, uninstall the driver and reinstall it, or upgrade to the latest version.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2: Search and repair corrupted system files on Windows OS.</strong><br />
<br />
We suggest that you use the System File Checker tool to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files. The sfc/scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted,
 changed or damaged versions with the correct versions possible. To run System File Checker, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>command prompt</strong>, press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt;
<strong>Yes</strong>.</span></li><li><span>At the command prompt, type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (note the space between "sfc" and the "/").</span><br />
<span>Scanning will take a few minutes.</span></li><li><span>R</span><span>estart your PC.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For more info about System File Checker, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but,&nbsp; there is no way for me to access windows as i did a complete reset. Imagine buying a new computer and when you turn it on it asks you to set up your display language etc....I get just past that part, set it to english, then it
 asks me to personalize my pc (set up a username, password etc...) I can NOT get passed that part...when i attempt to CREATE a login, I get the BSOD and it says "system thread exception not handled (AODDriver2.sys)"..So again, no login, no access to windows,
 basically a brand new computer in the stages of setting up a user...everytime i get the error, the pc restarts and gets stuck at the same part (personalize), with the same error.
<br />

            <p>Thank you for clarifying the issue. In this case, we suggest that you refresh your operating system drivers by following these troubleshooting steps, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If you have installation media for Windows, proceed to step 4. <br />
</li><li>If you don’t have installation media, create installation media on another device by going to
<span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8</a></span></span> and click
<strong>Download tool now</strong>.</li><li>Insert a blank DVD or empty USB drive, and follow the on-screen instructions to create installation media for another PC. Make sure you select correct architecture (32/64 bit).</li><li>Plug in the USB drive or insert the DVD into the computer you are trying to fix, and then reboot from media. You might need to configure the BIOS to boot from media first. When booting, most computers indicate a key you can press to bring up the boot menu.
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Modifying BIOS settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS settings can be
 solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</em></li></ul>
</li><li>When you have booted into the media, leave the language, time, and keyboard settings as their defaults, and click
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Repair your Computer</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt;
<strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Type <em><strong>copy x:\windows\system32\drivers\pci.sys c:\windows\system32\drivers /y</strong></em> (where x: is the drive letter of the Windows installation media you inserted), and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Reboot and see if the computer boots back into Windows.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

<p>No, I have not made any updates in the PC except those made mandatory by windows. Some softwares related to my studies were installed in the PC. So no such major changes were made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling wifi drivers, but it didn't worked. And also tried the default troubleshooter program which also failed to recognize the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes it is the first time such a problem occured in my PC.</p>

<p>If you believe your XBOX 360 is causing your discs to crack and break please do not continue to insert more discs in the console, instead contact phone support and speak with them. More than likely you will need to send your console in for repair.<br />
<br />
This problem is usually caused when a console is being moved while being on or being moved right as it's turned off and the disc is still spinning in the drive, but if you're sure your not doing that then you will need to follow the advice listed up top which
 would be to contact phone support and get the console repaired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It does indeed sound like it is your console causing this issue, especially if they are damaged to the extreme you mention.</p>
<p>But! I and many others have had damaged disks, in the manner you describe, by constantly removing games disks from certain types of Xbox games DVD cases, usually the harder plastic ones, some of them put excess pressure on the inner ring of the DVD, and
 this has cased hairline cracks and broken parts on some of my disc. Just another thing to look at.</p>

<p>If you mean ring the disc which can cause the disc not to function than it is either cause the console is being bumped or moved while running a disc. If you mean physically break than there is something seriously wrong with your system as to break it your
 system disc try would have to be broken or shaking. how long ago did you buy your system.</p>
