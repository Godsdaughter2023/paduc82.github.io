            This is a known issue since the latest cumulative update. Sorry, no fix for this yet.
<br />In the meantime, you are advised to use any other photo viewer like IrfanView:

            Hello,
<br />
<br />This is widely reported and known issue at the moment. We're expecting a fix from Microsoft, in upcoming Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />As of now, you can use classic Windows Photo Viewer to view photos:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/open-images-with-windows-photo-viewer-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/open-images-with-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />To edit Photos, you can use MS Paint or third-party program such as Paint.net, IrfanView.
<br />
<br />Regards.

Once you have reached the age of maturity (different in some regions, usually it is 17) you can promote your child account to a regular adult account. The process is really simple and is done on the console. Just follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the&nbsp;<b>Settings Hub</b>&nbsp;on the dashboard and select&nbsp;<b>Account.</b></span>
</li><li><span>Navigate to the&nbsp;<b>Your Information</b>&nbsp;panel and select&nbsp;<b>Promote Account.</b></span>
</li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<b>Yes</b>&nbsp;to connect to LIVE.</span> </li><li><span>Review the prompt and select&nbsp;<b>Continue</b>.</span> </li><li><span>Review and accept the Terms of Use.</span> </li><li><span>Check the boxes if you would like to receive info from Xbox.com and its partners.</span>
</li><li><span>Your account is now officially all grown up!</span> </li></ol>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you've forgotten the information on the account when you attempt to login to your main account you should see the direct parental e-mail associated with the account so you can attempt to accept the terms of service.<br />
<br />
If you don't know the password, you can try and reset it <strong><a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. If you are unable to reset the password, or are unable to get into the account at all, please use the Microsoft Account
 recovery form located <strong><a href="http://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
As far as you being 17 currently, that still means your a minor in Microsoft's eyes. You will be able to promote your account from a Child to an Adult at the age of 18 in the United States, until then you'll have to deal with the parental e-mail on the account.</p>

 Gives "corrupted&nbsp;file" error message but.....&nbsp; My husband is 10 feet away from me using his laptop with windows 7 and outlook express and getting the same email with attachments and he has no problem opening the pictures.&nbsp; However if I forward it to him from
 my windows 8.1 computer then he can't open it either.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>His suggestion is for me to notify all my email buddies to send their emails to him and he would let me read them on his computer.&nbsp; THAT AIN'T GONNA WORK!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Updates</h2>
                    I just re-installed a digital entitlement (free)&nbsp;copy of Windows 10 Pro on a PC with a fully-formatted&nbsp;Toshiba HDD.&nbsp; The install went well and Windows 10 Pro is activated and&nbsp;working fine.&nbsp; Soon after the O/S install, a few Microsoft updates were installed.&nbsp;
 This first batch of updates&nbsp;installed successfully.&nbsp;The next round of updates to install failed to install successfully.&nbsp;When I open Settings/Updates, there are now 8 (eight) updates available for download.&nbsp; The issue is these updates never begin to download.&nbsp;
 When I access&nbsp;Advanced&nbsp;Properties, each update listed&nbsp;states "Waiting to Download" under the description of the update, but the download never begins.&nbsp; I would appreciate any suggestions of fix instructions that any community member may be aware of.&nbsp; Thank
 you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NealO. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&

            <p>Hi Great reply! There are a ton of reasons that cause the updates to fail. Most of the time a claen install is the easiest and quickest way to solve updates problems. Good Idea to run the AVG tool</p>
<p>Team work is good!</p>
<p>Here's link for AVG removal tool!</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting step I would request you to <strong>use the on-screen keyboard
</strong>and then check if it helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of relying on the physical keyboard to type and enter data, you can use On-Screen Keyboard. On-Screen Keyboard displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. You can select keys using the mouse or another pointing device, or you can use a
 single key or group of keys to cycle through the keys on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Press <strong>Windows key + R.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Now type<strong> OSK </strong>in the run dialog box and hit enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert if you face any issues with Windows in future. </p>

    <title>Page Fault BSOD on attempt to install minecraft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moses148  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page Fault BSOD on attempt to install minecraft</h2>
                    <p>Hi, basically every time I open up the minecraft launcher and attempt to install the game but upon doing so it causes a BSOD with the error code of a page fault in unpaged, caused by the fp.sys driver. The minecraft launcher is the only thing to cause this
 bluescreen, I'm able to download and run any number of games and programs other then the minecraft launcher including other java based programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive attempted many things to attempt to fix thing, including a basic hard disk scan for errors while it was running, a system file scan, memory diagnostics, adjusting page file size, removing page file altogether, fixing any registry errors I've got, and
 making sure windows is up to date. I cannot do a system restore because I havnt enabled it, besides I haven't touched minecraft in years so I don't know if this problem is recent.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only two things I can think of doing that I haven't done yet is a full hard disk scan whilst the drive is inactive which last time stopped at 25% so I'm gonna run that and leave it over night, and the other is to completely purge all files of minecraft.
 If anyone has any other ideas as to what could be causing it, it would be much appreciated.</p>

    <title>Cannot use many Older Programs with Windows 7 Home Premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janesdf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot use many Older Programs with Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    
<div>I bought a new pc with Win7 Home Premium a couple of weeks ago since my old pc with WinXP is now just too slow. What I absolutely hate about Win7 is that all of my old software does not work and is not compatible with
 Win7 Home Premium. My software worked on Win95 through WinXP with no problems. Before you ask, I've been to the MS and Win 7 forums, tried the compatibility suggestions and VM suggestions and none of them work with Home Premium. I do not have a separate CD
 with XP to install. However, I do have a Restore CD that came with my older pc that includes XP, however, I was told it would not work with my new pc.<br />
<br />
Some of my older software is no longer available so I cannot buy upgraded versions plus I would have to spend hundreds of dollars for the software that does have upgrades, a waste when my older software is in perfectly good condition to use except with Win
 7 Home Premium. I was told I could buy Win 7 Professional for about $100, but I have no need nor do I want a "professional" edition when I should be able to use my older software. Win7 Pro sounds like a rip-off by MS after they screwed their customers by not
 including XP in Home Premium and creating an OS that does not allow for using older software. I may come to hate more about Win7, but right now, this is my biggest complaint.</div>
<div>Original Title: I also HATE Windows 7 Home Premium!</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Check with the System Maker to see if they have XP installation media for your machine. Also<br />
check with the System Maker's Forums (if any) as there might be others that have solved the<br />
XP installation issue even if XP media is not available.<br />
<br />
One possible option would be to upgrade to Professional or Ultimate so you can run the XP Mode.<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
More however the above should be all you need.<br />
<br />
If you have Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate, or Enterprise then XP mode is an option.<br />
<br />
From a post by Kristan M. Kenney :</p>
<p>"Most applications that were designed for Windows 2000 or Windows XP will still function correctly under all editions of Windows 7, including Home Premium. Some applications check the version number of the operating system and will fail to run&nbsp;if it finds
 an unexpected version number, therefore Windows 7 has a&nbsp;compatibility mode which&nbsp;allows these types of programs to&nbsp;run correctly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There is also another compatibility option geared towards IT professionals and business users which is called "Windows XP Mode," which is essentially a fully-licensed copy of Windows XP Professional running inside of a virtual machine and is only available
 to Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, and Windows 7 Ultimate users.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Windows XP Mode is&nbsp;meant primarily for companies who have designed their own software in-house which is targeted specifically for a version of software - a prime example of this is a web application that only works in Internet Explorer 6 (which is available
 with Windows XP, but not with Windows 7).</p>
<p>For more information on application compatibility with Windows 7, please see <br />

<br />
And more :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get all the benefits of Windows 7 and continue to leverage your investments in older business and<br />
productivity programs that require a PC running Windows XP. Note: Windows XP Mode requires a<br />
download.<br />

<p>I don't even know what SCM is... but I can tell by the error message that an XML-based user configuration file has gotten corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest that you merely move (or rename) that file and let the system rebuild the user configuration file. &nbsp; Typically, application store their user settings in a file like that... it's not normally an essential file... as it's just for your personal
 preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, move or rename:</p>

    <title>Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 not working on windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenlamb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 not working on windows 8</h2>
                    Hello I would like some help with setting up this webcam on windows 8. I installed the download from here&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/d/lifecam-hd-3000 and went through the set up and instillation. However after it seemed to have installed
 there was no icon to click to open it on the desktop. In addition to this I could not find the webcam listed in the applications in the start menu, yet it was listed as a device in the control panel. When plugging the webcam in I got a message saying that
 driver updates were detected and to sign up and register to download them, I went to do this and it was asking for money to install a driver update service, I declined to do that, I just purchased a webcam and I expected teh drivers to be up to date or at
 least available for update.<br />
<br />
<br />
So please help. When I plug the webcam in a blue light flashes twice and then it's not detected anywhere. It's extremely frustrating.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.

    <title>Cannot Disable Program Compatibility Assistant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mobius187  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Disable Program Compatibility Assistant</h2>
                    I'm hoping someone can provide me with a way to disable the Program Compatibility Assistant. I had this same problem during the Beta, but of course during Beta testing I was using Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp;First off let me begin by&nbsp;pointing out&nbsp;that I&nbsp;am running
 using&nbsp;<strong>Windows 7 Home Premium</strong>.<br />
<br />
That said, I&nbsp;realize this means that the most common solution, using Local Group Policy Editor to disable the Program Compatibility Assistant&nbsp;will not work, as Home Premium does not include
<strong>gpedit.msc</strong>.<br />
<br />
Now this is the confusing part, at least for me. I found an alternative solution specifically meant to address this limitation. I was directed to access
<strong>Services</strong>, and upon locating Program Compatibility Assistant Service, Stop the service and then Disable it (via Properties for that service). I did exactly that. It's stopped and the Startup Type is "Disabled". I even rebooted.<br />
<br />
Now here is the part that confuses me... it still comes up. How can it do that when I have the service stopped? Is it another aspect of Windows 7 security I'm unaware of that needs to be disabled?<br />
<br />
As a note, when I attempted to install the software in question I did choose to "Run as administrator", just in case, and that still had no benefit. If anyone knows what I should do, including instructions on editing my registry, let me know. Thanks.

            Hi Mobius187,
<div><br />
I am afraid to say that in Windows 7 Home Premium it is not possible to disable this feature.<br />
As the only way to&nbsp; disable it is by using Group Policy Editor.</div>

    <title>Windows 7 reversed my monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blitzwing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 reversed my monitors</h2>
                    When I had Vista I installed a second monitor (dual head nvidia GTX275) and all was fine and dandy, the second monitor was\\.\Display2. I installed Windows 7 with both monitors attached and now it has decided that my primary
 monitor should be Display 2 and my secondary monitor should be display 1! Sure, I have visually fixed this, but when I write XNA applications it defaults to
\\.\Display1 which is my secondary monitor. How can I reverse them so my primary monitor is\\.\Display1 like it should have been in the first place?

            Assuming you are using Nvidea drivers to impliment dual monitors, the position of the monitors is an option in your Nvidia control panel (rt click desktop, to select). If you are saying an application opens in the 'wrong' monitor, it depends on the control
 panel version as to whether an app can be 'made' to open on a particular monitor (my version of control panel doesnt have this option under win7)

<p>I'm using the standard Windows control panel Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Display\Screen Resolution</p>
<p>It decided that my second monitor should be&nbsp;Display 1 when&nbsp;Vista had this already sorted out correctly. Why would Vista do it one way then Windows 7 reverse it when I haven't touched the cables. I haven't actually tried reversing the cables yet either, but
 I'm certainly not happy about it.</p>

            If you are not using the Nvidia control panel, to manage multimonitor setup, then in Win7 Help &amp; Support, type multi monitor, you will then find instructions on how to manage the default win options. No need to switch cables, it just needs you to adjust
 the settings, why would you be unhappy, you are using a new o/s and the settings are different to your old sys

            Unfortunately thats not quite what I mean. I have reversed the monitors in the control panel, but that doesn't stop the fact that its still Display 2. Vista isn't that different from 7 and there is no reason I can see that my primary monitor plugged into
 the primary output of my only video card should not have stayed Display 1. Its not "an application" that is selecting the wrong monitor as such, XNA is a programming API made by Microsoft, and it liks to pick&nbsp;Display 1&nbsp;and seems to ignore changes you have
 made. This API is simply a wrapper over DirectX, so I don't exactly think it's wrong. Regardless the issue is that I want to restore what Vista had done correctly and Windows 7 has screwed up.

            So wait, when you right click on Desktop &gt; "Screen Resolution" and you check the box saying "This is my main monitor" under the one you want, this doesn't work? It should make your 'main monitor' Display 1...<br />
Try playing around with that.. Unless you mean something else (you can also drag the monitor pictures around, so that you position your secondary monitor on the left/right)

<p>No that works fine. Windows 7 assigned my primary monitor as Display 2 during install, and will not let go of this fact no matter if I unplug the other monitor and restart or switch plugs on my graphics card.<br />
<br />
\\.\Display2 1680x1050 [Default]<br />
\\.\Display1 1280x1024<br />
<br />
Under Vista it was <br />
\\.\Display1 1680x1050 [Default]<br />
\\.\Display2 1280x1024<br />
<br />
I physically changed nothing when I installed 7. When I'm developing in XNA it likes to choose Display 1 even though Display 2 is my default. I can make it change by in code, but thats not my point. My point is I want it to be the way it was under Vista so
 that my primary monitor is actually Display 1, as there has never been a reason for it to be any other way. It's personal, you know?</p>

<h2>            upgrade faile to Windows 10 3rd party hardware for HP and other not ready</h2>
                    <p>I have a new HP EliteBook Revolve 810 G3 Tablet which I had hoped to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 Pro, the install of the upgrade, upgrading, and rebooting to Window 10 seems to be fine with no errors at all.&nbsp; However on the reboot I had no external
 monitors which worked fine before on Windows 8.1 Pro connected via HDMI cables to the two ports on the HP Slim Docking Station.&nbsp; Additional, a number of other drivers were in generic mode now in Windows 10 and nothing I did&nbsp; even calling HP and creating an
 HP ticket worked.&nbsp; Lastly, which was the final straw was that the Window 10 upgrade of Windows 8.1 seems to disable and corrupt my antivirus and internet security software VUORE Business Premium Agent and wanted to enable Microsoft Defender and scan my system.&nbsp;
 At this point two plus hours I selected the restore previous OS (Windows 8.1 Pro).&nbsp; This process was seamless and I am back up and running this morning.&nbsp; HP EliteBook Revolve 810 G3 Tablet.&nbsp; Not sure how to give Microsoft this feedback other than this. I suspect
 this will get worked out. I still will work with HP and the folks from VIPRE to see.</p>

    <title>BSOD and Startup.nsh - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coltonbrayton  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD and Startup.nsh</h2>
                    Hey guys! So I've done my searching for the problem on the computer physically and now I'm here for the virtual side searching for help. But anyways, let's get to the problem!<br />
<br />
So a few days ago this randomly occurred. I turned on my screen in the morning and saw the dreadful "Startup.nsh." I then proceeded here to ask the question about it, shown here, http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2505517/type-startup-nsh-issue.html . Just
 read the first message in case you click it. But now after tracking down the issue and the bypass, I have more information to tell you that deserves and entire different thread and question.<br />
<br />
So when I turn on the computer, usually my keyboard lights up like normal. It doesn't. Then the MSI logo shows itself on the screen for about 2 seconds and then onto the next screen. "Startup.nsh" and I can't press any keys to skip it which explains why the
 keyboard isn't lighting up... :/ So I did some tinkering around with the system and found that this is a bypass which somehow could be the problem.<br />
<br />
After seeing the "Startup.nsh" screen, I turn off my computer, take out the one stick of Corsair Vengeance 8GB 1866 RAM stick of the DIMM, turn the computer one for about 7 seconds, nothing pops up (which is fine and is supposed to happen because there's no
 RAM in it). I then proceed to turn it off again. Put the RAM back in. Turn the computer on. Then it say's "There's been a change in CPU or RAM would you like to enter setup (BIOS) or continue to load with the previous data." Again my keyboard light isn't on
 and I can't press F1 or F2 or anything to continue. SO then I turn it off again. Then back on. And it gives me the same enter BIOS or continue to load previous data. But now my keyboards light is on and I can press what I need to! So I go in to BIOS, move
 my primary boot drive (my one and only HDD) to secondary and then back to primary. Then I click save configurations and reboot. The PC reboots. MSI screen. THEN THE BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS LOGO!! :D it boots up!!<br />
<br />
"Okay, great so why are you posting this?" Because every time I do this process, it end's up in the BSOD -___-. How? Basically it's inevitable. I let the PC sit there for 15-30 minutes not using it at all and... BSOD... It gives me this and says to look it
 up which I have and have found no answer, "Kernel_Data_Inpage_Error." And is stuck on 0% forever. http://tinypic.com/r/2q0ksiq/8 [img]http://tinypic.com/r/2q0ksiq/8[/img]<br />
<br />
So I turn off the PC. Turn it back on. MSI logo. And again.... "Startup.nsh"...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WHAT IS THIS MADNESS!?&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<h2>            neighbors are somehow using my internet.</h2>
                    I have 1 computer that I am on now and a WII and an XBOX. I tried to change the password because 3 of my&nbsp;of &nbsp;neighbors are somehow using my internet.
<div>My router is Cisco Linksys E2500. When I changed the password I lost my WII and my Xbox.&nbsp;</div>
<div>1 of my neighbors is very good with getting into my computer and it's driving me crazy.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have been reading for days about networking and security but it's hard to get the WII and XBOX working together.</div>
<div>I am starting to think if I should run ethernet cables to each device.&nbsp;</div>

You need to configure your router so that it uses WPA encryption. Ask the experts in a networking forum (http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/threads) for further advice if necessary.<br />

    <title>Issues with proxy servers involving Windows Live Messenger, Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j2bjosh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with proxy servers involving Windows Live Messenger, Windows Media Player, and Internet Explorer...</h2>
                    I've lately been having issues with the above programs and with them connecting to the internet. I didn't quite figure out what was going on until I attempted to sign into Windows Live Messenger one day and it wouldn't let me connect due to a problem with
 the proxy server and key ports... And ever since then, I haven't been able to browse the web with Internet Explorer, get on Windows Live, nor access the online music store for Windows Media player. Can anyone help me with this issue?

            J2BJosh,
<div><br />
<div>It's important you try some of the solutions Mouneshwar provided so we can continue to troubleshoot the issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here are some important steps to try that I think will resolve the issue:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>
<p>Web browser add-ons add features (for example, extra toolbars, animated mouse pointers, stock tickers, and pop-up ad blockers) to your web browser. While browser add-ons can enhance your online experience,
 they can occasionally interfere or conflict with other software on your computer. Try starting Internet Explorer without add-ons to see if the problem goes away. Here's how:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span>&nbsp;button&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows+7%2fMain%2f4%2ff%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33.jpg" />,
 click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">All Programs</span>, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Accessories</span>, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">System Tools</span>, and then click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</span>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Manage Add-ons to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on
 is causing the problem.</p>
<div>
To open Manage Add-ons
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open Internet Explorer by clicking the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span>&nbsp;button&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows+7%2fMain%2f4%2ff%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33.jpg" />.
 In the search box, type<span style="font-weight: bold">Internet Explorer</span>, and then, in the list of results, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Internet Explorer</span>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Tools</span>&nbsp;button, and then click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Manage Add-ons</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
</span></div>
<div><span>
<p>If disabling add-ons doesn't solve the problem, try resetting Internet Explorer back to its default settings. This removes all changes that have been made to Internet Explorer since it was installed,
 but it doesn't delete your favorites or feeds.</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Close all Internet Explorer or&nbsp;<span>Windows</span>&nbsp;Explorer windows.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Open Internet Explorer by clicking the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span>&nbsp;button&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows+7%2fMain%2f4%2ff%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33.jpg" />.
 In the search box, type<span style="font-weight: bold">Internet Explorer</span>, and then, in the list of results, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Internet Explorer</span>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Tools</span>&nbsp;button, and then click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Internet Options</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced</span>&nbsp;tab, and then click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Reset</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Reset Internet Explorer Settings</span>&nbsp;dialog box, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Reset</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When you are done, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Close</span>, and then click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Close Internet Explorer and reopen it for the changes to take effect.</p>
</li></ol>
</span></div>
<div>Hope that helps!</div>

    <title>Explorer constantly crashing&#47;restarting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> igorpiedra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer constantly crashing&#47;restarting</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday i installed the Anniversary Update, and immediately after booting my PC, the background and task bar started flickering. I went to the task manager and i discovered that the Explorer process was restarting itself each second or so, i tried many
 fixes, but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to leave system restore for last resort as i don't have another drive, computer or any device where to backup my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have DTI audio or any antivirus, and the problem persists in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me, i'll try to provide as much information as i can, sorry if i'm not being clear.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Looks like&nbsp;TwinUI.dll is the faulting module, still trying to fix it, killing the explorer process stopped the loop, but also turned my desktop black and made the task bar disappear, i'll keep working on a fix.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Computer acting strange, possible virus or malware. Without hesitating, restored back to factory using system restore.</h2>
                    <p>Before I restored it, would run a Microsoft Security Essentials. Program would run for 20+ hours. Scan results revealed there was malware :Trojan WIN32/Dynamer!ac &nbsp; &nbsp;Result: Partially removed</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I try going to the next step, but never seen it through completing. Said "to hell with it," and did a factory reset on PC. &nbsp;After that, downloaded Microsoft SE and ran the program. Same results. Ready to pitch it in the trash altogether...</p>

<h2>            Xbox Enforcement Team</h2>
                    <p>I'm not the type of person that believes in unfair, unquestioning, authoritative punishment as the XET does. After receiving the notice below, I decided to study up on the XET to determine exactly who they think they are. From one I've been able to tell, they are cowards. They leave no contact information to reach them at, and will contact you via email which you cannot rely to. They screw you over depending on however they judge a certain event, and hide behind this opaque wall of "online justice" if anyone has an issue with it. The fact that I'm writing creating a forum post, my first ever, to get their attention should be statement enough. Now, as for the "hate speech" in question, I am targeted because rather than reporting the various team-killers and trolls I'm often paired with in games, namely Halo, I choose to message the offender instead, in order to get to the bottom of this. Why are they acting this way, and does the root of such behavior stem beyond that of boredom in a vid

I had never been banned until the last 9 months, and I have a good reputation, I believe one ban was for the word "p****" which to my understanding is a word for&nbsp;a cat. Slang is not official language, nor does it give them the right to take back my digital property. When i purchase an item at a store, they can't take it back if im mean to someone. That's theft.</p>

The next thing I know, I'm banned!&nbsp;<br /><br />I have been an Xbox Live account holder for almost 10 years now, never with a problem. I guess people can harass you, but if you say a naughty word then you can get banned. I think this is a backwards system. For 10 years, I've never spammed or harassed anyone, I have a good reputation, etc. But they are ok with people being spammers or harassing you?&nbsp;<br /><br />And, ultimately, it's just so silly to think about language like that. If I would have said "funk off" or some other minor variation, that's ok, but because I actually spelled it out, I get banned? I did

 </blockquote> <p>Thank you. Just because Xbox is the one that made these stupid rules, and the fact I enjoy Halo (which is only on Xbox),&nbsp;doesn't make it fair. Like I'm really going to sit there reading the terms of agreement and decline to use it after I already bought the damn machine. It's a joke. That's like suddenly hanging a&nbsp;sign that reads, "We Reserve The Right To Refuse Service To Anyone" in a store that Pete has been going to for years. A new employee starts working at this store, and one day a&nbsp;customer has a disagreement with Pete. This customer runs off to tell this new employee, who then implements a disciplinary action that makes it so that Pete can only eat seventy five percent of the many bar he paid one hundred percent of the money for.&nbsp;</p>

Laptop- Acer extensa 5630EZ<br />
<br />
is it possible to connect old PC&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;with only vga&nbsp;cable, scarlet lead, hdmi cable and red white and yellow inputs without anything else to xbox 360 using laptop as middle piece?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you have an option of HDMI. I would have<span>&nbsp;
</span>you refer to the link below:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1: Dual monitor setup: Two monitors are better than one</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/organization/twomonitors.aspx#fbid=a8NuFWtDDJ4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/athome/organization/twomonitors.aspx#fbid=a8NuFWtDDJ4</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Some video cards require you to connect to the TV through (multiple) monitor settings. Until you do this, the TV signal may
 not be routed over the HDMI output.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>With nVidia card, for instance, you have to use the nVidia Control Panel (right click on desktop and then nVidia
 Control Panel) to set your Computer display and TV display whether both should show the same (aka clone setting), independent, or used to extend the desktop. This setting usually stays for as long as the computer is not rebooted even if the TV is switched
 off. If the computer is restarted you've to re-do the TV settings. The TV detection by video card also varies from TV to TV. Some can only be detected if switched to an HDMI port, while others (in the minority I think) can be detected regardless of their AV
 settings. This may also be dependent on the video card.</span></p>
<p><span>To confirm that your TV HDMI input port is OK, if you can, try with another TV HDMI input.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 3:
</span></p>
<p><span>Connect a Standard VGA display to the computer and check if it works</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start and click Control Panel and then click on Personalization.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on Display Settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under Display Settings click the Settings Tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then Select the monitor display from the drop down under Display.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Put a checkmark against “Extend my Windows Desktop onto this monitor”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on Apply and then click the Advanced Button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Graphics card tab that is installed on the computer, for example, Intel Graphics media Accelerator, and then click the Graphics properties button under Advanced.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Next, under the Display devices select Television as Single Display and under Multiple Display Select primary device as television and secondary device as notebook or laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on Ok on all the windows to close the Display properties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please post back if you have any questions regarding Windows. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that
 you can utilize to get the issue resolved.</span></p>
