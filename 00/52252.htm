<h2>            Roaming</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I noticed that all of the picture files I had saved on my computer have disappeared since I installed the first part for Windows 10 Version 1803 , sometime in March I believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been searching for assistance by using support.microsoft.com\en-us on how to find out what happened to them.&nbsp; A couple of answers I fould some new folders I did not create.&nbsp; Roaming is one of them.&nbsp; My new Roaming file contained two folders, 1.&nbsp; Camera
 Roll, and 2. Saved Pictures.&nbsp; Unfortunately, if my pictures were supposed to be moved into these new folders that were made without my knowledge or permission, Microsoft missed the mark.&nbsp; I can't find any of the Pictures I had saved on MY home computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, Microsoft should not be creating folders on computers that are privately owned, AND if Microsoft feels the need to overstep good business practices, then would it be too much to ask to be notified of the changes so your customers could find our personal
 documents?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else encountered this problem?&nbsp; Do you know how to recover our files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi Ruth.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is it possible the PC started up into a Temp Profile because your profile wouldnt load?  This is far too common in Windows 10, but you'd likely notice that nothing looks normal.  But your files would then probably be in your old account reached via C:\Users\Your User Name.  
<br />
<br />If not check at C:\windows.old which is where the upgrade might archive files if it fails during upgrade install.  
<br />
<br />I'd also check in OneDrive where it may create a separate Pictures and Documents folders for your online OneDrive files, however these remain contained in OneDrive folder on your PC and in the cloud via your Mircosoft Account at oneDrive.
<br />
<br />If none of these help then I'd do some keyword searches for files to see if it can locate them.  It's very rare they are lost completely because the install would fail so badly it wouldnt' start at all.  Even then we can often help you rescue them using a boot disk, but that isn't needed here from what you say.  Also, only in forums will we do these things because we don't work from Support scripts that don't get creative.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Hi Ruth, you may be logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around
<br />Restart your PC 3 or 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

</p><p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HATE WINDOWS 10!!!!&nbsp; It takes weeks to get my computer back to useable with almost every Windows 10 Updates that I receive.&nbsp; My Windows 7 computer died, so I had to buy a new computer and it had Windows 10 pre-installed.&nbsp; My life has been&nbsp; a living HELL
 ever since I purchased my current computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was very expensive, and if I had any information on what a monster Windows 10 would be, I would have purchased any computer that did not use any Microsoft products.&nbsp; With Windows 10, Microsoft decided customers have no rights to privacy or what programs
 are added or removed from our privately owned computers.&nbsp; Needless to say, I don't trust Microsoft anymore and I stay off of all the new programs written so customers can not disable them..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Edge or Bing appear on the screen I turn it off.&nbsp; I'm using Google as my default search engine.&nbsp; I closed by Skype accoung when I discovered Microsoft bought Skype.&nbsp; I don't use Cortana.&nbsp; My internet carrier is a small business called Century Link, because
 it's part of my Direct TV account.&nbsp; I don't use Outlook.&nbsp; The only account I have with Microsoft is my CenturyLink.net email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never sighed up for the Windows 10 Insider Build Listm, so I don't know when it was added.&nbsp; Of course that means I have no Idea how far back I need to go to reset my Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the 1803 Fall Creators Update I discovered all of the pictures I had saved to my computer have disappeared, and I have no idea how many hoops I will need to jump through to recover those files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I know is that I anm so fed up with how Microsoft is treating their customers that I just might have to purchase another computer and hope I locate a local geek to recover and move all of my personal emails, documents and and pictures over to a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think you can help me with any of these problems, please reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ruth 801</p>

            Hi Ruth.  
<br />
<br />Let's get everything back in place and see how it runs to correct anything that needs fixing.
<br />
<br />Then if you want you can turn off Windows Updates to avoid the hassle. 
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> There are even good reports from users now who've had them shut off for awhile and only install the Version Upgrades twice a year from the Media Creation Tool which is the most stable method anyway, and includes all previous Updates rolled in. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />As to the missing pictures.  Did you check for any other Users at C:\Users that might actually be your old User account that couldn't start after the Update?  Browse into those to see if you find your files where they were located.  If not check also at C:\windows.old under your User name there.  These are two locations where Windows might have archived the files if your old Account couldn't start up.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise the only other place they could be is in C:\Users\Your user Name\OneDrive where there is a secondary Pictures and Documents folder for working with these online.  Do you see those?       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Greg,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I changed the way I get updates from Microsoft to Metered.&nbsp; This morning I tried to update Office Progessional Pro.&nbsp; I selected update now, and I get. . . New updates are available for Office.&nbsp; We can download them in the background and won't interrupted
 your work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We noticed your internet connection may have a data limit, so you could be charged for the data used to download these updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you want to start downloading updates now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reply yes, but nothing is downloaded.&nbsp; Is that because I have changed updates to Metered?&nbsp; Is there a place in settings to accept updates for Office and a way to keep Updates for Windows 10 to metered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, under the block to download the Office updates, is a second box.&nbsp; The second box is About Word:&nbsp; Learn more about Word support, product ID, and copywright information.&nbsp; Version 1802 (Build 9029.2253 Click-to-run)&nbsp; Monthly channel.&nbsp; Does Version 1802
 build mean that Microsoft has not removed my computer from any and all Insider Build list as I requested two days ago? And when I tried the second, third, fourth.....or more that I still won't get the Updates&nbsp; for Office Professional Plus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For every question I have, using support.microsoft.com just makes me have more questions.&nbsp; Is there a place to Opt Out of every possible Insider list out there?&nbsp; How do I make sure I've been permanently removed from every Insider Build List?&nbsp; &nbsp;I can't update
 Office because of some other Insider List?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mess because I was added to Insider listings isn't getting better.&nbsp; It gets worse every day and how am I supposed to try to recover some of my missing files!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You asked if I checked for any additional Users at C:\Users that could be my old User account that couldn't start after the Update?&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't have an old user account.&nbsp; I'm the only person who uses this computer.&nbsp; There
 is a Ruth Smith account under users, but that's the only user account that I created since I bought this new computer and the picture files there do not contain pictures.&nbsp; There is a Roaming file I did not create and two folders: Camera Roll and Saved Picture.&nbsp;
 Both files are empty.</span></p>
<p>There are so many files listed on my computer that I did not create.&nbsp; Microsoft has to be adding them.&nbsp; One Drive, under that file is a Links folder, then I have the 3D Objects that I will never use and I want
 to remove, App Data that contains Local, LocalLow, Roaming, and Temp, an Intel file with a Log folder, a Links file, a MicrosoftEdgeBackups that's wasted space because I refuse to use Edge, a second One Drive file, a Tracing file that contains a WPPMedia folder
 (I have no idea what is being Traced), under my Libraries there is another Camera roll file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't create and I don't use any of these items.&nbsp; I'm so confused about what's happening on the computer I own that I'm not sure I can be sure if it's the last computer I purchased.&nbsp; I have files that appear and disappear at the whim of Microsoft.&nbsp; Some
 programs that have been removed were Microsoft products that I purchased separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help because Microsoft doesn't let me have control over what is added or removed from my computer and it's all because Windows 10 has always been a flawed product and Microsoft should have never released it.&nbsp; Greg, I don't expect you to be able to
 fix all of the things that Windows 10 Updates have screwed up, but do you have any idea who I should try to contact at Microsoft to see if anyone there can try to fix some of these.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if I can remove Office Updates from being metered?&nbsp; I don't want to remove Metered updates from the Windows 10 system.&nbsp; Office is a separate Microsoft program, and I guess I need to be able to Update Office.&nbsp; Again I have Office Professional
 Plus, not Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No wonder my two brothers that retired from the FBI, and one was in charge of the computer forensics department.&nbsp; They both bought Mac's and neither of their new computers use a Microsoft opertating system.&nbsp; They said Windows 10 is too dangerous to have.&nbsp;
 To bad they didn't warn me or our other 5 siblings.&nbsp; I'm one of eight children.&nbsp; But I bought my current Desktop before they retired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what needs to be done to fix the problems Microsoft has created.&nbsp; Every time I think I have a few of the problems corrected either new updates are released by Microsoft or trying to follow written solutions from Support creates more things
 that need to be fixed.&nbsp; I've used almost every Windows Operating Systems created by Microsoft.&nbsp; Not 2000, Millennium, Vista, or Windows 8 or 8.1 and in my last work position l linked to our field employees at True Value, and I fixed problems they were having
 with their computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is impossible and I'm afraid to try to fix anything else on my own to get my computer to work the way it should.&nbsp; I'm retired.&nbsp; I use my computer to research things via the Internet, to stay in touch with family and friends using email, and to
 shop online a few times each year.&nbsp; Since I retired, I make quilts for the kids at St. Jude (I could send you some pictures of them, but I've lost all of my saved pictures), I knit scarves for our military in the Middle East, I volunteer with Special Olympics,
 I'm a Red Cross National Disaster Volunteer, and my husband and I work with Habitat for Humanity and Wounded Warriors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want Windows 10 to be as easy to use as Windows 7, and I want Microsoft to keep their hands off of my computer.</p>
<p>Is tha really too much to ask?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, do you know who or what department at Microsoft I need to call for help with all of the problems?&nbsp; There's no way I can try to repair my system with actually speaking to those individuals.&nbsp; Or if you can explain how to reset my computer back
 to where it was at the first of 2018, and how I get removed from any and all Insider Builds for my computer, I'd try to follow your directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take pity on me if you can help me reset Windows 10 and get removed from Insider Builds.&nbsp; I'd be so grateful.</p>

            I would not worry about the Office Updates which can wait along with the other WIndows Updates until you're ready to do the Version Update via the Media Creation Tool.  Then after it installs, let Windows Update supply any others like Office updates before metering them again.
<br />
<br />You also should not be getting Insider builds while metered.  Did you shut them off at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Insider program?  
<br />
<br />Unless you have serious performance problems then I'd not bother with doing a reinstall or Reset.  But if you still have a factory install, you might consider doing the automated Fresh Start which reinstalls Windows 10 and leaves out the Factory Bloatware which corrupts and throttles Windows.  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />I'd also like to help you set up a backup.  Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>  while also has a file backup program that works better than Windows.

<p>
</p><p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all of your suggestions.&nbsp; The biggest would be backing up my system.&nbsp; I have never backed up this computer becasue I am continually fixing problems created by Microsoft Updates and all of the "New Windows 10 Versions" that Microsoft is constantly
 forcing onto their customers' privately owned computer.&nbsp; Why would I take a chance of backing up a computer that always has problems, programs and files that appear and disappear, that I can't find because Microsoft never tell us exactly what changes they
 are making or why the changes are necessary to begin with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, since I never signed up for Insider Builds, I don't know how to or what segments of Windows 10 are getting the Insider Builds.&nbsp; I thought you only had to go to one place in settings to stop all of them. I have never really had a two or three weeks
 period when I try to learn more about what can and can't be done in Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm actually afraid to do much of anything on this computer.&nbsp; I know that Microsoft thinks that I am in agreement with everything in the Privacy Policy for Windows 10 because after I bought a new computer with Windows 10 pre-installed, I had an idea that
 I should probably plug the computer into my electric outlet and turn the machine on.&nbsp; I say that because when my screen started up for the first time, I had a large pop up box that basically stated, "by the act of me starting my Windows 10 computer you have
 already agreed to the Privacy Policy for Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>****************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>I tried to tell them that the 48 page 1998 Federal Identity Law (yes I have a full copy of this law) states clearly on page 11 states: The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act makes it a Federal crime when someone or a business:&nbsp; knowingly transfers
 or uses, without lawful authority, (a warrant with the exact name of an individual or Written or Verbal approval from the individual/s), a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit or to aid</p>
<p>or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a felony under any applicable State or local law.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that under the act, a name of Social Security is considered a "means of identification."&nbsp; So is a credit card number cellular telephone electronic serial number or any other piece of information that may be used alone or in conjunction with other information
 to identify a specific individual."</p>
<p>
</p><p>****************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when Microsoft proclaimed, we will collect, archieve, and disburse your personal information, personal documents, email, social networking information and even some of their customers financial as they see fit . . . . I'm pretty sure they are in violiation
 of this 1998 Identity Theft Law.&nbsp; I know that is no warrant with my name from any law enfocement agency in the United States, and I never gave Microsoft an approval for the Windows 10 Privacy Statement verbally or in written.&nbsp; Their statement that I agreed
 because I start my computer would make that remark is making everything they are forcing on their customers invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you ever hear of the Microsoft Management Console, or MMC that the Microsoft Online Support pages suggested I use the MMC to help clarify some of the problems I was having.&nbsp; It's an internal legal that Microsoft is using as a "get out of jail" safety
 net.&nbsp; Before they ever released Windows 10, the Microsoft Legal included a clause that no individual or business would be allowed to start a Class Action lawsuit with regards to Windows, without a minimum of 3 years in Arbitration?&nbsp; To me that just proves
 Microsoft knew that Windows 10 as a totally flawed Operation System.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>They thought they'd still increase the annual profits by selling their customers' private information.&nbsp; They created a whole new array of associated programs, like Cortana, WiFi Sense, Microsoft Edge, the Bing search engine, which suggests websites that
 really nasty Trojan Viruses, that can never be removed or un-installed by their customers.&nbsp; hey purchased Skype and I bet most users of Windows 10 are totall in the dark that Skype has changed hands.&nbsp; They went out of their way to make sure Microsoft was in
 complete control of every individual act on a Windows 10 Operating System.&nbsp; Customers aren't even allowed to decide what programs can be added or removed from our privately own computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well guess what, they were wrong.&nbsp; The country of France was the first one to sued Microsoft in July of 2016. The suit was dropped in June of 2017 because Microsoft is now collecting less than 1/2 of the data that was collected before the suit was filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">In

<h2>            Disk 0 &#40;C&#58; D&#58;&#41; Almost all the time 100&#37; active time. Windows 10</h2>
                    I turned on my laptop after about 1 month. It took about 5 mins to turn on to write the password. After I wrote the password, it took about 10 mins for my laptop to load up my desktop. After I went on my task manager and I noticed that my disk usage was
 100% active time. So I went into services.msc and disabled&nbsp;background intelligent transfer service and superfetch and then I restarted my laptop. But that fixed the problem so little. The active time is almost always 100% or close to that. Two software in
 processed in task manager that were the highest in disk are windows problem reporting or system and compressed memory. I didn't download buy windows 10, it came built-in with it when I bought it just to let you know. Is there anything that I can do? Defrag
 probably?

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I just want to add that PAL and NTSC aren't the only things that will determine if a game will run on the console, you will also need to take the DVD region into account, since games can be regionally locked too.</p>
<p>Neither of those limitations can't be changed on the console since they are determined by hardware. So any regionally locked game may not work on that console.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>When you press the Print Screen key...the screenshot is copied to your Windows Clipboard. Each successive capture replaces the last. If you wish to save these screenshots they must be pasted into a program that can save
 them Windows Paint for example.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span>Suggest you to save the print screen images directly in the OneDrive folder located in File Explorer to check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Further, in the OneDrive settings window, flip to the “Auto save” tab and check the box to enable “automatically save screenshots I capture to OneDrive”. Click ok to save the setting.</span></span></p>

<h2>            How to change the order of the startup programs in win 7</h2>
                    <p>I have read two threads on this neither of which give an adequate answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is simple. Is it possible to change the order of the start up programs in win 7. Possible answers 'YES' or 'NO'</p>
<p>
</p><p>If YES how do you do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If NO. why not?&nbsp; And is there third party software to do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a startup where one program/process loads before another program/process which it is dependent on hence I the first program does not start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to change this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if it's not possible to change would uninstalling both and then re-installing in the order they need to load fix it?</p>

</p><p>Possible but not easy.&nbsp; You can create a scheduled task that executes on login that first launches app a then calls a second scheduled task that starts the second.&nbsp; (search schedule task) I would give exact steps but am not on a win 7 machine atm.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account Verifiction Email - Where is it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>New HP Laptop, Windows 8 upgraded to 8.1. I am trying to verify a .me.uk domain email address as the primary sign in address and I am not receiving any verification emails. I am using Office 365 Outlook. Outlook and the email address are sending and receiving
 okay.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>checked the spelling</li><li>checked junk mail in Outlook</li><li>contacted ISP who confirms spam settings are merely prefixing the Subject of the email and not deleting</li><li>contacted Microsoft Customer Services, who said use a different email(!) or go to answers.microsoft.com (here I am)</li><li>used a different email with a .co.uk domain name and still nothing</li></ul>
<p>[EDIT BEGIN] There is a mobile number associated with the Microsoft account. Microsoft have sent a text to this mobile with a message (emails obscured for privacy) "*****@z***.co.uk was added to ******@z***.co.uk. Visit
<a href="https://account.live.com/confirm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/confirm</a> and enter code: XXXXXX".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The link goes to a 404 page not found.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am reaching the end of my tether!</p>
<p>[EDIT END]</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I already have another computer running Windows 8.1 and this uses the same .me.uk domain&nbsp;(different email address, of course) and this is verified.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What next?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks to any replies.</p>

            Thanks, Basith, for the quick response. I did just reply, but have deleted it as I have just had a peek at the article you linked to. I think you may have misunderstood the difficulty I am experiencing. The domain I am referring to is an internet domain,
 not a workplace domain. I do not wish to connect my home account to a workplace domain.
<div><br />
<div>So to re-iterate: I am not receiving the Microsoft verification email for either a .co.uk or .me.uk email address when I try to verify my Windows 8 log in account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could you re-read and think again as I do not think this even remotely addresses my problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks.</div>

<h2>            Disk 0 has an extra partition &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 home.<span>&nbsp; </span>Looking at disk Management I have four partitions on disk 0; System Reserved, “C” , Disk 0 Partition 3 (recovery Partition), and “F”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What is “F” for, I have never seen it before and I am wondering if it was goofed up<span>&nbsp;
</span>after update 1709 messed up my drivers for my mouse?<span>&nbsp; </span>Ages ago I did put an “F” on the System Recovery<span>&nbsp;
</span>so as to look at it and&nbsp; satisfy my curiosity.&nbsp; I am having problems getting some drivers to update on Western Digital My Cloud (NAS) to update it's drivers,. They update via the program for the NAS drive. I also have a corrupt user profile I am working
 on.&nbsp; It gives a BSOD "IRQL not less or equal", but only when trying to use the corrupt profile. My other profiles work OK.</p>

            No critical personal data should not be on the Healthy recovery partition, thats why I recommended its deletion; unless you had saved there. 
<br />
<br />Do you need the space on both the Healthy recovery and F drive? If not, I would leave them until after upgrading to the Spring Creators Update.

            You can reinstall Windows 7. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<u>Reinstalling Windows </u><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>If you bought retail Windows: </b><br />
Using your retail install disks - insert the disk, restart the computer and boot from them to start the reinstall process. Reinstalling will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Installing And Reinstalling Windows 7: <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7
</a><br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>Reinstall Windows Preinstalled On Computer </b><br />
When Windows comes installed with the computer, OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows - your computer should have included either a recovery partition on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore
 disks. Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the recovery partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore? - check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you
 have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them
 up first. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>Preinstalled Windows</b> - if you don't have the recovery partition or install disks:
<br />
Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may charge a small fee. Contact information for the manufacturer of your computer can be found here: &nbsp;<br />

<p>How to restore Windows 7, Vista or Windows XP</p>
</span><span>
<p>If you have a Windows.old folder at the root of the drive where Windows 8 was installed, you could try uninstalling Windows 8 using that folder. See the follow articles for instructions. They reference Windows 7, but the same principles apply when using
 Windows 8:</p>
<p>How to uninstall Windows using the Windows.old folder:<br />
</p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971760</span></u></a></p>
<span>
<p>If there is no Windows.old folder there then that means you did a clean install.
</p>
<p>If you have any critical data on the drive, try backing up manually to a external hard disk using copy and paste.
</p>
<p>If you don't have any installation media, you can download a copy from the following link that corresponds with the edition of Windows 7 you download. You will need to have your Windows 7 product key ready to do the installation.
</p>
<p>If Windows 7 came preinstalled on your computer, the product key should be attached to a COA sticker at the bottom of your computer (if its a laptop) or the top or side if its a desktop computer. If its a retail upgrade or full version package, check the
 Windows 7 package. </p>

Some reports are saying it might take 48 hours. So, give it another day.</p>
<p>Go back to your order confirmation. From there, from there you will be able to get back to the MS Store and reopen your order. From there, you will able to start the download again.</p>

<p>I have read through the other posts regarding this so i wanted to start my own here.&nbsp; I just switched to wow and because of modem placement have to use wireless to connect so i bought the microsoft wireless network adapter.&nbsp; I can see my network and can
 connect to internet sometimes(not all times) but when i do i get an error saying some xbox live content is available. As soon as i try to go to internet explorer, youtube, or any other app that uses internet i get disconnected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things i have tried</p>
<p>1. clearing cache 3 times</p>
<p>2. setting up gateway to use dmz</p>
<p>running network test-when i do this i get the following results in the report</p>
<p>W 0000-0021</p>
<p>X 0000-F001</p>
<p>Y 0000-0000</p>
<p>Z 0000-0000</p>
<p>ID FFFF-FFFF</p>
<p>L 0015-10F1</p>

            <p>Greetings cdog!<br />Just to&nbsp;rule out the possibility,&nbsp;if&nbsp;your connection&nbsp;is behind a Large Scale NAT (LSN) architecture, could you access&nbsp;the web-uitlity interface of your router and find the WAN/Internet IP address, which is the address&nbsp;assigned by your ISP.<br /><br />Take note of&nbsp;the&nbsp;WAN/Internet IP address and go to <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(119, 187, 68, 1)">http://checkip.dyndns.com/</span></strong></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, do you see if the 'Current Address'&nbsp;match the WAN/Internet IP address that you see on your router?<br /><br />TIA!</p>

<p>The moment it says like "content is available"and it disconnect whats happens next? Just disconnects and then nothing? How far away are you from the router? Try an other channel. What kind of modem/router do you have? Curious if you can switch it from 20
 to 40 MHz...</p>

    <title>Microsoft Activation for windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaronjohnson8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Activation for windows 10</h2>
                    I was using my computer and all of a sudden, a watermark showed up on my computer telling me to activate windows. I bought this computer over a year ago with windows 10 pre-installed. After going through the troubleshooting option in the activation tab,
 it gave me an 0xc0000022 code. So I did a system reset and the issue persisted. I've ran a malware scan and a virus scan to see if it could be a virus or something and only one thing came back and it was deleted. What should I do?

            Hi Aaron.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> to read the Product Key embedded at Factory, which will be listed as "OEM-BIOS key."  Copy and paste that key (only) into Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.  
<br />
<br />If that fails then run the Activation Troubleshooter and report back it's results.  
<br />
<br />Also what is the Activation Status and Edition now showing at the top of Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Xbox 360 Wireless Headset Causes Me to Disconnect From Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gothikageist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Wireless Headset Causes Me to Disconnect From Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so, since the last update for Xbox 360 I've noticed that sometimes I will be disconnected from Xbox Live in the middle of a game if I'm in a party. I thought it was random, but since then it has happened with increasing frequency.<br />
<br />
Tonight however, I have found out that if I TURN ON my Wireless mic while in a multiplayer game I will be disconnected from Xbox Live. Also, when I disconnect from Xbox Live this way, if I go into the Network Troubleshooting it won't allow me to troubleshoot
 my Wireless Network claiming that "I require an Xbox Live Wireless adapter to be installed" even though I'am using an Xbox 360 S console. ALSO, if I turn my Xbox 360 S OFF, the Power Brick stays lit green for varying amounts of time, sometimes up to a minute.<br />
<br />
The only way to ensure I can reconnect to Xbox Live is to disconnect the power brick or wait until the light turns orange and turn my Xbox 360 S back on and it'll automatically reconnect to Xbox Live. I have tried clearing my system cache multiple times but
 it hasn't helped so far.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what's going on? Bad update maybe?<br />
<br />
Update: I think it only happens if I'm in an Xbox Live Party and then turn on my Mic. Because It doesn't disconnect me while in private chat.<br />
<br />
Nevermind that update it just happened while in a private chat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there Geist! What happens if you turn the wireless mic on when NOT in a game? Does it still disconnect you from the Dashboard? What if you turn on the mic and then connect to LIVE? Let me know how that goes, thanks!

<p>Right, I've tried to hold back my frustration but I can't any longer. I've had this setup working perfectly for well over a year then a stupid update comes along and bang, every time I have a game with my wireless mic it freezes randomly. If my battery drops
 a bar, freeze. If I join a party more than once, freeze. If I check a message a few times, freeze.<br />
<br />
I have just dropped from a really close, exciting game of L4D2 right at the last stage about to win as my mic ran out of battery. To say I was fuming is an understatement. I have tried all sorts of wireless changes with my router etc but quite frankly I spend
 most of my day at work resolving IT issues and don't expect to come home and have to spend hours cocking about with kit here and looking for a resolution here that doesn't exist. This has been known for weeks now and in usual MS fashion nothing has been done
 about it...</p>

<p>Same thing with me, this is the LE Halo Reach Mic, and it has worked PERFECTLY since Reach came out. But that last update has been causing these issues.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the only time I have ever been disconnected while on the dashboard was last night. I had just invited my friend to a private chat while playing L4D2 and turned on the mic. No issues. So I turned it off and on again and everyone in the match stopped
 moving and then it says my friend left the private chat, left the party, can't connect to the xbox live party, and finally disconnected from xbox live, AND the console doesn't recognize it has a built-in wireless adapter.<br />
<br />
Anyways, after all that happened. I turned off my console, but the power brick stayed lit green so I had to unplug it from the power and plug it in again, &nbsp;turned on the xbox and turned my mic on around the time the white xbox logo intro ends and the xbox was
 frozen for a bit on the dashboard (before signed in),and it signed me into xbox live and then I immediately disconnected, and had to start the process over.<br />
<br />
I haven't had any issues with the battery life though, as in I don't disconnect when my battery drains. I don't know if this anything to do with it, but, I do get updates for games when there aren't any updates. I regularly update games that have no updates
 and they are usually 4MB updates.<br />
<br />
I think turning on the mic before the xbox is on works fine, since the issues only occur if I power on the mic while connected online, but I'll give it a try.<br />
<br />
(Just tried it while in game chat, caused me to get disconnected after I turned it on the second time)</p>
<p>Actually, I do sometimes get disconnected randomly while the mic is on, but I think it's because my mic likes to randomly disconnect and reconnect itself, not the battery.<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem to disconnect me from Xbox Live while on the dashboard anymore. But it caused Youtube to freeze for moment and fast forward while watching videos. Caused one disconnect last night on Youtube but couldn't repeat it. No effect on Netflix.</p>

<p>There are now multiple threads for this very annoying problem and I just keep reading the same appalling suggestions. It's really not difficult to roll back the update to all users with immediate effect and look at resolving the issue internally before re-releasing,
 you know, just how updates SHOULD be done. We're not beta testers, we're not here to help you with your investigations and spend our time away from our work to make yours easier. We're loyal paying customers, and the amount of games that I have been kicked
 from now due to this mic problem is getting EXTREMELY annoying to the point where I've come close to launching it out of the window.<br />
<br />
To actually have a programmer come and at the very least acknowledge the problem and give a prompt timescale would be the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
<span>Gothika, the exact same thing happens to me. People start dropping from the party one by one and then the disconnect comes and you have to physically power off the Xbox and back on again, by which time you're organised, all mic players game is ruined
 and when it has happened for the 10th time with no sensible response from MS, it's beyond frustrating.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Got disconnected earlier when I &nbsp;went out of range, and while waiting to be summoned in Dark Souls no less. So going out of range is yet another way to cause a disconnect.</p>

<p>Hey guys! So after re-reading the thread, it seems that Gothika is having issues getting disconnected from LIVE, and Mr. Nut is having trouble with console freezing, is that correct? What I would suggest, so we can best assist both of you, is for Mr. Nut
 to create a new thread (if you haven't already) and Gothika will continue using this one. That way we can focus on your individual issues better.<br />
<br />
That said, Gothika, what happens if you turn the wireless mic on when NOT in a game? Does it still disconnect you from the Dashboard? What if you turn on the mic and then connect to LIVE? Do you notice you still get disconnected from LIVE when you are not using
 your wireless mic? Let me know, thanks!</p>

<p>I got disconnected from LIVE only once when turning on the mic after the xbox logo intro, it never happened again. &nbsp;If I turn ON the mic before I get on Xbox Live, it works perfectly. I don't get disconnected at all when I have my wireless mic off. I've
 purposefully turned it on and off in the middle of a match and attempted to repeat the disconnect and I am always successful in repeating it DURING an online match OR online-enabled games like dark Souls and Test Drive Unlimited Two. I still need to try being
 disconnected with SINGLE-PLAYER games.</p>

<p>Alright, thanks for the overview! For now I would simply recommend working around the issue by starting up your mic before you get in the game, and making sure it's charged so it doesn't need to be restarted in the middle of an important game.<br />
<br />
With regards to the issue itself, would it be possible for your to provide me a video of this happening? This will help in any investigation that starts to look into this issue. What I'd like to see is you in a game, then turn the mic on, confirm you are disconnected
 from LIVE (pop up), and then try to reconnect in the settings menu. I look forward to your post, thanks!</p>

<h2>            Classic shell pop up to reconfigure after win 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting a pop up to reconfigure classic shell after doing a major windows 10 upgrade. I already had won.10.</p>
<p>Is allowing classic shell safe to reconfigure? If not how can I get the pop up to go away?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a new computer in late December 2019 and I think the guy who transferred data from my old comp to new one put classic shell on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also keep getting a message that Dell needs to update it's bio to work with new operating system. Is this safe to do?</p>

            Hi TiminSC 
<br />
<br />After a major update, Classic Shell would need to re-configure to skin your Start Menu and Explorer
<br />
<br />If you have no need for Classic Shell, you can uninstall that from Control Panel - Programs and Features, if you do want to use that, you can safely let that re-configure, it is a safe application . . .
<br />
<br />Also any Dell Updates would also be safe, it is possible your system may need ot have the BIOS updated for any new Windows 10 Feature update
<br />
<br />Dell BIOS updates are among the most reliable of all the manufacturers, easy to apply and even if they go wrong, you can just install the previous version and your system would be back to normal . . .

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually after version upgrade, some of the settings of <em>Classic Shell</em>&nbsp;are lost. You would need to re-run the setup to configure those settings, so that the program continue to work as expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, you can check this thread on Classic Shell forum:</p>

<h2>            Installing windows 8 over unactivated windows 7</h2>
                    I do not have a spare key for windows 7, but I DO have an install DVD for windows 7 home premium. I KNOW that if I install home premium on a fresh HDD, but do not activate it and THEN install upgrade to windows 8, the key will activate no problem. Is this
 okay? There are a lot of questions on here with people with a similar question but they never covered unactivated older OSes, just that you absolutely NEED to have an older version of windows somewhere on your pc to be able to make the install

<p><strong>Yes, but the machine should really be properly licensed in order to use the Windows 8 Pro upgrade but nothing preventing you from using an unactivated copy of Windows&nbsp;7 as a qualifying license.</strong></p>

            Yes ... but you may run into power problems if you attempt to use an external disk drive with a USB hub unless the hub and/or the external drive has its own power supply.<br />

</p><p><span>I apologise for not getting back to you earlier.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you download and install games and the like you do not normally need to keep what you have downloaded in the Downloads folder. Some downloads are large so removing them could free up a fair bit of disk space! You need to do this at regular intervals
 to keep on top of the problem..</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The contents of your Video folder total 414gb. Are you likely to watch some of them again? If not delete those you no longer need.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You&nbsp;have a lot of desktop icons. Review these and delete those you never use.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you have done the above </span><span>select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk CleanUp to empty your Recycle Bin, remove Temporary Internet Files and other selected options. I also recommend you click on the More Options tab,
 System Restore and remove all but the latest System Restore point. Run Disk Defragmenter.</span></p>
