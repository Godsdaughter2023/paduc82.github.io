<h2>            N95 Hands Free with Tom Tom 710 and 720</h2>
                    I am very suprised to find that my N95 is not compatable with these devices.<br />
The 'phone does pair with the 710 but continually every couple of minutes disconnects and asks for the default password (0000) again. I have set the 'phone to accept the Tom Tom device as "authorised" but it still asks for the password again.<br />
When I try to upload the 'phone connections memory the Tom Tom says "This facility is not avialable"<br />
I wonder if anybody else has had this problem and has discovered a solution?<br />
Tom Tom just say they have not tested the Nokia 95 yet....not helpful!!!

            Hi, I bought my father a TOM TOM GO 720 for father days and we want to use the N95 for hands free with BT in the car. I can pair it and pass the contacts to it, but nothing works...keeps going around in circles asking for "xxxx" and says the function is
 not available on the TOM TOM...I have tried everything except updating HW SW...As the last time I updated the FW we lost all the contacts and setting.....<br />
<br />
Please help if you can. Thanks J

<h2>            Help&#33;&#33;&#33; e66 short circuiting&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was working and using my e66 perfectly until about a month ago. What happened was that a couple seconds after getting to the main screen upon opening the phone, the camera function would automatically start, putting the phone in camera mode. Then it would
 be constantly revert back from camera mode to the main ``desktop` screen, preventing me from being able to do anything else. It would also go to the email inbox and back waiting for me to type a message. I tried all resets including the hard reset, removed
 sim, memory cards as well-no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? Does this sound like a short circuit?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Well, 3 different people could not fix it. I even had the board supposedly put in an acid bath to eliminate any corrosion from corroded circuits due to water damage. It keeps going into email mode wanting me to write an email and thus making the keys useless.</p>

<p>This finally has been solved. There is a wired called the flex on slide up phones that can be damaged over time, ie constant sliding the main screen up and down. This was causing the craziness on my phone. It was cheap to replace but very expensive to locate
 the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No thanks to Nokia support. I guess they just wanted me to buy a new phone.</p>

    <title>Create Invoice numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> connie.dbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create Invoice numbers</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I require invoice numbers to be generated for the following scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Donations are collected monthly via Direct Deposit. Donors receive one receipt for tax purposes at the end of each year.&nbsp; A select query totals all donations for the entire year and returns the amount on the receipt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 receipts per perforated page are generated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be times when a duplicate receipt is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, a running sum / over group in the report returns 1- 2013DDP, 2- 2013DDP etc. However, the invoice number is not saved with the receipt, so if a reprint is necessary, the invoice number is not correct.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not married to the result so if it has to be changed, that is not a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for the best way to handle it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help.</p>

            Since you need control over the value of the InvoiceNumber, I would suggest searching the web for the "DMax + 1" technique. You would create the invoice number when the payment is entered in your Payments form, and saved with the Invoice record.&nbsp;Then simply
 display it on the report.

            <p>That's not quite what I meant. I'm guessing QryDonationsDDP is your report query, and you're thinking of simply moving the generation of the invoice numbers from the report (running sum) to the report query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote: <em>You would create the invoice number when the payment is entered in your Payments form, and saved with the Invoice record. Then simply display it on the report.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I mean by that is a change in your database design. You would have an Invoice table, and it would have an InvoiceNumber field. Records would be created from the Payments form each time a payment comes in. The InvoiceNumber would be created using the
 DMax+1 technique. For example in the Form_BeforeInsert I would write:<br />
Me.InvoiceNumber = DMax("InvoiceNumber", "tblInvoices") + 1<br />
Then I would change QryDonationsDDP to join with tblInvoices and pick up the InvoiceNumber field. Then in the report I set the InvoiceNumber field's ControlSource to InvoiceNumber.</p>

            You need to <em>assign </em>the value to an InvNo column in the table, not simply
<em>return </em>the computed the value in a query.&nbsp; This can be done in a number of ways, one of which is to set the DefaultValue property of the control bound to the column in the form's Current event procedure.&nbsp; You'll find an example as CustomNumber.zip
 in my public databases folder at:<br />

If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
The option for 'Sequential Numbering' would be appropriate in your case.

            I understand what you are saying. My only concern is that many payments are generated throughout the year (as per my original question), which are totaled at the end of the year. Only one invoice is generated for all payments made by a donor during the
 year. If an invoice number is generated for each payment, there will be huge gaps between invoice numbers when grouped at year end.<br />

            <p>OK, fair enough. Then at the end of the year you generate all Invoice records, one per donor. Still the same database design with an InvoiceNumber using DMax+1 technique, and a report query that picks up that value.</p>

<p>I will need it to work on a select query that groups and sums.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Invoices, as a separate entity type related to multiple payments, should be modelled by a related Invoices table of which the InvNo column will be the primary key, or if a separate autonumber column is used as a surrogate key, defined as a candidate key
 by being uniquely indexed.&nbsp; It is when a row into this table is inserted that the value will be computed and assigned to the InvNo column.<br />
<br />
You can group and aggregate values in a query which joins the Invoices table to whatever other tables are relevant, but for invoices the grouping and aggregation is more commonly done in a report, which may also include one or more subreports.&nbsp; InvoicePDF.zip
 in my same SkyDrive folder includes an example of such a report, though the primary purpose of the demo is to illustrate how to output a report as a PDF file; it just happens to be based on a simple hypothetical invoicing application.<br />

            <p>As Ken has said, you should have an Invoices table. This could be very simple:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblInvoice</p>
<p>InvoiceID, (PK Autonumber)</p>

<p>InvDate</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need the Invoice numbers to be Sequential within a Year, see my blog article on Sequential Numbering and add a Sequence field to tblInvoice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Actual Invoice number would be generated as indicated in the blog using an expression like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Sequence &amp; " - " &amp; Year(InvDate)-1 &amp; "DDP"</p>

<h3> activesyncuser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop-PPC communication using ActiveSync</h2>
                    
<p>I have written a small application to enable communication between desktop and HP iPAQ using ActiveSync via USB. When i connect the iPAQ to the desktop the ActiveSync synchronisation window comes up in the PC. I don't
 need to synchronize any files as such between the two devices (I only need the communication through my app), so I do not select any folders for synchronization. ActiveSync now shows "connected" but my application does not work.</p>
<p>If, however, I choose to synchronize ANY file or folder at least once, the communication works. Following this, if I disconnect and reconnect the device and never select folders to sync again, the application always works.
</p>
<p>Is there a requirement that the devices need to be "Synchronized" at least once before they can be used in just "connected" mode?

<h3> jtsch  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change the language on Microsoft Office PC and Mac versions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a MacBook Pro (Lion OS) with a Windows 7 Bootcamp partition, and I have Microsoft Office 2010 on the&nbsp;Windows partition and Office 2011 on the Mac OS&nbsp;partition. I would like to convert the entire computer (operating systems included) to simplified
 Chinese. I read the following information and would like someone to confirm this before I go through the process of converting everything to Chinese:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. To change Microsoft Windows 7 from English to Chinese, I must&nbsp;use Windows 7
<u>Ultimate</u> Edition since this is the only edition that&nbsp;permits a change in language. The language can be&nbsp;assigned during the installation process and the same Product Key will work with any language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Microsoft Office (both 2010 and 2011) are not language specific. In order to convert Microsoft Office from English to Chinese, uninstall the English version and install a&nbsp;Chinese
<em>trial</em> version&nbsp;and then use the same Product Key. This same Product Key will allow me to install the full Chinese version of Microsoft Office.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have 2 separate questions:</p>
<p>3. If I uninstall the English versions of Office (2010 and 2011) and then install the Chinese versions of Office, using the same Product Key that was used with the English versions, will the Product Keys be rejected because Microsoft assumes that they are
 already used on another computer? That is, can Office only be installed once with a given&nbsp;Product Key and then never installed again, even if on the same computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Where would I find&nbsp;trial versions of Microsoft Office 2010 (PC) and 2011 (Mac) in simplified Chinese? Online downloads would be fine. I would prefer not to purchase them from a brick and mortar store&nbsp;in China (for obvious reasons).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for posting such a general, wide ranging question here, but this seemed like the most appropriate place. Thank you very much for your assistance.</p>

            1. I have not heard that requirement. As far as I know, any of the retail versions can support alternate languages, NOT just Ultimate.&nbsp; That sounds an awful lot like a clerk trying to "upsell" you more than you need.&nbsp; As I understand it, you should be
 able to by a "Language Pack" to do it.<br />
<br />
2. The Office "Product Keys" are not language specific. They are region / location specific. The U.S.A. has export restrictions on some of the features in Office (encryption).&nbsp; For example I'm willing to bet that you could not use a Product Key purchased in
 the US to activate a copy of Office (either language) in China.&nbsp; However, if you bought a copy of Office in the USA and tried to install Chinese langauge while you are located in the USA it would work.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Languages installed are directly related to the location you say you are in. For example, if you say you are located in Canada, you get English (british) and French (canadian) by default, but you can change those defaults and add other languages as needed.<br />
<br />
3. The activation system collects information about the hardware and software installed on your computer. It uses this information to generate a "hash" value, a unique code. The activation system is supposed to recognize that you are installing Office on the
 same hardware and allow it.<br />
<br />
4. http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/worldwide.aspx?CTT=155&nbsp; This is the region selection page for the Office trials.&nbsp; There are several pictoform languages, with luck, one will be the language you are looking for<br />
<br />
If that link doesn't work, start from this page: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/&nbsp; (US english).&nbsp; Click on the "United states" in the upper right corner to get the to localization page. Select your desired language.<br />

            Ah, interesting...I tried this before and it didn't work because Office365Service.app was not listed in the program list (step three in the article mentioned by Arshad).&nbsp;But, this time when the dialog box came open I left it open and did not close it and
 then followed the instructions in the article. It seems that by not closing it the application itself also stays open. Hope that makes sense. Thanks Arshad you confirmed what I was thinking!

            I have all of the updates installed for Mavericks. I think Word is the latest version (14.4.7). The problem surfaces when Mac OS's firewall is enabled (which obviously must remain). I'm not willing to modify the firewall but am willing to modify the software.
 I'm going to try to trash the .plist files as try#this has suggested. I'll update the thread...either way and share the outcome.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0x80070005 is an Access is Denied error this is because either an application or executable does not have the necessary elevation to invoke a specific action. One possibility is you are trying to do this or did the update or installation as a standard user
 instead of as an Administrator - especially if you are using XP. Login to an Admininstrator account to proceed. This is not always required and I'm not sure about your circumstances or configuration or operation system, but given that error we should err on
 the side of cautiion and use the Administrator account here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with some possible troubleshooting ideas and solutions from others who also experienced this error code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see if the answer in the following thread helps: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/error-code-0x80070005/1e5cc042-2fcc-4ca1-a489-b44b1343e224">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not try the answer and the other suggestion in this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d</a>. It is similar to the above, but includes another link which may apply depending on your version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure where you are or where you got the download or what you've done, so if the above didn't help, let's just start from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE which we are testing). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate,
 or uninstall it. Once done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we don't know how much of what installed is good or possibly corrupted (or what that malware may have done even if it was removed), we need to first uninstall and then re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</a>. NOTE: Given you said you had problems with uninstalling, pay particular attention to the manual methods here if it still doesn't work and be sure
 to follow the steps exactly and precisely in order and that should do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a> - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the
 desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full Safety Scan from Microsoft:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a>. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair
 any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first
 or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>

            It is my old Hotmail address which up until about a month ago was still receiving messages (through Live). Since Hotmail migrated to outlook, I have always been able to (and still can) log into it online through Outlook. I haven't received anything to
 say that Hotmail as an address was going to stop working, but it appears that is what has happened.

            Hotmail addresses should still work (mine does). Do you have any aliases on the account? If not, add one and try sending to an alias and see if it also bounces.

            Just to clarify: The address you’re using is a hotmail address &amp; you’re not trying to receive email to the same account but using outlook address?
<br />I.E.: yourusernameathotmail.com is the address before the migration to Outlook &amp; you’re trying to receive from yourusernameatoutlook.com
<br />Or are you using the same hotmail account but now it is no longer receiving email?

            <p>Hi Kem..</p>
<p>Well I actually have everything back working the way it was with everything working. I'm very persistent when it comes to getting things working the way I wanted and having the layout and configurations(Rules,Forwards,Settings) all working together. I did
 not like using the Exchange server as I was stuck using the email address that exchanged assigned to my account which was not the one I wanted. Adding in the aliases into outlook didn't give what I was looking for either. When ever you replied to someone when
 they got your email it would say *** Email address is removed for privacy *** on behalf of *** Email address is removed for privacy *** it just looked stupid..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on to another google search and I came across a page that told me how to setup an Exchange Active Sync account at outlook.com after the upgrade. so I resetup my account in outlook but used my actual account of *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as the email account
 name but when it came to the server to connect to instead of using bay405-m.outlook.com I used eas.outlook.com and for the account to log into for that account I used my outlook.com alias. and bingo everything worked like it should I was able to get all of
 my emails synced and when I sent an email it showed my actual email address I wanted to use. so that part worked perfect. The settings I used in Outlook 2013 are these.</p>
<p>Setup manual account</p>
<p>Name: Rick xxxxxxx</p>
<p>Email address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
EAS Server: eas.outlook.com</p>
<p>User name *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>password:xxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click next and it will log into your account and your messages and folders start showing up in Outlook. Once I had everything configured I deleted the Exchange Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the rules I had to start new on all of them I created all of the rules in outlook 2013 and they are all now working. I also enabled the junk email options and now those are all working also.</p>
<p>Just in case the rules start working on outlook.com I deleted all of my rules there and recreated them on outlook.com also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a happy camper now. I think Outlook.needs to update users on how to connect to them via an Active Sync account but from what I have seen that wont happen. Hopefully someone will be able to google what I have posted.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Kem..</p>
<p>All 3 computers that have experienced this is running Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>There were no Error messages at all just all of them were saying Trying to connect to Server and did nothing just sit there they would not Send any outgoing email or download any of the actively new email that was being shown in Out look.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have found out how to work around this and a notice I had seen on one of the many websites I have viewed over the last couple of days. The message had said that once you had been moved to the new version of Outlook.com that you would be using Microsoft
 Exchange and not the ActiveSync servers. So what I had to do was create a new email account in Outlook.</p>
<p>For this account I had to choose Microsoft Exchange and for the email address I had to use one of my Outlook.com aliases. I also choose to let Outlook figure out the settings for me. After waiting about 5 minutes while it looked for the settings it assigned
 me an Exchange server and gave me a new login account to use on the server. Once I exited out of the setup windows and clicked on the new name in the outlook 2013 message are all of my folders and email were located there. I was able to send and receive mail
 threw outlook fine. All of that part is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the thing that is not working and I have not found a reason why is my inbox email rules. I have deleted and recreated all of my rules and have deleted and recreated all of my folders but the rules do not take place. Everything gets dumped into the main
 inbox and what I do for now is run the Manage Rules Widget and have it toss all of my email. everything left in the inbox is either actual email or Junk. Thats the other thing that is not working now is it is not moving junk to the junk folder even tho I have
 that turned on and configure..</p>

<h2>            Odd From&#58;Address in Email Sent from Outlook.com</h2>
                    
<p>hallo all,<br />
<br />
i'm looking to use my o365/outlook.com email more often now, and am noticing when i send an email to another o365 user the from: address has some strange characters:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7de492c8-1b2f-4dd3-9a8f-fc11e64a2875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7de492c8-1b2f-4dd3-9a8f-fc11e64a2875" /></a><br />
<br />
imagewas wondering if anyone else is experiencing this, and whether there is a way to correct this. i imagine the odd address should actually be my outlook.com address.</p>
<p>jesinta rosario, a support engineer, suggested i try this forum instead of the general microsoft community, where it was

originally posted.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />

<p>Hi Shyamal,</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for the reply. The issue is with what I believe to be a standard Outlook.com account. I was unaware of the upgraded Outlook experience, and my interface matches the old one. I don't know how to get an invite to the new features and functionality.</p>
<p>I have an Office 365 Personal Account. When I log into it the Mail client is the Outlook.com interface I am having the issue with.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why, but this last time I accessed this page a new Account was created in the O365 Community: TomHerrera4756. Not sure why that happened, when I published the original post under my other Community name, TomHerrera.</p>
<p>Since I'm not using a connected account, maybe that should be where I start? Or do you recommend another approach?</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>To further troubleshoot the issue, I'd like to confirm whether your account is migrated to the new server? If you log into Outlook.com and see "Outlook Mail (Preview)", it is on the new server.</p>
<p>When you use an outside address as a Microsoft account and log into outlook.com, mail sent from that account will use the outlook_....@ address unless it is configured to send and receive mail.Then messages you send are forwarded to the account's actual
 smtp server.</p>
<p>If it still on the old server, Go to Gear icon, Options, Your email accounts. does it says Send and Receive or Send only? Click the Details link - what does it say? Send only accounts will say this:</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Recipients of email from this account may see "From outlook_...@outlook.com on behalf of alias *** Email address is removed for privacy ***"<br />
To send and receive email from this address in Outlook.com, add your account as send-and-receive.</p>
<p>If the account was moved to the new server, the non-Microsoft address needs to be set up as a connected account so mail can be forwarded to the correct SMTP server.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

<p>hi lance,</p>
<p>thanks again for the replay. to simplify things i've included screen caps of what i see in my personal o365. first, my outlook:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0386bff2-6254-43db-a10a-56b94ab4dae9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0386bff2-6254-43db-a10a-56b94ab4dae9" /></a></p>
<p>and second what i see if i click on the onedrive icon above:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=166e1a81-4629-41ee-ba27-b691961dd45b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d166e1a81-4629-41ee-ba27-b691961dd45b" /></a></p>
<p>it's as though outlook.com email is on a different server. is there a way i can request it to be migrated?</p>
<p>i'm going to try setting up my earthlink account as a send/receive account, and see what that does.</p>
<p>please let me know your thoughts on why i'm seeing different menus, as noted above. thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>About the different menus, &nbsp;when you click one-drive, the browser was loading your Office 365 account identification, so the interface likes Office 365 portal.</p>
<p>I’ve tested with my test account and try to reproduce the issue. However, everything works fine and I can’t reproduce it.</p>
<p>So I suggest you do the reverse. Use your Outlook account as a connected account to Office 365 account and send a test email from Outlook account, check if the issue can be fixed.<br />
Please refer to this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Connect-email-accounts-in-Outlook-on-the-web-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect email accounts in Outlook on the web</a></p>
<p>If the issue persists, please post back and we’ll further assist you.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

<p>hi again lance,</p>
<p>thank again, but i am not seeing the same interface in my outlook as is indicated in the link you provided. my outlook is definitely not using the office 365 interface. i looked under the hood, and it is pointing to a hotmail server if i set it up in a desktop
 outlook.</p>
<p>if i deliberately log in to my office 365 personal account and click on mail it sends me back to the hotmail/outlook.com:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc717442-e264-4a2f-8d40-616902199013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc717442-e264-4a2f-8d40-616902199013" /></a></p>
<p>so i click on mail and i get:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af9e3b1c-e33c-4c19-b9f2-3e67117e1bf3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af9e3b1c-e33c-4c19-b9f2-3e67117e1bf3" /></a></p>
<p>not really sure how to proceed at this point. i tried setting up my earthlink account as a connected account (send/receive) in outlook.com, but when i send from the earthlink address it takes several hours for the email to be received at my work or gmail
 account.</p>
<p>thoughts?</p>
<p>tom</p>
<p>p.s. it seems pretty random whether this community page selects my tomherrera or my tomherrera4756 account, too. kinda strange.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>Based on your description, I suggest you use the problematic account to send an email directly on Outlook.com web access to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>If the from address still has some strange characters, the issue may relate to Outlook.com. You can contact
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum">Outlook.com support</a> for further assistance.</p>
<p>Regarding the two community account display names, they depend on the login accounts. If you have already signed up for one account, the community will use this account to log in.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

<p>hello tom, et. al-</p>
<p>i have what seems to be an identical problem with outlook 2016 and my outlook.com account. when the account is setup, the "root" shows as:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e18b23c4-4851-41fa-8a9b-68dc17566ba0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e18b23c4-4851-41fa-8a9b-68dc17566ba0" /></a></p>
<p>when mail is sent, the replies bounce because the headers use this *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address and fail with:</p>
<p><b>bay004-mc1f50.hotmail.com rejected your message to the following email addresses:</b></p>
<p>john sykes (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)<br />
your message couldn't be delivered because the recipient's email system reported the following error: '550 requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable'. it's possible it's a temporary issue with their email system. try to resend the message. if the problem
 continues, contact the recipient by some other means (by phone for example) and ask them to tell their email admin about the problem. be sure to give them the error above, as it will better help them diagnose the problem.</p>
<p>i can provide the full headers to a microsoft employee/admin if they need it for troubleshooting purposes. this has been a problem for something on the order of three or four months (never could set up the account, cleanly, in outlook 2016 - it's mostly
 used for one-way (inbound) communication, so was a low priority to resolve).</p>

<p>this is a workaround, not a solution. the problem, for me, is that outlook 2016 and outlook.com are not able to work together when you attempt to use the auto-discovery account creation method (i.e. when you just provide your outlook.com email address and
 password). the acceptable workaround, in my instance, was to simply setup my outlook.com account as an imap/smtp account in outlook 2016. these are the imap and smtp server settings that i used:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cc71b4d-cf6e-4b36-a738-37dbb6290fb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cc71b4d-cf6e-4b36-a738-37dbb6290fb8" /></a></p>
<p>this solved my primary problem: i was unable to send outlook.com messages with a valid return address when using outlook 2016 as the client and using the auto-discover mode of email account creation (which creates an exchange-type email account profile).</p>

            Does "notebook messages print" mean that you <span style="font-weight: bold">

<br />
Because you refer to spreadsheets, I assume that your printing problem is with Excel.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you go to Start &gt; Printers and Faxes, right-click the icon for your printer and select Properties and then click "Print test page"
<br />
Assuming that you are having problems printing from Excel and not from other applications, I suggest that you post in the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/excel">Excel forum</a> and include:<br />
<br />

<li>the version of Windows you have, including service pack</li><li>the version of Excel you have, including service pack</li><li>the make and model of the printer you are using </li><li>the complete text of any error message without paraphrasing</li><li>the answers to all 3 questions above (in bold, for your convenience)<br />

<p>Hi, BernardArmstrong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While Skype does include many features with its software and apps, unfortunately sending faxes has never been one of those features.&nbsp; You might try looking for a Skype-compatible, third-party add-on app or software package that offers fax sending and receiving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

    <title>GPS Auto Pause - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> apetheo  say:</h3>
<h2>            GPS Auto Pause</h2>
                    There is a really cool feature a certain other company has in their GPS wearables and devices that I found impressive that I thought would be a great addition to the settings of exercises (especially biking) on the Microsoft Band. In long bike rides, I
 take a couple breaks as well as have to stop at traffic lights. The problem is that while I am taking a break, the&nbsp;duration, distance, and&nbsp;other data points are still being collected. I would like to see my data for the trip without the mandatory or optional
 stops I have made. The band should see from the GPS that your stopped while in exercise mode and pause the timer until you are moving again. I have found that a great addition to the other company's devices and would like to see this added to the band.

<p>Rich is on the right track. You updated Mac OS without installing Office updates. Neo should know this by now and should have told you to install updates.

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">INSTALL UPDATES</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Ensure your Mac and Office have the latest updates</span></strong><span>. Here’s how to install updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install
 the updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Antidote, Webex, Silverlight, EndNote, Zotero, Suitcase, 3<sup>rd</sup> party font management tools or other add-ins there is a potential for crashes and unwanted misbehavior unless you also update your add-ins to the latest
 update. <strong>Install updates for these programs if you have them. </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It is possible that because your install is so far behind in updates that AutoUpdate itself is too old to work. If you can't update using the above instructions, download a fresh copy of the current version of AutoUpdate from
 this link and then let it do its thing when it launches.</p>
