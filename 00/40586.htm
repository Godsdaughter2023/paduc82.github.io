                    <p>Original Title: (Xbox for windows Game DVR) Recorded clips no longer appearing in DVR but are in captures file ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, as i said in my subject the clips i'm recording are no longer saving onto where i can see them using the xbox DVR app. They are however saving in the place where all previous DVR clips have saved so nothing has changed there (users/owner/videos/captures/.....)
 &nbsp;I just can't see what i could have done to bring about this change in the DVR app, one day all was showing up after recording in the xbox app and the next they're not. I even deleted stuff thinking it could have been a storage issue but apparently not. After
 my game session ends and i close down the game i still get the notifications in Action center telling me that a game clip has been recorded. Any help on this would be much appreciated. Obviously not a huge deal but irritating and mystifying all the same. Thanks</p>

<h2>            How can I move pictures between folders in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I've just uploaded a load of photos from my camera onto Windows 8. On my previous laptop, I could easily move several photos at a time between two folders. In W8 I just can't see how it's done. I thought I'd struck lucky when I opened up the folder in
 desktop mode, but I can't open up another folder simultaneously. I'm not a computer wizard, so can somebody please tell me how to do this?

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On the <strong>Desktop</strong>, click the <strong>File Explorer</strong> icon on the
<strong>Taskbar</strong> to open a window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Right Click</strong> the <strong>File Explorer</strong> icon on the
<strong>Taskbar</strong> and select <strong>File Explorer</strong>. This will open a
<strong>Second</strong> window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <strong>Right Click</strong> an <strong>empty spot</strong> on the <strong>
Taskbar</strong> and select the <strong>Show Windows Side by Side</strong> option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. This will <strong>Snap the 2 File Explorer windows</strong>, one on each side of the monitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there you can open a different folder in each window and Drag/Drop files between the&nbsp;folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete &#34;emails and apps&#34; account that no longer exists</h2>
                    <p>I have an email account through a university I no longer attend that is included in my list of accounts. I receive constant notifications saying that I need to "update the password" for this account, but I can't because the account no longer exists. I also
 can't delete the account from Windows because when I click "Manage" it sends me to a login page for the nonexistent email. Is there a way to get around this and remove the account from my computer?</p>

            Hi ReneeBabin... best to create a new account to use then delete your existing.
<br />This will get rid of any of anything to do with old accounts.
<br />See link to create a new local admin account.
<br />Once you do that add the Microsoft account that you use.
<br />Then go to c:\users\oldfolder and you can move your data from one folder to the new one.

            Ciao Renee, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, as a first troubleshooting option, did you try the below, by any chance?
<br />
<br />Click the Start button -&gt; Settings (Gear) -&gt; Click Accounts -&gt; Scroll down -&gt; Click the account you would like to delete -&gt; Click remove -&gt; click Yes.
<br />
<br />If you want to remove multiple OneDrive accounts from your computer, you can follow the advice of Jiaxing Bian MSFT below.

<p>Hi Ugo,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with this process is that from "Accounts" it asks what kind of account your looking for. Under the "Emails and apps" page where the account resides, there is no "Remove" option, only "Manage". There is a note on the page that states: "To change
 an account name, delete an account, or sync an account with another device, select your account, and then select manage".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting manage only leads me to the login page, with no option to click remove</p>

<p><span>Hey Lestat,</span></p>
<p><span>There is a Knowledge Base article by HP that talks about error 1316 and 1603 during HP software installation. Follow the suggestions given in the

            <p>I have a similar issue. I&nbsp;had 6 games that were in various stages of downloading updates. Since the system update the entire queue cleared out. When I try to run the game I get the error "0x80270300" and told to let it finish installing. However there is no updates to install listed in the update section for each game. At only a 12 Mb connection I do not have the time to uninstall and&nbsp;re-download 200+GB. Is there anyway to force it to check for game updates again?</p>

<p>Hello all , yes this issue is very annoying but i found a fix that foes not involve you deleting your have finished downloads or.updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now when the game download or update disappears from Queue you can only resume it if its gotten to the ready to play point but as we all know if this hasn't happened you get an error code reauesting you uninstall amd reinstall it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply scroll to you games tab move your cursor over the unfinished downloaf which would be listed amonsgt your games icons on your xboxonxb, press the start button on your xboxone controller while the unfinished game is highlighted select , manage game,&nbsp;
 now it will bring up thr screen showimg your games install location on the local drives notice the size shows the full download, this is an error. Look at the top of that screen you wouod see an option that say "See in Microsoft Store"ⁿ select that and the
 purchase screen you used yo purchase the gsme is displayed. Again with the install option select this and you download reappears in queue at the exsct point you paused it. Unfortunately you have to do this for every single game that you have unfinished in
 your library.</p>

            That is the only way I have found to do it as well without uninstalling and starting over. Not fun going through a list of over 300 games trying to figure out all the missing ones. Has anyone found an easier way to find the fix to figuring out which games
 need updated still without having to put each disc back into the console?

<h2>            Windows 10 Assistant upgrade</h2>
                    I am wanting Microsoft to do something about this Windows 10 upgrade assistant! It is constantly interrupting, freezes what I am doing, it is a big nuisance. I delete it and it downloads on its own, that is a security issue. I DON'T WANT IT.&nbsp; This goes
 on daily ..&nbsp;

            Hi NanaM's, yes a lot of us are of the same mind as you . . .
<br />
<br />The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter 
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater 
<br />Right Pane double click 'Update Assistant' 
<br />Click on Triggers Tab 
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled' 
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun' 
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event 
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!       
        </p>

            Do the following to block it:
<br />
<br />1. Type "Task Scheduler" in the search bar next to the windows icon in the lower left corner. A window will pop up. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2. On the left hand side, click Task Scheduler Library&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows&gt;UpdateOrchestrator. Once you click on "UpdateOrchestrator", you will see a list become populated in the center upper portion of the window.
<br />
<br />3. What you want to do at this point is DISABLE "UpdateAssistant" and "UpdateAssistantCalendarRun". Voila. Windows 10 Update Assistant will be dead forever and you are free to use your perfectly working as-is PC indefinitely without interruptions.

<br />
<br />and
<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver

    <title>Old software file problem in Windows 10, corrupted DLL&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glen_cct  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old software file problem in Windows 10, corrupted DLL&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use a CAD suite dating back to 2001 (P-CAD 2001 with 2013 service pack 3). It has been working fine on my Windows 10 Professional desktop until lately. The problem is with one exe that starts and runs, but when I open a file dialog
 to select a data file to edit, the program closes. There is no error message or hang, it just closes. It had done this intermittently before, but now I can’t get past that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured that the installation had become corrupted, so I uninstalled. I then attempted to reinstall from the original CD. I ran the setup and got the normal message “P-CAD 2001 Setup is preparing the Installshield Wizard, which will
 guide you through the rest of the setup process. Please Wait.” It then hangs at about 10% completion (2 bars) for a couple of minutes before giving the message “Error extracting support files: Server execution failed”. No error code was given and no folder
 was created in PF(x86)\InstallShield Installation Information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried both of the above in XP and Win 7 compatibility mode. It made no difference. So next I installed on a Windows 10 laptop. The program installed fine and runs fine, so the problem is not Windows 10 incompatibility. I think something
 in Windows is corrupted on my desktop. Since both of the above problems seem to be related to file opening, perhaps I’m missing an MFC dll from that vintage. Any ideas of things to try?</p>

<p>Hi Lukimai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in forums with this issue. Sorry to hear that you're having difficulty with Sea of Thieves being recognized as purchased on your new PC. As previously stated by our Ambassadors, if you're signing in with the exact same credentials
 (profile/account) that you used when you initially purchased Sea of Thieves, then you should not be asked to purchase the game. Sea of Thieves is a Play Anywhere title as well, so if you purchased it via the console, you would be able to use it on a PC and
 vice versa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since you indicated that it is requesting you purchase it fully, it begs the question on whether you initially purchased it fully, or gained the game via Game Pass download. Did you have an active Game Pass subscription during the time of initial
 purchase? And if so, do you not have a Game Pass subscription currently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To ensure that the account that you are using is the account of purchase, you may wish to go ahead and
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/check-xbox-live-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
check your purchase history</a> to be sure that the transaction went through fully on the account. Should you confirm that it is purchased on that account and are still being asked to purchase the game, then I would recommend that you
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us#0:2:0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
contact Xbox Support by requesting a call back</a> so that they may look into what may have happened to cause this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out!</p>
        </p>

<p>Hello Lukimai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you made sure you are logging into the Xbox app on the new PC with the MS account that made the purchase. Once logged on the app go to your library and see if the game is there. If it is then launch it from there on the PC.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows Update in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher1983  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I was reading changes to Windows 10.&nbsp; On one website I read that Microsoft is changing how Windows updates are downloaded and installed with Windows 10 Home.&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be no option to change to download updates manually.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have satellite internet and have limits on how much can be downloaded!&nbsp;&nbsp; I can not have Windows Update download updates on its own.&nbsp; Esp. updates that are 50+ MB,&nbsp; (most updates total over 150 MB).&nbsp; (I currently only have a 375 MB daily download limit.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is this true for Windows 10 Home users?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft changes this for us users that do not have unlimited download usage!&nbsp;&nbsp; If this does not get changed I will not be using Windows 10 and I would really like to get the Upgrade.</p>

            <p>Task scheduler is easy to get to grips with.&nbsp; I can set up a task and make screenshots while I'm doing it so that I can give you&nbsp;decent&nbsp;guidance.&nbsp; I can explain how to create the batch files without having&nbsp;to explain anything complicated - you will use Notepad
 to create two text files and then you will change their file&nbsp;extensions from .txt to .bat.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet done anything about Build 10130.&nbsp; It is perfectly possible to set it up in a dual-boot arrangement.&nbsp; I think you made a procedural error.&nbsp; Those links to Andre &amp; JWStuart's articles I gave you about dual-booting will guide you through it but,
 judging from your description, I think that you ran setup from within Windows 7.&nbsp; That would, in effect, install Windows 10 on top of Windows 7 as a "repair upgrade" [also known as an "In-place upgrade"].&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install it in a dual-boot arrangement:-</p>
<p>Connect the installation disk [USB/DVD] you made from the ISO file</p>
<p>Browse it using Windows explorer</p>
<p>Look in its sources folder and you will find another file called setup</p>
<p>Right-click on setup.exe, select Run as Admin</p>
<p>After the initial bits where it asks about languages &amp; keyboards, select Custom installation.</p>
<p>Then you will see the question about where to install it and you can choose the extra drive that you have ready for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what MS download manager you are referring to.&nbsp; Is it the 2011 one [version 1.2.1]?&nbsp; That does&nbsp;not seem to have been updated for later browser versions so I don't know if it much use.&nbsp; I'll have a look at it after I do a new system image this
 evening or tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bunch of tasks to do on my two laptops as I have recently fitted second hard drives to them [using caddies that replace the CD drives].&nbsp; I want to get that sorted out before worrying about upgrading to Build 10130 as I'll have to decide how to get
 the best out of both of them with this new facility - the partial syncing of core files&nbsp;I have been doing between them up until now is not making the most of my vast investment [£15 as I already had the spare HDDs sitting about doing nothing].&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I thought I'd give you an update.&nbsp; My news is provisional because I must validate everything&nbsp;using the released version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's good news.&nbsp; I have identified&nbsp;an automated&nbsp;procedure for switching&nbsp;a computer's WiFi connection between Metered and non-Metered.&nbsp; It is done with&nbsp;a pair of batch files [each with a single command, in fact] that can be run on Task scheduler.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The significance of this for you is that you would be able to put the batch files on each computer and then have the Task scheduler run the appropriate one [i.e. switch the computer between Metered &amp; non-Metered mode] at 02:00 &amp; 08:00.&nbsp; It would all be automatic
 so you would not need to switch anything over manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nearer the time, I'll have to find out if you know what a batch file is &amp; how to set up a task in Task scheduler.&nbsp; I can guide you through it if necessary.&nbsp; It will probably take you about&nbsp;four minutes to set up &amp; test on each computer.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If you do not have one, you must find another Win7 system with the same bitness as yours (32 or 64).&nbsp; You will need a blank recordable CD or DVD.&nbsp; Start globe, All programs, Maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Takes but a few moments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make certain the system boots on it. You may have to do something like Press F12 key repeatedly on startup or change the boot order in the BIOS.</p>

<h2>            Tried to buy a game but all I got was nothing and my money is gone&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>so yea, I bought 2100 MC points and purchasing them went just fine and I got the money. Then I was going to buy Left 4 Dead, it said sumtin "Online server error" (if I remember right) so I waited for a while and tried again, same text pops up again, waited
 sometime again and when I was going to try buying L4D I didn't have the money anymore on my account!!!<br />
So my money was taken and I got nothing. I tried to purchase the same MC point code again and it said it was already purchased so I was like "okay I think I have the money then" and was going to purchase L4D but still nothing, after few mins rage I just curiously
 went to the purchase-thing and what!!!-my money was there so "yay I can purchase it now" but no, same text and money gone, didn't get nothing.<br />
With the little money what was left I purchased Connor-outfit for my avatar succesfully.<br />
So, my questions:<br />
-What is the problem?<br />
-Can I get refunds or the game (Left 4 dead) ?<br />
-Did anyone else have the same problem?<br />
Plz help, I would appreciate it!!!</p>

<p>Hey Spaffox,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues downloading that L4D.<br />
<br />
I've passed along this information to be investigated. There are some things that would really help us narrow down what we're looking for:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you double check commerce.microsoft.com and see if the purchase is showing there.
</li><li>When was the last time you tried to download that content? </li></ul>
<div><br />
<br />
If you're interested in pursuing a refund for this game, you'll want to get in touch with our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Phone Support</a>.</div>

<p>so, it says:</p>
<p>1 purchased L4D</p>
<p>1 refund of L4D</p>
<p>1 purchased L4D</p>
<p>(thought I don't have it)</p>
<p>and when I go to the game store on xbox and search L4D theres only the purchase option and no download, so I should purchase it again</p>

<p>the guy on the phone said that there's no finnish helper at the moment, and I just said that I want somebody to help me out, so, I left my name and number like he asked. He said that someone would call soon back, but still I haven't got a call.</p>

<p>Phone support was able to get me a refund while chat support wouldn't and, now I seems I am able to buy stuff now and it adds it to my download history now I just wait on the refund. &nbsp;It's my luck that when i finally am able to get something I want something
 always goes wrong so i am expecting something to go wrong while i wait watch my refund takes long enough for xbox one to be released.</p>

            <p>Hello Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts or corrupt Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check if it helps.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, <strong>run system file checker(SFC)</strong> and see if it helps.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hello Ratandeep-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying to my query.&nbsp; I had previously tried to get help from "Microsoft partners" and paid $20 for a "DLL Suite + Max Utilities" which was of no use - I think these folks are frauds - and I got my money back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You answered me on 3/24 and I didn't reply because I thought I was supposed to get an email to my Outlook address.&nbsp; No matter, I finally checked in and you had specific instructions, so...</p>
<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
<p>So I followed your advice and did a clean boot.&nbsp; This didn't help.&nbsp; I then reset the startup to normal.
</p>
<p>Then I used the system file checker tool.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It did a 100% scan and returned with the msg:</p>
<p>"Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted again and there it is again... the same old missing DLL message...
</p>
<p>I did not go and try to find a file and manually install it.&nbsp; Should I try this?&nbsp; If so, where to find the file?</p>
<p>I think it is a rather innocuous "comptotal.DLL file".&nbsp; I know where to put it.&nbsp; Is it that simple or am I missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you for responding to me.&nbsp; It is really really nice to find someone that pays attention.&nbsp; I know that Windows 7 is an old release, but it has been working fine for years and I cannot upgrade it to Windows 10 on my particular Intel i5 - I tried
 that and I found that my HW and Win10 are incompatible.&nbsp; </p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I DO have a "reinstallation CD for Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2"&nbsp; I also have three "drivers and utilities" discs.&nbsp; I am loath to reinstall WinXP SP2 again as there have been LOTS of bug fixes and enhancements that have come down over the years
 since 2011.&nbsp; If I do go back to ancient code is there a way to update the OS to current status without suffering too badly?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I await your sagacious advice. </p>
<p>thank you again. </p>

            <p>Hi Ratandeep-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I ran the security scanner on full scan.&nbsp; Took most of the afternoon and night.&nbsp; Sometime during the night it finished and sent the message that there were 0 viruses and no corrupted files etc.&nbsp; All ok.&nbsp; No other information.
</p>
<p>so...</p>
<p>What now?&nbsp; I guess is the good news is that I am not infected.&nbsp; Any ideas? </p>
<p>Anyway, that security scanner is good to know about.&nbsp; If at any time one thinks you have a virus, I guess this is a pretty complete scan, right?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do we do now? </p>

            <p>Dear Ratandeep-</p>
<p>I don't see where this gets us anywhere. </p>
<p>I went into the mmc and see that you get a domain and a workgroup.&nbsp; I am not a workgroup.&nbsp; In domain I could set up a new user account.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I am the administrator and I don't want any more accounts.&nbsp; I did this and then deleted it.&nbsp; I do not want to delete
 the admin account.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; All I need is&nbsp; to find the code for the missing DLL called comptotal.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions? </p>
<p>Your friend with infinite patience. </p>

<h2>            UPDATED Many different Bluescreen errors.  FC, D1, 1A, C4, 50 &#40;Most common&#41;, 0A, 7F</h2>
                    
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The problem is still occurring.&nbsp; I have since removed the Bluetooth addin device from the motherboard and the issue still persisted.&nbsp; Also, I updated to the latest bios for the motherboard which also didn't resolve the issue.&nbsp; Most
 importantly I am now unable to reinstall Windows 7.&nbsp; It will blue screen when initially loading or when I click "Install". Of note is that I have been unable to install windows since before I removed the soundcard I just forgot to mention it. The error is
 90% 0x00000050&nbsp; PAGE FAULT.&nbsp; The last time I received a very odd blue screen.&nbsp; It just said:&nbsp; STOP C0000221 HARD ERROR and listed a file: NTDLL.DLL.&nbsp; This is making me crazy.</p>
<p>I recently purchased several new components for my PC and have since been experiancing many different blue screen errors.&nbsp; The new parts are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Phenom II X6 3.3Ghz</p>
<p><strong>RAM:</strong> Corsair Dominator 8GB (4 X 2) 1866Mhz (underclocked to 1600Mhz for testing purposes)</p>
<p><strong>Video Card:</strong> Nvidia GTX 580 1536MB (PNY Enthusiast edition if that matters)</p>
<p><strong>Motherboard:</strong> ASUS AMD 890FX Crosshair IV Extreme</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooting steps taken so far UPDATED:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replaced motherboard due to overheating Northbridge. </li><li>Reinstalled Windows 7 due to boot failure (expected with this much new hardware)</li><li>Ran two passes of Memtest86 due to frequent blue screens.&nbsp; Everything checked out.</li><li>Downloaded latest drivers for all hardware on system.&nbsp; </li><li>Tried Nvidia 8800GT that is known to work.&nbsp; Still encountered blue screens.</li><li>Replaced CPU after Memtest86 hung every time when attempting multicore testing.</li><li>Reinstalled Windows 7 due to suspected corrupted drivers (from all the blue screens).</li><li>Ran Memtest86 4.10 for 72+ hours.&nbsp; Found one bad memory location that out of 90+ passes only failed twice.</li><li>Ran Windows Memory Diagnostic on Extended with two passes, no errors found. </li><li>Attempted System Recovery with Windows 7 Disk.&nbsp; Blue screen code: 0x00000050.&nbsp; Now unable to install windows.</li><li>Removed Sound Blaster X-Fi Extreme Gamer which did not resolve the issue. </li><li>Updated BIOS.&nbs

<p>Hi&nbsp;Jetsirus,</p>
<p>After looking through your minidumps, the&nbsp;inconsistency&nbsp;of them really suggests a hardware problem. I've got a hunch that it's motherboard related, but honestly have nothing to prove that.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is to eliminate all other possible problems. If the blue screens are as frequent as your minidumps suggest, this shouldn't take much time. I'd start by disconnecting/removing as much&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;hardware as possible. This includes leaving
 a single stick of RAM, a single HDD, removing any USB devices other than keyboard and mouse, and removing any other expansion cards (WiFi, TV tuners, etc...). Get the system down to bare&nbsp;minimum and see if it blue screens. If so, swap one of the sticks of
 RAM and test.</p>
<p>If the blue screens continue, boot the system into Safe Mode and see if it blue screens. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>If the blue screens do not repeat in Safe mode, there is likely a startup item or service is causing the issue. Follow the steps found on the following
 link to pinpoint the item or service causing the error:</span></span></p>

    <title>Prices of games are outrageous and inaccurate... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> voidknight55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Prices of games are outrageous and inaccurate... </h2>
                    
<p>From the look of it... Games are added and forgotten, therefore their prices remain. The games I've been interested in purchasing from the Xbox Live store are way too over-priced for their release date and their rating.</p>

<p>A perfect example is Call of Duty Black Ops, the game is like $39.00 and it's currently selling for average $10.00-$25.00 Max. No one is selling it over $39.00.
</p>
<p>- Walmart</p>
<p>- Gamestop</p>
<p>- Best Buy</p>
<p>- Target</p>

<p>Get the picture? They don't update the prices and therefore you might as well go waste some gas and drive to purchase the dang thing. Call of Duty Black Ops was released in the time span of 2010-2011. The game is almost 3 years old, and it's still close
 to it's before retail price. ($20.00 isn't a lot you say? They gotta make profits you say?)</p>

<p>The game is worth about $19.00, and it's still $40.00. No thanks. </p>

<p>And this is how over 100's of other games are, some games like Fable... The first Fable, the first one released for Xbox not 360 but just Xbox... I wasted my money on this old memorable child hood game anyways. I couldn't even play it without a internal
 hard drive. This is how most games are, and that's probably why no one purchases games off the Xbox Live Marketplace anymore.

<p>This is why i always wait for the games i want to get to go on sale and if i want it faster i hit Amazon or Listia;) As i understand it it's the devs/publishers that control the games prices in the marketplace and not Xbox so they def need to start re-pricing
 some of the older stuff. I found Black-op's for $5 on amazon bundled with another game lol</p>

<p>The prices of hard copies of games on Amazon are so cheap compared to the XBL download store, makes sense to purchase from there. &nbsp;I always prefer to have a hard copy anyway, the only downloads I have are some of the gold freebies.</p>

<p>They should allow the shios to sell download codes so there is still a chance to get digi copy cheaper, you could still have the games right away because the code could be emailed. Even better allow the online shops to sell right from the store or at least
 link your amazon, GAME, shopto etc account to your MS account. At the moment the digital copies just arr not worth it, they are often £20 or more dearer than anywhere else.</p>

<p>I've only bought One games recently and they've done a really good job with the prices for digital games on there. &nbsp;Outside of buying the games on release (or pre-download), the remainder of games I've purchased were put on sale at some point. &nbsp;I think I
 got Plants vs. Zombies for 50% off, Never Alone was 10% off a week or two after release &amp; Murdered Soul Suspect was 50% off recently as well.</p>

<p>The problem with this, is that it is 100% subjective. &nbsp;What you may deem a video game's worth to be, others may not.</p>

<p>Just buy games from alternate sources. &nbsp;Best Buy / Future Shop / Walmart / Target, often these older games can be found in those bargain bins for 10 - 20$ new and sealed. &nbsp;Why pay more than you need to.

<p>The original Xbox had an internal hard drive, hence why you need one to play original Xbox games on 360. Those games are not reverse engineered to work like a normal 360 game would.</p>

<p>I have yet to pay over $10 for a game. I don't care to play the newest, latest and greatest, so I can wait for super sales or I use eBay... I've been playing all those free games with gold games, they are ancient history to most people, but new to me.</p>
<p>Because I'm so cheap, I am Amazed at the prices on the marketplace! Who would pay $30 for an old game, when it's $5 on eBay? &nbsp;Maybe if you're really lazy... I've downloaded games that were heavily discounted on sale, but that's it. I'd think if they had
 competitive prices they would put a huge dent in places like GameStop...</p>
