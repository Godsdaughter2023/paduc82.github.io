<h2>            Add margins to email merge from Word</h2>
                    I'm sending an email newsletter to a large list of email addresses from Word using a mail merge. Is there any way to create padding on both sides so that the content is a fixed size and centered? Is the only way to do this by putting everything in a table?

            Hi Marjorie,<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer add-ons are used in conjunction with Internet Explorer, and not alone, as they depend on services provided by the browser, or its accompanying Windows RSS Platform. They are also used to interact with web content like videos and games. You
 just need to make sure that the add-ons that you install are from a trusted source. To manage add-ons in Internet Explorer, kindly check this

Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.<br />

<p>Hi Marjorie,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Edge browser is the Default web browser on Windows 10</strong>. It has been designed to be easy and simple to use and does not have a long and complicated list of settings, nor does it use the old-fashion type of Addons and browser extensions
 that IE11 does... the simplest solution to your question is to use the Edge Browser instead of IE11.... however, even if you don't use IE11 (often) it is still a good idea to keep IE free of Addons and other malware extensions (some addons can install additional
 software on your computer without you knowing it, or connect to other computers to make a web bot, that can read your email address books or steal your web site passwords using your personal information to attack and install further malware on other computers
 (from your friends list etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, there are two types of Addons for Internet Explorer that can cause problems because they were developed or written for earlier versions of web browsers....</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Toolbars</strong> (eg.... the Google Toolbar, the Yahoo toolbar, Robo form, Last Pass etc. generally all toolbar addons)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Browser Helper Objects (BHO's)</strong> (eg.... Adobe PDF link helper, and others.... quite often a Toolbar addon also uses a BHO also... eg.... the Google Toolbar update helper BHO, RoboForm, Amazon Companion etc.)....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other IE addons such as <strong>menu extensions or command bar buttons</strong> are generally not incompatible with modern versions of Internet Explorer.... you can safely leave Menu and Command bar button extensions enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see there are a large number of possible addons that you may have already installed on your computer that may be causing problems in IE or that may harbour malware....there is no simple answer except.... don't install stuff for your browser (or
 computer for that matter)&nbsp;that doesn't come from Microsoft....On windows 10 you can install Secure, tested and validate Windows Store apps (winkey+s&gt;Windows Store)... In the first instance search Windows Store for software for your windows 10 computer before
 you search the internet for software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately there is a quick and easy way to disable (well actually this setting stops the bad toolbars and BHOs from being loaded in IE in the first place) Toolbar and BHO addons (commonly toolbar and BHO addons are called COM addons and the technology
 dates from the beginning of the Internet when IE was first developed)...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>From IE select the Tools&gt;Internet Options menu....</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Select the Advanced tab of Internet Options and find and uncheck "Enable third-party browser extensions". Save changes....</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afd7e65f-afdb-4f15-a921-251a905abdb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afd7e65f-afdb-4f15-a921-251a905abdb8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>!Important</strong> - you <strong>MUST</strong> close and restart all open IE instances for the changes to take affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also permanently uninstall Toolbar and BHO addons from the Add/Remove Programs applet in Windows 10.(and 7,8 and 8.1)...</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>winkey+s&gt;Control Panel...... open the Windows Control panel and double-click on "<strong>Programs and Features</strong>" and then sort the list by name or date of installation.... IF you notice IE suddenly misbehaving then it is likely that an addon that
 was installed recently (with or without your permission) is the cause, then it will appear at the top of the list (if you've sorted by date)... Select an item in the list of Installed Programs and then click the "Uninstall" button..... continue to choose and
 uninstall any items that you don't know or have not used and uninstall them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5c77fe6-84b4-45d7-9997-f81a7f44d1ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5c77fe6-84b4-45d7-9997-f81a7f44d1ed" /></a></p>
<p><strong>!important </strong>- When you uninstall programs, (sometimes) you MUST restart your computer for the full changes to take affect....
<strong>restart your computer! always after uninstalling software.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After you have uninstalled or disabled unused, unknown or unwanted Toolbars or BHO's...please read the following....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users often install Toolbar addons because they want to use popup blocking, form filling or web searching (in earlier versions of IE, these functions were not built-in to the browser and you had to install third-party addons like the Google toolbar to use
 those functions)... IE11 has all of those functions built-in.... you do not need Toolbar and BHO addons in IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Web search is built-in the IE Address bar and on the newtabs page.... just start typing your search terms in the IE address bar... eg...where is the tallest building in the world
</p>
<p>
</p><p>as you type in the address bar you should notice a dropdown appearing underneath the address bar offering suggestions from your search history, saved favorites or Search suggestions from your default Search Provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Modern web search engines such as Bing and Google now use <strong>natural language search
</strong>(and are pretty good at it) so experiment with your search terms and see the results page...<strong>with experience you should be able to enter a search term and then find exactly what you want from the first page of search results</strong>. Bing includes
 search results from Wikipedia.... excellent for students and the curious! You can configure your IE default search provider (search engine) from Tools&gt;Manage Addons&gt;Search Providers</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6232e6a3-6a71-4865-8579-bc9e41401164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6232e6a3-6a71-4865-8579-bc9e41401164" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>naturally as a MS fan-boy I choose <strong>Bing (Chinese pinyin&nbsp;for Cool)... </strong>
I like the balance between advertising and search results, and the Wikipedia sidebar for reference subjects.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I highly recommend that you practice using Address bar searching.... just type away....</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can configure your Address bar and Form filling autocomplete options from</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Content tab, "Settings" button in the Autocomplete section.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>General Web browser security</strong> -</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important that you enabled Enable IE11's "Windows Defender SmartScreen Filter" to protect you from phishing attacks (scam/fake websites)...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use your computer at home.... then you should not touch the default IE security zone settings..... just accept the default settings.... they have been designed to provide internet users with the best protection for browsing internet web sites... The
 IE security zone settings are mainly for Company computers (domain joined networks) or High security applications (government and military networks)....</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default" to change your IE Security zone settings back to their factory defaults...</strong></p>

<p>The screenshot above is from my computer, I am a programmer and do a lot of web testing so my list of addons may be different to yours.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned earlier the answer to your question is not easy..... Generally <strong>
avoid</strong> installing IE Addons of type (see column header above) <strong>Toolbar or Browser Helper Object</strong>... or if your browser is misbehaving you can disable these types of Addons from the Addons manage by selecting the item in the list and then
 clicking the disable button....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other Addon types (Browser Extensions, ActiveX controls) are generally benign ,
<strong>provided you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">keep your computer updated with windows updates</span>...
</strong><strong>If an ActiveX control becomes incompatible with IE or a security threat emerges IE will warn you before it will let the ActiveX control run...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Carefully <strong>note the Publisher of the Addon and its type</strong>.... <strong>
 replacements.... you could disable them if you want to... I disable them for testing purposes.
<strong>Home users can safely leave them enabled provided they have run regular windows updates.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Accelerator and search provider&nbsp;Addons can be safely left enabled.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled Addons from HP (the brand of my computer) because I don't use them, The HP companion Addon is not needed....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled the Google Toolbar and the Google Toolbar update helper BHO, but not uninstalled it because I use it for testing web sites only....As mentioned earlier
<strong>I highly recommend that you uninstall Toolbars and Browser Helper Addons from the Add/Remove Programs applet....</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>that's about it... I trust that my time has been informative and instructional....</p>

            <p>Office 2010 (v14) opened attachments fine directly from Outlook, as attachments. Then I stupidly upgraded to Office 365, installed Office 2013 (v15) and this stupid protected view occurs every time i try to open a .docx attachment. &nbsp;And the "Protected View"
 will sit there for hours. Seems like Office 2013 is a POC and can't perform like Office 2010. Stupid waste of $100 for software that is worse that its predecessor. New hp 27" i7 All-in-One touch screen, Win8.1 x64. I went into Windows "Set Default applications",
 to ensure that Word is the default. It was, no change, no fix. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a fix on CNET.com,&nbsp;http://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/how-to-disable-protected-view-in-microsoft-word/ One must disable Word's option to open outlook's attachment in protected view. &nbsp;After enabling this fix in Word, Word works like it should, opening
 Outlooks attachments like it is supposed to by default. &nbsp;This seems stupid, that MS Word would stop its own Outlook from working. Shouldn't protected view allow someone to view a word document from outlook? Anyway, regardless of the stupidity of the default
 settings, this will fix what Word 2013 enables by default, confusing us and making us hate MS again, at least until WE fix it so that it will work.</p>

            Protected view is a security feature which is enabled by default, but it is possible to turn these settings off, as you have noticed. It doesn't really qualify as a "workaround," though, since Word is working as designed.

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’m not sure what multiple searches you want in this form, search only once but get the multiple searches effect, or each filter will
 search the form will based on the previous one.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If just search once but do multiple search, you can use loop function.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want filter the form based on previous research, can use Query. Set SelectQuery#1 as the datasource of SelectQuery#2, then use
 SelectQuery#2 as the datasource of SelectQuery#3, etc. &nbsp;Then when you run SelectQuery#n, all the underlying queries will be run in sequence.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Elaine,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to filter the form based on the previous search.&nbsp; However this could be different each time.&nbsp; For instance, one time I could search for year 2007 and get everything from that year.&nbsp; I would then want to search that data for a particular program from
 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When done I have the 'show all' button on the form that returns all the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could then search in the box for a first name and a few could come up.&nbsp; I would then want to search those name's by year or program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just can't figure out a way for the form to hold the search results and then search on them again.&nbsp; And I don't think a sequene would work, only because it could be a different search each time.</p>

            Outlook for Mac introduces format=flowed formatting for plain text messages. This is similar to HTML, which by nature wraps only when it reaches the right edge of the window.
<div><br />
<div>Format=flowed means that plain text messages are no longer wrapped around the 80th character. This makes reading messages much cleaner on different size devices like iPhones or iPads. Messages are rewrapped automatically by the receiving application rather
 than the sending application.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This feature cannot be turned off.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            Tables are a great alternative.
<div><br />
<div>You can also used the intersection operator (" " -i.e., a space character) with named ranges. For instance, if you named Column B "Qtr_1", Column C "Qtr_2", and Row 5 "CY_2012", you could use</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; =SUM(Qtr_1:Qtr_2 CY_2012)</div>
<div><br />
<div>to get the sum of B5&amp; C5. Using this method is MUCH more flexible than renaming column headers, since you can redefine the named ranges at will, and the named ranges don't need to comprise entire rows or columns, or they can be defined with multiple rows
 and columns.</div>

<h3> kook---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            isync&#39;ing contacts from 5800 to mac OK. but what about the other way around&#63; that is, mac to 5800&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I had all my contacts compiled, throughout the years, on my new nokia 5800. Then I isync'ed and it automatically copied the same list to my mac's addressbook. Since it is easier to edit everything on a computer, I made edits on my contacts on my mac and
 deleted manually all the contacts on my nokia so that the next time I plugged them, I expected mac to transfer all the 'new' and 'edited' contacts to my nokia. But no, isync says it will delete all my mac contacts instead of equalling and copying what is there
 in my mac addressbook to my nokia. how can i make this work? in summary, I have null contacts on my nokia and full contacts on my mac and want isync to copy whatever there is on my mac's addressbook to my nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>PowerPoint can&#39;t open downloaded presentation files. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel m lima  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint can&#39;t open downloaded presentation files.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I currently own a retail version of Office 365 Home Premium 32 bit.<br />
Every time I try to open a .ppt or .pptx file downloaded from the internet I get the following error message:<br />
"Sorry, PowerPoint can't read (FilePath)."<br />
<br />
There's also a "Show Help" button on the message. If I click it, the following message shows up:<br />
"The presentation cannot be opened. Your antivirus program may prevent you from opening the presentation. To fix this problem, make sure your antivirus program is current and working correctly. If the problem persists and the presentation is from someone that
 you trust, turn off your antivirus program, and then try to open the presentation again. If you do this, make sure you turn on your antivirus program again after you open the presentation."<br />
<br />
The presentations open fine in other versions of Office and on PowerPoint Viewer 2007. I already tried turning off my antivirus and firewall and I still couldn't open the file. I spent the whole day researching and found some other threads about the same error,
 however none of the solutions proposed worked for me - including doing a clean reboot, reinstalling Office and changing the location of internet explorer's temporary files.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the threads I found - I did everything they said but nothing worked still:<br />

I have a Windows 8 64 bit operating system.<br />

Thanks,<br />

            Hi All,<br />
<br />
Good to know that the issue is resolved. Here I’d like to write a summary:<br />
<br />
=============<br />
<br />
<br />
You get an error “The specified view is invalid” when clicking the shared folder in Office 365 group.<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue is fixed now. We did not get the opportunity to investigate further and share the solution back to the community.
<br />
<br />
=============<br />
<br />
If you have any other questions, please feel free to post us a new thread, and we will continue to assist you from there.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Spike

<p>I’m trying to help one of our customers. They want to have a distribution list in Office 365. They have over 1100 external contacts in a list, and I’m trying to create a distribution list of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m using PowerShell to import the contacts, but can’t import more than 500 contacts.<br />
I don’t get any error while importing.</p>
<p>When all of the contact have been importeted, I check the contacts in 365, I can only see 500 contacts.</p>
<p>The customer has Office 365 Education E3 for Faculty for their users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea how I can accomplish this ?</p>

<p>Hi Reidar,<br />
<br />
I have searched articles about importing external contacts into Office 365 and haven’t found the detailed number limitation. So to further narrow down this scenario, could you provide the detailed PowerShell command you used to import these external contacts?
 There may be some limits when using the PowerShell command you used.<br />
<br />
Besides, have you tried to break the CSV file with 1100 contacts into some CSV files with less than 500 contacts and do the importing process again? If not, it is suggested that you try this.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<span>Greater control of and far far far better communications allowing easy exchange of chat messaging during video calls.&nbsp; Since Skype has become one window, in call messaging has almost stopped leading to a very large reduction in the quality and
 usefulness of our communication.&nbsp; Messaging has moved to Facebook, along with mobile phone video calls as both iOS &amp; Android Skype have been so massively degraded by Microsoft's 'development', so much that the current versions are unrecognisable as Skype with
 my call partners deleting Skype from their phones as a consequence except the few that have remained on the pre 'development' Android versions.</span></p>

<span>It would be a far far far better use of Microsoft Skype resources to sort out the many many many bugs now in Skype that have reduced effective communication from almost all of calls (90/95%) in pre 'development' Linux Skype 4.3 to around 20%
 for too many of the recent and current versions of Linux Skype in as far as I can tell the same internet conditions, granted weak wifi at the other end of many calls (from interference from other equipment that is far too expensive to resolve), the prime issue
 being that sound is collapsed into short sharp bursts sounding like someone knocking on a door, making speech unintelligible, and with the bugs in accessing the chat options for small laptop use of Skype, then that audio has become far far more important,
 there are other intrusive bugs that are not as significant as these issues.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>Better to have separate windows than split screen, current desktop Linux theoretically offers split screen for chat messages, although the facility is very buggy and erratic, on a small screen, opening the chat window by splitting the screen
 merges the 'open chat window' button with the inoperable call volume button rendering them both unusable, the only solution is to then fully quit Skype completely and restart Skype to restore the fuller video chat window in the same way that some Skype sessions
 the full screen operation can only be exited by finishing the call and restarting Skype, although the video rendering only gives part of the video feed unlike earlier and better versions where the Skype window space not used by the video feed were blank bars,
 or perhaps the user could be offered the choice of displaying the full video chat or the video stream filling the window by cropping the displayed feed? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>The other issue is that the minimum call window is by a very large margin far far far too large for small laptop screens using at a minimum at least a third of the screen yet still presents less information with so much wasted space than the
 pre 'development' versions of Skype did in a much smaller window, less than half the size of the current window. &nbsp; I use 12 inch screens (I understand 13 inches is the most popular size from a recent internet search) here as do my call partners, Linux Skype
 Window minimum now stretches from the top of the available screen space into the activity bar at the bottom of my Ubuntu 17.10 and Linux Mint 18.3 (latest versions of the two most popular Linux distros that are fully up to date on Thinkpads, one of the most
 popular laptops) rendering the bottom of the Skype Window inaccessible for most, but not quite all Skype sessions.&nbsp; The wasted space is also a massive issue in creating a call record for a visa application for example, the only method I have found is to take
 a screen shot of every part of the chat / history timeline and then adding them together in a suitable application, a process that was tortuous in the pre 'development' versions of Skype, far far far more uncomfortable in the Microsoft versions of Skype with
 the enormous amount of wasted space, and unnecessary colouring that massively increases ink consumption when printing pages and pages compared to the previous versions of Skype.</span></p>

<p>In that spirit, here's what I submitted last month to the survey for question #4:</p>
<p>
Oh yes. The new client is missing so many things that I would never consider using it until MANY of these are in place. This is why I hope you continue to "allow" us to use the perfectly-good "classic" Skype for years to come, since it will literally take years
 to build out the various new clients.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
-Have ONE new desktop client (in addition to the classic one). Stop confusing things by having two. And since the UWP app is always behind (and isn't compatible with a huge swath of Windows anyway--W7, W8, early versions of W10), I think that's the one that
 should go).<br />
-Add /showplaces, /remotelogout (and please restore these to the classic client while you're at it--I can't believe that you discontinued them a few weeks ago).<br />
-Away and Offline modes.<br />
-Ability to define how long "Away" is.<br />
-Double-click a contact to call.<br />
-Control over specific sounds.<br />
-I've noticed that the "X" for closing some windows (e.g. application settings) is on the top left for some reason. It should be on the top right.<br />
<br />
Chat:<br />
-A true compact chat view that's at least as good as what we had in Skype 5/6. It should emphasize displaying as much actual chat as possible and keep things like giant amounts of whitespace to a bare minimum.<br />
-Ability to vary the font and font size of chat.<br />
-Ability to keep ALL history (which I assume is the default, but it doesn't say) or just 1 year, month, whatever.<br />
-Ability to press Enter and insert only a line break (meaning Ctrl-Enter is used for sending).<br />
-Ability to turn off image, media, and link previews.<br />
-Ability to control the display of space-wasting avatars in chat.<br />
-Full control over emoticons, not just size (animation, whether to show them at all).<br />
-A border between chat typing area and history that a) Can be moved, and b) Remembers the position. Often I want a larger typing area at the start than one line, and it's tedious resizing it with a bunch of Ctrl-Enters (and even then you're limited).<br />
-A way of navigating chat history by time. This isn't great even in Classic, but at least it makes an attempt.<br />
-Ability to default to "Messages" when using Ctrl-F chat search. It currently defaults to ALL, which also includes People, Groups, and Bots. These add time to the search, clutters the results, and requires a user to click into Messages to get an unfettered
 view.<br />
-NEW FEATURE: Autosaving unsent chat to some temporary area, much like, say, Word does. In the case of an app or system crash, most (if not all) of the text would be there afterwards. The way it is now, all unsent text is lost, which sometimes is extremely
 painful.

            I refuse to use a version of Skype that doesn't have split-view. I'm a paying Skype customer with multiple Skype subscriptions and I'm forced to use an old version of Skype shoehorned into Windows 10 simply to have the core functionality that for me is
 crucial. If you want to keep my custom then return future Windows 10 versions of Skype to split-view/compact.

<p>How about the other versions of Skype, Mac &amp; Linux... &nbsp;They would be better off with compact windows, one for the video call &amp; one for messages. &nbsp;With a compact view the window can be resized for a convenient part of your screen on larger screens, with the
 current excessive minimum window size, small laptop users are just stuffed. &nbsp;My online research suggests that 13 inches is the most popular laptop size, using Skype on a slightly smaller screen would suggest that Skype is too big for those screens as on my
 12 inch screen, the minimum window size varies by about a centimetre or just over with each launch, but that is the difference between accessing the bottom edge of the minimum window and call control icons to not being able to and having to relaunch many times
 for a small window to open so that can use the app!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is the fruits of development from one of largest software companies in the world, on one of the two most popular versions of Linux on one of the most popular small laptops! &nbsp;Speaks volumes for the lack of quality control in Microsoft! &nbsp;No wonder
 there is a trail of broken previously great apps and companies in Microsoft's trail, the sadest being taking Nokia from one of the largest cellphone manufacturers to destruction, with a small design team rising independently from the ashes.</p>

<p>just now saw that this topic finally got noticed.</p>
<p>to add my two cents:</p>
<p>for me split windows is very relevant for many reasons. i am self-employed and most of the time i work in two to three different projects with a separate team for each project and different people in each of those teams - and i work from home remote, i only
 physically meet them about three times a year. i have two screens on my pc and one of those screens is covered with those separate chat windows, one chat window per project per most one or two relevant team-members and while i work or code on the primary screen
 i am able to follow communication of each of those people just with one glance over at the second screen, no need to switch back and forth between tabs just to see what they wrote while i was mentally absent because i were concentrating at some work on the
 primary screen. for me those windows are like a virtual surrounding while i work remotely and i am able to see what each of those persons do or say. in a room you would als be annoyed to need to actively pick which person you can hear instead of having those
 you picked all at once. same thing with voice or video-chat, quite often i video-chat with one person on primary screen while typing short answers to two or three other people on the second screen who totally are not meant to be in that video-chat as they
 are from another company/a different team/a different project. those chat windows for the primary key players i need to keep contact with are open all of the time, they are always arranged in the same way, i blindly know for years which person the upper left
 window on the right screen is and wo the lower right windows on the right screen is. i further mostly just hibernate my pc, so skype always runs this way, i only reboot for updates, and then first thing i do is open skype, rearrange those windows exactly how
 i need them and then work until the next update-reboot is required. that maybe also explains why the contacts in my perspective should be a higly dense list of names, preferably favorites i picked to be relevant, in alphabetical order like a telephone-book.
 because the people i frequently talk to every day are layed out as always open chat windows, all others i need to find quickly should be pickable immediately from that alphabetical list. the tendency of uwp-skype to reorder my contacts i see to have the "most
 recently used" on top and then followed by date and time of last message is a hell of confusing. i never care who i last talked to, just what name i plan to talk to next. the chat windows for me mostly work like the screen of a&nbsp;surveillance system where you
 see 8 different chats at one glance without the need to actively switch to the one where something happened. i also then like to keep the contacts list and most chats on the right screen while dragging one chat i need to share a lot of info with to the main
 screen temporarily. i believe the old win32 skype version had the perfect solution. it was my most relevant collaboration tool by working how it worked. without free floating unrestricted separate chat windows that i can arrange to my demands over as many
 screens as i can afford its absolutely useless.</p>

<p>It failed saying invalid Product Activation Code. I pulled the code from the laptop that shares the software so I know it's good. I don't have the box anymore - it was lost too.</p>

<p>Well, I thought the same thing and did reach a live person who tried to be helpful.</p>
<p>He explained that since the product is so old they don't have the tools to help me around my PAC problems.</p>
<p>He sent me to the Community Forum suggesting that people here might have the tools for a better download and verify my PAC. Well my disk, the box with the sticker and pretty much everything else) since I lost everything except for the laptop I escaped with
 so I pulled the PAC from my laptop but the Office XP I tried to validate wanted nothing to do with me.</p>

            I think I solved it. It must have been a "non-Professional" version of Office. When I installed "regular" office and applied my PAC it worked.

<p>Well, I thought I had it solved. The Windows&nbsp;Office XP (non-Professional) seemed to take my Code but when I opened Word, it asked for it again and then crippled my copy into reduced functionality. I had a 100% legitimate copy on the Win 10 machine that burned
 up now I can't get it working.</p>
<p>Anyone have an ideas?</p>

<h2>            Huge display and fonts in Office 2013 interface</h2>
                    How do I change the huge interface in Office 2013? &nbsp;The toolbars and menus at the top are huge and take up about 1/4 of my screen. &nbsp;Is there a way to change this? I already have my monitor display turned up all the way to 1920 and the problem only occurs
 in Office. &nbsp;I've tried changing themes too but that didn't do anything. &nbsp;I feel like I'm using a program from the 1980s and not 2013. &nbsp;Can someone please tell me if there is a way to change it?

</p><p>I had the same problem, and I don't think the others "got" the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I solved it by going to the Control Panel (cursor bottom right &gt; click Settings &gt; Personalization</p>

</p><p>Click Display on the dialog box (bottom left)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check (tick) the box left of "Let me choose one scaling level for all my displays"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go through each of the pull down menu items, and change the font size to something like 10 or smaller depending on your preference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once all done, click "Apply"</p>
<p>
</p><p>That worked for me.&nbsp; I don't have the foggiest idea how it happened in the first place, but this seemed to solve it.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes third party software’s like the antivirus or any other security software’s tend to conflict with
 the installation of java and give the error “Unknown Publisher”.</span></p>
<p><span>You may try installing Java after performing clean boot on the computer and also disable the antivirus software
 running on the computer. Make sure that you put the computer in normal startup after installing Java on the computer and you may enable the antivirus software after the installation of Java.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempted installation on Windows XP, SP3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AVG (current version) flags the installer as malware and stops the installation process. &nbsp;AVG then forces a cancelation of the installation, and a system restart in order to remove the segments of the installer it thinks is a worm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that this is a false positive but the Nokia web site is silent on this problem, i.e it does not guarantee it to be malware or spyware free, and does not recommend turning your AV off in order to install it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not inclined to turn it off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia, as the developer, needs to contact AVG (Grissoft) to resolve &nbsp;the problem. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Don't bark up the wrong tree. There is no way Nokia can prevent users from installing all sorts of security software on their computers, that will prevent software from installing or working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen both Windows XP and Windows 7 computers where problems were solved by uninstalling and cleaning all traces of AVG (and replacing it with Microsoft Security Essentials).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion AVG need to get their act together.</p>

<p>I think half the problem is that NPCS installs itself to start every time Windoze boots up - what malware does.</p>
<p>There is no good reason to have this, unless you are in a mobile phone shop.&nbsp; The Suite is not sweet: it should only run on demand. That is why I would rather **bleep** around with gnokii than have paternalistic Nokia **bleep** forcing itself on me.</p>

<p><em><font color="#0000FF">&gt;&gt; RE: &nbsp;Barking up the wrong tree...</font></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would humbley disagree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see from the additional threads, both AVG and Avast are showing the problem, and it is due to a segment of the program that is setting something to run at Windows launch. &nbsp;As postulated by another poster, that is unnecessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications and AV programs that are incompatible are not uncommon. &nbsp;Firefox regularly declares AVG's add-ons to be incompatible when there is a Firefox update. &nbsp;AVG then issues an update and all is well. &nbsp;This is due to Firefox's date coding for its add-oins
 and extensions, and not due to a true issue with incompatibility. &nbsp;The adept user of Firefox can over-ride these or simply wait for the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, the Nokia installer would have a pre-amble asking if you want to have their PC Suite load when Windows Starts as a part of the end-user dialogue. &nbsp;This allows the user to say "no" and that segment of the installer would be skipped, and not trigger
 the AV program(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternately, now that this is known, and hopefully someone flags it to Nokia via this forum, appropriate wording can be added to the Nokia web site stating that it may trigger some AV programs and to shut them off. &nbsp;I have also reported this in the AVG user
 forums as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the only reason I was attempting to try the Nokia PC Suite was to have an alternative to that gastly bloatware called "Zune."</p>

I have an AT&amp;T 8525, just upgraded to WM 6 which then required ActiveSync 4.5 upgrade...now my device will not sync with outlook, just gives me a sync error (no # reference). When I run the troubleshooter, it saids Norton Firewall may be causing a problem and
 takes me to a MS link to check the configurations. I do not have Norton Firewall, just the Windows firewall which I have tried disabling, running sync but still the same error message. I can connect to the device(via USB), add files, explore etc but not able
 to sync Outlook. I've also tried to sync the items individually from Outlook, no luck. I've reloaded, re-installed, ran Outlook repair, connected, disconnected til I'm ready to pull my hair out....always the same message that sync could not be completed???&nbsp;
 Anyone had this version of a problem?&nbsp; Thanks &amp; Merry Christmas!

            You sais that you reinstalled Outlook. Did you also reinstall Activesync. It is recommended to install Outlook first, then Activesync. If you did not do it in that order, I suggest you start all over again. Uninstall both software on the PC and reboot
 and reinstall. Now if there's any partneership on your device, delete it and reboot. Connect again. Keep us posted and Merry Christmas.

    <title>Excel 2010&#58; Double-Click PivotTable Item without Displaying Excess - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel 2010&#58; Double-Click PivotTable Item without Displaying Excess Records</h2>
                    Thank you for reviewing my post.<br />
<br />
When double-clicking a PivotTable value, how does one limit the records displayed?<br />
<br />
For example, it makes intuitive sense to see only one record, when double-clicking the value of 1 in the following PivotTable:<br />
<br />

<br />
However, I get the following nine records instead:<br />
<br />

<br />
The desired result, of only the one record displayed, would appear as follows:<br />

<br />
One more thing.... The file may not have macros, because many end-users view the reports on Macs.

I look forward to your help.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Taskbar Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragonsyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar Issue</h2>
                    <p>I'm not really sure if this is an inherent issue in the 9879 build of the technical preview or if it is related to a conflict on my system, as I have not been able to find anybody else posting about it online. The problem is as thus:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the taskbar set to autohide at the bottom of the screen. The problem is, when moving the mouse cursor to it, it will not pop the taskar anywhere that an icon is attached to. For example, you can not point at the lower left of the screen to get to
 the start menu. You must point to a point on the taskbar that has no icons pinned to it, then slide back over. I thought it could be a problem with a dual monitor setup, so I disabled one of them and it still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had any experience with this? If so, any solutions or tips? It is not very intuitive to point at a region other than the one that your icon is located and not very convenient to pop it up manually with the keyboard first either. Thanks everyone.</p>

            <p>I have that problem too, but <strong>only </strong>in the region of startbutton, search-button and task view button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, I can move the mouse on regions with pinned icons of running or unused programs, empty regions or e.g. the clock - and the taskbar pops up normally.</p>
<p>

            <p>Okay, Daniel. Upon closer inspection, it appears you are right. The taskbar will pop up wherever there are icons pinned to it, just not the far left region where the Start button, Task view and search button are. It could be I was swiping the mouse to the
 right too quickly and it just appeared to go past the pinned icons. Still annoying, nonetheless. It seems we could be on to a bug here or an incompatibility with some setups, at least. It would be nice to hear from Microsoft if this is a known issue or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the clarification from both of you. Gives me hope that this may get more attention.</p>

            <p>as mentioned, you will not be able to hover over the area of the START, SEARCH, or TASK VIEW to bring up the taskbar. This has been in EVERY build, including the unofficial 9901 build. I assume it will be dealt with at a later date. Yes, it is slightly annoying
 because so many of us are used to shoving the cursor in the bottom left corner to bring up the taskbar. I have gotten used to just dropping down to the middle of the screen now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making an educated guess, I have to assume that since the first three icons are locked in place, that area is 'greyed' out for any activity such as moving apps around, removing them from the bar, etc. Unfortunately, it also seems to have made it a 'dead
 area' for even something as minor as waking up the taskbar. Funny actually.</p>

            im on build 9879 thankfully you can now <strong>remove</strong> the SEARCH and TASK VIEW icons (right click taskbar uncheck them)&nbsp;&nbsp; on 9879 thus for me, decreasing the size of the area affected to only the "start" button<br />

            I have a related taskbar problem which has recently shown up - the row of pinned tasks to the right of the windows and cortana icons has decided to shift itself up to a higher row on the desktop. And the pins are now underlined if they are open. Maybe
 this change is responsible? Anyway it has spoiled my desktop and windows that use that part of the screen.<br />

                    <p class="contentStandard">I am replicating this question from another user, because the thread was locked down to only one response and the answer was not helpful. Seriously infuriating problem. Cannot believe all the problems created by Word after

<p>Thank&nbsp;you. I must have serious brain fog not to have figured this out. The program began saving documents to the template folder as normat.dotm and set that way. I must have accidentally hit "save as a template" instead of "save as" What I should have done,
 and this was a very easy fix, was to 1) change the save as to the proper folder, not the template folder 2) look at the bottom file format option where the dialog box asks for the format to save the document as, i.e., .doc, .docx, etc. and pick .docx&nbsp;for the
 format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so basic, I'm embarrassed. Sorry about that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In your original post, you quoted part of an error message:</p>
<p>"<span>Word cannot open the existing file.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;(/Users/<strong>chubbco.17</strong>/Library/Group Conta...)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>But your screen shots show your User folder being called <strong>kayaak</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you share this computer with other users? I've highlighted that there are 2 different user names you've posted. Please fill us in on the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never experienced any issue with Word 2016 for Mac not displaying accents. That's not a shortcoming of the program, but a problem with your installation.</p>

                    Does Microsoft Office 2010 offer a Latin and Cyrillic Transliteration Add-in, something like the good old Office 2003 Add-in:&nbsp; Latin and Cyrillic Transliteration&nbsp;(translit.exe)???
