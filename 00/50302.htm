            Hi JackYou0706 ... This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />In Insider build 18305, this is a known issue. Unfortunately no known fix yet.
<br />I am affected by this too and I know It is annoying as your taskbar refreshes every 3 minutes :)

            If no one has figured out the problem by themselves I shall tell you how I was able to solve the problem. Go to program files (x86) &gt; common files &gt; adobe &gt; fonts and place all the type 1 fonts into that folder and they should work.

</p><p><strong>If you sign in to Windows with a local account, you can choose not to enter a password.</strong> However, we don't recommend this—it's the least secure way to sign in to your PC. You can also switch a Microsoft account to a local account, but you
 can't use a local account to download apps from the Windows Store or sync settings online.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 has native touch screen support no doubt in that. Unfortunately touch gesture is not possible on remote desktop connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a remote desktop session is established in between two computers (one with touch capability and other with no touch capability) as in your case. There might not be a chance to access a touch
 capable computer with a non touch capable desktop computer, though Windows 7 is touch wiz compatible.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to use this touch features or programs, both the computers should be installed with touch capable hardware. For example a Touch screen monitor, Touch pad, etc.</p>
<p>Without a touch compatible&nbsp;hardware on both the computers, touch capable remote desktop connection in between two computers might not possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only possible way to create a touch capable remote desktop connection is by installing touch interface hardware on your desktop computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide us with additional information. So that we can help you fix the problem on your computer.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps you.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Which operating system is currently installed on your system?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description, you get a blank screen on Windows 10 get app. In this case, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><span>Check Windows Update for an updated version of KB2952664 (Windows 7 SP1) or KB2976978 (Windows 8.x)</span></strong></li><li>
<span>After installing the Windows Update, re-run the&nbsp;Compatibility Appraiser. This will happen automatically within a day or it can be run manually from an&nbsp;admin command prompt:
</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser"</span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Once started, it may take&nbsp;10 minutes or so&nbsp;for the appraiser to complete. Once&nbsp;complete, re-open the Get Windows 10 app and it will have the updated compatibility
 information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

    <title>BSOD - Critical Process Died and Unexpected Store Exception - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSOD - Critical Process Died and Unexpected Store Exception</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been getting increasing blue screen errors over the last several weeks. I have searched here and elsewhere for solutions, and have been unsuccessful. I am hoping that someone here will be able to at least point me in the right direction, as at this
 point I don't even know if this is a hardware or a Windows issue, or if it's related to other software, perhaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is 9 months old, assembled by the store in which I bought the components. Specs are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 Home</p>
<p>ASUS Z170-E Motherboard</p>
<p>Intel Core i7-6700K @ 4.00GHz<br />
16.0 GB RAM<br />
Samsung 850 EVO 500GB SSD (Windows is installed here)<br />
Western Digital 1TB HDD<br />
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti<br />
Thermaltake Toughpower 850W Gold Power supply<br />
Corsair H105 Liquid Cooler</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general I am getting BSODs when playing two specific games - Civilization VI and Fallout 4. Both were installed to my SSD (although I moved Civilization to the HDD to see if that would help - it did not). It is most consistent while playing Civilization
 VI. After about 5 minutes it will freeze and give me a blue screen; either <strong>
CRITICAL PROCESS DIED</strong> or <strong>UNEXPECTED STORE EXCEPTION</strong>. I don't believe I've had any other types of blue screens. The blue screens strangely occur during low-stress times (i.e. not during a loading screen or heavy action) such as walking
 around in Fallout or panning around the map during my turn in Civilization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all instances, it refuses to create a minidump or a memory dump. I have followed the advice on here and turned off the automatic reboot on crash, but the 'collecting information' progress stays at 0% until I hard reset the system. My last minidump is
 from over a month ago, and I can't recall the circumstances in which it was created. I can post it if you think it might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am 100% sure I do not have malware or a virus. I am running Kaspersky Internet Security and have also scanned with Malwarebytes. I did read somewhere that exclusions in your antivirus may cause the issue, so I made sure these two games had full permissions
 (both were curiously "Low Restricted" initially - no other software/games were "low restricted", I thought this was a strange coincidence) but moving them to "Trusted" did not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my hardware to the best of my ability and all tests have come back fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc /scannow on C: (the SSD) shows no errors or problems. I ran a memory test on the ram, no problems. I've used Samsung Magician to check the health of the SSD, no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had blue screens occur outside of the two aforementioned games, as far as I can remember. Perhaps a random one over 6 months ago, but at the time it was an isolated incident, and I do not recall the error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Open Hardware Monitor shows seemingly normal values - ~65% load on all CPU cores, ~15% load on memory, 54 degrees (C) GPU temp, 48% load GPU core, and under 30 degrees (C) SSD &amp; HDD temps. Although I do not know if these reset after a restart. I am unable
 to monitor it during game play, although it does not make any more noise or emit any more heat than normal during game play. Given my specs above, neither of these two games should push the system too hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Event Viewer, there seem to be no system errors listed until AFTER the reboot (Critical - The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first...etc.) Please let me know if I can provide any additional info from the system event viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss. I was told by a Microsoft support tech (I called in last week) that the UNEXPECTED STORE EXCEPTION is common with failing or faulty SSDs. However at this point I can't conclusively figure out if this is a hardware or software issue. Other
 than the blue screens during these two games, the system seems to run fine without any problems whatsoever. No performance issues, no other blue screens, nothing out of the ordinary that I can think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, when the problem started increasing (a few weeks after installing Civilization VI), at that time I had checked to make sure all of my drivers were up to date, and they were. I do believe they still are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, and please let me know if I can provide any additional details; I've tried to include everything I could think of. I just want to pinpoint what the issue is so that I can go about fixing it.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your computer should still be under warranty and the system builder as OEM&nbsp;is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. The&nbsp;store should fix it for free. Added you want the issues
 documented by them just in case there are further problems down the road.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I have contacted the store and am awaiting a reply back from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through the blue screen troubleshooting here on the site, and the problem is I cannot get it to create minidumps (or even the large memory dumps), despite ensuring my settings were correct. The blue screen always remains stuck at 0%; the only thing
 I can do is hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On some past occasions, the computer could not recognize my SSD upon reboot, but after a few more reboots it ended up recognizing it and loading Windows properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one other occasion (early on, not during recent crashes), it showed the drive in the BIOS utility but wouldn't allow me to select it as a boot drive. A few restarts mysteriously fixed that too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My most recent 5-6 crashes or so have not had these issues; simply restarting manually after the blue screen takes me to the normal Windows log-in screen, and I can use the computer without issue, except for playing the aforementioned games in my original
 post.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help initially 3 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seems to have come up again very suddenly. I initially solved it by switching out my surge protector (store could not replicate the problem), and had absolutely no problems for over 3 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, out of the blue I've had 3 crashes, all while playing the same game - Civilization VI; two I've hard reset from a grey screen, and one actually went to BSOD with CRITICAL PROCESS DIED as the error type. All three have given me minidumps this time:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, and let me know if I can provide any additional info.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
All the minidumps were essentially the same.<br />
<br />
<div>BugCheck EF, {ffff860a420e4800, 0, 0, 0}</div>
<div>ETW minidump data unavailable<br />
Probably caused by : memory_corruption</div>
<div><br />
No other real help.<br />
<br />
<strong>So the game is likely the cause though it could be hardware or other causes.</strong><br />

displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            <p>Thank you again! I will work my way slowly through the steps you've outlined over the next few weeks. The good news is that aside from the game in question (Civilization VI) the computer seems to run fine at all other times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few follow-up questions:<br />
<br />
1) I have a much larger memory.dmp file which looks like it was created during the last BSOD (824,428KB), would this be more helpful than the minidumps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) As I work my way through possible solutions, if the BSOD keeps happening, do I run the risk of damaging any of my hardware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) What seemed to have fixed the issue between December and my new round of crashes was swapping out the surge protector (power bar). When the store couldn't replicate my issue over several days of testing, they suggested I look at the differences between
 their testing environment and my home setup. The only differences were the power bar, monitor, keyboard, mouse and headset. I started with the power bar and it seemed to have worked, until a few days ago. Does this sound at all like a plausible cause? I don't
 think it's a coincidence, but I'm also at a loss to explain how a power bar could be causing the issue. If not the surge protector itself, could it still be related somehow to the power supply, or even the outlet in my home?<br />
<br />
Thank you, and I will follow up with additional info as I work my way through your troubleshooting guide.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Post the memory dump and I will look at it. Might help, might not and odds say not.<br />
<br />
No, software can only affect a little hardware and that would have to be malicious. Software causes of BSOD do not harm the hardware. If hardware is the cause then it can affect other hardware, so best to resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
Could have been a low power situation which might have returned.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently had a chance to troubleshoot a little more. I'll post as much detail as I can about what I've done, in the hopes that perhaps anyone with more knowledge and experience than me could offer up some insight on what the problem might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before beginning your suggested troubleshooting above, I first again tested the games that were causing me crashes (Fallout 4 and Civilization VI), and I reliably had my system crash within 15 minutes of starting the games, usually in less than 10. The crashes
 only occurred with those games, and I did not get any crashes during any other times (although I did not attempt playing any more-demanding games than those two...however any older games have continued to work perfectly without crashes). None went to an actual
 blue screen, most just froze the system completely, some crashed explorer.exe, and I had to hard reset each time. No minidumps were created. Several times, the computer did not recognize my SSD, or gave me a "Disk Read Error", but restarting once again would
 allow me to boot up Windows normally. After one such crash, I had to run a disk repair, which completed successfully. I did run Samsung Magician several times afterwards and the drive health shows as "Good", which is the highest rating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried unplugging the computer from the surge protector, and plugging it straight into the wall, and the crashes continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset my BIOS settings to default (eliminating the mild overclock I had), and it did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then started with your above advice, attempting to reseat the internal components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reseated the cables going into my power supply, the SATA cable going to my SSD, and reseated my two 8GB chips of RAM. Curiously, they were not in the recommended slots (A2 and B2); rather they were in A1 and B1. I'd read, though, that as long as they are
 in alternating slots, it should be ok. I did move them to the slots recommended in my motherboard's manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is normally in a bedroom upstairs in a new house (2 years old), plugged into what I believe is an AFCI outlet. However at this point while troubleshooting, I was doing this down on my main floor, and decided to plug into the wall (not an AFCI
 to my knowledge) and boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, I did not have a network cable plugged in at this point, and it seemed to cause Windows to take significantly longer to boot up (about 30 seconds, rather than the usual 5 seconds or so, as Windows is on the SSD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to test Fallout 4 for over 30 minutes without an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that night, I have kept the computer down in the living room, plugged straight into the wall (not an AFCI plug), with no surge protector. I've been able to run both Fallout 4 and Civilization 6 multiple times, for several hours, with absolutely no
 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only minor new thing that seems to be happening, is that on Startup (after typing my Windows password), while the Windows logo is shown just before the desktop boots up, I get some minor visual glitches (straight line of 'static' briefly showing below
 the Windows logo). It works absolutely perfectly after the desktop shows up; no visual glitches whatsover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question now is this: Could it be the AFCI power outlet upstairs that is perhaps causing some sort of power issue, which is responsible for all my crashes? The above would seem to suggest that, but I don't have enough knowledge to know if this is a possibility.
 It's important to note that when I sent it back to the store that built my system late last year, they could not replicate the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what perplexes me is that initially when I bought my machine (just over a year ago), I had no problems at all for about 5 months or so. Similarly, after I brought it back from the store (after 3 or 4 days of them not being able to replicate the
 issue), I changed out my surge protector, thinking it might be the problem, and it again worked fine for about 3 months before I started encountering the issue again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, my theory is that either it's the outlet upstairs, or perhaps, because of the months-long gaps between the times when I've had consistent issues, perhaps some component inside the machine is coming loose after a while? This to me is unlikely,
 as there is no vibration at all that I can detect. Furthermore, none of the cables or components felt loose when I was reseating them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must also note that at no point have my temperatures been even remotely high. Even after several hours of Civilization or Fallout 4, none of my components get any hotter than mid-70s celsius.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My plan at the moment is to keep the machine down here for a few days, test it out with the surge protector again, and probably run a 4+hour memory test (though I have no reason to suspect the memory at this point, I guess?). If it all works fine, I will
 bring it back upstairs and perhaps run an extension cord to the hallway, rather than using the AFCI outlet in the bedroom. I'm also thinking of buying a UPS and/or testing the outlet itself to see whether it's supplying power correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, just trying to include as much detail as possible. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Does the SSD have the latest firmware? Check with its maker.<br />
<br />
Heat could still be in play as even a single component could be too sensitive to the normal levels of heat.<br />
<br />
Surge protectors can cause unusual power related situations.<br />
<br />
The upstairs outlet could be involved though it is more likely to be that a (even slightly) lower power level is what is available there. Playing the more intense games could require slightly more power pushing the system into fault. And/or the video card or
 other hardware could be pulling too much power or the PSU is too small for the computer as presently configured. Have you experienced any brown out type issues with other hardware?<br />

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check the SSD firmware tonight. I do know that all my drivers are up to date, including the SSD's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the heat - perhaps, but I have played other games generating similar levels of heat, according to Open Hardware Monitor (Skyrim, for example), and never once encountered a problem in those games, or any other situation where the fans have had to
 spool up for a considerable amount of time. The case itself is significantly bigger than required (I hadn't realized at the time I was purchasing it how big a full-size case was :) ), so there is good airflow at all times (and it's normally on top of a coffee
 table in the upstairs room - no vents are blocked, it's not against a wall or in a corner, etc.). In terms of cooling I have a Corsair H105 liquid cooler.</p>
<p>Regarding the possibility of a single component being sensitive to even normal levels of heat, I suppose I would have had to be seeing crashes outside of the times I've been playing those games, and I have not. I've not encountered a single BSOD outside
 of those two games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During testing, I had also run the machine with the case open to see for myself if any significant heat was being generated, and could not detect any with my hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the surge protector - I have two of them, both seemingly rated for the power supply I'm using (850W). As you know from my above posts, I initially suspected the surge protector, as when I received the machine back from the shop and swapped the
 surge protector for my other one, the problem went away for 3 months. However, I've had the problem occur with the newer surge protector in the upstairs room, as well as with no surge protector at all (plugged straight into the bedroom wall outlet). In order
 to rule it out, I will try using the surge protector in the downstairs living room for the next few days (where so far I've not had any problems).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe the PSU is too small, as it's 850W Gold rated, and considering my specs in the original post, I believe it's probably bigger than necessary. I got it so that I could eventually add another video card, more drives, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the upstairs outlet itself, no, I have not had any other issues with using other devices on it. My monitor has never once flickered, my alarm clock and router are also plugged into it and I'm not encountering any problems with those devices at
 all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'll look at the firmware, as you've suggested, and I'll also look at the electrical plans of my house; I want to confirm whether or not there is actually any difference between the upstairs bedroom outlet and the downstairs ones I've been using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>i dont know if im the only one with this problem. I bought the xbox game pass for PC and wanted to download Metro Exodus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The download runs for almost 5 hours now and im not able to download it. After one minute or sometimes a few seconds the download says that i download with 0 b/s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled my drivers, reinstalled the xbox app, restartet the download multiple times, tested other download packages from other websites (they are working fine), tested it on 3 hard drives but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im sure it comes from the xbox app for PC.</p>

            Did this work for you in the past two days? I've been able to download The Surge and Astroneer so far, but when I tried to download Everspace, the download would stop at 94.0 MB and tell me it needs to be downloaded to the main drive. Though when I did
 change it, the same thing happened.

For me, all games are downloading properly except for Everspace.&nbsp; A friend of mine also tried to download it and had the same problem. I hope there's something wrong with the game's files and we don't need to install it to the main drive, because I won't. It
 would be great if Microsoft let the developers know.

            Ah, ok.I was thinking that there had to be a problem with the game on the XBox app itself. I was looking somewhere on the app I could report the problem, of course the isn't one. I just went and bought Everspace on GOG on sale eventually.

<h2>            error code 0x80072ee7</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer laptop computer and do not normally have internet access at home. I use the laptop mostly for Microsoft Office 365 and to play solitaire. I&nbsp;have been accessing&nbsp;the internet at the local library and sometimes save files onto a flash drive to
 copy to my computer at home. I'm not up on the latest technology and don't want to have any data on the cloud. Recently I checked out a wifi hotspot from the library to try at home. Soon after I connected to the internet via the hotspot, I received a message
 from Microsoft that I needed to update my version of Windows 10. The version I am currently using is 1607, and I didn't really want to update it, and don't remember selecting an "ok" or "update now" button, but I may have. The Windows Update Assistant proceeded
 with the update, but the process didn't complete. I received the error message 0x8072ee7. I've also been&nbsp;getting a notice from Accer that I need to&nbsp;install Acer updates before the other (Windows) update can be completed. I tried selecting&nbsp;&nbsp;the "update" button
 on the Acer screen, and it appeared to want to set me up on the cloud. I definitely don't want that. My problem is that the Windows Update Assistant continues trying to update Windows version 10, and is repeatedly unable to. It is slowing down my computer
 and interfering with my use of the internet (including screens changing sizes, scrolling uncontrollably, and in facebook, selecting posts and videos that I don't want to select, and TV shows that I am trying to watch on abc.com, etc to stop in progress, after
 which they won't restart). Several times I have been notified to restart my computer so the updates will be installed. I tried that and receive a message telling me that Windows is preparing for use and not to turn off the computer. Sometime, after a very
 long time,&nbsp;I receive a notice that the update was not completed. Last night I waited for about an hour with the screen instructing me not to turn off the computer. I finally left the computer on and went to bed. When I woke up this morning, I was back to my
 regular log in screen. Now the update process has started once again. I'm pretty frustrated. All I want is to be able to stop Windows from trying to install the update, so I can connect to a wifi hotspot,&nbsp;to access the&nbsp;internet from home. I'm hoping to get
 another computer within the next year, and expect it to come with the current version of Windows installed. Please tell me how to stop the update process. I'm guessing there is an easy way to cancel the update, but I'm sure unable to find it. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            reset windows 10 deactivated windows</h2>
                    So I was having some issues with my PC that just got progressively worse. Normally I reinstall with the ISO but because that takes so long and I didn't want to take the time blah blah, I decided to let Windows reset my PC and install a 'fresh' version
 via settings. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! Instead of installing a clean version, which it may very well be, in the process it never activated windows which came built in and not as easy as entering a product code. problem-DOES NOT REACTIVATE!!! Solution online says update,
 PROBLEM 2- IT STARTS AND STOPS DOWNLOADING THE PENDING UPDATES ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SO CLEARLY I CAN'T EVEN UPDATE IT!!! I also read the license is tied to your Microsoft account, etc so thought maybe my solution would be there, nope. Because no where on there
 does it says it isn't activated. in fact, it actually lists the current version it is running. Ive been directed to the store to purchase a genuine copy. PROBLEM: HOW ISNT IT GENUINE IF I RESET IT THROUGH THE WINDOWS SETTING AP

    <title>Problem with Wi-Fi internet connection on Windows XP - very - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c0ley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Wi-Fi internet connection on Windows XP - very &#34;slow&#34; packets</h2>
                    Hi folks, this problem has been driving me mad for weeks, so I wonder if anyone can provide a solution! Sorry for the long post, but I've tried to put in as much information as I can.<br />
<br />
In short, I decided to rebuild an old (2006) Windows XP laptop I have (latest updates installed). I'm without audio (can't find the drivers) but that isn't so much of a problem. The problem is connecting to WiFi.<br />
<br />
The internal WiFi card is an Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2200BG (or, at least, that's the driver).<br />
<br />
WiFi is shown as "Connected" and "Signal Strength: Excellent" (as my laptop is sitting right beside the hub). Ethernet (wired) connection to the hub works perfectly. I have BT WiFi which works connects perfectly with my Mac and my iPod, so I know there is absolutely
 no problem with the router.<br />
<br />
However, my laptop does not seem to want to connect to WiFi, despite the "positive" messages shown above. All browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox) display a message stating that they cannot connect to the internet. Nothing in the browsers would suggest any DNS settings
 have been changed.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">I *think* the problem might be because the sent/received packets remain very low - if either get into three figures, I'm very lucky. At the moment, they are stuck on Sent = 14, Received = 3.</span><br />
<br />
So, what I've checked/tried is the following (all based on Google searching) - none have worked:<br />
<br />
1) I can confirm that Wireless Zero Configuration is on, started, and set to automatic, and that Windows is used to configure my network settings.<br />
2) My wireless network shows up in my preferred networks, and is connected to automatically (or should be :-) ) - I've added/removed the connection many times, checking the wireless key each time, to no avail.<br />
3) The TCP/IP menu is set up to obtain both an IP address and a DNS service automatically.<br />
4) Typing ipconfig /all at the command prompt seems to show that everything is working OK:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Physical address is: 00-16-xx-xx-xx-xx (I've removed the last few digits as this is an open forum, but probably isn't a security issue)</li><li>DHCP is enabled.</li><li>Autoconfiguration is enabled.</li><li>IP address is 192.xxx.x.xx (as above)</li><li>Subnet mask is 255.255.255.0</li><li>Default gateway, DHCP server and DNS Servers are all 192.xxx.x.xxx (as above)</li></ul>
<br />
However, IP routing is NOT enabled, nor is WINS Proxy. Node type is shown as Unknown.<br />
<br />
I've tried flushing the DNS, resetting the IP in the command line (can't remember the command), everything I can think of, or have found via an internet search.<br />
<br />
I've also tried two separate USB wireless sticks (installing only the drivers - now removed), neither of which worked either.<br />
<br />
So, am I right to think that everything appears OK, apart from the very low packet transfer? Anyone got any other checks I can try - or better still, a potential solution?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div><br />
<div>Have you tried changing the wireless channel that your router is operating at? There may be wireless interference that could be preventing the internet connection:</div>

    <title>My Windows 8 Pro Product Key Did not work for Activating My Copy of - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Windows 8 Pro Product Key Did not work for Activating My Copy of Windows 8 Pro</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 8 Product Key Didn't work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: &nbsp;Yesterday&nbsp;I purchased a brand new clean virgin hard drive and I purchased Windows 8 Pro at a local Big Box store. This is a full copy. Not an upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: &nbsp;I removed all other HDD's from my system and installed Windows 8 on the new Hard Drive. The installation asked for the Product key. I entered it and everything installed perfectly. Windows works great. I Love it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3 However, When I went to "activate" my copy of Windows&nbsp; 8 and I enter that SAME product key I used to install I get the following message "This key didn't work. Please check it and try again or try a different key." I repeated this step at least 4
 different times after rebooting. Still will not accept it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: I cannot activate my brand new copy of Windows 8. How can it accept my key for installation and then NOT accept it for the activation???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!!</p>

            <p>The Problem Has Been Solved !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: I called Microsoft support (800) MICRSOFT</p>
<p>Step 2: I Navigate through all the voice menus to tech Support for Windows 8 installation</p>
<p>Step 3: I Explained the problem to the tech (Jerry)</p>
<p>Step 4: The tech had me find the&nbsp;search function and he had me search for a 4-letter function (I forget the command). I executed the function and I got to a screen which asked me to enter a code from the Microsoft Technical professional. I entered the 8
 digit code that the tech provided to me. </p>
<p>Step 5: I arrive at a new screen and the tech (Jerry) explains that I am activated.</p>
<p>Step 6: I reboot my PC and I go to the "System" page under the control panel and it indicates that my copy of Windows 8 is activated!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tech&nbsp;explains that my copy of windows is an "upgrade version" (its NOT) and that was the reason that I had the trouble. I explained repeatedly that it was a FULL Copy.&nbsp; I finally gave up as my Windows 8 was activated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call Tech support and good luck!</p>

    <title>Windows 7 browsers unable to resolve domain names - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kent_l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 browsers unable to resolve domain names</h2>
                    A few days ago a client's laptop just stopped connecting to the internet via the browser.<br />
The laptop is a Dell that is only about a month old running Windows 7 with no software other than firefox&nbsp; that isn't Microsoft's. All the lady does is browse the web and get eMail so she has no inclination to add any more software.<br />
<br />
When she got it, she called me to set-up her network which includes an HP printer and her computer on a wireless network with a D-Link router.<br />
<br />
I uninstalled Norton (through add/remove programs) and installed Microsoft Security Essentials.<br />
I also installed Firefox (although she only uses IE).<br />
<br />
I also set-up the network and everything was fine running perfect until 3 days ago when she couldn't connect to the internet through IE.<br />
<br />
She called SHAW Cable Support who monitored the connection, saw her router was getting an IP and communicating but had no idea why she couldn't connect so she called me.<br />
<br />
Typing any domain name into either Firefox or IE would not connect, (Site could not be found)<br />
IPCONFIG is good. Has been released/renewed, and I even tried changing the DNS server from the gateway to the ISPs<br />
In all cases NSLOOKUP, PING, TRACEROUTE are able to resolve the domain name and return the IP.<br />
The DNS client is running.<br />
Neither browser can resolve domain names.<br />
Both browsers work fine if I enter the IP address, the problem is with name resolution.<br />
<br />
I thought it might be remnants of Norton left on the system so I used Norton's own 'Complete Removal' system to remove all traces.<br />
It left no files/folders/registry entries and indicated success.<br />
After a reboot... still same problem.<br />
<br />
Windows network diagnostics indicates that it cannot find the problem.<br />
<br />
I verified that no proxy was selected.<br />
I disabled Microsoft's firewall.. problem still present after reboot.<br />
I checked the HOSTS file.. intact but no entries.<br />
&nbsp;* I actually tried adding an entry for google.com into hosts to see if that would work but it didn't.<br />
I tried booting in safe mode with networking.. still no name resolving on either browser.<br />
I reset winsock (netsh winsock reset)... that did not fix the problem.<br />
I thought maybe IPv6 problem, disabled that protocol.. no change, problem still there.<br />
I also toggled network.dns.disableIPv6 in Firefox's about:config screen and tried that to ensure IPv6 was not the problem... no change<br />
I flushed the DNS 'ipconfig /flushdns' several times through this and at no time did it make a difference.<br />
<br />
I rolled back to before the last update (at which point the system was working) and still have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Other than re-installing Windows which means I would have to set up the network and MSSecurity again, I have no ideas.<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            <p>Hi Kent_L,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to open Microsoft website by typing the IP address in the address bar and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></b>Open
<b>Internet Explorer</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type the following in the address bar and press
<b>Enter</b></p>
<p><b>207.46.19.190</b></p>
<p>If it displays <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.microsoft.com</a> website then you may have to contact the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to reset DNS settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

            Of course it connects to Microsoft.<br />
And I can ping Microsoft using the domain name which resolves correctly so it isn't a dns server issue.<br />
Windows 7 resolver is working... for everything except browsers... well' and eMail<br />
All command line tools work as expected.<br />
All GUI applications (IE, Outlook, Firefox) are failing to resolve domain names.<br />
<br />
All other computers on the net are having no issues.<br />
<br />
That would seem to be a problem with the stack but I reset that with no effect.<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
It looks like the simplest solution to this problem is ripping out the Win7 network completely and letting it re-install.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it's time consuming to set-up the network again and if I don't find the problem there is nothing to prevent it from happening again.<br />

            I realize this is an old post, and I'm sure (or hope) that you've fixed the issue but, for others still trying to fix this problem, what FINALLY solved my problem with resolving domain names into IP addresses was that, somehow, my computer's name (while
 in Win7) had been erased. &nbsp;I re-entered the original name I gave it and, voila! - it works! &nbsp;I can now completely access the internet, again! &nbsp;So, to sum up, right-click the "Computer" icon, left-click "Properties". &nbsp;Select "Computer Name" and see if there's
 anything in that field. &nbsp;If not, enter something, click "Apply" and click "OK" to reboot the system. &nbsp;Hopefully this will solve your issue, too. &nbsp;Good luck and good hunting!

            <p>As of 5 minutes ago I went to check on my local host file and the only thing I found that was modified recently was a file call host.ics which appeared to be some icalendar.&nbsp; I looked at the file and found ip's that didn't match.&nbsp; I didn't want to removed
 the file temporaly incase the file was needed.&nbsp; As soon as I removed the file I was able to resolve both bing.com and google.com which were not working unless I used their ip's in the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem was only noticed in browsers.&nbsp; I was not able to resolve dns names but the IP would work.&nbsp; I was able to temporary fix the problem by run command prompt as an admin and flushing the dns(ipconfig /flushdns).&nbsp; I will report back later if problem
 continues.</p>

    <title>Creating a batch file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating a batch file</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am starting to create a batch file to perform multiple actions, however I am having a few issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How can I centre and underline the text I have at the top of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.G.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@echo off</p>
<p>Echo.</p>
<p>Echo Sam Batch file</p>
<p>Echo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I am going to have a few multiple choice questions to start with. How do I make each question and answer&nbsp; different colour</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.G.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you need help with?&nbsp;&gt;&gt; I would like this be double underlined as well as bold (prefer ally a different color)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Network</p>
<p>2) Security</p>
<p>3) Tools</p>
<p>4) Image</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each option above I would like to be different colour to the question. e.g. The&nbsp;Title "Sam Batch file" in red, the multiple questions in&nbsp;purple, the 4 attentional&nbsp;answers in blue &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I create another multiple choice after you select the first option, I would like this to be a different colour too. However this just keeps lopping and I don't understand why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a continuous loop, when I go choose 1) Network and then 1a = Ipconfig, however how do I make it stop after a single run?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be quite nice to have a GUI side to this script, however not sure how this would work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like all text to be neatly layed out, so it is nice to read</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also be writing all actions to a txt file (or a protected CSV if possible)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is possible I would like to create&nbsp;a Documentation and a separate choice at the end, where they can request help. I would like the help request to be sent to a mailbox (Encrypted). And the documentation stored in a network / cloud location)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the documentation form, I would like have a&nbsp;multiple text boxes stating what the documentation contains, what type&nbsp;sector, what operating system, the subject, the creator (automatically populated from their username / full name)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like the information to be saved to my Office 365 SharePoint really rather than on site, however I have no idea how SSL certificates would work with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to run Image commands, e.g. Capture, Import, Edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I would also make it a boot command?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use a batch file is it easy to run Powershell commands?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what / if is possible.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;haven't ever made a PowerShell script, so that's all pretty new&nbsp;to me. However if anyone could help / has any advice</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<br />I'm a C# developer, so I may be impartial. For what you're doing, I think a meager PowerShell script cannot do for the GUI side of things, and C# and the VS toolkit can do both a GUI application and console application.
<br />
<br />Visual Studio 2017 is personally my route to go to if you want to build a GUI based application, which is called a Windows Forms Application, or you could also do a Windows Presentation Foundation based application (although the former is easier to get around), although you will have to get used to a new language, C#, either way.
<br />
<br />I realize it would be taxing to learn a new language and get familiar with a new workflow, but for me personally, I think since you're on a fresh slate here, this would be perfect to start off with a versatile and powerful language.
<br />
<br />If you're interested, here is Visual Studio 2017 Community (free version, all you need is your Microsoft account): <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/</a>
<br />
<br />If you decide to go on this path with your scripting/programming endeavors, please do feel free to send me a personal message on Microsoft Community, so in the event that you need help with something C# or Visual Studio related, I will be able to assist. 
<br />
<br />Fortunately though, there is a wealth of information out there that can get you up to speed, like on YouTube or Stack Overflow (which helped me gain traction in my understanding), but again, I'm at a stone's throw.
<br />
<br />That's my two cents, though. I wish you luck on your prospect.

            You can do a lot of what you want in a "DOS" / Batch file, including some of the color requirements, but DOS is pretty basic.  Writing PowerShell code is essentially the same as a Batch file, just a different, more complex set of commands.
<br />
<br />Just to confirm, you are trying to create on only applet that prompts user for some imput then outputs
<br />
<br />PowerShell is a lot more powerful than DOS and should be able to do everything you need, so I disagree with Ethan's suggestion of going to C. Sure it is an option, but requires installing a new programming language, it is probably overkill for what you want to do and PowerShell is free.
<br />
<br />Your overall question is too big to answer. Either break it up into smaller pieces or do your own research.  Here are some links to get you started:

<br />PowerShell is a shell language by nature. This means it was designed for the command-line. 95% of the PowerShell scripts you are building today are most likely executed from the PowerShell console in some way. However, did you realize that you can build professional-looking GUIs from within PowerShell?   I’d like to over some considerations of when you might choose to create a GUI rather than a command-line tool.
<br />
<br />Definitely take a look at this series of articles. It will probably answer many of your questions:

<br />Scripting is one thing, but to make your tools really pop, you’ll eventually want to build your own Graphical User Interface for end-users to use, especially those who might be frightened of using a scripting environment like PowerShell. In this series, I’ll take you step by step, from creating a GUI using built-in .net methods like System.Windows.Forms to the super quick, super effective XAML/WPF approach, using Visual Studio. As time goes on and I post more and more about GUI Toolmaking, this post will always be updated with the newest links

<br />It is very easy to get a lot of information out of PowerShell. But sometimes it isn't as easy to get it where it needs to be. One solution is e-mail. Everyone has it so why not send data pulled from PowerShell via an e-mail message? It is very easy with the Send-MailMessage cmdlet. These are plain text messages

<br />In this article, you’ll learn what Markdown is, how to use it, and why it’s an important tool for the PowerShell administrative scripter.
<br />Back in 2004, a blogger named John Gruber wrote a Perl script called Markdown that automated text-to-HTML conversions for web content creators. John released Markdown under a BSD-style open-source license.
<br />The good news is that we PowerShell administrative scripters can easily add Markdown syntax to our toolset and make good use of the language on GitHub.

            Hello Zasjb,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post.&nbsp; In order to copy your DVD's to your hard drive, you will need to download a DVD Ripper.&nbsp; They are easily found, some are free and some cost money (about $35).&nbsp; Most will give you an option to try them out for free for a period of time.&nbsp;
 All you need to do is type "download DVD Ripper" into your favorite search engine and you will generate quite a list of software.&nbsp; You can also go to
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/windows/</a>&nbsp;and type "download DVD Ripper".&nbsp; Let us know if you have any more questions.<br />
<br />
Cheers

            <p><span>Hi Louise,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The error code you are getting can be broken down to two causes.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through,
 unless specifically told not to do so.</span></p>
