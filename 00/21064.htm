<h2>            Visio 2007 installation with Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I have recently gotten a new PC and installed Office 2013.&nbsp; When I went to install Visio 2007 upgrade&nbsp;that was on my old PC it does not find Office 2013 to let me install.&nbsp; When I place an office 2003, 2007, or 2013 DVD in the drive, and select it from the
 browse button it still does not find the file path&nbsp;it is looking for to do its verification.&nbsp; I do not wish to buy another visio.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If we need to install the multiple versions of Office on the same PC. It’s important to always install earlier versions of Office first.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/install-and-use-multiple-versions-of-office-on-the-same-pc-HA103981695.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/install-and-use-multiple-versions-of-office-on-the-same-pc-HA103981695.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, if your Office 2013 is 64bit version, you can't install the Visio 2007 32bit version&nbsp;in the same PC.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Same hotmail account synced to two computers shows different items on each computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same hotmail account synced to two different computers via exchange activesync in outlook 2013. I would expect that the synced inbox and other folders would all have the same number of total and unread e-mails. but I am seeng that they are different
 on the two computers. What's more, each computer is also different from what I see when I log on to the account on the web via a browser - this shows me a third version!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me nuts1 Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. Thank you for reporting this issue to us.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based from what you've posted, you have a Microsoft account synced to Outlook 2013 (EAS protocol) in 2 different computers. Now, you are seeing different total number of emails from each computer and when you login to Outlook.com web.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is not a normal behavior, we need to investigate this issue. For that, we need to ask for the screenshots of your mailbox of Outlook 2013&nbsp;in each computer and the mailbox of your Outlook.com web account.

<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa - slow down there folks! I appreciate your efforts and guidance but where is the diagnosis? What came out of the information I sent you? Can you help me figure out why/how this is happening? If we don't know why it happened now - how can
 you be sure it won't happen again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do&nbsp;you mean by "reconfiguring" the account? Are you asking me to REMOVE the account and then add it back in? Isn't that a little like killing the patient and getting a new one because you cannot diagnose what's wrong with him/her?&nbsp;There is a good chance
 I may lose e-mails if I follow your&nbsp;recommendation&nbsp;as it appears the server does not have all the e-mails I have in the Office Outlook acocunt.&nbsp;The steps in the article you sent are not new to me - this how the current accounts were added. So why would it
 be different this time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We really need to find out why/how this happened. Can you please help me with that? I have hundreds of e-mails just in the inbox and thousands if you include other folders. Can you suggest a tool I could use to compare the e-mails on the two computers and
 the web interface and identify the ones which are NOT common? Any other less drastic measures you can recommend?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

DocMelVis,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to read your thread and I understand that you do not want to reconfigure your account in Outlook 2013 as you might lose some of your emails there and we totally understand that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, we strongly suggest that you try configuring your account to another device or another email program like Windows Live Mail and compare the number of emails there from your Outlook 2013 and Outlook.com. Once done, we would need the screenshot
 of the email program indicating the number of emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would also be helpful if you can provide us the most recent screenshots of&nbsp;your account in&nbsp;Outlook 2013 and Outlook.com so we can check this closely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, please post the needed information in our private messaging area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We totally appreciate your effort and cooperation in this. Don't worry as our team will do our best to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and have a nice day ahead!</p>

            <p>OK I followed your suggestion above and newly configured the same account in a different program - Windows Live Mail. Please see the private area where I have attached screenshots of the results. What I saw was that the total as well as unread e-mails in
 Outlook.com and WLM match for all folders - except one. The exception is a folder called "Action". For this one, the number of unread e-mails matches (1395)&nbsp;but the TOTAL number does not. The Outlook Web file is again the Outlook.com screenshot. This one does
 not directly give the total number, but I calculated it as TOTAL = 128 pages x 35 e-mails per page + 15 e-mails on the last page (129) = 4495 e-mails. You can see the number of pages as well as the number of e-mails on the last page (all are selected) in the
 screenshot. Now if you go to the Outlook Windows Live Mail screenshot, at the bottom right you can see that the total number of messages is only 4494 - so one message is missing in this case. I think this is a good example to troubleshoot as the difference
 is only one e-mail. Problem is, how can we identify this one missing e-mail from a total of over 4,000!? I really don't want to go through all of them manually. Any ideas on how to quickly identify the missing e-mail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Folks, I really think the key here is to find the SOURCE/REASON for these discrepancies rather than just go reconfiguring account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have given you full detail here and presented a very specific issue. Please help me find out what is going wrong here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi DocMelVis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen the latest screenshots that you have uploaded and based on your post, those figure are correct and indeed, there is a single email that is missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this regard, please check out the screenshot of your Outlook.com. You will see that there is a link&nbsp;"<strong>Select everything</strong>". Doing so, you do not need to compute for how many emails you have in that specific folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for us to check whether the web based Outlook.com and the Windows Live Mail are&nbsp;not showing the correct figure/s, it would be best that you try to recreate this issue. Please try these:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On the web based Outlook.com, go to your <strong>Actions folder, </strong>then do the same steps for you to be able to click the "<strong>Select everything</strong>". Remember the total number of emails.</p>
<p>2. Go to your Windows Live Mail, then also remember the total number of emails in the
<strong>Action folder.</strong></p>
<p>3. Go back to your Outlook.com, then try to&nbsp;delete three emails. Doing so, the total number of emails should be lessen by 3 emails.</p>
<p>4. Go to your Windows Live Mail. Sign out from there, then sign back in. Now, check the total number of emails if it is consistent on the Outlook.com.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope these helps. And should you have questions regarding the content of my post, please do not hesitate to email us back so we can answer them for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>That should be click on Send/receive.</p>
<p>Signing in determines what contacts and calendar are used.&nbsp; Signing in has nothing to do with syncing emails and folders.&nbsp; Folders and emails will sync without signing in.</p>

                    <p>I play music using Media Player Classic Home Cinema (best media player ever btw). I have all audio and video files associated with it, so I can double click any WAV, MP3, OGG file and play them with MPCHC. No problems here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I try to&nbsp;'run'&nbsp;one of these formats associated with mpchc&nbsp;from the Run command (win+R), this window appears:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe5358f4-092e-44d7-83f7-3dd95ff33423" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have some questions about that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>Why is that writing the name of a file from RUN is not the same as double clicking it???</strong></p>
<p>- Even if a click OK, nothing happens, mpchc doesn't start. But if it is an mp3 file and I choose another app (like WMP), it works.</p>
<p>- That checkbox to always use this app does nothing, this dialog appears anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that this is a problem with the file association made by MPCHC, but maybe you can take a look at this too, because, I repeat, if I double click works OK.</p>

            <p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to open a file from Run window by typing&nbsp;the filename?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typing the&nbsp;filename&nbsp;will not open it in Run window.&nbsp;Specific command exists to open the file/application for example to open a simple application like Word you have to type winword.exe , this depends on the executable file name for the particular application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please get back to us with more information to understand the issue better.&nbsp;</p>

            Yeah, It works with other file formats. If I write the name of any file inside any folder listed in PATH, it opens with the default app. It worked in previous versions of windows and it works in Windows 10, but not for files opening with media player classic.
 It is a very strange issue, that's why I say that you should take a look.<br />

<p>Hi Valerie, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It’s possible that the installation component of the program is corrupted, that’s why it can’t change the application as the default. For us to better assist you, please answer the questions below:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How many Office programs installed on your computer? To find out, go to the <strong>
Control</strong> <strong>Panel </strong>&gt; <strong>Programs </strong>&gt; <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.
</li><li>Which version of Office is installed on the computer? to get this information, open
<strong>PowerPoint </strong>&gt; <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Account </strong>&gt;<strong> Product Information</strong>.
</li><li>Is this happening to other Office files like in Word and Excel? <span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you perform an online repair for Office to fix missing and corrupted installation components. To do this, check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for the proper procedures on how this can be done accordingly. </p>

<h2>            Critical Error &#40;&#34;Start Menu and Cortana aren&#39;t working&#34; after linking Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>After updating to the most recent build (Windows 10 Pro)&nbsp;via auto-update,&nbsp;I regained functionality that I had lost (Xbox and Microsoft Store weren't opening).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to link my Microsoft account with my local user account, and was once again met with the "Critical Error - Cortana and Start Menu aren't working - Sign Out Now" message that's plaguing users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched around and it seems most of the conversations have gone stale with no known solution and reps telling people to start a new question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here I am, and I want to know that Microsoft is aware of the issue and working on a fix. Yes, I've tied sfc /scannow and it reports everything is fine, re-installs and repairs don't help, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a new known solution? Or is there a fix coming soon? </p>

</p><p>I read the instructions in the link you gave, but I think there's something not lining up. When I go to my Account Overview (following the link in the instructions) there is no "Permissions" on that that page. Even hunting around through the Overview's contents,
 nothing seems to line up with Permissions or Manage Accounts, so I can't follow step 2 of the process.&nbsp;</p>

            I have had this issue since ages and the only suggestions people come up with is very lame, really. Anil, your reply is good for Windows 8 only, for windows 10, it sends you in a deadlock situation once you link your Microsoft Account. I am not trying
 to sound rude but only suggest here if you are sure of something please, as I have been really frustrated and this bug will be the main factor for Windows 10 if Microsoft doesn't address it soon enough.&nbsp;

Thank you for the reply. I tried it by deleting the web credentials also but I still have the same issue.

            <p>I'm not Doleary, but I am the OP, experiencing the same issues as Doleary, Jessen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course we're on the newest build (I state so in the first line of the original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's boil this down, linking our Microsoft account to Windows 10 installs is breaking our profiles. Think about that for a second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is almost out for commercial application. Is this going to be fixed or what? I need to know so I can revert to Windows 7 for good if need be. I understand we're on test builds and what not, but this isn't exactly a "fringe" bug, is it? Tons of
 users are having problems with core functionality. I can't use Cortana or enjoy other key benefits of Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want to know is that there is a fix coming. Things like, "oh, did you update to the newest version?" or "Did you try not using the function you're having an issue with?" are very basic and frustrating replies to get from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm asking pointed questions and would appreciate a reply, even if that reply is "We can't discuss that."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            hanging and crashing lumia 635 on W10</h2>
                    my phone hangs forever sometimes, its quite annoying. It happens maybe 6x a day, and on different applications. I have one-third memory left on the SDI card, and one-third on the device as well. I'm on the windows insider program-- slow, with update 10.0.10586.164.
 Perhaps the 512 MB Ram is too weak? i like W10, but should i go back to W8.1?&nbsp;

<h2>            Muting Songs in Groove Music Playlist</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the latest builds of Groove Music states that you can mute songs in a playlist (which forces the program to skip over that song--for example, one that is no longer available in the category--when you play the list).&nbsp; I have yet to figure out how to
 do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea of how to do this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Short answer: you get and use an earlier version of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are Office components and work with the version of Office (Word) for which they were designed. They are not stand-alone programs.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is called "innovation" or perhaps "marketing." If the new version is the same as the old one, why buy? Look online for the screams heard with the introduction of the Ribbon interface. What is an improvement for one user (or corporate buyer) is a nightmare
 for another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know of anything inferior about the spellchecker in Word 2013 other than the lack of a link to adding solutions to AutoCorrect in the right-click menu.</p>

            The loss of the 'undo" button in the spellchecker is a major step backwards.&nbsp; If you use the "undo" keyboard shortcut, it stops spellcheck and forces you to resume it. All a massive productivity killer.

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I used to use that button regularly. Removing it was ridiculous. And yes there are other retrograde steps with the new spell checker.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The buttons no longer line up as they used to, so you have to jump around with the mouse (and your eyes) a lot more.&nbsp;
</li><li>It's not as easy now to see what the spell checker is indicating - the layout is not as user-friendly as it used to be.
</li><li>Errors are no longer shown in in context in the spell checker box.</li><li>Ignore Rule has disappeared.</li><li>The Options link has disappeared.</li><li>The buttons move around and appear/disappear, depending on what's showing. This is never a good thing. Clever, but not good.</li><li>The description of the error sometimes appears above the box and sometimes below. Where do you look?</li><li>Descriptions are sometimes less descriptive; eg, if there's an extra space between words, 2003 says exactly that. In 2013, it just says 'space between words'. So you look below to see what's up, and get a very polite - BUT WORDY - explanation of what may
 be the problem! All they had to do was add the word 'extra' to the original description. If that wasn't the exact problem, we can probably work it out.</li><li>In the document itself, it has often become very difficult to see the item that the spell checker is referring to (particularly if it is something small, like a punctuation mark) - the error now has a grey background, which often blends in with Word's other
 'helpful' greys, whereas the error background used to be black with white text - much clearer.&nbsp; I know I should be terribly distracted by that awful black, but I have managed to live with it in the past, buoyed by the knowledge that I could actually see it.</li></ul>
<p>It now takes quite a bit longer to run through the spell checker - I write reports that are around 10 000 words each.&nbsp; Great 'innovation' or 'marketing'! You asked: why buy if the new version is the same as the old. If you had an old, sharp saw, would you
 buy a new blunt saw, or keep using the old one. You only buy something new if it's better... or if what you had is taken from you (there's the rub).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the ribbon, that's an absolute disaster! It's harder to find things, more eye and mouse movement is required to use it, it requires more mouse clicks, it takes up more of the page, and you can't bring useful toolbars down onto the page, as you used
 to be able to. Yes, I'm one of those screaming about it. I'm like the frog put in hot water - I jumped straight from Word 2003 to 2013. No gradual introduction to all the lost features. I can see everything that's now wrong. it sticks out like my now overused
 sore thumb!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's so much wrong with the new Word that I have reinstalled Word 2003 and do most of my work in that. Unfortunately, others have to work with my documents also, so I have to eventually save in Word 2013 format, and do some work in that too.</p>

            <p>GCWesq lists all the reasons why I dislike the new spell-checking pane. The biggest gripe for me is the amount of eye-travel that's needed to look from the pane, to the context, then back again. Plus the fact that letters which are underlined in the pane
 don't work like traditional keyboard shortcuts with the Alt key, meaning I have to keep using the mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, I asked about the shortcuts in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/can-i-use-keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-word-2013/47dca017-528f-4c1d-a755-b786479a83d2">
another thread</a> , and received a really helpful reply with a macro I have now added the Word template, which invokes the old spell-checker when I press F7. It's the old familiar dialogue box with all the options that have been stripped out of the new text
 correction pane, it appears closer to the text in question, complete with a context box, and the keyboard shortcuts work the way I expect. It's so much quicker to use than the new version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft reinstated the start button and a "boot to desktop" option in Windows 8.1 for those users who complained. It would be nice if they could bring back the old spell-checking window (even if it's just as an option) in Word.</p>

<h2>            Send To OneNote Printer is missing - Repair and Reinstall didn&#39;t help</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since today I'm missing my "Send to OneNote" Printer, a function I used to work with a lot (Win 8.1). First I couldn't use the function, getting the information the printer wound't be installed correctly. Repair or reinstall Office 365 didn't work. So I
 deleted the printer to create a new one, like shown in other discussions. But creating a new printer isn't possible, because doing so I'm told, that the driver (Generic Printer Text Only also tried as One Note Printer 2015) wasn't found on my PC ("Haupttreiberpaket
 nicht gefunden", in English this should be something like "installation media not found").
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I took a backup from before the time I deleted the printer (and pushed in some Windows updates which may be responsible for this mess) but even then nothing changed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas here? So on another PC (WIN 7) it workes perfectly. Maybe I could take the driver from there, what do you think? But on the other hand these drivers are also found under C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\OneNote on the Win 8 machine.
 Chosing them brings the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like I need a new installation. :-/</p>

            <p>Thank you a lot for this complex answer! The clean removal of office would be the next thing to try. I'm pretty sure this should work too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand I got it working now! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I realized later that there could be a problem with my windows drivers in general. Everytime I touched a printer driver or tried to install a printer&nbsp;the same error occured. So&nbsp;it seems legit that&nbsp;the office repair wasn't sucessfull to create a
 new printer as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to repair my windows&nbsp;without installing all my programs&nbsp;again, following this link (<a href="https://www.winhelp.us/non-destructive-reinstall-of-windows-8-and-8-1.html)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.winhelp.us/non-destructive-reinstall-of-windows-8-and-8-1.html).</a>
 This might be helpful for other users too. Basically you upgrade your windows to 8.1, even if it is 8.1 already. So you&nbsp; got a fresh windows (with all the drivers form Microsoft) keeping everything else (except for other drivers which you&nbsp;might have to install
 again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I repaired office agian (offline) and tada: the one note printer is back!&nbsp;:-)</p>

            Hello. No, there is no Windows Phone 7 ROM for the Omnia. The hardware will not support it. Windows Mobile can dual boot android. The Omnia is an older device and you would have to see if a functional android ROM was ever developed for it. The best place
 to see is xda-developers.com and look around on that site. I think you are trying to access Windows Mobile Marketplace, which was closed earlier this year. You will have to get Windows Mobile apps on the web. Some places are freewarepocketpc.net, handango.comm,
 and handster.com.

<h2>            Minimum Age Requirement for Office 365 for Students</h2>
                    <p>I had my 5th grade class try to sign up for Office 365 for Students.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of them were successful, and others received a message saying that they didn't meet the age requirement.&nbsp; What's very odd is that some of the ones who were successful are YOUNGER
 than some of the ones who were told they didn't meet the age requirement.&nbsp; Is there, in fact, an age requirement?&nbsp; Why would younger students successfully sign up?&nbsp; I've researched this topic on the Community, and I see posts that say the minimum age requirement
 is 13, but our experience doesn't make sense.&nbsp; I'd be grateful for any insights anyone can offer.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>It is a great new feature of PPT 2010 - now with 'Freeform' lines you can hold down the shift key and draw perfect lines - 180 degrees, 90 degrees &amp; 45 degrees. Much cleaner.</p>

                    <p>Not a fan of the New GUI for Windows 10:</p>
<p>Why is Microsoft trying to stop any resemblance to the&nbsp;Windows 7 Start menu? They had a winner with the original tech preview of 10. It was very customizable. This latest update took all that away. Why is Microsoft so stubbornly hanging on to their opinion
 that Windows 8 is Likeable? IT'S NOT!&nbsp;And, what is with the search assistant? Didn't Microsoft learn their lesson with "Bob"? As much as I am not a big fan of Apple, one thing that Apple understands is that "people" "Computer Users" don't like a steep learning
 curve. The original Tech Preview was a winner, this new change is a LOSER.</p>

            I agree. <br />
<br />
Looks really ugly and flat. Looks like going back to when computers had to look this ugly because of lack of CPU and mem power.<br />

Things looking nice is a big part of what I pay for.<br />

Having to pay for something that looks this ugly, that I have to stare at for 12 hours a day, every day, makes me shiver.<br />

 the symbols weren't fast enough, I could use the Smart Menu's search (withOUT the web!).&nbsp; What a nice mix of options!&nbsp;I overcame my bias of preferring the traditional XP/7 Start Menu and found the newer approach to&nbsp;be productive and intiuitive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 9926 has taken that away. One of Window's hallmarks over the last two decades has been user-level UI customization. Ouch, 9926, at least with respect to the Start Menu, is a regression.&nbsp; Microsoft, please go back to the design philosophy of 9879's
 Start Menu. You were making real progress at that juncture.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just for the sake of clarity - what exactly is it that you want to accomplish at the end of the day? The operating system in use has no bearing on any of this whether in reference to accessing Outlook.com via your browser or using any version of Outlook
 (desktop) - member of the Office suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without knowing anything else - there's no such thing as "updating" from the browser version to the desktop "client" version. Just need to configure the &lt;email account&gt; so answer to your question: "No you will not lose any content contained in your &lt;email
 account&gt; when adding the &lt;Email Account&gt; to the Outlook &lt;email client&gt;"</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is bearing, the Outlook web browser version does not have the following ribbon across the top, no file tab, no account, etc., so I can't follow the steps below: &nbsp;It's that simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
Open Outlook, and on the&nbsp;<span>File</span>&nbsp;tab, choose&nbsp;<span>Account Settings</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Account Settings</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Data
 Files</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
On the&nbsp;<span>Data Files</span>&nbsp;tab, you'll see the location of the .ost file and can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
Accept the offline Outlook Data File (.ost) location that appears in the&nbsp;<span>Location</span>&nbsp;column for the Exchange account.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
or</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
Change the location—for example, pick a different folder—where the offline Outlook Data File (.ost) file is to be saved.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Again, as I tried to explain previously in another question: &nbsp;The Outlook version I have does not have the ribbon toolbar across the top with the file, account, etc. so I can't transfer the easy way. &nbsp;I was told because I have the Outlook browser version,
 I would have to do it this way:&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">drive</span></em><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook;
 &nbsp; &nbsp;however, I went to find this in on C:\drive, opening up windows folder and couldn't find anything. &nbsp;I also pasted this the in the address bar.
</span>&nbsp;I even copied this to the lower bottom left side bar in ask me anything and of course that didn't work; Microsoft community also told me that I can't transfer data from Outlook.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">All I want to do is to move/export my folders to my external hard drive.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Thanks Confused.</span></p>

</p><p>I have no idea from where your original post in this thread was moved from or by whom so have no context to go by as to what the original thread was all about or why it was moved to this forum without adding the explanation at the end of this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me simplify this</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - This forum is for Outlook (desktop) which is part of the Office suite and therefore</p>
<p>#2 - The instructions apply to Outlook (desktop - any version) and have nothing to do with using Outlook.com via WebMail (your browser)</p>
<p>#3 - As far as I know, there is no option to export mail folders in Outlook.com but honestly, don't really use Outlook.com via a browser so will gladly stand corrected (you can export your contacts to a .csv file using your web browser)</p>
<p>#4 - So in short, this thread belongs in the Outlook.com forum and if</p>
<p>#5 - It was incorrectly moved by someone - my apologies&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you want to export your Outlook.com account to a PST file, you will need to configure the account in the Outlook desktop &lt;email client&gt; and then follow the instructions already provided. If you do not currently own any Office suite - you cannot export
 your Outlook.com account.</p>

            Hi Daniel
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />They are slowly rolling out the new icons. 
<br />
<br />Access and Publisher just got them. Visio and Project should follow soon, it will likely be a silent update too. So, no idea when you might see them.
        </p>

<p>Yes, they probably will. But for some reason MS is just putting around with the task, rolling out a couple of icons at a time. I don't understand what is taking them so long, once they came up with an approved basic design for the first batch, the rest should
 have been relatively easy to finalize. But they are taking their time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect they will push them out eventually. No idea what order or when. They never tell us. When they push them out, they do it slowly, phased in over georgraphic regions without warning. The new icons will just show up.&nbsp; Some people will see them in the
 "insider" releaes, then someone will report the new icons in industry newsletters or magazines and they'll slowly roll out to the general public, with people like yourself asking for them, but not being able to force their arrival.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike Diane, I expect them to forced on Office 2016 onetime payment licenses also.&nbsp; MS already have "forced" (didn't give me any option) them onto my 2016 Pro Plus.&nbsp; I don't want them. They are 2019 icons, I had a perfectly ugly set of icons for 2016 that
 should NOT be have been changed for even uglier 2019 icons ... &lt;sigh&gt; (yes, it is a minor pet peeve .. &lt;g&gt;)</p>

<p>This is not a satisfactory answer. I have the deferred channel build 1701.77662092 and the problem still exists for me in that version. This is a loss of functionality. It seems reasonable to expect that there should be another remedy for users on a deferred
 channel build other than recreating tags manually or waiting for an as yet unknown build for resolution. Even if you would just log an issue report and then indicate that it has been escalated as in issue that would be better. Please advise if there is a fix
 for this coming? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Daryl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand your feelings on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to confirm when you mentioned "the problem still exists for me", do you mean the tags don't show again after you add them back?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, from the Office version you provide, it is not the latest version in this channel, please try updating Office to check if the issue can be fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, could you share the following information to help us better understand your situation?</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do you encounter the same problem with Danxav: the default
 tags are missing from all tags list?</span></li><li><span>Did the issue happen previously? If not, when did the issue begin to appear and what changes did you make before this sudden change? For example,
 updating Office etc.</span></li><li><span>Do other users in your company have the same issue?</span></li><li><span>Which version of Windows operating system are you using? For example, Windows 10, Windows 8 or else.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Daryl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us try clearing the local cache for the notebooks to check the result:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Make sure all your work has been saved and all notebooks
 are synced completely, then exit OneNote.</span></li><li><span>Navigate the cache folder via the following location, try to rename the cache folder by appending 'old' to the folder name.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
<ol>
<li><span>Restart OneNote.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem persists, for further investigation, could you share with us the following information?</p>
<ol>
<li><span>A screenshot of "tags not showing in OneNote 2016".</span></li><li><span>Did the issue happen previously? If not, when did the issue begin to appear and what changes did you make any changes to your OneNote or your

                    <p>I am not computer savvy, so please bear with me. Every time, EVERY TIME Windows 10 updates, it crashes my computer. If it doesn't shut it down completely, it drops my internet and I have to shut down my computer myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my computer reboots, I always get the same message, "certain updates were unable to install". I'm sick to death of this, definitely, wish I'd never "upgraded" to Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Can I get access to the VBproject property when the project is locked&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I have some code that uses the code-name property of the Excel worksheets using the following line:
<div><br />
<div>SheetName = ThisWorkbook.VBProject.VBComponents(CodeName).Properties("Name").Value</div>
&nbsp;<br />
<div>and if I lock the project for viewing and add a password to unlock, it stops my function working</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can I access the property,even though it's locked?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>or can I unprotect it in code and then protect it again (I DO know the password)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>or can I get the code-name in another way?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(P.S. we use 2007 &amp; 2010)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help</div>

            The answers to your questions are no, no and no.<br />
<br />
If the project is locked, any call through the VBProject object fails.<br />
<br />
But every sheet object has a CodeName and a Name property, you can access them even if the project is locked.<br />
<br />
Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp; MsgBox ActiveSheet.CodeName &amp; " " &amp; ActiveSheet.Name<br />

            I'm sorry Andeas, I didn't explain that very well. I already have the code name and I need a function that returns the sheet name, at the moment, the function looks like this...
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Function SheetName(CodeName As String) As String</div>
<div>On Error GoTo AllowAccess</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; SheetName = ThisWorkbook.VBProject.VBComponents(CodeName).Properties("Name").Value</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Function</div>
<div>AllowAccess:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; MsgBox "You must enable access to the VBA Project 'object-model'" &amp; vbCr &amp; vbCr &amp; _</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This is done in the 'Macro settings' section of the Trust Centre" &amp; vbCr &amp; vbCr &amp; _</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "See user documentation for details.", vbCritical, shtHidden.Range("iName")</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; End</div>
<div>End Function</div>
<div><br />
<div>But I need it to work when the project is locked. Can you think of another way to achieve that?</div>

<h2>            Email rules crash Outlook</h2>
                    Is anyone else having this problem? I've had to disable all of my Rules in order to use Outlook. Occasionally I can manually apply Rules one-by-one, which I've tried in the process of troubleshooting, but even that rarely works. I have the latest update
 of Office for Mac (15.13.1) and am using Yosemite 10.10.5. Thank you.
