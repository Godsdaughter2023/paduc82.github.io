<h2>            Windows Phone 7 connected to Zune always tries to connect to the Internet via proxy.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I sit behind a proxy at work which was causing the Windows Phone 7 emulator to not connect to the Internet. I've since been removed from this security policy and connect directly to the Internet. This allows my emulator to connect to the Internet normally.
 I am now trying to developer unlock my work phone and am having&nbsp;similar&nbsp;issues. When I connect the physical phone to my desktop PC and start Zune, I am presented with a web proxy login screen for my company and can not browse the Internet on my phone. I think
 this is breaking "Windows Phone Developer Registration".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've since reinstalled Zune with full admin rights and confirm that I can browse the Internet on my browsers and in Zune (searching for music etc) without hitting the proxy. My questions are...</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible to determine how these Internet settings are "discovered" by Zune?</li><li>Is it possible to have Zune running and yet force a WP7 phone to using it's own connetivity settings to access the Internet?</li></ul>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alasdair</p>

<p>Hi ajmccall,</p>
<p>It sounds like it would be beneficial for you to ask your questions in the Developer Forums found here:<a href="http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/</a>&nbsp; . The WP7 forums are for customers (non developers) looking

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - printing calendar groups month view</h2>
                    Is there an easy way to print calendar groups in Outlook 2010 in a month view with multiple users?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have 16 users on a team (all in one calendar group) all on an exchange server. We have several users still on 2007, several on Macs (2011), and some on 2010, so there are cross-platform and cross-version functionality issues. &nbsp;Everyone can enter and
 update information, however, not everyone can create calendar groups with a layered month view (only the smattering on 2010 users).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All users enter their meetings and out of office info here, however, it is really difficult to schedule, for staffing plan purposes, a month view. We ideally want to use this for a 3-month look-ahead to see who will be in/out and what additional coverage/projects
 we need to staff for.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Currently, the most readable view is in Schedule View, but this is best for scheduling meetings/daily events only, because you can only scroll a few days at a time. The only option we've been able to come up with is a screen capture of the 16 person Month
 View in Side-by-side mode (in one of the 2010 computers), which with the cramped space and non-differentiated color palette, makes it difficult to tell who is the owner of the Event on the calendar.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As our organization is cross-platform and does not upgrade MS Office software (until you get a new computer, you have the old version), are there any good alternatives other than manually writing out the information? The data is all there, there just doesn't
 seem to be a good way to look at it at present.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help</div>
                </div>

                    <p>
</p><p><span>Hi all,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can some one please help me understand what the following SKUs (
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3BM474 &amp; 3BM473 )
</span><span>are, both are in Product Family “</span><span>Business Apps Add-on Open” .<span>&nbsp;
</span>What are Office 365 Business Apps? Does this mean the apps discussed at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2017/10/31/grow-your-small-business-with-business-apps-from-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2017/10/31/grow-your-small-business-with-business-apps-from-office-365/</a>&nbsp; ?&nbsp;<span>
</span>(Those are Microsoft Connections, Microsoft Listings, Microsoft Invoicing, Office 365 Business center, Microsoft Bookings, Outlook Customer Manager, and MileIQ).<span>&nbsp;
</span>If so why are these sold separately when they are included in Office 365 ?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Is there a URL to a page that describes these ?</span></p>

<p>Hi Terry Clancy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in our forum. For your problem, may I know where you find the SKUs? Based on my research, I cannot find such an official document is talking about the SKU for Office 365 products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the article you provided above mentioned, the Business apps are available as part of Microsoft 365 Business and Office 365 Business Premium. They are designed for small businesses. Business apps can also be added to Office 365 E3 and
 E5 Subscriptions but the only app currently available in the Business Apps license is Bookings. As far as know, it cannot be sold separately.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>

 I didn't do anything ... nothing added or deleted ... ???&nbsp; Any ideas how to get my Publisher 2016 to open my file(s)?&nbsp; It is not a part of the Office package, I bought it separate when I took on this newsletter project.

            I have Office 365 Home on 5 computers. Last month none of the computers had a problem opening old Publisher files. Now, none of the computers will open old Publisher files. A group that I'm in also uses Ofice 365 Home on 5 of their computers. None of them
 can open Publisher files now. I've reinstalled Office on one computer and that had no effect. Sounds like an Office update may have caused this problem. We need the old publisher files so we don't have to start all over to design our newsletter.

</p><p>Sorry...it seems that forced Win10 updates tend to break things in an attempt to fix other things. Perhaps that is what is happening again here. I don't have a good answer.</p>

            We experienced exactly the same and fixed it by reinstalling an older version of office 365. It seems that the version in question is 1812. We used the Office 365 deployment tool, set the update to BROAD and voila it will install 1808 which opens all the
 files just fine.

<p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; I prepare a widely read local magazine using Publisher, and cannot open any of the old files.&nbsp; Which as they use a standard format and a standard set of advertisers mastered in those files, it is a big problem.&nbsp; I raised it with
 Microsoft Support,&nbsp; but haven't yet had any help or means of resolving the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked out how to roll back Office 365 back to version&nbsp;11029.20108 which works.&nbsp; But it means I'm stuck on that version.</p>

    <title>New Outlook windows suddenly opening behind the main window - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New Outlook windows suddenly opening behind the main window</h2>
                    I've had Windows 7 and Outlook 2010 since Dec last year. Suddenly, since yesterday, when I click anything in Outlook that opens another window- email, appointment- it opens behind the main window so you can't see it. Is this a bug with an update (although
 I don't recall an update when I last closed down)?
<div>How can I change it back so it comes to the front? </div>
<div><br />

            The most common cause of this is an add-in.&nbsp; Start Outlook in safe mode (hold CTRL when you start it) and see if the behavior changes.&nbsp; If it doess, disable all add-ins and enable them one at a time until the behavior happens again.&nbsp; That will tell you
 which application is causing the trouble.

<div>I'll admit it's very complex for me so it's possible I may have missed something but the issue I see so far is that the solution assumes you can just dump the data exactly like I wrote it in my example above. &nbsp;Except I need the data to flow into a table
 in Word with Department in its own box and each row below broken up by lines denoting the separation between employee, job title and date of hire. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone's aware of a resource they could point me to, I would be deeply grateful. &nbsp;And even more grateful if you just happened to have the Mergeseq code or whatever it is handy. :)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

    <title>URGENT&#58; Expiration Date for Build 18282 needs to be extended as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesse165  say:</h3>
<h2>            URGENT&#58; Expiration Date for Build 18282 needs to be extended as soon as possible or else people will lose a ton of important files &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Right now I am having trouble downloading new builds through Windows Update and if the build expires it will never be able to download a newer build because it will keep restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then apparently the computer will stop working entirely and I will LOSE ALL DATA STORED ON THE COMPUTER !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not acceptable by any means and let's just say I have seen lawsuits won because of lesser stuff than this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And even if not by me if people do lose their data on other computers because of this you can bet that there will be a ton of expensive lawsuits against Microsoft because of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now before you think this is someone who hates Microsoft I can assure you it is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me and my family loves Microsoft. We have Xbox's hooked up to all of our TV's and my family has used Windows since it first came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am warning that a ton of computer data will be lost by people because of how surprisingly soon the expiration date on this build is and if it is not extended or removed I can bet that there will be damage to Microsoft because of it and I truly do not want
 to see that happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So PLEASE EXTEND OR REMOVE THE EXPIRATION DATE ON THIS STABLE BUILD BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That way we can have more time to upgrade to the newer builds before it is too late and we lose everything.</p>

<p>Microsoft did warn people about this on 11/28.</p>
<p>It was in the Windows Blog and on the Forum.</p>
<p>You will not lose anything. All you will have to</p>
<p>deal with is the daily nag about the expiration.</p>
<p>Why are you having trouble updating?</p>
<p>You give no details.</p>
<p>Have you tried download and running the ISO</p>
<p>for build 18290 that MS put out the other day?</p>

            No. Language packs have never been downloadable anywhere on Nokia phones. You have to take it to their Care Centers. If you buy one from Arabia, it will have Arabian language preinstalled. =p

            It was meant as a joke, especially since I would assume you are from the middle east (or of mideastern descent). Since you want the Arabian language, you may have relatives there who could like send you a phone from there. =p

<h2>            Outlook 2016 group email sent out are saved in user&#39;s sent folder rather than group sent folder.</h2>
                    I have a user with access to an email group. When she replies to an email from the group, the sent email is sent to her personal sent folder rather than the group sent folder. How do we set it so that when she sends from the group account that it gets
 saved to the group sent folder? Thank you for your time.&nbsp;

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your post. I would like to confirm what <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Compare-groups-758759ad-63ee-4ea9-90a3-39f941897b7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
type of email group</a> the user has access to.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If this user is using Office 365 groups, as a workaround you can allow the user to

<p>
</p><p><span>If this user is using a shared mailbox. </span>By default, messages sent from the shared mailbox aren't saved to the Sent Items folder of the shared mailbox. Instead, they are saved to the Sent Items folder of the person who sent the message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p>1.) As an admin,&nbsp;modify this setting to&nbsp;copy sent items on the (shared) mailbox sent items folder in the Office 365 admin center. Edit the shared mailbox settings, and choose
<strong>Sent items </strong>&gt; <strong>Edit</strong>. (this will have both the user mailbox and Shared mailbox&nbsp;a copy of the item.)</p>

<p>2.)&nbsp;In OWA, access the shared mailbox in a separate window (<strong>Click Name (upper left corner) &gt; Open a shared mailbox... &gt; Type the shared mailbox email address</strong>)</p>
<p>3.) Whenever you send emails on this separate window (shared mailbox), the sent items folder of this shared mailbox will only have the copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> stephane clement 63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials Freezing</h2>
                    <p>here we are again.</p>
<p>it's done it in the past and it is doing it again.</p>
<p>I have had it with Microsoft.</p>
<p>this is the last laptop with Microsoft software/operating system,&nbsp;I ever buy.</p>
<p>I've only had problems&nbsp; in the last 5 years.</p>
<p>few years back realized I could NO longer restore my laptop to a previous point in the past.</p>
<p>it creates (well can) a restore point but the next time I turn my laptop on it has vanished.</p>
<p>every time and I mean every time I post on this board, I experienced keyboard lag time.</p>
<p>not on ebay, no when I type an email... just here...</p>
<p>and lets not talk about my Windows phone.</p>
<p>what a mistake that was.</p>
<p>the damn thing NO longer supports the ebay app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and now this again.</p>
<p>the scan freezes at some point.</p>
<p>but that is not all.</p>
<p>it freezes my screen, can't even log off or shut it down properly.</p>
<p>the only option I have is to press the power button off (have been told it is not recommended but have no choice).</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do I fix this?</p>
<p>OR...</p>
<p>can I get rid of security essentials&nbsp;(or perhaps just&nbsp;turn it off)&nbsp;and get another antivirus?</p>
<p>how do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>all I do with my laptop is Ebay, oline banking, stream videos on Hulu (no downloads, not even music or books or anything), my hard drive says 388 free of 451, not a media (FB and others) follower...</p>
<p>all that to say can't see the problems created by what I do on this laptop...</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway thanks for any help...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>some of the replies you got are just weird.</p>
<p>I see that you replied to 1 (good for you).</p>
<p>I understood what you said.</p>
<p>you deleted MSE but <strong>also</strong> got another Antivirus.</p>
<p>so don't see why it should be a problem as long as you have 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>just to let you know I had the same problem last year.</p>
<p>MSE would no longer update.</p>
<p>I had posted here or checked here and realized I was not the only one having this issue.</p>
<p>they posted a Fix.</p>
<p>it has worked since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but having so many other issues.</p>
<p>it has been a few years I can NO longer restore my laptop to a previous point.</p>
<p>not that long ago MSE would give a warning about some malware/threats on my laptop.</p>
<p>the scan would end saying it had detected nothing.</p>
<p>another issue people posted about on this board.</p>
<p>the issue took weeks to months to go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>some time ago my MSE would freeze in the middle of the scan.</p>
<p>posted here about it.</p>
<p>then it worked again.</p>
<p>NOW it freezes again.</p>
<p>the thing is it freezes my whole laptop.</p>
<p>can NOT do anything.</p>
<p>can't even shut down properly.</p>
<p>have to turn the power button off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so posted today about it.</p>
<p>I am completely fed up with Microsoft.</p>
<p>I just bought an Ipad.</p>
<p>I am really thinking about dumping all Microsoft products, period.</p>

<p>thanks for you quick answer...</p>
<p>MSE came with my laptop.</p>
<p>never had another Antivirus.</p>
<p>will look into your suggestions in details later.</p>
<p>and yes I will invest in a Mac.</p>
<p>I already bought an Ipad.</p>
<p>can't be worse than Microsoft.</p>
<p>I posted here in the past about not being able to do a restore.</p>
<p>that was long ago.</p>
<p>never got an answer or a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also think MSE is prone to issues.</p>
<p>not that long ago, the scan would give some warning about potential threats.</p>
<p>but at the end it detected nothing.</p>
<p>people posted about&nbsp;it here.</p>
<p>the issue took weeks to a month to get corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then there was a time,&nbsp;Windows updates wouldn't work.</p>
<p>people posted here too.</p>
<p>at least for that we got a fix.</p>
<p>just plain fed up with this nonsense.</p>

<p>well you might not have encountered issues, that's your experience.</p>
<p>most of the issues I have talked about have been posted about, on this board.</p>
<p>you found an earlier post of mine, I am sure you can find these other posts as well.</p>
<p>not an argument, just facts...</p>
<p>I know I am not the only&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the freezing issue started within the last year.</p>
<p>then it went away.</p>
<p>started again in the last month (losing track of time).</p>
<p>there are "old" threads about this very issue in this forum.</p>
<p>I believe u even posted on 1.</p>
<p>recently&nbsp;I was able to do a complete virus&nbsp;scan after downloading an old "fix".</p>
<p>but now it is freezing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this laptop for close to 6 years.</p>
<p>MSE is the only antivirus I have had as far as I know (then again am getting old).</p>
<p>perhaps this laptop came with some other pre-installed AV software.</p>
<p>but have never used them (that I know for sure).</p>
<p>never had Norton or Mcafee...</p>
<p>I DO have CCcleaner and have used it on all my laptops since 2003.</p>
<p>it works fine.</p>
<p>some say it could cause issues with MSE</p>
<p>never had issues in at least 4 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>will look into it&nbsp;in details later.</p>
<p>my laptop is close to 6 years old.</p>
<p>just need it for a little longer.</p>

<h2>            Disconnecting incoming calls</h2>
                    <p>When I receive incoming calls I hear it ring once then it disconnects. I reinstalled Skype and tried on different internet connections as well. I then created a new Skype account and logged in with that. Afterwards I could receive call no problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What account settings would stop incoming calls. Note outgoing calls work fine.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi James 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            <p>From the Users Guide:</p>
<p>1. Tap on the network's name.<br />
2. ... a dialog box appears asking for&nbsp;a wireless password.<br />
3. Tap in the password box then use the keyboard which appears to enter the password.<br />
4. Tap Connect.</p>
<p>The password will be the WEP key of the wireless router.</p>
<p>You will have to access router settings from Internet Explorer. The WEP key should be under wireless security, wireless settings, etc. Some routers are accessed by typing 192.168.1.1 into the Address Bar. Some are different. If you need a password to access
 router settings, you will have to contact the person who setup the router.</p>

            <p>Hi - I run Windows 8.1 and so have Windows Defender built in. I had run a full scan and not turned up any hits so I was about to buy a third party product when I found the cause of the pop up box / strange message 'contacting:\\dis.criteo.com\dis'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently it was a linked to an email sent by a company called Fotolia. It was their newsletter which apparently caused this pop up box and instructed my PC to contact that web address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I had permanently deleted that email everything worked fine and Outlook has been completely stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to reply</p>

                    I created an Access database several years ago, probably 2 or 3 versions of Office prior to 2010, which our company recently upgraded to. Now ever since the upgrade I'm getting the error message "Your microsoft access database or project contains a missing
 or broken reference to the file XMSCONF.OCX version 1.0". I'm baffled. The additional information provided on how to fix the problem makes no sense whatsoever. The database opens, but I'm not sure it's operating correctly.

            There isn't a reason why not, simply turn on the internet sharing then go to the WiFi settings on your Xbox to connect to it. Doing this will likely drain the battery on your phone so is best to have it plugged in the entire time.

    <title>Why is the Junk Mail Reporting Program manned by imbeciles&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cliveknowles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is the Junk Mail Reporting Program manned by imbeciles&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Last year, one of our users' computers got a virus. This led to many spam emails being sent out through one of our servers. As the emails where authenticated, they bypassed some of your own spam checks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we were blacklisted by Hotmail. Totally, for that IP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following this I found out about the Junk Mail Reporting Program (JMRP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the surface, this seems like a decent program, whereby Hotmail (and other MS) users can mark email as being spam, and then that being reported back to the person who has stated that they are responsible for that IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked well for a while, with our clients who use mail-shots occasionally getting someone marking their messages as spam. I would then ask that they be removed from further mailings, and everyone was happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently we have had two worrying trends starting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Automatic email (non-advertising) like order confirmations being determined as spam. We can accept this. Our view is that if you deal with enough of the public, you will find someone who decides it is spam when you email them with the details of the order
 they just placed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Email which is so obviously NOT spam being marked as such. The four most recent issues include 2 replies to hotmail users who emailed in, and two email (generated by contact forms) which were then determined to be spam (even though they were TO the website
 owners' email addresses, and they did NOT mark them as spam).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So because of these I have had plenty of email to-and-fro with the JMRP support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These guys are enough to destroy your faith in humanity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I get an automated email from the JMRP. It is about an IP which I am registered for, and it is a form which was sent to a clients hotmail address from their own website.</p>
<p>I checked with the website owner that they did not do something stupid (which they did not).</p>
<p>I emailed JMRP and asked them to correct the obvious error in their system.</p>
<p>They emailed back with instructions on how to join the JRMP.</p>
<p>I wrote back explaining I was already a member, and asking for an answer to the original email.</p>
<p>So they sent me another link to the JRMP form.</p>
<p>Getting tried, I filled in the form, indicating in the form that I did not want to enrol, and I was already a member.</p>
<p>I get email asking why I filled the form in.</p>
<p>I wrote back, saying I was already a member, and was trying to get an answer to a question about a JMRP incident.</p>
<p>They emailed back saying I need to join the JRMP, and gave a link to the same form again.</p>
<p>I repeated the original email, stating the problem in their system., including an attachment of the email they sent me, so they could see I was already a member.</p>
<p>I get an email back saying the cannot receive attachments.... (even though they send enough)</p>
<p>I sent another email, with the whole life-story, including email headers, the original email text, the original email "reporting email" and everything.</p>
<p>This time, you guessed it, they sent back a message saying that I need to sign up to the program...</p>
<p>I sent them a copy of the email which they sent to me, confirming the IP addresses I say I am responsible for. By this time, I am getting a little "testy". I explained that the subject-line still included the original incident number, and that the IP address
 would NOT have reported to me if it was not already in my list.</p>
<p>I had an email back saying that this needed to go to another support department, and I would hear back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have chased this now several times over the last 2 months, and they have now taken to not even responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the JRMP support manned by imbeciles who do not even understand the concept of email, and are unable to say anything except "join the program - using this form" even when you are replying to an incident which obviously means you are a member already...?</p>
<p>

<p>To make this clearer, to you, and those who come later...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The form they repeatedly asked me to complete, and that therefore you are saying I should complete is utterly irrelevant. The form is merely a "joining the program" form. It does not even have fields for you to explain what the issue is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have joined the program, email which is marked as bad will be sent to you (If the originating IP address is on your JMRP account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore writing email to the JMRP team, including the email they sent, the IP from which the "bad" email came, and enough detail to sink a lawyer, is the ONLY way to get a complaint reviewed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with this approach is that the team is made up of imbeciles who cannot work out that the reason you are emailing them is because their system emailed you....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only questioning them because an issue has arisen, and I have been alerted. I would only be alerted if the IP address was under my account. That account being my membership of the program they then ask me to join...!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the sake of our sanity, prevent this team from sending yet-another-copy of the same formula driven, email drivel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an update to this, I complained again, as I had not heard anything for about 4 weeks. The email I sent included all of the previous conversation, IP address, email headers, content, etc.. &nbsp;The reply came back asking me to send the headers. I indicated
 the headers were already included, added them again for good order, and all the other details a second time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a short email back saying it was now being sent to support to be reviewed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not hold my breath, as a week later I have still had no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think the people within the JMRP have any clue as to how their own system works.</p>

            <p>Hi, we are facing a similar issue. Our customer decided to migrate from a ReturnPath certified IP addresses to a new IP addresses w/o certification for budget issues and we are facing huge bulking. It's more than a month we are warming 20 new IP addresses
 (10 per sending domain), following the industry best practices (dkim, spf, sender if, well designed responsive html template, good text to image ratio, text only versions and so on) and we are mailing exactly the same (well maintained) subscriber base that
 was perfectly inboxing using ReturnPath certified IP addresses. SNDS shows Filtering rate jumping from green to yellow, to red, back to green everyday on all 20 IP's &nbsp;(they all were steady green when we had RP certification program active). We are also subscribed
 to the feedback loop program and we are actively removing in realtime subscribers when we receive a complaint but if the messages are bulking continuously we lose the chance to deliver the email to our subscribers and to remove the active subscribers no longer
 interested in receiving our newsletter. I think I created more than 10 separate and precise JMRP tickets, asking escalation but all the answers I received were simply not related to the subject. I got cookbooks links, requests to open other tickets, requests
 to open a single ticket per sending IP, I believe they did not even read the content of the form I was diligently filling with headers captured from our inbox monitoring platform. I stopped filling forms for the last 2 weeks because I could not see any benefit
 investing time in it. Being so desperate I also tried to contact a former JMRP escalation engineer I was able to locate scrubbing LinkedIn but I believe it's a dead end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last chance, post my experience here hoping that someone will at least suggest me a way to escalate the the problem to a technically-savy individual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if anyone can hook me up I'll definitely appreciate because our customer is loosing revenues day after day. Last bit not least we are perfectly inboxing with all other ISPs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

            <p>Any idea how you contact them it seems the email address is no longer working for inquiries and I can not find any contact forms.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an IP address I need removed from my feed, but I no longer have access to it.
<br />
There is no option to simply remove an IP address from a feed. <br />
I no longer have the IP address, the new owners are spamming the hell out of it and filling my inbox with complaint messages about an IP address I have nothing to do with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

            <p>So I am in the throws of building a new mail server, so I have returned to my documentation, and found this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid to say JR_N that having waited some 17 months I still have not received a reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We still regularly get emails returned to us, and occasionally these are checked. When we contact the "hotmail" user, we find they fall into two categories:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I got an automated email about an order I placed, but I did not ask for it, so I marked it as spam because I'm thick. We know we have to allow these people to live, even if we don't want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I never saw the email / I haven't even logged into hotmail/live/outlook. These people are still having their email AUTOMATICALLY junked despite the claims of the JMRP team that this is not the case. &lt;&lt;&lt; This still needs fixing.<br />
<br />
There is still a mis-configuration or lack of understanding on the part of the JMRP team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also still no way of contacting them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to update the question title:<br />
<br />
Why is the Junk Mail Reporting Program manned by non-contactable imbeciles?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Tasks without start or end date not showing up in Today&#39;s View</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to set the Task Today's view filters to include tasks &nbsp;that have only a description but no start or end date? &nbsp;I've been trying for two hours. &nbsp;These simple to-do's do show up in the to-do bar by default but not in the task window.
 &nbsp;I frequently jot wown a quick task without any dates, to remember things I need to dobut they are not showing up. &nbsp;Any help appreciated.

            <p>I'm not sure why I was not able to see my undated tasks, but I did find a solution after a bit more research so I will post it here in answer to my own question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to show BOTH - Dated and Not Date Tasks</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) In the HOME tab&gt;Current View Section click the drop down arrow and select "Manage Views" at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Highlight TODAY - Click MODIFY - Click FILTER - ADVANCED tab<br />
</p>
<p>3) Remove all the defaults (You can always RESET to defaults if you want them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>FIELD&gt;INFO STATUS FIELDS - STATUS; CONDITION not equal to; VALUE - Completed - Add to list</p>
<p>DATE/TIME FIELDS&gt;START DATE - does not exist - Add to list</p>
<p>DATE/TIME FIELDS&gt;DUE DATE - does not exist - Add to list</p>
<p>DATE/TIME FIELDS&gt;START DATE - on or before today&nbsp;- Add to list</p>
<p>DATE/TIME FIELDS&gt;DUE DATE - on or before today - Add to list</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will then be able to see all your tasks, even those without a start date, for tasks which have no specific time to start. &nbsp;This should have been the default view for Outlook as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you click out of the Advanced view settings to make things even sweeter, click on COLUMNS, then display the following in this order:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Complete</p>
<p>Priority</p>
<p>Icon</p>
<p>Task Subject</p>
<p>Start Date</p>
<p>Due Date</p>
<p>Categories</p>
<p>Recurring</p>
<p>Flag Status</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to the GROUP BY button</p>
<p>
</p><p>Group items by Start Date Ascending, then by</p>
<p>Priority Descending</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternately, instead you might want to SORT instead of GROUP, by Priority and then by Due Date</p>
<p>Click OK Twice</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can apply more or less the same conditions to the ACTIVE TASKS view but change to</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIELD&gt;INFO STATUS FIELDS - STATUS; CONDITION not equal to; VALUE - Completed - Add to list</p>
<p>DATE/TIME FIELDS&gt;START DATE - does not exist - Add to list</p>
<p>DATE/TIME FIELDS&gt;DUE DATE - does not exist - Add to list</p>
<p>DATE/TIME FIELDS&gt;START DATE - anytime - Add to list</p>
<p>DATE/TIME FIELDS&gt;DUE DATE - anytime - Add to list</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change &nbsp;the columns in the same manner as above, as well as the GROUP BY commands</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are at it, under the VIEW tab, Show the READING PANE on right and TO-Do Bar - Calendar</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you will have Task Views which actually reflect the views which you selected. &nbsp;You'll love the way this looks in comparison to the default views which are set by Microsoft when you install the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
