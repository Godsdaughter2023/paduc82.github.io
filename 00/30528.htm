    <title>Power cover drains drains to &#40;0&#41; over night&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Power cover drains drains to &#40;0&#41; over night&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently got the Power cover for my Surface Pro 2 (256)GB. I can charge my surface pro 2 by itself and power it down and the charge will last for day's. When i attach the Power Cover and charge them both to 100 percent, if i power down the surface and
 leave the power cover attached the power cover will be drained to zero over night, and the surface will still be at a high percentage. If i fully charge them both, and disconnect the power cover over night and re-attach the cover in the morning it will be
 at 100 percent, and the surface at a high percentage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is why is the power cover draining down so fast even when the surface is turned off? &nbsp;I dont want to have to disconnect the cover every time im not using it, as this is a screen protector also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, sometimes i also have to reboot several times to get the power cover to charge, 80 percent of the time it will just say power connected not charging, even when surface is at 100 percent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didnt see an option for Power cover, so i put this under accessories power supply. If it needs to be moved feel free to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Greetings&nbsp;CharlesPollard Jr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about your experience with your Surface Pro 2 and Power Cover. I've moved your thread to the Surface Pro 2 forum as your issue is related to the Surface Pro 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, are you doing a Shutdown on your Surface via the Power Menu? Also, is your Power Cover open (in the use position), folded over the screen, or folded back behind when this occurs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you go to Control Panel and click on Windows Update while the Power Cover is open and in the use position, and check for updates and install any available updates?</p>
        </p>

            <p>First off, let me start by saying thank you for the fast reply, Sorry for the wrong placement, And thank you for moving this question to the proper place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My surface pro 2 is up to date. I check manually check every morning for updates. As far as the power cover draining when not in use:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I shut down the Surface from the power menu, not sleep, but shut down.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once i shut down the Surface, as soon as the screen blacks out i shut the power cover placing it in the Closed position (Folded over on the Screen)</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I check for updates daily, but was not 100% sure if i had done it with the power cover attached, so this morning i powered up with the power cover attached, waited a few min, checked and was up to date. Waited about an hour more, checked again and
 confirmed (up to date with power cover in use, in open position)</li></ul>
<p>As far as the surface cover not always charging:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It does not matter if the surface is powered down</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On in the closed position</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On, Open, In the use position</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or what % the surface is at</li></ul>
<p>Sometimes it will charge, and some times it will only say plugged in not charging, sometimes a single reboot will fix this, sometimes i will have to reboot several times to achieve a charge. A few times i have used power and volume keys to force reboot and
 it will work 50% of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also i get about 50% success with removing and re-attaching the cover to the surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I really like the power cover, it will suite my needs perfectly, I actually like the thickness and weight of it over my Type Cover 2 (with lit keys), other than the (lit key) part. (really wish the power cover had this feature), I am hoping this is a fluke
 (power cycling issue maybe on new cover?) or a defective cover and not the norm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again, if i didn't hit all the points you would need to help please just ask, i am on hear most of the day, i should be able to respond fairly quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>That is crazy! How can they not take it back, when it is not working?</p>
<p>I have had mine about a week also, if this cannot be resolved I will attempt a return as well. I want, need this cover. However I need it to work. If it doesn't work as described, i don't see how they can NOT take it back.</p>
<p>I ordered mine directly from Microsoft online as well. Its hard for me to believe they would not take it back, that is just ridiculous. I got my pro 2 and type 2 cover from staples, they said if i have nay problems just take it back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely Micro will make this right, if not its said to say that a secondary retailer has better service then the original manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you get a resolve, Have you tried discontenting the cover for a few seconds, then re snapping it back on. Sometimes this will work for me and get it charging. &nbsp;I seem to have more luck with this on the OEM charger, as opposed to the docking station.</p>

            I paid for the Power Cover with my Chase Visa so I went online and challenged the charge under the reason of defective product, will not accept return.&nbsp; Since I tried to resolve the matter by calling and by online chat, I've already wasted more time than
 I should have to.&nbsp; Besides, I purchased this power cover at full price.&nbsp; I should be able to open the box, take the product out and it should perform as advertised.&nbsp; I should not have to diagnose and repair Microsoft's defective products by phone, by chat,
 or&nbsp;by community forum.&nbsp; Hopefully a credit is on the way and I can send the power cover back or throw it in the trash.&nbsp; Let's see what happens.&nbsp;

            <p>Im going to give it a few day's to see how things go, probably call and talk and see how that goes. Gonna try to give them a chance, but if not i will likely be taking your route. &nbsp;I have protection with my visa also, but i hope it doesn't come to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep me posted on how things go for you, hope it works out. &nbsp;There is simply no justification for them not standing behind their product. Even if they say there is firmware update coming out or whatever, we paid a premium price for a product that
 should work as advertised from day one. I understand that there are always unforeseen circumstances, but to say to their customers, o well, no refund for you. &nbsp;That is simply bad business.</p>

<p>I will say, my experience has been good. Inconsistent, but good. All told my charges last through the entire work day, with 50% left. I'm online all day,&nbsp;have multi&nbsp;windows and monitors, online calls, videos, and SQL sessions running. So, I get 10 hers plus,
 50% left. I figure...13-15 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The inconsistent part... exactly what you mention. The meter showing connected no charge sometimes will display... for awhile. But it always picks up. In addition, the switchover are slow in registering. The cover goes to 0%, before the surface takes over
 in spite of the stated 20%. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But, over the course of the day, it works for me..&nbsp; at night, if I have not fully charged yet, I use sleep. I prefer shut down..but the cover doesn't charge in shut down. I just decided to go with it and not scrutinize it with a fine tooth comb. I wanted
 it to last all day... my work day. It does, and more. I don't care what the meter says....</p>

            <p><strong>@ Phill 101 Outlook</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to hear yours is doing well, Mine works great when it works also. And if i leave it plugged in all night it will last me a while, not quite as long as yours (but i do keep alot of my values turned up high). &nbsp;I could leave it plugged in all night, but
 the only problem is when i did this (2) times only, it was extremely hot! Hotter than i have ever felt it before. I can leave it in the dock, and use it all day. If i play a game ( with external monitor) it will get a little warm, but not hot. If i leave the
 power dock on, in sleep mode, and plug in with oem charger, it is hot as Hades. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also i have noticed that when my power cover goes down to 0 (like you said it will go down to not, before surface loses any power) if i leave it attached it seems to drain my surface a lot faster than normal. Almost like it is reverse charging the cover?
 though the cover never gains any charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have faith in MS, and hope they can resolve this fairly quick and easily. I will say the surface is not quite as strong as my self built desktop, but as far as a laptop/tablet goes, i could not be happier! I really like the functionality and size
 of the surface, i like the power cover over the type cover 2 (other than lack of back-light ) it is firmer, the size isn't to big for me, and feels much better for extended typing in the lap, or a desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i will give them some time. I am actually heading out on of country for a week, so maybe by the time i get back, (doubt i will get good internet there) there will be a fix or offer of replacement for this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input.</p>

<p>Yeah, those were the days.&nbsp; And, I certainly don't disagree with you.&nbsp; The only caveat I question is the insistence this is a Microsoft issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we see here is a general lack of good quality across the board, in Hardware, regardless of OEM, of offerings, regardless of OEM, of OS"s, regardless of OEM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take that same Laptop, 2 years ago, with Web OS, you had similar issues.&nbsp; Grab any Android laptop or tablet, you have similar issues.&nbsp; Even the glorious Apple laptops and tablets have their issues.&nbsp; Nothing is immune.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think the issue is Microsoft, Apple, Asus, Acer, Samsung... etc...I think the issue is us, the consumer.&nbsp; We have allowed OEM's, all of them, to take advantage of us by accepting sub par offerings..... from the OS, to hardware to design.... to so
 called features that mean nothing. All of them use the consumer as a testing ground.&nbsp; We listen to 'idiots' at CNET, WPCentral, Android Central, ZDNET, WMPOWERUSER, The Verge, etc...to tell us what sucks and what is wrong and whose fault it is.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Truth be told, that HP laptop 3 years ago, did you read the review on it before you bought and after you brought it home?&nbsp; Did you have someone tell you what was wrong with it, even though you may not have noticed it yourself?&nbsp; I know I didn't.&nbsp; I knew something
 was wrong when I saw it.... not when someone told me it was there.&nbsp; If the laptop was hot... I knew it overheated....I didn't go looking for things before it happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;In another thread a guy was talking about ID41 in event viewer.&nbsp; The common person has
 no clue what this means... or even how to read an event viewer.&nbsp; To me bringing this up as evidence in advance, is just like a Used Car salesman.&nbsp; Catching the flash.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite frankly I've stopped reading reviews because they are usually too sided for my taste.&nbsp; Is the Surface an absolutely great tablet/laptop?&nbsp; To me, yes.&nbsp; Is it perfect&gt;?&nbsp; Absolutely no.&nbsp; Does it do what I need/want/would like it too?&nbsp; Yes, each and every
 time.&nbsp; Does the CPU sometimes cycle up?&nbsp; Yes, Does the Power cover meter sometimes confuse me, Yes.&nbsp; Did the December update screw me? Yes.&nbsp; Did the February and March updates get me back on track? Yes.&nbsp; Am I glad I bought the&nbsp;surface? Yes.&nbsp; Am I glad I bought
 the Surface instead of [insert name here]? Yes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite honestly, my bottom line is what drives me.&nbsp; I'm happy with the surface.&nbsp; Not happy, send it back.&nbsp; Show your preference with your wallet.&nbsp; Do not buy something that does not make you happy.&nbsp; Period.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;-Looking for the stairs.... this soapbox got kinda high.... sorry about that.</p>

<h2>            Turning off Windows Event Log and removing a .evtx file.</h2>
                    Hi, I recently did a trial of Kaspersky antivirus because I have been using just Windows Defender for a while. I decided to delete Kaspersky because it ate my computer alive. So I uninstalled Kaspersky and a few files stayed. I deleted those, and this
 one Kaspersky Event Log.evtx file wont go when I delete it. So I turned of Windows Event Log, and then deleted it, and it was gone. I then turned back on Windows Event Log, and it just popped right back up! How do I remove this?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you delete the log from the <strong>Event Manager’s Actions Box</strong>, you are only removing it from the console tree; the log file is not deleted from the system. To completely remove it, you can delete the logs from your system. You'll have to
 navigate to the mentioned <strong>ExternalLogs </strong>folder and delete them manually. Make sure that the Event Viewer is closed when you delete these files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>UAC prompt when try to access Event viewer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            UAC prompt when try to access Event viewer</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: <strong>Userrights corrupt</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Everytime</strong> when I install Windows 8 from scratch at a certain point Windows eventviewer starts reporting errors regarding
<strong>Runtime-Broker </strong>(userright-conflicts). So I struggle everytime to fix that. You must change some userrights to "Administrators", give rights to "owner line", change the rights in the DCOM etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could fix it, so no more eventviewer entries appearing anymore.... but.. during this procedure, I may have caused an other problem (changing the userrights manually). When I start e.g. the Eventviewer (Microsoft Management Console) I have to confirm a
 useraccount-controll popup (see picture below). This was not before. This also hurts, because my system works perfectly, no important eventviewer erros. Can somebody help me to fix that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please no solutions like:</p>
<p>- install Windows again from scratch</p>
<p>- use an old systemimage</p>
<p>- create a new useraccount</p>
<p>- all DISM.exe &amp; sfc commands (all returning no failure)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only need to know where exactly I must change in the Windows Registry key.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hello Martin,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I would like to know is this issue specific to the event viewer?</p>
<p>
</p><div>You may have set the UAC (User Account Control) Settings to <strong>"Always notify me".
</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to&nbsp;lower the slider to "<strong>Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (default)"
</strong>and click Ok and then try to access the event viewer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative rights, such as installing software or changing settings that
 affect other users. We don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</p>
<div>
<p>In order to make changes to UAC refer to the article below.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>What are User Account Control settings? </strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-are-user-account-control-settings#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-are-user-account-control-settings#1TC=windows-8</a></div>
<p>Hope this information helps, please reply with the status of the issue for any further assistance.</p>

    <title>Recovery D drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackie giorgis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery D drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased a new HP Pavilion A27A with Windows 10 already installed,&nbsp; have set up the use accounts and installed MS office, iTunes, Dropbox &amp; Google Chrome so far but haven't saved anything.&nbsp; The program file path is to save everything on the (C:)
 drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I checked the storage space in settings it had the below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This PC (C:)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>52.2 GM used out of 1.80 TB</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Recovery (D:)</strong></p>
<p><strong>11.1 GB used out of 12.7 GB</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why the recovery Drive has been used like this but I had just bought the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on it its showing a list of files:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Other 10.4 GB</strong></p>
<p><strong>System &amp; Reserved 776 MB</strong></p>
<p><strong>Documents 4.48 MB</strong></p>
<p><strong>The rest has 0 bytes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm clicking on Other to view what's in there it &amp; to try &amp; move them to an external drive, it gave me a msg saying "We couldn't find any folders to show you".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, how can I fix this or find out what's in the <strong>Other </strong>
file to free up this drive?</p>
<p>Also will this affect the performance of my PC, as it is taking a while to load up when I'm signing in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your assistance.</p>
<p>Jackie</p>

<p>Hi Jackie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that you are unaware that some of the installers of the programs that you've downloaded were saved on your PC. Default programs that are pre-installed on the PC could also take a huge space in your storage. Since this is a brand new
 device, it will be best to perform a PC reset to address this concern. This <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> provides further information about how to use the recovery options in Windows 10. Follow the steps under Reset your PC. We
 highly suggest that you back up your files before performing a reset. This <strong>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-manually-backup-and-restore-your-files/45859954-c9c3-403f-b997-e96c8e001963">article</a></strong> published by Andre Da Costa serves as a guide on
 how to manually backup and restore your files.</p>

            That Recovery drive is probably there so you can reinstall windows and HP back to the as New state.&nbsp; If you read your HP documentation it may tell you how to use that recovery drive to make yourself a backup DVD set or usb thumb drive to recover your drive
 to the factory new state for in the future when and if you have unsurmountable problems.

<p>The Recovery drive was provided by the computer's manufacturer in lieu of an installation DVD. It's there to let you reinstall Windows should it be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do *not* try to free up the drive or do anything else do it. Do not write anything to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to create a DVD from the recovery drive, so you have a way to reinstall Windows should you have a disk crash.</p>

            I have not seen any official statement to say that this is true. I doubt anyone on the forums could clarify and would suggest waiting for an Official Microsoft/Xbox statement. You do hear rumours and hoax reports from time to time.

<h2>            no sound after upgrade to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I did the upgrade for Windows 10 today and everything is working except for the sound. Indeed I do not have any sound coming neither from my computer nor from my speakers (on the audio jack).</p>
<p>I have an ASUS computer X52J with conexant cx20671 smartaudio hd. </p>
<p>I tried to upgrade the drivers but they seem to date. I also tried the audio troubleshooter, but it did not see anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? </p>

<p>Please note, when using Apple Boot Camp, you need to hold down the <strong>Option</strong> key on your keyboard during Startup. Then using the left and right arrow keys to select which OS you want to boot into.</p>
<p>If you did not configure your Mac using boot camp, you will not have the correct experience. Meaning, after preparing the partition in Mac OS X using Boot Camp, restarting, booting from the Windows 7 installation DVD, install Windows and then proceed to
 install the Boot Camp drivers.</p>
<p>The Boot Camp drivers also place a Startup item in your Control from which you can choose a default operating system when you boot your Mac.</p>
<p>Its a possibility you might have deleted your Mac OS drive and instead installed Windows 7 as the default operating system.</p>
<p>I would recommend you go to http://support.apple.com for additional help.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 - Showing presence unknown every few seconds or minutes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just registered the domain of the company that i work for in Office Online and i will like to make a hybrid deployment but i have a strange problem with Skype that i want to resolve before doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed a user from onmicrosoft.com domain to the custom domain and since i did that, Skype "blinks" presence unknown on his contacts then the availability appears again and it alternates like that every few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to specify the following:</p>
<p>- i changed the onmicrosoft.com domain to a few other users and they don`t have that problem</p>
<p>- the user has both Skype 2015 and 2016 installed but the other users have them also and there`s no problem</p>
<p>- if i change the user back to onmicrosoft.com the problem disappears</p>
<p>- i can write to him so the messaging works</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where did you tried to change the name, in Office 365 admin center &gt; Uses &gt; Active Users or local AD?</p>
<p>We suggest you keep the UPN, SMTP address and SIP address the same. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’re the differences between the user and other users?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about this user login to another person’s machine which works well?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did exactly this:</p>
<p>1. I registered customdomain.ro in Office 365</p>
<p>2. I switched some users from onmicrosoft.com to&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp;just to do some tests.</p>
<p>Note: the users with onmicrosoft.com were added manualy by someone else before I even added the custom domain</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE! No hybrid deployment was made. The ON PREM and the CLOUD are completely separate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. After I switched the users to customdomain.ro , one user had problems with skype.
</p>
<p>- all the contacts from the list alternated with presence unknown, then available or whatever status they had....and again presence unknown, alternating every few seconds or minutes</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I signed in with his credentials on my PC and we had the same problem</p>
<p>5. If I moved the user again onmicrosoft.com, the problem disappeared</p>
<p>6. If I moved the user yet again to customdomain.ro, the problem still disappeared BUT at the next restart it appeared again</p>
<p>
</p><p>It`s like SKYPE is alternating the connections and connects to the CLOUD user and then to the ON PREM server back and forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

<p><del>Hi Alex,</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>Yes, that could be. </del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>You have Skype for business/ Lync on-premise server deployed. So I assumed that the related CNAME and SRV records for the customer domain are pointed to your on-premise server.
</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>However, to let Skype for business online function well with the custom domain, we need to point the related SRV and CNAME records to cloud. That’s where the conflicts occur.
</del></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>Given the situation, we suggest you use the ***.onmicrosoft.com domain for cloud users.</del></p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Skype for Business hybrid deployment, DNS records are pointed to on-premise. My mistake. I have modified my post.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS records are correct as the others are not affected. It could be an account issue. Have you ever tried to let this user login in his colleagues’ machines?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before, there is no hybrid deployment done yet. I just registered the custom domain in O365 and that's it.</p>
<p>The user was added manualy in O365 by someone else and at that time, the custom domain was not registered&nbsp;so the user was *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>After I registered the custom domain, I changed the manualy added user from 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** so the user was not synced from the on-prem AD....but both on-prem user and cloud user are now "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user signed into Skype from my machine (while I was logged on&nbsp;in Windows with my user)&nbsp;and he had the same problem.</p>
<p>I did not try to logon into Windows on my machine with that other user and then try to use Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Have you ever tried soft match to match the local user with cloud user? Since they already have the same VPN, you just need to include the local use in the sync scope.</p>

            <p>Posting in all caps makes for very hard reading and is considered shouting</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the tool you were given the link to in your previous post</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If useing IE as your browser click the 'gear wheel' icon (top rt) &gt; Internet Options, reset the home page as required</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You dont clean the registry niether do you use any of the so called 'SpeedUpMyPc' type of programs, whether free or paid for. They are all snake oil and in the worst case render the PC or programs unuseable.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death after Windows update on the 3&#47;11&#47;18</h2>
                    I run Windows 10 via Parallels on my mac. Have just opened it to find the blue screen of death. It seems to be stuck in a loop - restarting the PC does nothing to solve the issue. It seems that there was an update on the 3/11/18, which i am thinking might
 be the issue..? Not really sure how to fix this so any tips would be great.&nbsp;

            Hi Katrina,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hi Mostafa.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Type Resource Monitor in Start Search, open it and choose memory tab.  This will show you how the RAM is apportioned exactly.  
<br />
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, Mostafa,
<br />unfortunately, your calculation could not  get a result because not only processes are counted, sometimes much more memory is used by memory-mapped files.
<br />And the pagefile size does not have direct relation with memory using but with memory allocation.

            Hello Mostafa, I am Frank.
<br />Just a techie guy here on the forum.
<br />
<br />I pitch in with some ideas here and there,
<br />This is what I would do:
<br />The short of the long story is that if you increase the RAM memory to at least 8GB it might solve things if we cannot do it manually, ok?
<br />
<br />Of course, you go and check TASK MANAGER for Memory and CPU Utilization.  A PC "at rest", recently booted, with no APPS or programs loaded? That should use less than 10% of your RAM memory.
<br />CPU utilization should be at and around 30% at the max.
<br />If they are NOT - then I would go into the details section and see which APPS, PROCESS and PROGRAMS is consuming the most memory.
<br />Analyze that list. Can you turn off any of the big memory huggers? How do you turn them off? Can you do that in the Task Manager Boot section or do you uninstall that program? You will have to evaluate what you want to do. You should be able to make some performance improvements by making the necessary adjustments under the Task Manager panel.
<br />
<br />The Paging File is automatically adjusted by the OS and I would not mess around with it. Let it be.
<br />Hope these suggestions are of some use to you.
<br />Regards,
<br />Franklin

<h2>            Windows 10. Stripes on a screenshot.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with screenshot taking. When I try to take one with only PrtSc button, two stripes appear as in the picture below. Stripes can be either white or black color. If I use Win+PrtSc combination, the screenshot comes out correctly. How can I
 get rid of this defect?</p>

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<h2>            Trying to remove windows store app data taking up space</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I installed killer instinct from the windows store a while ago and now I need to clear up space on my hard drive, so I tried to uninstall it. I used the uninstall from the storage option where it said KI took up about 50 gigs. A few seconds later, KI is
 gone from the list, but no space has been cleared out. I found out the data is stored in the Program Files/WindowsApps folder and followed a tutorial to gain access to it by changing the ownership. I found the KI folder and tried to delete it, but it is giving
 me an error saying that I require permission from the admin account that I am using to try to delete the files. I cannot even try to reinstall it from the store to try uninstalling again as there is not enough space on the drive. How can I get rid of these
 useless files taking up almost 50 GB on my computer?<br />

            Thanks for the advice, but my issue was not how to generally get more storage space. I am trying to remove a specific set of files left behind by an uninstalled game. Permissions issues are preventing me from deleting them.

            Nevermind, I fixed it. Cutting the file from the windows apps folder and placing it in documents allowed me to delete it. Don't know why this fixed it, but it did.

                    <p>Hello!</p><p><br /></p><p>So as a lot of us all know, Sony is making a game called 'Days Gone' for the Playstation 4, and I am very upset about this. For years, I've always enjoyed playing zombie survival-based games like: Dead Island, Dying Light, Dead Rising, etc. Even though they severely lack realism. However, 'Days Gone' is exactly what I've been praying for, and now that it's&nbsp;coming, it's a bit of a disappointment. 'Days Gone' is a Playstation 4 exclusive, but I refuse to think about that, as I don't have enough money to go out and buy a PS4 just to play one game. So, I am here to propose an idea. An idea that I feel Sony and Xbox would both listen to, especially if we have enough supporters. Down below, I have linked a URL that will lead to a website called "iPetitions" where I have created a petition to get 'Days Gone' made for both the Xbox One and PC. And it's not like this is the first time something like this has come to mind. In fact, the survival horror game 'Dead by

            <p>Hello Brijesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try updating the graphics drivers and check if the issue resolves?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Disable or uninstall third party anti-virus software and check if you are able to install.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any third party software installed on the computer, then I would suggest you to disable the anti-virus software and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Important Note: </span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check if the issue resolves&nbsp;</span></span><strong><span><span>performing a clean boot.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into
</span><strong><span>clean boot </span></strong><span>state </span><strong><span>and check if are able to install.</span></strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> </span></span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in
 Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong> <span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>

<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which web browser are you using?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps, to narrow down the issue:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Disable the security software and test, follow the steps mentioned below</span></strong></p>

</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span>
 Enable the security software back once everything is done.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Boot the computer in safe mode with networking and check if the download speeds increase or still remain the same, to do this, follow the steps below,</span></strong></p>

    <title>Kernel-power error in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidoffc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kernel-power error in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p><font><span>When Windows 8.1 came out I couldn't wait to have it installed and so I did.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Have installed Windows 8.1 on three computers:</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>- (1) The main desktop on which I work ~ 3 y.o.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>- (2) the Toshiba laptop computer used for work ~ 1 y.o.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>- (3) an home-theatre PC (HTPC) ~ 1 y.o.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Have also a Windows 7 desktop computer<span>&nbsp;
</span>(4) ~ 3 y.o. where this issue also appears since windows 7 came out.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Before-yesterday error messages and light blue screens of death first started appearing on the desktop PC (1), and today they
 even started appearing on the laptop (2). Haven’t seen one on the HTPC (3) yet. And I have seen these errors way ago on Windows 7 computers as is the case with computer #4.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>It is always the same error (as seen in the event viewer/system):</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>- level: critical</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>- source: Kernel-Power</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>- event ID: 41</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>- task category: 63</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Description: The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding,
 crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>The first two computers (1 and 2) are on an APC Smart 1500 VA UPS (SUA 1500I), on the laptop (2) the BSOD also happens when on
 battery power.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>I have seen this kernel-power error with this ID also with older computers (#4) running Windows 7.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>There are periods when this keeps happening more often than the rest.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>I’ve checked the temperatures of MB, processor, disks etc. with #1 and everything seems to be fine.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>The same is with the laptop #2.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>With #4 there were quite a few of these incidents also after replacing the PSU with more powerful one.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Also the APC UPS seems to be working smoothly and regulating the power peeks and lows.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Note also that I have another Pentium 4 computer that is also plugged into the same UPS and this PC is running OpenSUSE Linux
 and of course these crashes never occur.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>I would also bet that Linux would work normally on #1 or #2. Because of a lack of time I can’t play around with it.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Today I’ve found a nice program bluescreenview-x64 that helps interpreting the Windows dump files.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>What it show is:</span></font></p>

<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>Microsoft Support says they can’t do anything more. Does a fresh clean installation help with these issues? Probably the error
 it will resurface after some time?</span></font></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro...</h2>
                    My company had purchased a new HP laptop which came with Windows 10 Home. I want to upgrade the laptop to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; How do I get a quote from Microsoft to purchase the upgrade?&nbsp; (The only way I am allowed to purchase software is by getting a quote,
 and after I approve of the quote, sending it to our purchasing department to buy it.)&nbsp; I do not have a company credit card for purchases.

            Hi mrmarkeratwork,
<br />
<br />The upgrade from Home to Pro is a standard $99.00 with regards to getting a quote, you can probably contact the Microsoft Store Support Staff:

            If you purchase a Pro Pack through the Store its $99, if you purchase a full license, its $199. The Store is the cheapest method, but its not for bulk purchasing.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link ˜Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won't get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase.
