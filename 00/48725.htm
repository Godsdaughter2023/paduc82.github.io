<h2>            Cannon BJ-10sx USB to Parallel drivers</h2>
                    I have an older Cannon BJ-10sx printer that only has a parallel port. I have a cable with an IEEE 1284&nbsp;parallel connector on one end and USB connector on the other. I cannot find drivers that will allow my Win 7 machine recognize the printer. Any idea
 where I can get drivers that will allow me to use this printer?

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Thanks for responding. My computer is a Lenovo V570. Windows update and driver website doesn’t have the drivers listed for
 Canon BJ-10sx. I contacted Canon Tech Support and they also do not have drivers but suggested trying drivers for Epson LQ Series 1 (136) or &nbsp;Generic / Text Only or IBM Pro 24.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I tried Epson LQ Series 1 (136) &nbsp;and the Generic / Text Only drivers but no luck. When I would turn the printer on it would
 either print a few odd characters in the top left corner then eject the paper or it would go offline then come back repeatedly. Obviously these drivers would let the computer recognize that there was a printer there but not have the correct instructions for
 the printer. I could not find the IBM Pro 24 drivers anywhere online so I was not able to try them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">It would be nice if someone could find the proper drivers for this nice little portable printer because it would be a shame

<p>
</p><p>I currently cannot connect my canon BJ-10 sx to my computer because my computer doesn't have a parallel port, so I'm going to get one eventually. Seeing that you already can connect the printer to your computer and just need the drivers, try these out and
 reply to tell me if they work or not. Hope it works!</p>

            <p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that the drivers for this device is not present and the Canon Tech Support have suggested you to use the drivers for other printer. In that case I would request you to&nbsp;download and install these drivers in compatibility mode and then&nbsp;check
 the status that are you able to&nbsp;print&nbsp; or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The drivers for printer might
<strong>not be compatible</strong> with <strong>Windows 7</strong>. Hence I would suggest you to install in compatibility mode for
<strong>Windows XP </strong>and then check the status.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Download the printer driver from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right-click on the driver folder and click on <strong>‘properties’</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box <strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select
<strong>Windows XP </strong>operating system from the drop down.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on <strong>‘Apply’</strong> and click <strong>‘OK’</strong> and run the file to install it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>After you try the above steps suggested, reply us with the results,
</span>we will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Scroll down to the BJ series and download the 2.25 driver. It says that it isn't signed and it doesn't recommend you downloading it, but I downloaded it and it didn't harm my computer. I still can't test it because I don't have the parallel to usb adapter,
 so I can't tell you if it works. It just didn't harm&nbsp;my computer.&nbsp;Trust me. It should work.</p>

            <p>You need to use the DIP switches inside the printer to set it into LQ mode.</p>
<p>Connect the printer via the USB-parrallel connector cable.</p>
<p>Switch the printer on.</p>
<p>Click Start &gt; Devices and Printers</p>
<p>Click Add new Printer</p>
<p>Select Local Printer and set the port to the USB port - typically, this is the highest numbered USBbport, but you can check which port by selecting another local printer, displaying Printer Properties, then the Ports tab.&nbsp; The correct USB port will not (yet)
 have an associated printer,</p>
<p>In the driver selection dialogue, select EPSON, LQ Series 1 (136)</p>
<p>Complete the printer installation dialogue and then try a test print.</p>
<p>The printer should then render a Windows printer test page!</p>
<p>
The interesting thing is that the necessary components are all there in the Win7 x64 installation, but neither Microsoft or Canon seem prepared to tell us that 'tis so.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 1709 Network Drive Access Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanmcvey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1709 Network Drive Access Issue</h2>
                    <p>We have moved a number of people to Windows 10 Version 1709 for testing purposes. At this time though we are experiencing an issue on our network where when they click on a Network Drive we get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Location is not available</p>
<p>T:\ is unavailable, if the location is on this PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again. If the location is on a network, make sure you're connected to the network or internet, and then try again. If the
 location still can't be found, it might have been moved or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we keep clicking on the drive for access to it we will eventually get into the drive and have access as normal. But when we close the drive off and then try to access it again we will get the same message. Try again multiple times we will get back in.<br />
</p>
<p>This started once we upgraded the machines. I have stopped at this point updating anymore until I come up with a fix for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have done a number of tests to make sure we are not missing something simple.</p>
<p>1. The first user that informed us of this issue</p>
<p>&nbsp; A) We rebuilt her profile</p>
<p>&nbsp; B) Changed her user settings</p>
<p>&nbsp; C) Mapped the network drive (Same issue)</p>
<p>2. Had user login on other Machines (Not 1709) and the user has no issues, can access mapped drives, also tested on 2012 r2 Terminal server with no issues.</p>
<p>3. Copied the user from AD for testing on another 1709 system, same issue. Removed all memberships one by one&nbsp;for the user, logged in one by one and still the same issue</p>
<p>4. Removed the latest CU (16299.64 I think) for Windows 10 1709, still the same issue</p>
<p>5. Disabled our AntiVirus for testing to see if there was a problem, still the same issue as above.</p>
<p>6. Gave the user higher rights on domain. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>PROBLEM FIXED</strong></em></span>. The user can then access the Network drive with no issue.</p>
<p>7. Remove user rights, back to same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as you can see this seems to be a windows 10 1709 permissions issue??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things that we looked at:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mapped drive is coming from a 2012 r2 Server, so SMB 1 is not in play. (Or atleast I do not believe it is)</p>
<p>Updated our TrendMicro OfficeScan XG to SP1 - No resloution</p>
<p>Tested&nbsp;on older versions of Windows 10 (1511, 1607, 1703) and the user is ok accessing network drives</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for any advice here, and suggestions to a resolution. Maybe there is a hotfix I don't know about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>*EDIT*</p>
<p>Forgot to mention that Users that have higher rights (tech staff) are not experincing any issues accessing these network drives.</p>
<p>Another very interesting fine, if the user has a quick access link to a directory on the T Drive, they can get there with no issues every time. But to just hit the T drive from computer no luck.</p>

    <title>Aliens vs Predator 2 &#40;2001 video game&#41; video problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Aliens vs Predator 2 &#40;2001 video game&#41; video problems</h2>
                    <p>I recently acquired the game Aliens vs Predator 2 (from Monolith Productions). The game works fine until the point of the night vision from the alien or the predator visions, which just cause the game to go black (the game still runs, but instead of the
 night vision you see a black screen with the normal UI.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to appeal for you guys, but I tried to contact Monolith Productions and Sierra Entertainment with no response whatsoever.</p>
<p>Here are the things that I tried:</p>
<p>- run with compatibility mode (XP SP2, XP SP3, 98/ME, 2000, Vista);</p>
<p>- run the setup (alongside with the patch) with compatibility mode (XP SP2, XP SP3, 98/ME);</p>
<p>- run the setup and the game as administrator;</p>
<p>- update the driver of my graphic card;</p>
<p>- reinstall the game (several times);</p>
<p>- multiple pirate versions of the web;</p>
<p>- downloaded the demo (the problem happens too in the demo);</p>
<p>- install in different paths;</p>
<p>- run with DirectX 9 and DirectX 8;</p>
<p>- online patches;</p>
<p>- online mods;</p>
<p>- pray for 2 hours and help a homeless person;</p>
<p>- search for fan-remakes;</p>
<p>- run in 256 colors;</p>
<p>- change several in-game graphic options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game by itself works perfectly, I just can't use different vision modes. While some fans say that the game works fine on Windows 7/8, there's a huge amount of people who has this same problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for the attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my specs:</p>
<p>Intell Core i5 CPU 1.80GHz</p>
<p>RAM Memory is 6 GB</p>
<p>Intell HD Graphics 4000</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bits</p>
<p>DirectX 11 installed</p>
<p>It's a notebook, by the way...</p>

            <p>In all likelihood the computer will be much too under-powered to run Windows 7 properly.&nbsp; All I can suggest is that you make an image of your disk before you attempt this, then if it blows up on you you can easily restore the computer back to its present
 state.&nbsp; Upgrades from Windows XP to Windows 7 are not supported.</p>

            <p>Janet,</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I have written about both Windows 7 and Windows 10 in this post just for completeness.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of Dell Inspiron models so no single answer can be given to your question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just by way of example, I have a Dell Inspiron 9300 [originally with Windows XP] &amp; a Dell Inspiron 1545&nbsp;[originally with Windows 7] and both of them work well [but
 not perfectly]&nbsp;with Windows 10.&nbsp; I once did a short test of Windows 7 on the Inspiron 9300 and it all seemed to work okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until you have Windows 7 [or Windows 10] up &amp; running on your computer you will not know whether or not it will run properly or if any particular shortcomings are&nbsp;significant to you - I&nbsp;have been&nbsp;in contact with another Dell Inspiron 9300 user who, after
 a successful test installation of Windows 7,&nbsp;has also upgraded from XP to Windows 10 but has had terrible trouble playing videos on his one [I have no such problems] even though we have the same model with, apparently,&nbsp;the same specs and we both use the same
 drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, experiences vary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if any other users&nbsp;of your Inspiron model have posted useful guidance for you by searching for your model:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dell forums</a>&nbsp; </li><li>[<a href="http://support.euro.dell.com/support/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dell support</a> might have useful guidance for your model but might not]</li><li>in&nbsp;the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7">Windows 7</a> or the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10">Windows 10</a> sections of this forum</li><li>anywhere else online - try Googling&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dell Inspiron&nbsp;9300/1545/whatever&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Windows 7 /
<em>Windows 10</em></li><li><em>and in the support sites &amp; user forums for your key software</em>&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p style="text-align: left">You should&nbsp;check the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/products/system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</span></span><span>Therefore the <a href="http://web.esd.microsoft.com/W8DL/WSEC5B1D8A9DFDFD92DFB736C5B1D8956B5B1D8/Windows8-UpgradeAssistant.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</span><span>good idea of the system’s compatibility with Windows 10.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do decide to try, make a&nbsp;system image backup of your computer first and both make &amp; test whatever rescue / bootup disk your chosen imaging software requires.&nbsp; This is in addition to making&nbsp;a full copy of all your own files, writing down or copying
 all product keys and copying all application installation files you have saved on your HDD&nbsp;- this should all be copied to external drives.&nbsp; By taking these precautions, you can be confident of getting back to where you started from if the attempt to run Windows
 7 or Windows 10 is unsatisfactory and you will have the information &amp; files you need to install applications &amp;&nbsp;copy back your own files&nbsp;in the new OS if it all works well enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Windows 7 and Windows 10 would involve complete installation, overwriting everything on your computer i.e. neither is an "upgrade" as such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest installing&nbsp;Windows 7 or Windows 10&nbsp;temporarily [without buying&nbsp;anything yet]&nbsp;until you are sure it will work properly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 7, you will need to borrow a DVD from somebody [downloads are not available] and it must be the right one i.e. the one you will eventually want to use [as there will be no need to uninstall it if you decide to go ahead and buy it].&nbsp; I suggest
 that 32 bit Windows 7 Home premium is&nbsp;an appropriate choice [I know some XPs had processors capable of running 64 bit OSs and I am also aware that there are several other "Editions" of Windows 7].</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 10, you can make your own installation disk.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suggest that 32 bit Windows&nbsp;10 Home is&nbsp;an appropriate choice. &nbsp;See the&nbsp;procedural&nbsp;guide &amp; links in
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download and install Windows 10 - MS Software download site</a> [<em>there is also some guidance in its companion page at
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 will work unactivated [i.e. before you have to buy it] for a 30 day grace period of full functionality after which there will be an "Evaluation version" watermark put on the desktop [I don't think there will be any&nbsp;reduced functionality providing
 you completed all available Windows updates during the 30 day period].&nbsp; This would probably be long enough for you to decide if it was worth the purchase price for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know nothing about how long&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;will work unactivated [i.e. before you have to buy it] -&nbsp;there might be a 30 day grace period of full functionality after which there is likely to be an "Evaluation version" watermark put on the desktop and possibly
 reduced functionality for all I know.&nbsp; Even 30 days would probably be enough for you to decide if it was worth the purchase price for you.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your biggest headache is likely to be with hardware drivers [<span>whatever the Windows 7 or Windows 8 upgrade assistants say</span>].&nbsp; I consolidated my advice on this subject in my&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/96eddd4e-4b0a-46f1-8c71-96ff380ad272?threadId=03aef37a-f353-4449-89b4-37f417c8a102"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Where
 to get hardware drivers</span></a> ditty [the article applies equally to upgrading to Windows 7 and to Windows 10].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not observe any problems running Windows 7 on my old XP [9300] during my short test of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problems I have found running Windows 10 on the old XP are that </p>
<ul>
<li>Task scheduler is unable to wake the computer from sleep or hibernation [<em>so I have had to adopt new ways of working to avoid needing this functionality</em>]</li><li>PowerCfg battery reports do not run [<em>but PowerCfg energy reports do - it's just a bit of a drag extracting the battery data from this larger report</em>].</li></ul>
<p>I no longer have any problems running Windows 10 on my Inspiron 1545.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made some other changes on the Inspiron 9300 [both for Windows 7 and Windows 10].&nbsp; Because the old XP computer is slower than modern computers, I have added an 8GB SD card as a "<em>ReadyBoost</em>" drive to counter some of&nbsp;its laggish behaviour [this
 proves particularly&nbsp;effective when making system images and when editing/playing videos].&nbsp; In addition, I&nbsp;had a 120GB HDD in it so I replaced the DVD drive with a caddy that holds a 320GB HDD drive that I had lying around anyway [so the pair of drives can,
 between them,&nbsp;hold everything that I have grown accustomed to having on my newer computer with its larger drive].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having Windows 7 or Windows 10 on my Inspiron 9300 [old XP] computer has given it a whole new lease of life [particularly since I added the large HDD]:-</p>
<ul>
<li>I can use the internet again, </li><li>The updated&nbsp;display driver is better than its windows XP equivalent so I can use extended desktop mode when playing videos on the TV,</li><li>The Windows 7 <em>Windows explorer</em>&nbsp;and the Windows 10 <em>File manager</em> are both better than the XP version&nbsp;[for example, they&nbsp;can display more file properties&nbsp;including&nbsp;video file length],</li><li>I can make system images using Windows' own tools.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><em>Just remember that I have not had to&nbsp;spend anything for the new OS on the 9300 either for Windows 7 [as it was only on for a short period] or Windows 10&nbsp;[as I am still running&nbsp;its Preview version].&nbsp; I might not be quite so enthusiastic if I had had to
 shell out £60-100 for&nbsp;a new OS&nbsp;- especially since I cannot expect the old XP to keep running forever [I'm going to be absolutely delighted if it keeps running until the end of next year but it might&nbsp;roll over &amp; die tomorrow].</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to keep Windows 7 or Windows 10 then you will need to pay for it.&nbsp; You will need to buy the same&nbsp;"Edition" as the one you installed for test [Windows 7 Home Premium or Windows 10 Home] because the product keys you will buy are specific to the
 "Edition" [<em>product keys are valid for both 32 and 64 bit installations but I would be very surprised if that was relevant to your situation</em>].&nbsp; You will have to be very careful to buy from an honest dealer as there are many dishonest ones around.&nbsp;
 The dishonest ones might sell you a product key that works initially but is later flagged up as fake / pirated by MS servers and your installation will become de-activated [my earlier comments about exceeding the initial grace period would apply to that situation].&nbsp;
 Buying Windows 10 online is probably pretty easy as Amazon and all the online sellers stock it.&nbsp; Buying Windows 7 is more difficult as few reliable sellers stock it any more [you could buy with confidence from the likes of Amazon but would be taking a risk
 by buying through eBay or from Amazon Marketplace sellers or their equivalents].&nbsp; Whilst any legitimate purchase will involve buying both a DVD and a product key, you will not need to re-install as you can just enter the product key to activate what you have
 already installed [<em>hence the usefulness of running&nbsp;your tests with the version you are eventually going to want to use</em>].</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish you luck.&nbsp; </p>

            I don't know how it got started, but the installer window pops up and tries to download instantsharedevices until it comes back with "program requires a disk, insert disk and continue".&nbsp; I don't have a disk with that program that I know of.&nbsp; I try to cancel
 the download, and it just starts over again till it gets to the requires a disk message.&nbsp; Do you know what disk has that program in it, and what are instantsharedevices?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, I hope this helps

            Do you get this message when you first start up the computer or at some other time(s) (please specify)?<br />
<br />
This appears to be a common problem and the most often proposed solution that I saw was to use the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Microsoft has removed this utility from its download servers because it apparently sometimes "cleaned up" more
 than it was supposed to (I think the problem was usually with respect to Microsoft Office, but I'm not sure).<br />
<br />
You can still get the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility here --&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://majorgeeks.com/Windows_Installer_CleanUp_Utility_d4459.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://majorgeeks.com/Windows_Installer_CleanUp_Utility_d4459.html</a> <br />
<br />
A non-Microsoft option, which is still free, is Revo Uninstaller --&gt; <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a> <br />
<br />
Download one of the tools; make a System Restore point (and/or download and backup your registry with
<a href="http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ERUNT</a>) and then run the tool.&nbsp; Clean out anything related to Instant Share Devices.<br />

            The windows installer starts up as soon as the computer boots up, and if I try to cancel the install, it just starts over again.&nbsp; I have Revo Uninstaller on my computer, but have not found out how to remove the install.

            When you run Revo Uninstaller, does Instant Share Devices appear in the list?&nbsp; How about software from HP (if so, please list all HP software)?<br />
<br />
You also can take a look at the following keys using regedit.&nbsp; Don't delete a key before backing up the registry either with a System Restore point or ERUNT.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Current Version\RunOnce<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Current Version\RunOnceEX<br />
<br />
Normally, there shouldn't be anything in the right pane for either of those keys other than the (Default) entry.&nbsp; If there is, please double click on the entry and copy and paste both the "Value name" and "Value data" in your Reply here.<br />

<h2>            Sound only works on left channel on audio after performing updates on the PC</h2>
                    <p>Well here are the fun and games with windows again.</p>
<p>So recently there were updates.</p>
<p>I only noticed today all non USB audio now only comes through the left channel correctly, the right is so low you can barely hear it even when cranked to max.&nbsp; This covers the motherboard soundcard as well as a better quality sound card in the PCI.&nbsp; I have
 uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers multiple times and run the frankly useless troubleshooter multiple times and nothing helps.&nbsp; As an aside I have never had a windows 10 troubleshooter fix any issue on a PC let alone this one - they are a complete waste
 of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I know this is not a new issue for windows since I have a friend who had this issue and has never been able to fix it.</p>
<p>So I can only get stereo if I use my USB headset, what a joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anybody got a clue as to what microsoft broke ?</p>

<p>Well I spent approx. 10 hours with MS support and they failed to solve the issue even after all possible steps and we had to roll back to a previous build which of course means I am now going to spend a great deal of time reinstalling all my software.&nbsp; In
 essence the update system (as is well known) is completely unfit for purpose as the issue caused for my machine would not happen if the update system would refuse to install updates that would cause issues for a users hardware.</p>
<p>MS (like many companies) is so fixated on rushing forward with the newest technology they have zero care for customers who haven't bought all the latest technology.&nbsp; Things get broken and between MS and the hardware manufacturers the response to customers
 is basically tough luck buy new hardware.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In this instance I will have to hope MS fixes the issue with the particular driver types (3 different sound cards 1 onboard and 2 plug in internal which are some of the most popular from the last decade) but funnily enough I don't think they will try very
 hard.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Upshot being how long until my current system which is quite costly will have to be replaced as these "glitches" become more frequent and my machine is unable to work properly at all ?&nbsp; Not all of us can drop £1000 every year or two for new hardware just
 to have a fully working system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also to sum up the level of support I received was incredibly bad (I'd say in the negative out of ten)- due to the nature of the problems the computer had to restart and then you go back and be talking to a completely different person who would fail to read
 and adequately comprehend the previous contacts and repeat stuff over and over.&nbsp; About half my 10 hours was explaining the same things over and over and having to tell them what they had suggested had already been tried (I think it was 9 different people in
 total, 2 being higher level but still not very useful).&nbsp; Seems instead of keeping a full record of live chat they rely on staff keeping notes.&nbsp; Of course their notes are sporadic and incomplete and as stated the next person doesn't even read and comprehend
 them properly anyway so you end up in endless loops repeating the same information.&nbsp; I was given links that were supposed to link me straight back to the same person after a reboot and those didn't work either.&nbsp; Much as I was loathe to allow it at points I
 allowed remote access.&nbsp; They then took control and ran exactly the same things I had with no miraculous fixing of the issue for obvious reasons.&nbsp; In the biggest laugh ever, several of these persons kept going on about how great the windows 10 troubleshooters
 are and seemed surprised when I told them in all my years using MS products and repairing computers I have never seen a troubleshooter from MS ever fix an issue or even correctly find what has gone wrong.&nbsp; It's just there as window dressing that will just
 waste a minute or two before you have to go find actual help (just not from MS as apparently they just don't do that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I also just realised this system has changed the title of my original post to one which is not very good (it is speaker and headset audio not just headset).&nbsp; Do not change the title of a post without talking to the user first - it's called courtesy
 as the new title is not as useful as you obviously think it is.&nbsp; I've now changes the title again.<br />

 that my RAM might be faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Doesn't seem to crash in safe mode.</li><li>Crashes randomly.</li><li>Firefox and Chrome crashes frequently (especially if video is playing).</li><li>Crashes sometimes even when it's in the blue "Recovering..." screen.</li><li>Tried to update to Fall Creator's, kept crashing during installation and once after reboot when it finally got to that part (then it automatically rolled-back).</li><li>Windows Defender found no malware but is constantly gets disabled by itself.</li></ul>

            <p>When you upgraded for free the Windows 7 licence was transferred to Windows 10 to create a digital licence. The licence in Windows 10 is allocated to the hardware. (the PC) When you sign-in with your MS account there is a link to your account for the PC.
 If you create a local account for your friend (and make sure it is an administrator account) then when your friend signs-in to that new account they can go to Settings &gt; Accounts and change it to a MS account of their choosing.</p>
<p>Or if they give you the details you can set-up an account using their MS account straight off.</p>
<p>If you go to Settings &gt; Accounts and select Manage my MS account (while signed-in using your account) and select the device under more actions you can remove the device from your account.</p>

<h3> krhoover  say:</h3>
<h2>            time sync a workgroup to network</h2>
                    I have an interesting situation. I am in a casino environment and I have a work-group that consists of surveillance equipment that must have its time synchronized with the same source as our network.&nbsp; The surveillance system does not have internet access.&nbsp;
 I have a computer running Windows XP that has two NIC cards, one for the domain and one for the work-group. The video recorders are running Windows 7 Professional 32-bit. How can I sync the time on the video recorders to the domain computer with the 2 NIC
 cards?<br />
<br />
I have tried a batch file with the following commands, but always get an erro that either says "RPC server not found" or something about parameters:<br />
<br />
w32tm/config/manualpeerlist:192.168.1.35,0x8/syncfromflags:MANUAL<br />
w32tm/config/update<br />
net stop w32time<br />
net start w32time<br />

I would appreciate any help.<br />

    <title>Bought Cuphead from Xbox webpage, unable to install on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> outletpro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bought Cuphead from Xbox webpage, unable to install on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Cuphead from the Xbox One webpage store while I was at work today. When I got home I saw that the game had not installed so I went to the Updates section of my Xbox One to install it from there. It was not present. I entered into the Xbox store from my Xbox One, went to the Cuphead section, and was able to click on Install from there. Nothing happened. I went back to my Updates section and saw Cuphead located in there now with an Install button. I clicked on it and still nothing happened. I went to my home PC&nbsp;to see if I could install it from there but clicking on the 'Install to my Xbox One' did nothing. Is there an issue with buy this game from the webpage on a PC&nbsp;and then trying to install it on your home Xbox One? What actions can I take to start playing this game soon?</p>

Tried to install the Forza 7 demo to see if it was an issue with the service, and that also did the same thing. Maybe Microsoft's download service is messed up right now.</p>

            <p><strong>How I fixed my issue:</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>For everyone having the same issue as me, I was just able to install it. What I did was shut down the Xbox One and then unplug the power cord&nbsp;from the back of the Xbox One. I waited about 15 seconds, plugged the power cord&nbsp;back in, started up the Xbox One, went to the Ready For Install section for games, clicked on the Install button for Cuphead, and it finally started installing. The reason I unplugged the console was to force it to do a hard reboot which appears to work. I'd suggest you guys trying the same and I hope it works out well for you too.</p>

 <p><strong>How I fixed my issue:</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>For everyone having the same issue as me, I was just able to install it. What I did was shut down the Xbox One and then unplug the power cord&nbsp;from the back of the Xbox One. I waited about 15 seconds, plugged the power cord&nbsp;back in, started up the Xbox One, went to the Ready For Install section for games, clicked on the Install button for Cuphead, and it finally started installing. The reason I unplugged the console was to force it to do a hard reboot which appears to work. I'd suggest you guys trying the same and I hope it works out well for you too.</p> 
 </blockquote> <p>Thank you so much! This worked and everything is installing and running great!</p>

<h2>            Help with my MP3 Player...&#63;</h2>
                    Ok, so... I have an MP3 player. It's about a year old, so it shouldn't be having problems. I plug it in, and try to put music on it using Window's Media Player... but it won't work. It starts to sync, and tries to sync the first song, but it does not work,
 then it stops itself. Why is it doing this, and how do I fix it?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Set the MP3 to MTP Mode for Sync to WMP11 - MSC mode to treat the MP3 as a drive.

Tips for solving problems with USB devices -&nbsp;and a Mr Fixit<br />

Hardware devices not detected or not working - Mr Fixit<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems</span></a><br />
<br />
Make sure Windows is updated as it should be as there have been several USB updates.<br />
<br />
1st check that the driver letters for them, for a player if the default player drive letter is changed this happens.
<br />
Mine was H: and I added a device which took H: and the player stopped. So I set it&nbsp;back to H: and the other
<br />
device to J: and all worked again. If needed Start - type in Search box -&gt; Disk Management&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list
<br />
- Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Be sure to remember the MP3 has to be set to MTP for synching with WMP and to MSC to copy and delete files
<br />
and updating firmware.<br />
<br />
If no joy do this:<br />
<br />
You may need a powered hub. (all the USB ports on your computer are not powered either, often only 2)<br />
<br />
try these :<br />
<br />
Make a Restore Point<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - click in the blank area - then VIEW - Show Hidden Devices<br />
<br />
Your devices here are&nbsp;the MP3 player(s).<br />
<br />
now look everywhere EXCEPT USB Controllers for your devices (may not find ANY) and if you find<br />
it RIGHT CLICK and UNINSTALL them all. <br />
<br />
now go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING in the category but the category itself.<br />
<br />
APPLY/OK<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the USB stack and hopefully allow the device to install. (You may need a powered hub)<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific devices if present.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />
Here is a utility to help but do the above 1st.<br />
<br />
<span>
<p>USBDeview is a small utility that lists all USB devices that currently connected to your computer, as well as all USB devices that you previously used. Run it Options and check the 1st three choices to see if any are there.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html</span></a><br />
<br />
You would remove all instances of the devices then reboot.</p>

<h2>            Netflix</h2>
                    
<p>For the last two days I have been getting an error message with Netflix telling me to go to netflix.com/tvhelp which of course does not help anything at all. I have deleted my Netflix download, cleared my system cache numerous times and restarted my system
 numerous times. So my question is does anyone have any clue what is going on with Netflix?</p>

<h2>            Programs won&#39;t open in Windows XP</h2>
                    Hi. From yesterday I could not open my programs on my computer. I thought it had to do with the registry(Like if I were hit by SirCam) but that wasn't it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The programs(EXEs) can be opened but the windows don't show up, there's just a message beep and then nothing. Taking a look in Task Manager I can see the exe's running but their windows are hidden.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another thing, all the controls in Windows Explorer disappear. The context menus are gone and all that's left is the "Create Shortcut" and "Detele" popup menu.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I downloaded a PDF from a known trusted source so I;m thinking it might be something else. Unless they wanted to infect me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone come across this one. Thanks</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method1 :&nbsp; </strong>Scan your computer for virus using Microsoft Safety Scanner in Safe Mode with Networking and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use a Safe mode with networking option, follow these steps: </p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Use the arrow keys to choose Safe mode with networking in Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>

<h2>            svchost.exe in Windows&#47;Temp is a massive Trojan and when I remove it the system crashes and puts it back. Why is a VIRUS a SYSTEM FILE&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I did a system scan recently and found a virus with maximum threat level so sought to clean it and the system crashed and restarted. I then used CCleaner to kill the file and the system crashed and restarted. Attempting to eliminate this massive Trojan virus
 is clearly not what Microsoft wants, so I'm forced to assume that Microsoft is using a virus to data mine and provide invisible remote access to all Windows 10 users. I've known a few hackers that do this exact same thing and the purpose, intent and function
 of a Trojan of this style is always malicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know how to remove it without my system crashing so others can't exploit Microsoft's virus package to ruin my system or my life.</p>

<p>That being said, I'm trying to ask Microsoft why they made a svchost.exe in the Windows Temp folder (not the System folder) that IS A MASSIVE VIRUS.</p>

            No such file in my temp. folder. Have not emptied the temp folder since I upgraded to Win 10. I suspect you do actually have a virus.

            How were you doing it before Win10? What are you using in Win10 to access your email? Have you tried using a browser such as Firefox, saving your images from your email account, then burning them to disc as usual from your PC?

            <p>I was using Windows 7. &nbsp;My computer was a 2006 Dell Dimension. &nbsp;My email account was AT&amp;T Yahoo which I'm still using. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I remember, when I loaded to CD there was a humming, buzzing noise that the CD was loading, then a menu would drop down and you went from there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had to upgrade the Dell about 6 weeks ago. &nbsp;We bought an HP All in One which has the CD loading from the side. &nbsp;When I loaded the CD, there wasn't this humming sound like before and no menu dropped down. &nbsp;I can't seem to discover where the new "menu"
 is so to speak..........Windows 10 doesn't have a general File menu or if it does they've hidden it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a computer geek........just use the computer to email, surf, and burn pictures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Windows Media Player 12 is indeed present in Windows 10. I think you have it confused with Windows Media Center, which is no longer available.

            <p>First of all confirm that you're not running the N or KN version of Windows, and then check whether WMP is installed. Right-click the Start button &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Click the
<em>Turn Windows features on or off</em> link to the left &gt; In the Windows Features dialog ensure WMP is checked:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Once you've confirmed WMP is installed it should be accessible from the Start Menu.</p>

            <p>Ok, let's start again from the beginning because there seems to be some confusion here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to burn photos to a DVD then read the two articles I linked to above on Jan. 14. You do
<em>not</em> need WMP to burn photos to disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to burn or play an audio CD then you can do so via WMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to view photos you've already burnt to a DVD, use File Explorer to open the DVD and then double-click the photos to open in the Photos app or whatever you've set as your default app for viewing images. WMP is not an image viewer.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your patience with me. &nbsp;Like I have already said, I'm not astute at all with computers. &nbsp;It doesn't take much to lose me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did read the articles you linked on January 14. &nbsp;This brought up another question; it seems like the photos I would like to burn to my DVD need to be put in folders. &nbsp;I didn't have to do this before; I was able to burn them to the disc from my e-mail without
 making a folder. &nbsp;I'm assuming now I need to either place them in folders or a file. &nbsp;Is this correct? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are photos I do want to view that have already been burnt to DVD's. &nbsp;I have not set up a default app for viewing them. &nbsp;I will try to view them using your instructions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do your find WMP on Windows 10? &nbsp;I have searched the menu that comes up to no avail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

    <title>Suggestion about watermark - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakub ql  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suggestion about watermark</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is it possible for Microsoft to change the mechanics of displaying 'Activate Windows' watermark?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I mean is with new OLED screens, there might be an issue of burning pixels inside the screen. It can be simply prevented by moving this watermark at least a few pixels every side every few days or even moving it across the screen (from corner to corner).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for the developers to apply this small change?</p>

<p>Windows 10 is not free you need to buy a licence even if you initially install it without a licence key. Go to the Store either via Settings or by selecting the watermark.</p>
<p>Leaving it not activated is illegal.</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 - System problem, Cortana .......</h2>
                    <p>Hi, on my Lenovo Thinkpad I have upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. A lot of good things. Yet a few problems I haven't been able to solve yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;When I switch on I get the following error message:&nbsp; RUN DLL, There was a&nbsp;problem starting c:\Windows\System32\LogiLDA.dll. The specified module could not be found.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched for a solution but so far I haven't found it. I run &nbsp;an sfc scan but it found no problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; Cortana just got as far as trying to find a language she can speak .... my only choice in settings is US English (which is peculiar as all my settings are on English UK, home country UK, UK keyboard) .... but even in US English it doesn't seem to want
 to do anything .....</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Homegroup password won't print (printing is OK otherwise)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
