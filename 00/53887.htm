<h2>            Driver IRQL not less or equal &#40;athw8x.sys&#41; Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi Ladies and Gent's,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the following error message Driver IRQL Not Less or Equal (athw8x.sys).</p>
<p>this error keeps collecting data from the system and then restatrs. WTF!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error only happened AFTER I did an update on Aug 11th of this year.</p>
<p>After reading the Other posts It is NOT an error message I get when I connect an external device, or an error with the PC.</p>
<p>The system I am running is 100% Virus free, and it is Fire walled to death.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have backed up all of my data, and re set the PC to factory settings, all the way back. when I update the PC that is when the Error occurs, without any exteral devices attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is HAVE Microsoft engineered a error into the system to create a backdoor???</p>
<p>
</p><p>System details are </p>
<p>Acer E1-571</p>
<p>Intel i5-3230M 2.6GHz Processor</p>
<p>Intel HD Graphics 4000.</p>
<p>4GB DDR3 Memory</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are reasons why you may not be able to now shrink that partition (applies to 8/8.1).</p>
<p>That is when you need to use 3rd party Partition managers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/resizepartition/windows-7-can't-reduce-partition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.partitionwizard.com/resizepartition/windows-7-can't-reduce-partition.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer: <em>the reason may be that there are immovable files contained in the space you want to shrink. Immovable files can be pagefile, hibernation file, MFT backup, or other types of files. To reduce partition size in Windows 7 Disk Management when these
 files exist, users need to delete or move them to another drive in advance. Nevertheless, it is not easy for common users to find these files, let alone delete/remove them. Aiming at this situation, we recommend a very simple solution, namely using the
<strong>free partition manager MiniTool Partition Wizard .</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp;It can solve the problem that Windows 7/8/8.1/10 can’t reduce partition size in most situations, including the one mentioned here.&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also a very good free version&nbsp;Partition Manager.</p>

<p><span><span>Good Day!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Local call to mobile and landlines means that the number you will be calling is covered on the calling plan that you purchase.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Just to clarify if I’m getting your concern correctly, you mean that you and your wife purchased United Kingdom 400 minutes mobiles
 and landlines - 1 month for your respective accounts and you would like to purchase same subscription for your daughter? If so, yes, you may do so.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please be advised that sharing of subscription is not recommended as it violates the fair usage policy.
</span></span></p>

            I think I know the reason why this is. I think my laptop can't handle the image quality because&nbsp;when I download a 4k video it&nbsp;becomes pixelated and buggy. So,&nbsp;I don't anything is wrong, thank you.

    <title>Recorded file through VLC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faggot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recorded file through VLC</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I got this problem: One time I was watching a video in VLC media player and I wanted to record few seconds through it. There is option to record part of the video and if you press record button again it will save the recorded video into C:\Users\Name\Videos\
 libraby. So I tried to play it but when I doubleclicked it didnt open in vlc. It didnt do anything. I could see how the file is getting bigger and bigger. It had like 80 mbs in the beggining and 5 minutes later over 2gb. I couldnt delete it, I couldnt rename
 it I couldnt do anything with it. Whenever I just clicked on the file my whole computer started to lag and the windows explorer stops answering. Then the explorer just restarts and my pc lags even more. I tried to put it somewhere else from the Videos libraby
 and I somehow put it on my desktop which is even worse. Now whenever I turn on my pc its a lot slower and I am pretty sure its because of this file. Whenever I right click it everything freezes and restarts. If I move it to recycle bin it doesnt do anything.
 So I installed few softwares to get rid of it. Tried Total commander - DIdnt work, Salamander- Didnt work, IObit Unlocker - didnt work, EMCO MoveOnBoot - suprisingly didnt work. Also I tried to restore my system to state where it was 4 days before ( I didnt
 even had vlc in that time) But the file still was on my desktop. &nbsp;Also I tried delete it through cmd but that didnt work either. Now I am scanning my pc with several programmes which should detect viruses or malwares but they didnt find anything yet. I really
 have no idea what should I do and how can I get rid of that stupid file. Also I should say its .ts file and cant be oppened in anything I have. Thanks for help</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: forgot to mention that I tried to put it in quarantine with Avira antivirus but that didnt work either, when I tried that avira just stopped working and closed. Like every program where I try to do something with the file...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should. I appreciate the troubleshooting you tried on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you able to download the game?</p>
<p>2. Do you have this problem with one particular app or with all the apps from the store?</p>
<p>
<strong>Method 1: Sync the app license<br />
<br />
</strong>
</p><div>If a license for an app is out of sync with the license installed on your PC, the app might stop working.</div>
<div><br />
To sync your app licenses, follow these steps:</div>
<div>1. On the <strong>Start </strong>screen, tap or click Store to open the <strong>
Windows Store.<br />
<br />
</strong>2. <strong>Swipe in </strong>from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Settings.<br />
<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Settings.)<br />
<br />
3. <strong>Tap or click App </strong>updates. If you haven't signed in to the Windows Store, sign in using your Microsoft account.<br />
<br />
4. Tap or click Sync licenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>If the issue still persists, perform SFC scan and try to install the app. <br />
<br />
Run <strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool scan and check if it works.</div>
<div>a. Press <strong>Windows + X </strong>key and click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
b. Type the command: <strong>sfc /scannow </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
c. <strong>Restart </strong>the computer and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
Also Refer: </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why can't I find or install an app from the Windows Store?</strong></p>

                    <p>Hello, I am posting today in regards to an issue I am currently having with the Xbox One marketplace. I've been trying to buy Burnout Revenge for the past half hour and I keep unsuccessfully clicking through the purchase panel with varying levels of completion. Occassionally I'll make it either to the review purchase screen, or the change payment info screen as I am also trying to change the payment option used for making this purchase, but generally it goes until the price screen or right after I hit the "See Price" button, but in all scenarios I get stopped whenever I try to advance the transaction with a white error message screen that says "Uh oh... that shouldn't have happened" that briefly flashes the screen for a few seconds and then disappears back to the store page for the game. I haven't attempted making a purchase with another game but this is becoming rather frustrating as I simply want to buy this game and move on from the store to continue my life. I've tried restarting th

            <p>Hi there,<br /><br />Purchase issues can be caused by issues on the account itself. Be sure to check if your billing information is correct at <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp; and also check <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.microsoft.com/services</a> for any outstanding amount issues<br />After that try the purchase on both xbox console and via xbox.com (Make sure you are signed into the correct account)<br />Also check that the Xbox Live account, the console all match region wise, using different regions for any of them cause issues too.<br /><br />If you can't find anything wrong and it is still not working, best thing to do is to contact official Xbox Support via Phone or Microsoft Support Chat at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> they can do a

    <title>how to disconnect from win 10 network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karen1941  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to disconnect from win 10 network</h2>
                    <p>In the good old days, there was a function key that I could use to disconnect from network when I am&nbsp;not doing online tasks&nbsp;for long periods during the days.&nbsp;(This frees up other computers in the house to do online tasks faster)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can go to (Win 10) settings&gt;network&gt;disconnect.&nbsp; But I am sure there is a keyboard or function key shortcut that I can use to disconnect and use again to connect more quickly.
</p>
<p>

            <p>True ... but you are less likely to suffer from interference or WiFi snoopers. Both of us can count our blessings &nbsp;;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to experiment with QOS, which stands for Quality of Service. That's a setting in your router that gives priority to services that need more bandwidth, like Skype, at the expense of services that don't need much bandwidth, like email. If all
 of you are on the internet at the same time, it might make for a smoother experience.</p>

</p><p>When I select one of the&nbsp;music files, there is no delete option with the right mouse click, the delete option in the Home menu has no effect and the delete key on the keyboard also has no effect. No message occurs when I try to delete using these methods.
 Just nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to copy more files or folders from a stick into the same music folders which I created before, it doesn't happen. When the mouse pointer travels over these music folders I see a small red circle with a bar thru it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the time being I have copied my new music files from the stick into Documents, which works without any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I get rid of the old music files and folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise that I am obviously not understanding how Windows Explorer works, although I have tried&nbsp;for ages to solve&nbsp;this problem. What is it which I am not understanding? If I used the C:\Users\Music folder to create and save my music sub-folders before,
 why can't I do it now?</p>

            <p>Thanks Shawn. In the meantime I have seen that my problem is a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main computer is a hp laptop. I bought the acer as a backup. Then I set up a home network so that my music is copied from the hp to the acer every time I start the acer. That's why I can't change any music files on the acer, because they "belong" to the
 hp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, since I am having burning problems on the hp (the CD drive may be defective because it doesn't playback correctly either), I decided to try burning the same music on the acer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately Windows Media Player on the acer does not allow me to burn the hp network music files. I don't see why not, but that's how it is - wmp sees the music files but does not allow me to copy them across into the burn list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to solve this problem,&nbsp;I have copied some of the hp network music files&nbsp;to the acer Documents folder, with the idea of burning the music from there. But wmp does not find the Documents folder. Why not? Why doesn't wmp let me look into the whole pc organisation
 structure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do next? Sorry if this is 2 problems in one, but I think you can see what I am trying to do. It's unnerving that I set up a home network and then I can't do anything with&nbsp;the transferred files.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Copied?&nbsp; I wouldn't really recommend that, I would just share them over the network.&nbsp; Do you have a batch command running that copies all the music?&nbsp; Maybe using xcopy or robocopy so you can tell it to skip a file that already exists?&nbsp;
 I guess this is off-topic entirely, but I've never heard of someone doing that, so I'm curious.</p>

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Windows Media Player is pre-set to look in the Music library.&nbsp; Keep in mind that library is not a folder, it's just an XML search specification that looks like a folder.&nbsp;By default, your Music library contains three places in scope:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Music folder</li><li>Your Public/Shared Music folder</li><li>All public music folders on any other member computers on your network</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>You might ask "well what's the point of a library?"&nbsp; I'm glad you (might have) asked.&nbsp; The reason is because you might have a lot of places.&nbsp; Take me for example.&nbsp; I have
 some movies on my hard drive.&nbsp; I have a lot more moves on an extra drive (they won't all fit on the main drive).&nbsp; Plus my roommate has some movies on his drive.&nbsp; With a library, I have one Videos library that instantly searches all those drives and gives me
 one single combined view of all our movies.&nbsp; Now I can see all my movies in my library at once, regardless of which drive they are on.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or instead of setting up your Music library, you could just skip it entirely and just open the folder where the song files are.&nbsp; Drag them into the "Burn" list, like this:</p>

            <p><span>Thanks again Shawn. I had in total 3 problems which are now resolved. Correct me if I’m wrong:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Home Group</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I thought that the master pc copies the shared files to the slave. Wrong. The slave pc shows the shared files under C but this refers to the master pc. As soon as the master pc is turned off they are not available
 to the slave. So I have to copy the files onto the slave hard disk before working with them or holding them as a backup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Windows Media Player</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) WMP will not burn a cd from shared music files on the slave pc. First I have to copy them to the slave hard disk, which is tedious if there are a lot. WMP will play the shared files, for which it needs to
 read them, so why it can’t use the file data to burn a cd I have no idea.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) I understand your explanation as to why WMP searches for music only in Music folders. However, this is merely a default and I don’t see why this default cannot be changed, but that’s how it is. I have never
 come across a search program which does not allow you to search the whole pc if you want&nbsp;to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Burning</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I wrote that the cd drive on my master pc has stopped burning. That’s why I wanted to burn from the slave pc. Wrong. I found out by chance that some of my burn lists were too long even though WMP says that
 they fit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The WMP free space number is incorrect because the last approximately 11 seconds are not available. When I tried to burn a list with stated 11 seconds free or less, the burn aborted with totally incorrect suggestions
 that the cd could be dirty and such rubbish. The programmer knew very well&nbsp;that the free space shown is overstated. He forgot to mention it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This makes me mad. When I found this out, I just chopped a few seconds off one of the tracks, which always have spare&nbsp;at the end, and then the burn is successful. Fortunately WMP doesn’t burn anything if the
 list doesn’t fit, so I didn’t lose any cds.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your help.</span></p>

            <p>John - Hi</p>
<p>I've been following this thread with interest - I thought it seemed odd that you could not burn files from one pc on the other's cd drive, and although you found in the end you did not need to, maybe I could assist just in case you do need to at some point.</p>
<p>This thread got a bit involved so forgive me if I have missed something, but by the look of it you were trying to copy tracks from
<p>I'm on Win7 but I would guess a similar process applies on 8.1 - you need to open Explorer - Network - find the relevant pc and go into the music folder that way - add the tracks wanted to a wmp playlist and save it as (eg) 'temp playlist' - It can the be
 burned to disc. (If you aren't seeing the relevant pc in Network the network settings need adjusting)</p>
<p>btw (I'm always harping on about this!) get yourself a small pack of cd-rws - while they are still available! - although blanks are cheap as chips* these days, rws are invaluable for doing test burns and can save an awful lot of waste.*Come to think of it
 they are probably cheaper than chips!</p>
<p>Happy New Year ( - and to Shawn too) - R.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your suggestion RicW, but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fact I have no music in Other Libraries because I have not yet made any copies of the shared files on my slave pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying as you say to&nbsp;burn shared files directly, which is not possible. These are not in Other Libraries, they are on the network drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your suggestion to first create a playlist from the shared files and this works. But when I call up this playlist which is saved&nbsp;on the&nbsp;slave pc harddisk, WMP still does not allow me to bring the files into the burn list. Apparently, the creation
 of a playlist does not create a copy of the files, it just creates a list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely looks like I can only burn shared files when I first copy them to the slave pc hard disk. BTW it also takes ages for all the shared files to become available every time I start the slave pc, as I have nearly 1000 music files (including duplicates
 for organisational purposes), so I am not exactly enamoured with Home Group sharing at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy New Year to you too!</p>

<p>You are quite right in saying "Apparently, the creation of a playlist does not create a copy of the files" etc...</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>angel3450,</span></p>
<p><span>Since the installation is blocked by a third party software, you may try performing a cleanboot to disable
 the software and try installing flash player and Yahoo messenger.</span></p>
<p><span>To perform a clean boot we will have to run System Configuration Utility. :</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under
<strong>Selective Startup</strong>, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to select the <strong>Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable All</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click
<strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6. When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>7. After the computer starts try installing the flash player and Yahoo messenger.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you may refer the following link:</span></p>

<p><span>After installing the flash player and yahoo messenger see the section on the above article on how to return
 your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Wen,</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you to follow the steps given below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Clear Printer Spooler files and enable the Spooler service.<br />

    <title>PC Tablet &#34;Press &#38; Hold&#34; function not working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PC Tablet &#34;Press &#38; Hold&#34; function not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Trust pc Tablet TB-5300 which I have been using for some time with Windows 7. The "Press &amp; Hold" function (which replicates a right-click) has suddenly stopped working. When you press and hold, there is no response, not even the usual blue circle.&nbsp;
 I uninstalled the Trust tablet software, rebooted the laptop, then inserted the driver CD and installed the latest drivers from the Trust webside (it correctly identified the system as Windows 7&nbsp; 32-bit). After re-booting the laptop, there was still no difference.
 I double-checked the settings using the control panel Windows "Tablet&nbsp;PC Settings": Tablet&nbsp;PC settings &gt; Other &gt; (select right-handed) &gt; Pen&nbsp;&amp; Touch &gt; Pen Options &gt; (select Pen &amp; Hold) &gt; Settings &gt; (select "Enable press and hold for right-clicking") &gt; test
 by press and hold on&nbsp; the graphic - no response.&nbsp; Then to finish,&nbsp; clicked on OK &gt; Apply if required &gt; OK. &nbsp;I've changed the battery in the pen (just in case). All to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions as to what to do next would be greatly appreciated, as I use this functionality a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only extra clue I can provide is that I was testing the Windows Speech Recognition application, after which the Tablet "press and hold" functionality didn't work (but that could just be a&nbsp;coincidence).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards</p>
<p>Gordon</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. As it happens, subsequently the laptop crashed completely.&nbsp; In doing the repairs, it found problems with the register and also problems with the disk (some addresses that were empty that were flagged as in use.&nbsp; I also de-activated
 the "Support pc Tablet" function, saved that, rebooted, and then re-activated the "Support pc Tablet" function. Tablet now working as expected. So didn't have to resort to the system restore in the end, but still had some system issues that&nbsp;perhaps were the
 cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

            Well, that's a very standard kind of answer. Without any disrespect, it is not very helfpful. Firstly, what third party software are you referring to, i.e. what programs, what distributor, where to download them etc? Secondly, why can't windows make a
 patch themselves, I mean, I do believe I payed enough to get some reasonably up-to-date software. How come freeware like Ubuntu, which I've used before managed to do this for free, and Windows can't do this while getting payed? Is there somewhere I can file
 a complaint or recommendation on this matter? I do understand they might have bigger issues to take care, but it is quite annoying, and I believe not thát hard to do if you're into programming.

            <p>Use mp3tag to convert the tags. Also if your library is 50GB already you should use different music software. The library from WMP (and explorer itself in windows 7 and up) cannot handle a serious music collection.</p>
<p>it becomes easily corrupted forcing you to rebuild it entirely (note, I have over 100,000 tracks and the library becomes corrupted even before all the tracks are added).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>many questions have been asked about the weak library from WMP but none have been properly answered. Also Microsoft fails to provide a tool to fix a corrupted library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>good luck with your collection!</p>

<h2>            Unable to setup printer</h2>
                    After upgrade to Win 10 I had to reinstall printer (Samsung ML-1640). Printer is connected to my routers USB as it was when running Win 7 (64-bit). When setting it up the test page is printed incorrectly and on top of page it says "INTERNAL ERROR - FALSE".
 Driver was found using Win update. Printer troubleshooting guide in Win 10 is of no help (can't find the problem). What can I do? Must I buy a new printer now?

<p>Thank you for the feedback. Don't lose hope, let us try a different route to isolate the issue. Since the driver was updated by the Windows update, what we need to do is to roll back to the previous driver that was working before.

<p><span><span>It appears to me that some of the Thinkpad utility is failing to load on Startup. On my research I find that this could be the Thinkpad Power Manager
 utility. I suggest that you reinstall the driver and check if you have the same issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also set your computer to clean boot, this will help you figure out the program that is causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click

 you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>On
 the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></span></span></p>

 you are prompted, click Restart.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>After the computer starts, check if the issue is fixed, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down
 the exact source:</span></span></span></p>

                    <div>I really am shot at all ideas i could come up with. I have tried reinstalling my OS like 10 times. I bought the whole computer custom built on 11/12/12 and it was not showing any sign of problems what so ever until about ten days ago when i randomly started
 getting the below BSODs. I have tried so many methods and none of which seemed to solve my problem. This is my last hope to figuring this out, i really dont want to fork out another couple hundred dollars to get a whole new setup... below are the dump files
 copy and pasted with WhoCrashed program. Any and all help would be SUPER&nbsp;appreciated&nbsp;and thanked in advance. Sad to say, im desperate for answers.</div>

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you are receiving BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) constantly and receiving error: BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur if one or more of the Random Access Memory (RAM) modules that are installed in your computer is damaged or if the RAM configuration is incompatible.
 It can also be any hardware device, its driver, or related software. </p>
<p>To troubleshoot you can try to remove the memory modules that are installed in your computer, but leave enough RAM to start your computer and run Windows, and then
 restart your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s follow these methods to fix the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Run Memory Diagnostics test to check for any memory problems. Refer to the below mentioned link for the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I removed one of my RAM sticks earlier after reading a lot about the issue that these errors occur because of them and it was running really well for a while. Then suddently a new BSOD that i have not experienced before happened. Perhaps someone may be
 able to look into it?&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's right there is a high possibility of a corrupted RAM on the computer.<br />
<br />
Since you have re-installed the Operating System, that is sure issue lies with hardware.<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause of this error:</strong><br />
This error message can occur if either of the following conditions exists: <br />
• Your computer has hardware or software problems (hardware failure is the most common cause).<br />
• You try to over clock the speed of your computer's processor (for example, you set a 150 MhZ processor to run at 187 MhZ).<br />
<br />
The above STOP error means a trap occurred in kernel mode and the trap is either one the kernel is not allowed to have or is always fatal. The most common causes of a STOP 0x7F are:<br />
• Low-level hardware corruption, such as corrupt memory (RAM)<br />
• Mismatched memory modules<br />
• A malfunctioning motherboard<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution:</strong><br />
To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method: <br />
• If either software or hardware can cause a particular trap, a debug is required to determine which is the cause. If you suspect a hardware problem, try the following hardware troubleshooting steps:<br />
<br />
1. Sincde you have checked the RAM in the computer by running the diagnostic software that is provided by the computer manufacturer. Replace any RAM that is reported as bad. Also, make sure that all the RAM in the computer is the same speed.<br />
<br />
2. Try removing or swapping out controllers, cards, or other peripherals.<br />
<br />
3. Try a different motherboard on the computer.<br />
• If you are over clocking the speed of your processor, set it back to the speed at which it is designed to run.<br />
• Check with the hardware vendor for any updated hardware drivers or BIOS updates, or both.<br />
<strong>BIOS Disclaimer:<br />
</strong>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can<br />
causeserious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot<br />
guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.
<br />
<br />
4. Try removing the graphics card and then check if you get the error message, If the error still exists that means this is occuring because of a faulty RAM.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you are using <strong>Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc</strong> the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a different Anti-Virus, please read this:</p>
<p>"<span>How to Start/Stop </span><span>Windows Defender service"</span></p>
<p><a href="http://computerstepbystep.com/windows_defender_service.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://computerstepbystep.com/windows_defender_service.html</a></p>

<p>If you wish to have extra protection against&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;use the FREE version of Malwarebytes AntiMalware:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to now&nbsp;change Startup Programs in&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;without using Defender, use either of these Methods:</p>

            <blockquote>In Control Panel, click on 'Windows Defender', it shows that it is turned off. Select the link 'click here to turn it on', but no response after clicking on it.
</blockquote>
<p>If you have another antimalware program installed that contains it's own version of what defender does, e.g. Microsoft Security Essentials, it will disable Windows Defender.&nbsp; This is normal.</p>
<p>
