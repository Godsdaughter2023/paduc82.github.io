    <title>Is there a &#34;partial protection&#34; in Powerpoint as there is in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ochimus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a &#34;partial protection&#34; in Powerpoint as there is in Excel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In Excel&nbsp;an entire sheet can be "protected" but with&nbsp;"unlocked" cells that users can change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone found&nbsp;the same facilitty&nbsp;in Powerpoint? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want&nbsp;a slide that allows users&nbsp;to add, delete or change information in specific text boxes but nothing else.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I can find on the web are "blanket" approaches (password protection, setting as "Read Only", marking as&nbsp;"Final")&nbsp;that are no use because they mean users can either&nbsp;change everything or nothing at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate any&nbsp;solutions or links provided</p>

            This might or might not suit your needs, but here goes:
<div><br />
<div>Make sure you have a saved normal copy of the presentation, then save it as a Picture Presentation. &nbsp;This converts each slide to an image, meaning it can't be edited further.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then add new text boxes/shapes atop the slides and save as a regular presentation, NOT a picture presentation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That should more or less do it, I think.</div>

<h2>            &#61;UPPER&#40;&#91;Column Name&#93;&#41; failing to validate properly</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the following formula in a SharePoint list&nbsp;to require Upper Case alpha characters in a 'Single line of text' field:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=UPPER([Reporting Entity Name])</p>
<p>
</p><p>When testing using lower case alpha characters, it correctly validates and the User Message appears indicating they must use Upper Case letters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when testing using actual Upper Case alpha characters and then saving, the User Message appears again indicating that Upper Case letters were not used when they actually were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas on why this might be occurring? Is the formula missing something?</p>
<p>

    <title>Hacked account. Microsoft support is a joke. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john_may_125  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hacked account. Microsoft support is a joke.</h2>
                    <p>Recently my email address was hacked, not sure how long ago since i i rarely used it as it was only used from one of my devices. I tried logging into one of my accounts made from the email address and was unable to so i just guessed i i might have forgotten
 the password. Tried to change it and the i realised i couldnt log into my account, someone changed the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone number used for the account that i had was lost a long time ago with my phone (it was a pre-paid phone number) and the recovery email is unkown to me since i had made a lot of emails over the past few years. Therefore i couldn't recover my account
 the normal way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried filling out the form but i got denied every single time, since the last email sent from my account was about 5 years ago how the hell am i supposed to remember that?? Apart from that there is no way to talk to anyone from Microsoft using live chat
 or anything so the only way to recover an account is to fill out a stupid form which will do absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have saved emails, from the last time i used my email on this device and that was the only place for the past few years that account has been used from, i have a facebook account created through this email and many more (most of which have now been hacked
 thanks to microsoft having terrible customer support)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any hope at all in recovering my email by being able to prove it is mine (emails on my device, facebook) or can i at the very least have my account blocked or will the hacker just be able to go ahead and take whatever account they wish from me?</p>

<p>As i allready stated above, the password had been changed, and not by me, i relised not long ago when trying to recover my RSC account and a got an "password is invalid" notification on my device for this email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never really thought about changing the phone number after i lost it since i i rarely used the account, only for recovering other old accounts as i use a different email for mostly everything, however the two things i did use my hotmail account have allready
 been compromised (PSN account and Rockstar Social Club) and im im guessing a few others have been aswell, and just haven't got around to looking at them.</p>

            Hi John,
If you don't log in at least once a year, the account is inactive only way to recover is if you have the password - resetting the password does not work. If the account is not accessed in 5 years it will be deleted.&nbsp;

The following is from the Microsoft  services agreement&nbsp;
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreeme...;

ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a five-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless provided otherwise in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.

            Called microsoft today, went through numerous options without speaking to anyone and got told by the automated system to go online to the microsoft website to get help, it seems you cant talk to anyone and if microsoft decides with their forms that it
 might not be your account the hacker can just do whatever he pleases with your account, even if you have solid proof it is yours (facebook account, emails) it means nothing as that is not asked for in the form and you cant even talk to anyone, terrible service.

<h2>            Copy sheet with buttons &#47; macros &#40;same workbook&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a workbook with a number of macros.&nbsp; The user opens a form, selects some options and it creates a report on either the Summary or Results sheet.&nbsp; Both of these sheets contain buttons that run a number of other macros.&nbsp;The data for these reports resides
 on the Data sheet in the same workbook.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; Works just like it is supposed to.&nbsp; I'm using VBA in this workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the next verison of this workbook, users want to create multiple reports on either the Summary or Results sheets.&nbsp; If they have already run a report to one of&nbsp;these&nbsp;sheets, the next time they run another report, they want the macro to add another "Results
 / Summary" sheet with the same buttons and macros (attached to those buttons).&nbsp;&nbsp;The name for the new sheet is immaterial and can be anything.&nbsp; They want to keep adding copies of either the Summary or Results sheet to this workbook.</p>

<p>Is it possible to copy a sheet with buttons (and&nbsp;associated macros)&nbsp;to the same workbook?&nbsp; The buttons should have the same names and run the same macros as the original Summary and Results sheets.&nbsp; These buttons should also be in the same location on the
 sheet and the same size.&nbsp; What I'm looking to do is create and exact duplicate of the Result / Summary sheet in the same workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The macros associated with these buttons are in modules and not contained in the sheets I want to copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you for your help.....</p>

            Sorry, but the chess games on the store are absolutely pitiful. I just upgraded to Windows 10, but to be honest, I am considering reverting back to Windows 7 just to have the Chess Titans and Mahjong Titans back.&nbsp;

    <title>IF false do nothing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alisonmoorhouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            IF false do nothing</h2>
                    <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>I am planning resources on several projects so my spreadsheet has dates across the top, people down the side and cells are populated along the spreadsheet with which project they are working on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have contract end dates in a column on the left and I want to gray out the cells that are beyond the contract end date, which I can do with conditional formatting if cells beyond that date are returned as zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, so easy, but I want the cells to remain unchanged if the date is before the end date. &nbsp;Is there a way to do that with my VALUE_IF_FALSE in the below formula? &nbsp;I tried just adding the cell number of the cell I wanted the formula applied to but it's
 returning a 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My formula for cell CC3 is:</p>
<p>=IF(CC$2&gt;=$F3,0,CC3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried it the other way around too, where the VALUE-IF-TRUE is the cell value but it just shows the formula in the cell.</p>
<p>=IF(CC$2&lt;$F3,CC3,0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated!</p>
                </div>

            <p>If you're doing this as conditional formatting then there is no real need to put a formula in the cell to make it evaluate to zero, and then conditional format on the basis of the zero value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conditional formatting works on a TRUE/FALSE basis - if the conditional format condition evaluates to TRUE, it does the formatting, if not, it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So (without seeing your worksheet) it should be possible to just make the conditional format condition like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">=IF(CC$2&gt;=$F3,TRUE,FALSE)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope I haven't misunderstood what you want.</span><br />

            <p>Ah sorry - I left out an important bit of information!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a SUMIF formula at the bottom of the spreadsheet working on the basis of the project name - so if the contract end date is up I need the cell to no longer contain the project name. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was initially going to conditional format on the basis of making the cell fill and text the same colour so that it was no longer visible, but I need the value to change. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>if the formula is showing in the cell instead of the result of the formula, check the format of the cell. It is probably "Text". Change it to "General" and then edit the cell and confirm it again with Enter. You must edit the cell after changing the format,

            <p>In that case, CC2 is text that may look like a date, but the underlying value is text, not a real date. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, check the format of the cell, this time CC2. Set it to "General" and if it is a real date it should now show as a number. If it is text, it will stay as it is and you will need to convert the text to real dates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are techniques to do that in bulk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, select all the text that looks like dates, then click Data &gt; Text to columns &gt; Next &gt; Next (yes again) &gt; tick Date and select the order of Year, Month and Date that the data is showing &gt; Click Finish.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 &#8211; Calendar Printing and word cut off.</h2>
                    In Outlook 2010 when printing a monthly calendar, the words wrap but they are cut off randomly and the calendar looks terrible and unprofessional. Is there a Microsoft Fix for this? I do not want any 3rd party solutions. Thank you for any assistance.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You won't be able to use the Zune Software nor will you be able to sync any Zune Pass DRM Protected Content to your Samsun Galaxy Phone. Assuming the phone is not a WP7 device. The only devices that can connect/sync Zune Pass DRM Protected Content are Valid
 Computers with a valid installation of the Zune Software, Zune Devices (PMP personal media players), KIN devices, and WP7 devices.</p>
<p>However, you can sync any non-DRM protected content MP3 files that you own through whatever sync program that the Samsung Galaxy/Android works with. How that is done is beyond the scope of this discussion.&nbsp; You should be able to use Windows Media Player
 as discussing in this <a href="http://www.knowyourmobile.com/samsung/samsunggalaxys/samsunggalaxysuserguides/529523/how_to_sync_galaxy_s_with_windows_media_player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Nokia N97 is the worst phone ever. Problem after problem... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia N97 is the worst phone ever. Problem after problem...</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Nokia N97. To my suprise it is the actual official Nokia N97 model and not a fake. Also to my suprise, it is the Nokia flagship model! Waiting for months since its announcement, and finally thought top phoneas I signed an EIGHTEEN MONTH CONTRACT
 on it (thankfully it wasn't more).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I power it up and within the first day, it crashes twice. That's nothing though, it's simply the beginning of an enormous ammount of bugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My N97 crashed during a presentation I was giving off it (because apparently N97 is fantastic NSeries phone that can do all this kind of stuff without a hickle). Failed to wake me up via the Alarm which in turn made me late for an appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ammount of bugs on this "top" NSeries flagship is disgusting. I am sad to say that this is definetly the last Nokia I will ever buy. This is worse than the N95 when it failed every so often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The homescreen which it is applauded for is a total waste of space as the widgets don't work practically all the time. I am so angry, upset, and frustrated with the problems of this device. People should NOT have to UPDATE their phone because of the ammount
 of bugs in it. Only today did I leave it on charge for hours, I then left it upon seeing the charging light, "Charging" on the screen, and the bars going up and come back to see that it had not even charged...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This phone should be taken OFF THE MARKET asap as it is not fit for selling at all. I can't imagine the pain Nokia must be feeling as their flagship model which they have apparently spent loads on, is just failing completely because of the ammount of software
 bugs in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALL MY PHOTOS which I taken with the 5mp camera on the phone, are now corrupted thanks to the phone itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to send this for repair or something but quite frankly I don't even want this "amazing" phone now. It IS amazing when it works but it hardly works anyway so what is the point... When I do send it for repair from my operator (3,
<a href="http://www.three.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.three.co.uk</a>), I DO NOT want a simple standard phone to last through the time of repair (could be upto 2 weeks). I have paid for a N97 and I will have an N97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems:<br />
Random crashes/freezing/restarts.</p>
<p>Out of Memory all the time<br />
Widgets not working<br />
Not charging</p>
<p>Photos corrupted/out of place in gallery</p>
<p>and lots more... trust me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how frustrated I am with this and I refuse to pay for it anymore for 18months. I am definetly not having these problems for EIGHTEEN MONTHS. I refuse to have them any longer as it currently is. It was embarrasing the other day when I tried
 to send some content via Bluetooth and the phone was just repeatidly crashing. My friend said that I have a rubbish phone...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has caused me alot of stress because I wake up in the morning and the phone has either not charged through the night, the alarm doesn't activate and wake me up, or it crashes/freezes/restarts at the moment when I am leaving home for work and that's when
 I need it most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S - Thanks alot Nokia! No longer will I ever buy a Nokia phone, and I will be advising all my friends the same when I show them proof with my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Technomike</p>

    <title>right margin has a lock on it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            right margin has a lock on it&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to create a document that has two to a page in landscape orientation. I need there to be at least a .75" margin for each document for hole punches. the left side will let me make the margin whatever i want. The right side of the whole page,
 even when margins are set at 0, puts at least a half inch margin and I can't figure out how to get ride of it. I tried making a custom print size at 11x8.5 which fixed the margin problem but now is telling me the printer isnt compatible with that size... help

            The printer may not be compatible with that paper size. If you are trying to get two excel ranges to print on a single page, you will have to structure your worksheet that way. Use an intermediate column as the between column margins.<br />
Or, please explain in more detail, using actual Excel columns and row identifiers to explain how you want the result to look.<br />

            If it were changeable it wouldn't be set as the minimum requirement in the first place, would it :-) Seriously, that spec is set by the manufacturer of the printer because of what the mechanism needs to feed the paper.<br />
<br />
Typically an attempt to use a non-compliant setting will generate a prompt offering the option to ignore the minimum. It's doubtful that content which extends beyond that requirement will print, though.<br />
<br />
As Bob G mentioned, what you're attempting to do or how your content is laid out isn't very clear. That makes it impossible to offer any specific suggestions, but it shouldn't be to difficult to get the result you want. Have a look in Excel Help - The Help
 home page includes a Printing link which takes you to a page of topics related to printing. Review that info with particular attention to the topics entitled;<br />
<ul>
<li>Print a sheet on just one page</li><li>Scale the sheet size for printing</li></ul>

<h2>            HTC Mogul Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional for some reason no longer syncs with My HP Laptop which is running Microsoft Vista Ultimate</h2>
                    My contacts, calender information, tasks, etc... have disappeared off my mobile phone. The last thing a remember doing was connecting it to my laptop and letting it sync like I usually do every week. I usually don't check for any issues because I never
 had a problem. Windows Mobile Device Center shows phone connects then syncs. I tried syncing to get all my info back on my phone but noticed sync happened to fast. Checked phone and nothing was tranferred. Further investigation showed that according to the
 Windows Mobile Device Center that Outlook is not installed. This does not make sense since I have Outlook installed. Again I do not know what happened and how I can get this fixed. Just frustrated...

            No, as soon as you type "Me.Forms" Intellisense stops responding and you're on the wrong track. If you want to update a subform from a parent form, the syntax is:<br />
Me.mySubformControl.Form.myControlInSubform = somevalue<br />
<br />
If you then want to call that control's AfterUpdate event, you have to do two things. First you need to make that event procedure Public so you can call it from other forms (i.e. its parent). Then you call it with very similar syntax to the above:<br />
Me.mySubformControl.Form.txtActlength_AfterUpdate<br />
<br />
On another topic: your name "Lily AZ" suggests you are in Arizona like I am. Tell me more if you like: tom 7744 at cox dot net<br />

<h2>            6210 Navigator &#58; Error Certificate installing Sports Tracker</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't install Nokia Sport Tracker on my Nokia 6210 Navigator because it gives me an error certificate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, trying to update my cellphone, it does not have new update...???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia 6210 Navigator (RM-367)</p>
<p>Micrologiciel: 3.25.124.04 (22 oct 2008)</p>
<p>Code: 0569996</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking the both same phone of my parents (Both RM-367), the version is higher 5.something and mine stays at 3.25 without any update... since 2008?????????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi Suite and Pc Suite doesn't offer me any update...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm desesperate (I've past a few days looking in google without solutions (for example changing the date of the phone, or configurate the application manager (all, no control online of the certificates,...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing nothing... I'm thinking about flashing it with an updated software, ultimate action of a&nbsp;desperate&nbsp;man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, it's strange that a mobile "updated" can't install a program from Ovi Suite....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Yours may be branded to a network operator who never approved any versions beyond 3.25.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the application, Symbian apps usually have a one-year certificate, so if you have had the installation file for a long time or you downloaded it from an old source, it won't install.</p>

<p>So my cellphone is updated (following my operador) &nbsp; :(&nbsp; and I'm unable to install any aplication from the Ovi Suite... sounds so stupid. The application is the Sports Tracker and it is a new version!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the page "can I update" is finaly working and giving me an answer, 3.25 is indeed the latest update when a free version is now at the 6.05... it is a shame!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm now obliged to flash my mobile and use piracy because of Vodafone Spain if I want new applications on this mobile.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I think this feature could easily be implemented - when selecting entries in mail app only delete and move icons are shown but mark read and mark unread functions have to be pulled up. There is enough space to include these two functions as icons ;)</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<h2>            Everything going to spam</h2>
                    Hi, for the past few months every email I get has been suddenly going to my spam folder instead of my inbox. I haven't changed any settings and even when I add the email to the safe sender list, the emails still end up in spam. I never know when I get
 an email now because it doesn't tell me when I get an email in my spam folder, and none end up in my inbox. I have a hotmail account and it does this no matter which program I use to check emails. I previously used Windows Live Mail, where the problem started,
 and then switched over to Mailbird and it continued. Even when I check my email using the Outlook website, it still puts everything into the spam folder. If anyone has any idea what the problem may be or what a solution could be I'd appreciate it.

<p>
</p><p>This could also be a big Glitch/Bug Microsoft may be working on. Waiting someone with an

                    I purchased a Lumia 1520 from a Microsoft store 9 months ago. I purchased the Complete service plan as insurance in case the phone was damaged. The screen was cracked today&nbsp;and I've spent all day trying to get the phone replaced under the service agreement
 I paid for and have gotten no-where.&nbsp; I live over 2 hours away from a Microsoft Store and should not have to make a 5 hour round trip to have my phone replaced. I was told when we purchased the plan that a new phone would be shipped to me if anything happened.
 So far I have been unable to get anyone from Microsoft to help me. I have called Windows Phone Support at 1-888-665-4228,&nbsp;1-877-696-7786 and the store number which is 315-233-1080 (not that it matters, all store numbers go to the same place)&nbsp;as well as a few
 other numbers. They each have bounced me to other numbers and have not helped. The closest I've gotten to a solution was being told to drive to the store and&nbsp;they would give me a new phone, but they

<div>I see. Thank you for doing your best, Gary. I understand that you have already exhausted all your effort just to rectify this concern and it definitely needs to be checked. Just to let you know that you have
 reached the Technical support for Pcs and laptop devices only. As much as I want to go through your phone settings and get the root cause of the issue, my resources and tools are not applicable for phones and if I insist to work this out, I'm afraid that I
 will just going to compromise it. Please post this concern to our Microsoft community website. They are the one who can best assist you on this. Once you have posted your concern, they will then respond to your thread to provide you some steps that you can
 work on.<br />

</p><p>I have a similar problem and I reset my tablet back to factory and was able to open word files from within word but not from the files menu as you described.&nbsp; Now if I open the word app it will open and I can open the file but if I close the word app on
 my galaxy tab and then try to open word again it fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to turn off the tablet and turn it back on to reopen word again.&nbsp; Are you able to open word at all? &nbsp; My tablet was acting normal until this week also.</p>

<p>Ivan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a iPad with the application on it, however, can not tell you if it's working as I've not tried to open the program on it. &nbsp;I can see how the apple product works later today when I get back home. &nbsp;As far as my phone, I'm able to open the excel application
 via it's own application icon by simply touching the icon then selecting "open" then choose "this device" then choose "SD Card" and access my stored file via that method without needing an internet connection. &nbsp;I'm just spoiled in that I am accustomed to simply
 a two step process of opening "My Files" then selecting the file and it previously always opened. &nbsp;And furthermore, if microsoft broke it with their update they need to release a patch to fix it so it's compatible since it was working fine prior to the recent
 update, just my thoughts.</p>

<p>I struggled with the same issue on my Galaxy Tab A. What finally fixed the problem was using a different file explorer app than the one that comes pre-installed. I'm using an app called Solid Explorer and it opens Excel and Word files stored on the SD card.
 When I try and open the same files with Samsungs My Files app I get the same problem as you, the Excel of Word application screen appears but the files will not open. So if your having this problem try a different file explorer app. I tried a few apps and
 some had the problem as Samsungs app, I was about to give up but finally found some that worked.</p>
<p>I found that this app worked: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.generalmobile.app.gmfilemanager&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
File Manager</a></p>
<p>And this app:&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Solid Explorer</a></p>

            Mr. Faulk, it's quite disheartening that consumers of the products have to find work around fixes for issues created by big software producers that continue to take our $$ yet provide no service and rectification to their created issues.&nbsp; Thank you so
 much for the response and forwarding the information you discovered by trial and error to rectify the problem!!

<h2>            error syncing account</h2>
                    <p>Hello, everybody.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just joined this lively forum that has helped read-only already a couple of times, as I am experiencing same issue on several WP8 devices (Lumia 920 and 1520). It happens repeatedly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my default account, so I have reset my phones to factory default several times and reinstalled the whole thing, but this issue is cross-device and cross releases of the OS (from Black to Cyan).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server I am automatically redirected to is blu402-m.hotmail.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my computer, I am redirected to servers like&nbsp;blu168.mail.live.com instead. It does not give any problems using a mail client elsewhere, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am led to believe that there is a misconfiguration server side in the access rights of the active directory settings. Maybe some good soul in the friendly Microsoft team could have a look, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>best regards and thanks in advance, Armin&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello, Johayber, </p>
<p>
</p><p>are you, by any chance, the Johayber Taher that graduated with honors 2007 in STI Iligan?</p>
<p>
</p><p>... But this aside, may I know, if you have found a moment to check the account? I may add, that according to some company guru, this kind of thing happens, when a checkbox in the LDAP is left unattended...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This guy may be wrong, and it might be something else, but having the <span>blu402-m.hotmail.com replacing my m.hotmail.com entry every single time, leaving me without synching of the standard account after so many hours of checking and rechecking is a bit
 disconcerting and your intervention with regards to this error would be highly appreciated!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is still showing the same 85010014 error as before.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>cheers, Armin</span></p>

                    <p>Original Title: bing maps</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wanting a feature on Bing Maps in the Directions. Lots of times I need to find where Mile Markers are and to say," I-74 west ___, Indiana" for example, doesn't show me exactly where I need to be. I need more help with the location, such as Mile Marker
 149. Bing Maps doesn't bring up mile markers or exit numbers off of the interstate. This would be wonderful to have. Do you think you can make this available?<br />

    <title>Bing image thumbnail issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bing image thumbnail issue</h2>
                    Just the other day, Bing images has gone awry in my HTC Windows 8x. I perform a search and get a page of thumbnails, but when I tap on a thumbnail to enlarge, it just reloads the page of thumbnails. I use Ecosia for content search but Bing is better for
 images. I'm not sure what to do but it's very frustrating.
