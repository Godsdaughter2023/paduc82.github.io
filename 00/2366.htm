<h2>            What is best way to email groups of people in Outlook 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok in Windows Live Mail, if you create a group of people, (PTA committee members), you can email the group by selecting the group from your list of contacts as you are creating an email message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Outlook 2013, I know I can sort&nbsp;a list of contacts by category and then drag and drop over to the mail tab at bottom to email the group, but this seems like a lot for some people to handle, it seems over complicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How should I inform folks that are repeatedly asking me this question? I must be missing something, because I don't see an easier way to do this, and this is a contact manager, this should be the easiest thing to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Contact Groups are not supported in&nbsp;Outlook.com accounts in Outlook 2013 (the problem is EAS protocol but only Outlook.com uses it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll need to Group by category, select the group and choose Email (in the communicate chunk).

<h2>            my account is compromised</h2>
                    <p>i have a account problem that has been continuing for several months to almost a year. is has been blocked. i cant seem to get it back. is has been blocked. i just filled out a recovery form and it said:</p>
<p>We recently received a request to recover your Microsoft account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Unfortunately, our automated system has determined that the information you provided was not sufficient for us to validate your account ownership. Microsoft takes the security
 and privacy of our customers very seriously, and our commitment to protecting your personal information requires that we take the utmost care in ensuring that you are the account owner.
<br />
<br />
We have taken the additional step of blocking your account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** until we can verify you as the account owner. This will prevent any further use of the account, and protect you from any possible malicious activity.<br />
<br />
Please submit a new account verification form<br />
<br />
At this point, your best option is to submit a new form with as much accurate information as you can gather. The more information you can include in the form, the better the chance you’ll have of regaining access to your account. We’ve included a few tips below
 to help you fill out the form as completely as possible. <br />
<br />
&gt; Submit a new form<br />
<br />
Helpful tips for filling out another form:<br />
<br />
Answer as many questions as you can.<br />
Use the information you provided when you created the account, or last updated it.<br />
Submit the form from a computer you frequently use.<br />
You will be asked to list recently used email addresses and the subject lines from recent emails. Ask for help from family members, friends, or business contacts to confirm their email addresses and tell you the subject lines of the last three emails they sent
 you.<br />
Make sure to use the correct domain for your account, such as hotmail.com, live.com, or outlook.com. Keep in mind that your email address may be country specific. For example, if you created your account in Sweden, your domain would be “hotmail.co.se” rather
 than “hotmail.com”. can some one help me unblock my account??? i really need to get in it!!!</p>

            <p>here are the spec's from MS that are needed to run that program&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i7 3820 @ 3.6GHz</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or NVIDIA GTX 1060 (AMD R9 290X or AMD RX 480)</li><li>VRAM: 4GB</li><li>RAM: 12GB</li><li>Hard Drive Type: HDD</li><li>Available Space: 55GB</li><li>Resolution: 1920 x 1080</li><li>Windows Version: Windows Anniversary Edition 64-bit&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Here is a list of PC issues:</p>
PC Specific Issues
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some antivirus software packages cause the game to exit unexpectedly shortly after launch</li><li>Microphones sometimes aren't being detected for ANNA on PC</li><li>Can't start a convoy on wheel unless you create a custom wheel profile.</li><li>Moving the mouse during races on PC causes the game to swap briefly to mouse control.</li><li>Logitech G27 not recognised on PC.</li><li>Thrustmaster TX Leather Edition not recognised in UI, can't save settings (PC).</li><li>Support for all Thrustmaster TX variants to be added on PC.</li><li>Accelerator/Decelerator deadzones don't work on PC.</li><li>Improved Advanced Controller Options for Wheels coming to PC in our next update.</li><li>Unable to rewind when returning to Solo from co-op and online free-roam.</li><li>Club member status doesn't update unless you reboot.</li><li>Visual vehicle upgrades occasionally don't apply without a reboot.</li><li>Racing line can disappear when saving settings on PC.</li><li>Visible pop-in of objects when switching to/from cockp
</blockquote>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Keep in mind this list will likely be updated as more people begin to play the game and encounter bugs and issues that have not been discovered yet.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Bottom line is try installing on your C drive and see if it works you can always delete or move it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Forza</p>
<p>Adjusted my preferences to install future apps on my larger D drive</p>
<p>Tried to download the game again but the download would not complete and I'd come across my error.</p>

            <p>Forza games are huge. &nbsp;When you change the Storage - Save Locations in Settings, there is no nice progress indicator at all. &nbsp;It's best to just leave it for a long time after any change is made here, as it affects every App that can be relocated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have Forza Motorsport 6: Apex, but it is 19GB and I had my D: drive chosen for Apps prior to installing it. &nbsp;If you find the Forza game in Storage you can get to a screen that allows for Reset of the App. &nbsp;You could first try running wsreset.exe to
 reset the Store App.</p>

<h2>            Security email to validate my account within 72 hours</h2>
                    <p>14th January I attempted to change some information on my account for security - a phone number.<br />
I received an email confirmation about this from Microsoft Account Team (email: 
<span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>). The email told me that "if it was me that attempted to do this change I could ignore the email, and wait 30 days for the number to change" - so I am doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>21st January I received another email from Outlook Team.com (<span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>). It said:<br />
"Dear User, You are receiving this due to errors encountered during validity verification process on email accounts. You are advised to validate your account within 72 hours to avoid suspension of use. Thanks, The Microsoft Team" then there is a blue box hyper
 link 'Update Now'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can&nbsp;anyone advise me. I don't want my account suspended. I did attempt to change the phone number - which I thought was successful, and I was waiting the 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? Is the 2nd email real?</p>

 and once there &nbsp;black and white horizontal lines across the screen. Most of the time the screen is black. I have try soft reset and hard reset but nothing changed. I have plugged it into my pc but nothing changed. Anyone have any ideas to solve this problem.

<h3> david milling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-install Office Business and Home 2010 on same computer after windows 8.1 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have a pc with Windows 8, bought last year. &nbsp;purchased Office Home and Business 2010 online and received product key.</p>
<p>My computer recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 when I did not want it to. &nbsp;This is my media/sound room computer at church. &nbsp;I lost all functionality to do what I normally do with it. &nbsp;I had to refresh my computer to get back to Windows 8, but as a result I
 had to re-install Office 2010.</p>
<p>I still have my product key, and it goes through the process of accepting it and trying to activate, but then every time I re-open one of the programs (i.e. Powerpoint, Word), it is still in the trial mode.</p>
<p>How do I get it to actually accept the product key, when it goes through the motions? &nbsp;I read in another post that they are supposed to be smart enough to recognize when the same product key is being activated again on the same computer. &nbsp;I'm starting to
 wonder.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I tried removing the Office programs that was on my computer, and going to the site in your link to download the setup file. &nbsp;I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The Office 2010 Product Key provided represents a product which is not eligible for free download. Please check your Product ID and try again, or check the list of eligible products. If your product is not eligible, you may be interested in downloading
 a free trial of Office 2010 at http://buyoffice.microsoft.com. Contact Customer Support.</p>
<p>So it will not allow me to get the version that I had. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to have to buy another newer version to use on the same machine that I already had it on, because of an update to Windows that i did not want to begin with,.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Media Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott p. c.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Media Player</h2>
                    <p>I have continual problems ripping and burning backup CDs on media player on 64 bit Windows 10 on a pretty good new PC.&nbsp; Media Player shows me all sorts of conflicting info about versions and problem file icons.&nbsp; One out of six blank CDs from a company starting
 with a V actually does burn.&nbsp; I throw the rest in the trash, as they are ruined quickly if Media Player doesn't like one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Media Player version is copyrighted 2013 and is version 12.0.15063.608.&nbsp; It doesn't say if it for 64 bit or not.&nbsp; I also bought from a different well-known software company, and the things it was supposed to do are incredible for $30.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
 it rips files to somewhere in the either that I've never been able to find, and their tech support is so bad that you have to make an appointment several days in advance by email for them to phone you or set up a chat.&nbsp; I told them to cancel and return my
 money.&nbsp; Their web help sucks worse than when MS continually takes one to a general help screen in response to a specific question.</p>

<p>How the hell do I figure out this message when Media Player does work, but doesn't work well?&nbsp; Does anyone think I should actually download an XP version?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, at times I get a message that a music file is bad and to click the icon next to the file.&nbsp; Do you see an icon?&nbsp; I don't.&nbsp; The asterisks by the last two files represent bonus tracks, not problem icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5aec38a-b703-4de1-89ea-94522cfe836c" />I guess this is just another example of the utter crap that MS foisted on us with Windows 10.&nbsp; How many major updates have
 there been now?&nbsp; I've lost track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me have better success with backing up my CD library, I'd appreciate it.&nbsp; I don't care if you recommend a different software company although MS probably wouldn't like it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Scott - It's the lack of maintenance of WMP that is the problem - this is happening on
<p><strong>Power2Go </strong>for disc creation... I've tested it and it seems to work reliably, although when I do need to burn a disc I usually use
<strong>iTunes for Windows</strong>. There is another reliable free version called
<strong>imgburn</strong> available (but they do tend to nag you to buy the full version!)</p>
<p>There are ways of getting WMP working but none of them tend to last so if you want to burn discs frequently (and without wastage) use another program. (It may also be worth buying a few CD/RW discs so that you can run test burns - that cuts down the coaster
 count!) - Ric.</p>

<p>RicW, Thank you very much for your help.&nbsp; Microsoft sent me an email and response above telling me to uninstall and reinstall Media Player, which did not help.&nbsp; I have your email copied in case MS will not let me get back to it for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to start at the top of your list and try that first.&nbsp; Cyberlink was pre-installed, and will do a free trial, but then it is only about $12, no problem.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, I'll go to your next suggestion, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My brother also happens to think that the CD manufacturer, which starts with a V makes lousy CDs.&nbsp; I just started on a new spindle that I bought several years ago, so I will see how they work with Cyberlink as a first step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't a shame that we have to get help from the "community" with these kind of issues, instead of from Microsoft?&nbsp; That blows my mind that they wrote buggy Windows 10 and do not do good support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll bet one of your suggestions will work, and I'll be happy to be done with Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, do NOT use CD software from a well known software developer starting with a C, known for drawing programs, and having a good reputation.&nbsp; They downloaded three icons to my desktop.&nbsp; I could not get any of their software to work.&nbsp; Their express CD burner
 needed a setup and then a reboot.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it wanted the same thing after the reboot, and it took the same circle the next day.&nbsp; That software is now uninstalled, I've asked for my money back, and I'm going to write to the President of the company,
 who is not minding the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks Ric.</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback... with disc technology firmly in the back seat (despite the fact many people still use it) there are many pitfalls with CD creation... many optical drives are not great - blank CD stock can be old/poorly stored and can degrade -
 and pedigree does not seem to guarantee durability... e.g. I was 'given' a stack of unbranded discs with my first desktop many years ago and they are still looking and performing as good as new. Other famous name brands have not lasted the distance and quite
 a few commercial issues in my collection have 'rusted' and are unplayable (whereas I can still play the vinyl originals that are 30 years older!)</p>
<p>I have iTunes for Windows because I also own a Marantz streaming amp and iPad - that makes it the best player for my purposes by a mile... the fact that it&nbsp;makes discs and has a built-in file converter is a bonus, but it is a bit of a heavyweight just for
 burning ops. It is a shame that WMP has been very much sidelined (I still use it for library management) but with Groove Music now also more or less on the scrapheap it looks as though MS is happy to delegate providing this stuff to PC makers!</p>
<p>Best - R.</p>

<p>RicW, Sorry I did not get back to you earlier.&nbsp; My PC caught the flu and was in the Geek Squad shop where I had the worst five agents ever, all in a row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because these other problems took precedence, I just wanted to let you know that I did try Cyberlink and it worked on the first try.&nbsp; Who knows if it will work next time?&nbsp; If not, I will continue to follow your software suggestions.</p>

</p><p><span>Hi Ben,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forum. I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Which operating system and web browser are you using to download Windows 10 Technical Preview?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Which antivirus program are you using?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The download size for Windows 10 Technical Preview 64 bit is 3.81 GB. If the downloaded file is less then the download is not completed successfully. There might be several reasons why you may face this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I would suggest you to download the Windows 10 Technical Preview in safe mode with networking and check if you are able to download successfully.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check if issue occurs in <strong>Safe mode with networking</strong>, you can start Windows in different advanced troubleshooting modes to help you find and fix problems on your PC.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Try saving the Windows 10 Technical Preview setup file on different location. Check if you have enough space on the hard drive. You can try
</span>performing <strong>Clean Boot</strong> and check. Follow the Microsoft KB article to perform clean boot on the computer. A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Anybody else having the band crash their phone&#63;</h2>
                    I've only had it a couple of days and I've a few times had the experience that my phone has crashed. I activate it, see the screen photo, slide this up and then nothing happens and the photo reappears. I have to switch the phone right off (soft reset?)
 and then back on again. I have Live Lock Screen Beta so it's just possible that the incompatibility is that but I had no problems before I got the band.

<h2>            Office 2013 - Activation for non mail enabled active directory accounts</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have&nbsp;a number of non-mail enabled user accounts. These account require access to Office 2013&nbsp;in order to work but do not require a mailbox (or the cost associated with having a mailbox in Office 365).
</p>
<p>As dirsync only synchronizes mail enabled accounts, when they open Office it asks them to activate (which they can't because the account doesn't exist in Office 365)</p>
<p>What are my options for activating these accounts? </p>

<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>Based on your description, you can directly create these users in Office 365 cloud. After that, you only assign Office365 Business or ProPlus licenses to them. Then they can activate Office 365 applications.</p>
<p>If you have any other requirements, please feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Erick, </p>
<p>I have tried this and it doesn't give the seamless user experience I was hoping for, the user has to enter a password each time they want to activate Office.
</p>
<p>It looks like mail enabling is the only option to get the seamless user experience.

<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>Given your description, your organization is using ADFS. So the synced user will not need to enter the password to activate Office 365 Pro Plus. For the user created in cloud, they are not federated accounts. They need to enter the user name and password
 to activate Office.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

    <title>Style Separators - both halves now showing in TOC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jen__again  say:</h3>
<h2>            Style Separators - both halves now showing in TOC</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Style Separators for a long time now, to force only the first part of a heading to show up in the TOC. I'm now working on a document with style separators, and all of a sudden both "halves" of the title are showing in the TOC, on separate
 lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example - my document looks like this:</p>
<p>1.1 Heading Text {style separator} - subtext</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whereas previously my TOC would have just said</p>
<p>1.1 Heading Text</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it says&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1 Heading Text</p>
<p>1.2 - subtext</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the text as well, it now jumps from 1.1 to 1.3 because it's seeing the subtext as 1.2 (even though it isn't numbered that way).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking some setting must have changed (I recently got a new laptop)...any ideas on how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Those symptoms both imply that the subtext has the same style applied to it as the heading text, so the style separator is doing nothing more than placing both paragraphs on the same line. If the formatting appears to change after the style separator, that
 should mean that there's direct formatting applied to the subtext to make it look like body text. I'm able to force that situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d67149c8-c197-40ea-ac0e-a100c3de4dc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d67149c8-c197-40ea-ac0e-a100c3de4dc8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(It's useful to add the Style box to the Quick Access Toolbar; it always shows the name of the style at the cursor.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>First try clearing any direct formatting of the subtext by selecting the text and pressing Ctrl+spacebar. Then apply the correct paragraph style of Normal or Body Text or whatever you're using. The numbering will adjust automatically, and then you need to
 update the TOC.</p>

<p>Thank you both for your replies. I'm so confused by this, because I have literally been doing this for years without any issues, and I have not changed anything about the way I do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use this when I have either a heading or a figure/table caption (with one of those styles applied) and want only the first part of it to show in in the TOC/TOF. The way I have always done it was from a website I originally found linked on this forum, using
 the method below with a heading as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type the entire heading as I want it to look on the page, with the desired heading style applied. E.g., "<strong>This is my heading - with some subtext</strong>"</li><li>Place the mouse after the text I want to show in the TOC. So here, I would place my mouse right after "heading"</li><li>Type Enter --&gt; 2 separate headings now</li><li>Select the pilcrow after "heading" and do Ctrl+Shift+H to make it hidden</li><li>Place my cursor in the first part of the heading (the part I want to be in the TOC) and click Alt+Ctrl+Enter --&gt; magically have both bits on the same line, with the same formatting, with a hidden pilcrow in between&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>This doesn't seem to match with the way I see this written up elsewhere (and in your replies), with having to apply different styles to both bits, etc. But I have always done it this way and suddenly it stopped working. Is there something odd about this
 method that, combined with some other recent and silent Word change, has made it stop working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to have to change the method if there is some setting I can change back to make it work again (not to mention, it's going to mess up a lot of existing documents).&nbsp;</p>

<p>That method works for table captions and figure captions, because the table TOC and figure TOC stop collecting text at the first (hidden) paragraph mark after the caption's label. It does not work for headings because the main TOC collects any text with
 the specified styles. Any text that you want to have omitted from the TOC must have a style other than one of the heading styles. Your method applies the same style to both parts of the heading, and the style separator does nothing to change that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option setting that will make the method work for headings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read the "<span>Hidden paragraph mark" and "</span><span>Lead-in emphasis and style separator" sections of
<a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/RunInSidehead.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/RunInSidehead.htm</a>. Note especially the paragraph</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>Format the first paragraph as Heading 3 (or whatever style you’re using for this heading level) and the second paragraph as Body Text (or whatever text
 you’re using for the text paragraphs).</span></p>
<p><span>In your case, you should create a custom style that has the same font formatting as the Heading
 X style (for X = 1, 2, etc.), but based on the Normal style rather than on Heading X. Because the Normal style has an outline level of "Body Text" and the custom style inherits that, the TOC will not include any text to which the custom style is applied. Use
 the custom style for the second paragraph, and otherwise follow the instructions.</span></p>

            To add to what Charles and Jay have said, note that you do not need to format the paragraph mark as Hidden when using a style separator, but you do have to have two separate paragraphs with two different styles. When you have different styles, you can
 place the insertion point anywhere in the first paragraph and insert the style separator, which has the same effect as making the paragraph Hidden except that the two paragraphs appear combined even when you have Hidden text (and other nonprinting characters)
 displayed.

<h2>            Clicking on &#34;Open event&#34; and &#34;Edit&#34; don&#39;t work for me in outlook.live.com</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the change to the new&nbsp;outlook.live.com, selecting an Event/Appointment in my Outlook Calendar and then clicking on "Open event" or "Edit" does nothing. Clicking on "Delete" does work as I get the &nbsp;"Are you sure you want to delete this event" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried it on Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome and it's the same on both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this issue and does anyone have a solution?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you with this, double-click the event either in the calendar or the one on the right side. Refer to the screenshot below:</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried d<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ouble-clicking today's Events (in the calendar and then the one on the right side) and nothing happened.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I then started double-clicking on events from previous weeks. If the Event was created by someone else (i.e. they sent me the calendar event and I accepted it) it opened every time (either by double-clicking
 on the Event or by selecting it then clicking on "Open event"). Events I created myself only opened sometimes. For example, I double-clicked on an Event from September the 7th and it opened. I closed it and then tried to open it again by double-clicking on
 it. It didn't open. The&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Open event" and "Edit" buttons also did not work either.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this on two different Windows 10 PCs so the issue must be something to do with the new Outlook.</p>

            <p>I am still suffering this issue so I thought I would try doing some tests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I double-clicked on tomorrow's date in my Calendar. I created a new Event then saved it. From the Calendar, I double-clicked on the new Event and it opened. I closed the Event and then clicked on&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Open
 event" from the right side of the screen. The Event opened. I closed it and then tried clicking on "Edit". Again the Event opened. I changed the date of the Event from tomorrow's date to today's date then saved it. The Event moved to today. I was then able
 to double-click the Event, &nbsp;select&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Open event" and "Edit" and it worked.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As my next test I </span>
double-clicked on today's date in my Calendar then&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">created another new Event and saved it. I tried to double-click on the Event and nothing happened. I tried&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Open
 event" and "Edit" and neither worked.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It therefore seems to be the case that new Events created in my Calendar for future dates can be opened and edited. Events created for the current date cannot be opened or edited.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Newly created Events can be Opened and Edited (as long as they weren't put in my calendar for the current day). Events created before the switch to the new Outlook can only occasionally be Opened or Edited
 (I've literally just successfully opened an old Event, closed it and then a minute later tried to open it again and it wouldn't open).</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>What is the Operating System installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to use any other websites?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you try using different web browser?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make changes to the computer before the issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the methods listed below.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Open Internet Explorer (IE) in no add-ons mode and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the
<b>Start</b> button, and select <b>All Programs</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<b>Accessories</b>, and select <b>System Tools.</b></span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow
 you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the “Disable add-ons” section in the following article for further instructions:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Please reset Internet Explorer by using the link below</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important</span></b><span>: When you reset Internet Explorer 8 settings, all add-ons
 and customizations are deleted, and you basically start with a fresh version of Internet Explorer. It does not delete your favorites, feeds, and Web Slices.</span></p>

<h2>            Office 365 crashes on Mac - Majove &#40;10.14.3&#41;</h2>
                    Hi <br />
 <br />
Since upgrading to Mojave, most Office products crash OR crash my MAC (in work, not my home account). <br />
 <br />
My Mac specs are: <br />
 <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88b792f8-6f52-4389-98a7-459010a92240?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88b792f8-6f52-4389-98a7-459010a92240?upload=true" /></a><br />
 <br />
Outlook crashes when trying to download any attached files, either clicking the "Download All" link or choosing "Save As" from the dropdown next to the file. <br />
 <br />
Word doesn't open if I double click on the document (which should open the app). It crashes when I try to save a document, even a new one with just a word or two in it. <br />
 <br />
Both of the above apps, when crashing, forces a (Not responding) error on Finder and also other apps are affected. The worst one is Adobe InDesign. If Outlook or Word freeze, for some reason InDesign freezees, as well as Finder and can often lead to me having
 to force restart the MAC using the power button.  Not ideal!<br />
 <br />
It's getting REALLY frustrating. <br />
 <br />
Outlook is version 16.22.1 (190220) and Word is version 16.22 (190211). <br />
 <br />
Another issue is after one of the apps has crashed, EVEN the "Crash Reporter" that pops up to send the error doesn't work and crashes! <br />
 <br />
Any ideas? <br />
Cheers <br />

<p>Hi G,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience. We would like to assist you in resolving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems all the issues are caused by upgrading to Mojave version 10.14.3. The process of upgrading might affect the parts of Office internal files. To narrow down if the issue might be caused by corrupted files both in Outlook and Word, we suggest you try&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>accessing
 Safe Mode on Mac</span></a><span> to ensure it is not caused by
</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25614?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>incompatible login items</span></a><span>.</span><br />
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists under safe mode, it's most likely related to Office client. For example, some feature files are corrupted. Given the situation, we would suggest you reinstall the standalone Word or Outlook for Mac install package
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> first. If reinstalling Word or Outlook doesn't fix the corresponding issue, I recommend
<span>uninstalling Office completely to fix this issue. For the detailed steps of uninstalling your Office for Mac, please refer to this article:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.office.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2Ftroubleshoot-office-for-mac-issues-by-completely-uninstalling-before-you-reinstall-ec3aa66e-6a76-45****saDV%2FqscCpn5ymafpUYJ12%2FNzgO3fu70OMy1%2BQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot
 Office for Mac issues by completely uninstalling before you reinstall</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since the error report also doesn't work, we will try to collect logs when the issue remains by using the ways above. So feel free to post back and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>I had this exact problem the only way I resolved the problem was restoring my Mac Mini back to a prior date before it was upgraded to 10.14.3. &nbsp;Then office worked again on 10.14.2. &nbsp;I turned off all updates until someone resolved this issue and soon.</p>

<h2>            Incompatible Office Products are installed on your Machine after  Windows 10 installed an update on 13&#47;8&#47;15</h2>
                    <p>Everything was fine until a windows update yesterday. Searching suggests I have the stand alone OneDrive client but I don't. As far as I know I only have 32 bit office products installed (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 and Viso 2010). How do I find
 the conflicting products so that I can uninstall it?</p>

            <p>The error is seen when opening both&nbsp; spreadsheet and word documents. The exact message is as per attached and is the same in both word and excel. Both the word and excel files opened prior to the update without error. On clicking OK to the message, the file
 (be it word or excel file) then opens as expected. One other interesting point - after the update I could not locate the said file using the recent used list and had to manually navigate to where the files were located.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2dea3c6-719a-428b-baa4-41dc26dffe3a" /></p>

            <p>I have resolved my issues as follow but not sure why. I had checked task manager and notice that Microsoft Office Document Task (32 bit) process was taking a huge amount of CPU resource (upwards 35%) and no doubt contibuting to my PC running slower than
 it should be. I then took the following actions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. in task tray open up Microsoft Upload Center by right clicking -&gt; settings - nb mine said no files are pending upload when hovering over it which is odd given how much CPU it was hogging</p>
<p>2. check box to delete files from cache when they are closed</p>
<p>3. press the delete cached files button</p>
<p>4. close and restart PC</p>
<p>5. return to Microsoft Upload Center and recheck the delete files from cache</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine machine is now back to what it was and moreover does not complain when opening documents.</p>

            Hi Tim. Sorry this didn't work for you. I cann't now recreate as through other issues with Windows 10 (like file explorer refusing to connect to NAS devices) I ended up having to refresh Windows 10 and then re-installing my applications and lo and behold
 no more problems.

<h2>            Office 365 on laptop keeps asking to activate office all apps</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I recently installed office 365 back onto my desktop after windows 10 destroyed my desktop machine during an upgrade. I reinstalled windows 8 &amp; then installed office apps back to this machine.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Now any Office apps on my laptop</span> keep asking to activate office, I have five license agreement &amp; am only using 365 on 4 computers.</p>
<p>My account says I only have four licenses being used &amp; that my laptop is one of them.</p>
<p>I am signing in to both computers using my outlook account which is also my office 365 account, not sure why it keeps asking me to activate office ??</p>
