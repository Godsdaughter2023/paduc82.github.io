<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Has it <strong>worked properly before</strong>? Does it <strong>work with other applications</strong>?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know what <strong>exact Skype version</strong> you have installed on your device?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try <strong>uninstalling </strong>and <strong>reinstalling </strong>the Skype application:

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; The camera worked fine for a few years up until about a year ago, maybe when I updated to version 7 of Skype.&nbsp; I just lived with it.&nbsp; Then today I updated to version 8.30.0.50. hoping the problem would be corrected but no.&nbsp; The camera
 works fine with Facebook Messenger

<p>I cannot tell from that diagnostic what driver you are running or even the exact camera model. Based on the ASUS support site, you more than likely have a Sonix-based camera. Try to update your camera drivers to those drivers to see if anything changes.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are already using those drivers, try the generic "USB Video Device" drivers that come with the OS. Below is an example of how I can change to either driver with my camera.</p>

            Success!&nbsp; My laptop was using a "USB Camera" driver.&nbsp; I looked for an update for that driver and loaded a "USB Video Device" driver.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; Then I loaded the Sonix driver you suggested and that seems to have done the trick.&nbsp; Thanks a lot.

<h2>            Nested &#40;IIF &#43; CDate&#41; formula help</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the CDATE function to modify dates formatted as text, to be formatted as actual dates with success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EX) I am changing the date values that are formatted as 20180901 to 09/01/2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also trying to change the date values that are listed as "00000000" to "", but I am failing when I try to combine the two functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EX) Iif([PSTNG_DATE]="00000000","",[PSTNG_DATE])</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is what I thought would work, but doesn't:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Iif([PSTNG_DATE]="00000000","",CDate(Mid([PSTNG_DATE],5,2) &amp; "/" &amp; RIGHT([PSTNG_DATE],2) &amp; "/" &amp; LEFT([PSTNG_DATE],4))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me with the above formula to change the "00000000" to blanks and the text date format to a date format in one formula in MS ACCESS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>You can convert to a <em>Variant </em>holding a date value for date strings and
<em>Null </em>for zero-strings, and reduce it a little:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">VariantDate = CVDate(IIf([PSTNG_DATE]="00000000", Null, Format([PSTNG_DATE], "@@@@-@@-@@")))</p>

<p>
</p><p>Or, as an <em>expression </em>for a textbox to which you can apply normal formatting of dates:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">=CVDate(IIf([PSTNG_DATE]="00000000",Null,Format([PSTNG_DATE],"@@@@-@@-@@")))</p>

    <title>Bug in SharePoint Online&#39;s New Interface - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brent&#39;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug in SharePoint Online&#39;s New Interface</h2>
                    <p>This is an issue we've only just noticed in using the new SharePoint Online interface. We use a managed metadata field/column that is linked to a closed term set and have this set as optional. This means that users can choose tags from a dropdown or leave
 it blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the classic interface, there are no issues with removing tags from that column/field and leaving it blank, but when attempting to do so with the new interface, an error is shown to indicate that it is 'required' despite being an optional field.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/384fdcd2-abf4-413e-aa27-8bb42cbf463c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/384fdcd2-abf4-413e-aa27-8bb42cbf463c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem only occurs when a tag has been applied and a user attempts to remove the tag so that it becomes blank again.</p>

<p>Hi Brent,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I suggest you confirm if you have checked Yes under the option “Require that this column contains information” on the list or library which is using New experience:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ab89810-4973-426f-b5de-79b7b002284a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ab89810-4973-426f-b5de-79b7b002284a" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>1. Sign into the list or library which is using new experience.</p>
<p>2. Click Settings&gt;select List Setting.</p>
<p>3. Click the column under Columns</p>
<p>4. Check if check Yes under the option “Require that this column contains information”, if so, please select No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The screenshot of the affected column’s settings.</p>
<p>2. Confirm if you use the same list or library with the new experience and classic experience.</p>
<p>3. Check if all lists and libraries have the situation.</p>
<p>4. Confirm if you reproduce the issue via the following steps:</p>
<p>a. Add a new item, select a value on the managed metadata column.</p>
<p>b. Edit the item&gt;remove the value&gt;can’t save.</p>
<p>5. The steps about how to create the affected column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Qing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the prompt reply. What I'm seeing is slightly different to your screenshot, but still similar.</p>
<p>When going to Settings &gt; Library Settings and then selecting the column, I see:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1141458-94c5-413d-afcb-4993d920a4d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1141458-94c5-413d-afcb-4993d920a4d6" /></a></p>
<p>It is using a closed term set, and so Fill-in choices have been automatically disabled. There is no default value. Under List Content Type, it is possible to see that the column is set to optional:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03358ce0-adad-49b5-a2f0-263f61ced6bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03358ce0-adad-49b5-a2f0-263f61ced6bf" /></a></p>
<p>We did indeed test the same document library (our site only has one document library) with the new and classic experience. The issue only occurs in the new experience. As shown in the screenshot below, when uploading a document to the library, it is not
 marked as a required field and I am allowed to leave it blank.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85fd9f9b-c147-400b-bef5-875bd8dde6e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85fd9f9b-c147-400b-bef5-875bd8dde6e8" /></a></p>
<p>However, after selecting a value in the 'Client' field and saving it, I receive the error message shown in the screenshot of my original post stating "You must specify a value for this required field."</p>

    <title>Hyperlinks in Body of Doc Die when Saved As PDF - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hyperlinks in Body of Doc Die when Saved As PDF</h2>
                    
<p>I created a document in Word 2010 Beta.&nbsp; All was lovely until I tried to export the document to a PDF.&nbsp; First I tried the built in "save as" function.&nbsp; The document looks fine, but only the hyperlinks in the footer remained alive in the PDF.&nbsp; All of the
 hyperlinks in the body of the document ceased to function, and when hovered over in Acrobat Reader, display a malformed link that appears to start with a hard return and then "URI:" and the link.&nbsp; The ones in the footer start with "http:" as they should.</p>
<p>All of the links were created the same way (Ctrl+K and type in the URL).&nbsp; I even created a whole new document and moved the contents over manually, re-creating each link as I went.&nbsp; Same problem.</p>
<p>I also had problems with the graphics, of which all but one were native Word Shapes - when PDFed, they appeared with black boxes around them.&nbsp; I had to recreate all of the shapes in GIMP and bring them in as traditional graphics.&nbsp; Word 2010 apparently cannot
 handle exporting its own native shapes.</p>
<p>I had the same problems using Word's export to PDF function, printing to Nitro PDF, PrimoPDF (which comes closest to getting it), CutePDF, Acrobat 6, and Acrobat 9 Pro Extended (eval version), so I'm darn sure that this is a Word problem.</p>
<p>I need to have this document made into a functional PDF with living hyperlinks by the end of today or I'm toast - $$$$ LOST! - what was supposed to be an afternoon's work has turned into three DAYS.&nbsp; I have never seen this problem with any previous version
 of Word, and unfortunately, since this is a new computer and my old one was given to a family member, I can't roll back to an older version.&nbsp; I may end up having to do this in OpenOffice or LibreOffice which won't be as nice, but at least will be functional!</p>
<p>Help!</p>

The problem with the graphics is probably because of the default setting for compression Go to Word Options, Advanced tab and check the Do Not Compress Images in this FIle and make sure to set
 it for All Documents. Then reinsert the images into the file.</p>

<p>Ok, I tried setting to no compression with an older version of this document that still had the Word art in it, and yes, it got rid of the black boxes, but now the text entered on these shapes does not show.</p>
<p>I am still at a complete loss about the hyperlinks.&nbsp; I even reconstructed the document in Publisher 2007 ... when I make a PDF,&nbsp; none of the body links work, but the footer links do, just like in Word 2010.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM:&nbsp; I ended up having to recreate the document in LibreOffice.&nbsp; It does not look as nice, but the links work.</p>

<p>Hi Surya,</p>
<p>I am using Reader 9.3.&nbsp; It is the newest.&nbsp; I am a documentation professional with over 25 years of experience, so I'm pretty used to making PDFs from Word and other apps.&nbsp; ;o)</p>
<p>XPS looks lovely and the links work, but only Acrobat and CutePDF will make a PDF that is readable from this format.&nbsp; PrimoPDF made a PDF in which the layout and graphics looked right, but the text was rendered in a mixture of weird fonts, looked like what
 you get when you print out a graphic file in text format (I've never actually seen a Windows box do that before...I've always seen that particular behavior on a Mac).&nbsp; All of the PDFs had the same working footer links and dead body links.&nbsp; BTW, clicking the
 Acrobat 9 icon inside of IE resulted in an error message that said Acrobat did not recognize the file type as a web page.&nbsp; But when I opened Acrobat separately and dragged in the file without IE open, it converted just fine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the body links
 were still dead.</p>
<p>HTML destroyed the formatting, but the links worked in the HTML and in the PDF.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the PDF was not usable due to the trashed formatting.</p>
<p>RTF also looks perfect and the links work inside Word, and the PDFs come out looking nice, but with the exact same dead body links.</p>
<p>For grins, I opened up a brand new document and applied no custom styles, no graphics, and no header or footer.&nbsp; Just a vanilla plain, straight out of Word default settings document.&nbsp; I added links to my web site and to CNN, saved, and made a PDF.&nbsp; The PDF
 comes out with the same malformed links as occurred in the documentation suite I've been struggling with over the past week.</p>
<p>I then made a version with a simple footer, using the first selection available from the list of footers, and added a link to Microsoft.&nbsp; When I made the PDF, *NONE* of the hyperlinks worked.</p>
<p>BTW, to make the links, I highlighted the text and typed Ctrl+K.&nbsp; I set the Target Frame to New Window and selected the check box to set as default for all links.</p>
<p>This is what the malformed links look like when hovered over in the PDF...note that the cursor does not turn into a hand.</p>
<span>
<p>***************************<br />
* (blank line)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; *<br />
* URI:http://www.cnn.com/ *<br />
***************************</p>
</span>
<p>As you can see, that is completely abnormal.&nbsp; A normal link is just the URL and the cursor turns into a hand.</p>
<p>Then I realized that in the documentation suite I've been working on, the footer link is one that Word generates automatically when you type in a full URL.&nbsp; So I made another version of the plain test document with two types of footers - one with the hyperlink
 made via Ctrl+K and one made by typing out the URL and letting Word make the link.&nbsp; In the resulting PDF, the hyperlink in the footer made with Ctrl+K was completely dead, and the one made with the whole URL and letting Word create the hyperlink worked.&nbsp; So
 I added an automatically created hyperlink to the body, and guess what...the automatically made version worked!</p>
So then I started playing around with the settings for the PDF generation.&nbsp; I had been using Standard size, and accepting the default settings, which I believe was Page range: All, Publish What: Document, Include Non-printing Information: Document properties
 + Document structure tags, PDF Options: ISO 19005-1 compliant (PDF/A).&nbsp; On this pass, I deselected ISO19005-1, and NOW the body links all work, but the footer link that was NOT automatically generated is still dead.&nbsp; So this points to a mangled hand-over to
 PDF-A, and still there is an inconsistency between how body links and footer links are handled.
<p>I would be happy to send you a copy of this file and the PDF so you can verify it for yourself.</p>
<p>I regenerated one of my project files, and the links were still dead.&nbsp; I then unchecked the "bitmap text" checkbox and regenerated the PDF.&nbsp; Still nothing.&nbsp; I reapplied styles to remove custom formatting of the hyperlinks (so they would match the color of
 the surrounding text...and the links then worked.</p>
<p>So that means there are the following BUGS concerning handoff of hyperlinks to PDF:</p>
<ul>
<li>handoff of hyperlinks (plain formatted or not, I tested) to PDF/A format </li><li>handoff of hyperlinks made by Ctrl+K in the footer (plain formatted or not) </li><li>handoff of hyperlinks that are applied to text with ANY styles or colors applied.</li></ul>
<p>I mentioned that I am a documentation professional.&nbsp; It really looks bad to have generic blue hyperlinks in an otherwise polished document.&nbsp; I am also concerned about the inability to write an ISO compliant file:&nbsp; that may be an issue to some clients.</p>
<p>Microsoft also needs to test all of the built-in styles for headers and footers, as well as all of the colors and styles that can be applied to text for compatibility with saving to PDF, as they are not all working correctly.&nbsp; Even with setting documents
 to "no compression" some of the footer styles with page numbers don't PDF correctly.&nbsp; I did not test them all, but at least 2 footer styles convert to PDF with an ugly black box on them.&nbsp; Every feature packaged in Word should come out correctly when saved
 to PDF.&nbsp; If it can't, it should be removed or otherwise labeled as not for use in documents that will be made into PDFs.</p>

            <p>Often Acrobat's default installation setup configures it&nbsp;to remove hyperlinks when converting from Word.&nbsp; To correct this, open Adobe Acrobat and

            Hello&nbsp;
<div>Are your links to external urls or to bookmarks in the Word doc? I have had the same (3 day) problem with links (inserted into SmartArt - so formatting not the issue) to bookmarks that work beautifully in Word, but as soon as I save to PDF, the links die.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Test: change one hyperlink in the Word doc to link to another file etc, save to PDF and presto it opens the file in my browser - which leads me to my own question, why doesn't it open the original file?</div>

            <p>Yes, this is an old question, but it's still relevant. One answer, which works very effectively for Word's built-in PDFing, is to:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click File &gt; Save As</li><li>Set Save as Type &gt; PDF</li><li>Click Options &gt; PDF Options &gt; turn on ISO 19005-1 compliant (PDF/A)</li><li>OK, Save</li></ol>
<p>(Instructions from Word 2010 (Windows), but should be quite similar in current versions)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>It works every time to preserve hyperlinks</li><li>It's native to Word - no extra software required, and it'll work on anyone's computer who's using Word (this can be really handy in corporate environments)</li></ul>
<p>Downside: It can generate larger files compared to, say, Nitro PDF. My test two-page document had embedded fonts, one extra colour, and a few paragraph borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Word: 3537 Kb</li><li>PDFed by Nitro: 96 Kb</li><li>PDFed by Word: 356 Kb</li></ul>
<p>Yes, those are small numbers in 2017, and I haven't tested whether those ratios actually mean much, but just do a moment of testing in case you end up needing to PDF a large file. Not all your recipients are on desktop computers with unlimited bandwidth.
 :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>@virge456, what does/doesn't happen - what is the mode of failure, and when/where does it fail?</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the exact steps you're using to create the link in Word?</li><li>Does the link open as expected in Word?</li><li>What happens when you XPS it?</li><li>What PDF reader are you using?</li><li>Do you get any different results using a different PDF reader?</li></ul>
<p>What do you get when you hover over what should be a link?</p>
<ul>
<li>No response at all, as if it were just text?</li><li>A hint that it may be a link (like hovertext, or it gives you the finger), but nothing happens when you click?</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>A hint that it may be a link (like hovertext, or it gives you the finger), and it appears to have responded to the click, but the browser doesn't open? (Marginally different from the above question.)</li><li>A clickable link that opens a browser but the destination fails to load?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>BTW the solution that worked for me (above) is purely within Word and using Word's PDF conversion. (My preference is to use as few applications as possible.) I am not familiar enough with the deep details of how other applications may make the conversion;
 you may have better luck using a third-party app.</p>

    <title>Problems scrolling with click wheel in Internet Explorer 7&#47;8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dummy1212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems scrolling with click wheel in Internet Explorer 7&#47;8</h2>
                    
<p>We've had this computer for over a year now, and i've had the same problem.&nbsp; With other computers, I've always been able to hold the click wheel down and use it to scroll very fast up or down a page.&nbsp; However when I try it on this system, holding the click
 wheel down brings up an icon of a magnifying glass with a plus sign in the middle of it.&nbsp; I can't scroll at all holding it down, and when I relase and use the scroll wheel, its zooms in or out in 25% increments.&nbsp; Upon clicking it again, the zoom feature is
 disabled and i can scroll the slow way, but the ability to scroll fast through long web pages is completely gone.<br />
<br />
I've gone through all the options I can think of and I can't figure out how to turn off this feature to get the scroll wheel back to simply scrolling.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello Dummy1212,<br />
<br />
Welcome to the forum!<br />
<br />
Your mouse should have options in the Control Panel to alter the functions that each of the buttons are assigned to. You can find these options at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Start Orb</strong> </li><li>Click <strong>Control Panel</strong> </li><li>Click <strong>Classic View </strong>on the left column, if not already selected
</li><li>Open <strong>Mouse</strong> </li><li>Click the<strong> Buttons</strong> tab (if you don't have a buttons tab, read below)
</li><li>Change the function of the middle button to <strong>Autoscroll</strong> </li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> </li></ul>
<p>If you don't have the Buttons tab,&nbsp;you don't have the software for your mouse installed on your system. Look at the bottom of your mouse to see who makes it, and visit their website. For instance, my mouse is made by Microsoft and is an Intellimouse.
<br />
<br />
Once you have the software on your system, revisit the Mouse options in the Control Panel to set your configuration.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</p>

    <title>Nested IIF statements work in Project Professional 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeb5555  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nested IIF statements work in Project Professional 2010 &#40;formula&#41; but not in MS Project Server 2010.  Why is that&#63;</h2>
                    Could somebody please give me an example of nested IIF statements that work on MS Project Server 2010? &nbsp;I created a custom field in MS Project Professional 2010 that works fine. &nbsp;Then I created another custom field in MS Project Server 2010 and added the
 same formula and it keeps on saying "This formula contains errors. &nbsp;Correct the formula and try again". &nbsp;I'm not sure why the same formula works in Proj. Professional 2010 but not on Server 2010. &nbsp;Any ideas would be much appreciated. &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>

            Mike,
<div>I don't use Project Server and this isn't really the best forum for Project Server questions but it might be that you need to reference enterprise fields when applying the formula in a server environment.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just a thought.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For Project Server related questions, you might have better luck posting to the server forum at:&nbsp;http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/projectserver/en-US/home?forum=projectserver2010general.</div>

            Thank you John. &nbsp;I will post my question in the forum that you mentioned. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Update:</div>
<div>If I have only 1 IIF it works fine, if I have 2 IIF, then it does not. &nbsp;I got the nested IIF to work by doing the following:</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;IIf([Baseline Finish]=projdatevalue("NA"),"no baseline",IIf([Status Date]&gt;[Baseline Finish],"status date greater","false part of the IIF))</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess in Project Server, you need to add the false part to any IIF statement. &nbsp;In Project Professional you don't. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<div>Okay, thanks for the update. If you don't get any response on the server forum you could try the customization and programming forum (see below), but cross posting is frowned upon so do an either/or.</div>

            Oops, sorry I overlooked your response.<br />
Ok, now we know better. It seems AdwCleaner did a good job for you. Meet (some) of your enemies&gt;<br />
<blockquote>Free Offers from Freeze.com (Freeze.com)<br />
HyperCam Toolbar (bigseekpro.com)<br />
Tuto4pc<br />
Somoto Toolbar<br />
SMTTB2009<br />
PDF Creator DB Toolbar<br />
Ask<br />
Babylon<br />
</blockquote>
From the report: I assume it was Freeze.com the one to blame for the ads. <br />
Bigseekpro.com and/or Somoto.com changed your home page and search engine provider to cause the redirections to those sites. At least in IE. Don't know about Chrome as the report is incomplete.<br />
Other related entries are toolbars, BHO's, add-ons and extensions part of same.<br />
Deleted entries for Ask and Babylon (also adware programs) appear to be leftovers from previous uninstalls?. I'm surprised since (you confirmed no presence of 'unknown or suspicious' programs or add-ons) you didn't find any related items before rebooting the
 OS following the tool's execution?<br />
Not sure about 'Tuto4pc'. Have you installed a PDF Reader/Creator freeware (other than the popular-standard Adobe Reader from the official Adobe.com website)? What about a non-official (cracked freeware) Photoshop program? Or a 'tutorial' related? Where did
 it come from? Whatever it is, would suggest you uninstall it now.<br />
<br />
<u><i>-Recommendation:</i></u> DO NOT use Softonic.com or any similar free-downloads websites to download anything. You may see the target program's reviews for comparision purposes if you like, but always use the 'official provider' source to download/install
 it.<br />
<u><i>-Warning/Recommendation:</i></u> When downloading/installing a new program, even from its 'official' download site, you must ensure any additional software (as toolbars or whatever) that is pre-selected to be installed by default, is previously 'un-marked/un-checked'
 (NOT to be installed) BEFORE you click on 'NEXT' or 'ACCEPT LICENSE' or the 'DOWNLOAD/INSTALL NOW' buttons.<br />

Re: MSE &amp; WU &gt; Good to know MSE is self-updating every day (normal behavior), and also a good sign WU-AU is working (at least for MSE's updates) as MSE uses the WU service (Microsoft Update, actually) to update its virus and spyware definitions, and for the
 program's upgrades as well. You may check if you're using the latest and current version (4.2.223.0 was released on February 12th) of MSE by clicking on the arrow-down located next to the 'Help' menu, and then click on 'About Security Essentials'. If you see
 'Antimalware Client version: 4.2.223.0' you're fine! If you see v4.1.522.0 instead, you're still using the previous version. If this is your case, you may upgrade the program (Please do it 'after' Point #4 below is done) by opening the Help menu again, and
 click on 'Search for software updates'. Please confirm.<br />
<br />
Re: WU-AU &amp; the OS+IE9's latest security updates &gt; If the above is true for MSE's automatic updates, your OS and IE should've been updated 'automatically' as well. Please note that every second tuesday of each month (aka 'Patch Tuesday') Microsoft regularly
 releases security patches. If you have the WU-AU feature enabled, you'll receive 'automatically' any security update that might be available for your OS and other Microsoft products (e.g., IE, Office, .NET Framework and MSE, for instance) you may be using.
<br />
For example, past PatchTuesday (Feb. 12th) Microsoft published 12 bulletins (5 critical-class and 7 important-class) addressing 57 vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, Exchange and .NET Framework. You may see them all
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-feb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>,
<u>but only the ones related to your</u> <b>Win7OS</b> (KB2778344, KB2799494, KB2790655 and KB2799013) and
<b>IE9</b> (KB2792100 and KB2797052) are the ones you may wish to check out if listed as installed at your Control Panel/Installed programs list:
<br />
Click Start and then click Run &gt; Type-in: <i>Appwiz.cpl</i> and then click OK &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Scroll down to the botton of the list and look under the Windows (and IE) software updates sections for these updates, and confirm they're there and
 the date (the 12th or the 13th) that is shown. <br />
<u><i>-Note:</i></u> Sorry, no updates from WU for Chrome as it's not a MS product, but can confirm you're using its latest version (v25.0.1364.97 was released on Feb. 22, 2013) though, and please also note that Google Chrome updates itself automatically.<br />
<br />
Re: AdwCleaner &gt; No, this is not a program to keep in your system as you won't need it anymore. It did its job already (adware remover) and you can delete it after you run it one more time 'just as a doble-check' (see Point #3 below). In any case, if you ever
 need it again in the future (hope not) you'll need to download it again as you'll need a fresh and 'updated' tool.<br />
<br />
Re: Malwarebytes &gt; Noticed you only ran a quick scan? Please run a full system scan now and report back with its report.
<br />
Further, please note that as suggested per my initial post, it's the 'FREE EDITION' Only! (NOT the 'Trial' nor the 'Pro' versions) that is recommended at this Community, as it doesn't include the real-time protection feature (available with the paid &lt; Pro &gt;
 version only), so there shall be no conflicts with MSE's normal operations. As you're right now using the 'Trial' version (which needs be upgraded to the 'Pro' version within the next 30 days) with RTP enabled, would suggest you uninstall this 'Trial' version
 (after the full scan is done - See Point #2 below) ) and install the 'Free' version later on (see Point #6 below).
<br />
<br />
Re: CCleaner &gt; No cleaners are recommended at this Community (no need to) as its injudicious use may cause more damage (specially to the registry) than good to the system. However, if you feel comfortable using it
<i>only to clean temporary files, etc..</i> you may do so with proper caution. <br />
<u><i>-Warning/Recommendation:</i></u> If you decide to continue its use, please ensure the following configuration settings are observed:<br />
a) Settings &gt; Uncheck the box for: 'Clean the system automatically at startup'.<br />
b) Advanced Options &gt; Check the boxes for: 'Only delete files from the Windows Temp folder after 24 hours' AND 'Warn you to make a security backup of changes to the registry'.
<br />
c) Cleaner -&gt; Applications -&gt; Windows &gt; Uncheck the boxes for: 'MS Antimalware', 'MS Security Client' and 'MS Management Console'.
<br />
==&gt; Be aware this last setting (c) is very important for your MSE program to work properly. Please do it now as you won't like CCleaner meddling (known issue) with MSE's scans files.<br />

Re: Attaching files to the forums &gt; Sorry, it's not possible to attach any files to your forum's posts. However, you may use an external online file storage service (as
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>, for instance) and post a link to the archive in your post. Similarly, you do can post an image or screenshot (use

¡Firedog</a>).<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Both the browsers default home Page is About Blank.
</blockquote>
Let's finish the homework. Please do as follows - in order:<br />
<br />
1) Close ALL your programs/applications (including browsers), open IE9 only to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260897/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB260897</a> (How to Delete the contents of the Temporary Internet Files Folder) and run the automated Fix it 50472.<br />
<br />
2) Next, please tell me (no need to post the report) what (if anything) was found (and removed) during the full scan you earlier ran with Malwarebytes. Now, you may proceed to uninstall Malwarebytes Anti-Malware '<b>Trial</b>' using your Control Panel &gt; Programs
 and Features &gt; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Uninstall a program</a>; and then also delete all its associated files and folders (if any) from its previous installation locations.<br />
<br />
3) Run AdwCleaner once more now (remember to click on the 'Delete' button) as a final check/cleaning. When you're done (Please tell me first if any new item was removed), open the program again, and this time, click on the 'Uninstall' botton to remove the program
 from your system. Any associated files (if any left behind) may be deleted manually now.<br />
<br />
4) Reboot the OS, and open IE9 only to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB923737</a>, and run the automated Fix it 50195 to reset IE settings automatically. Make sure to select the 'Delete personal settings' check box. When it's done, restart IE9 and check on your search provider and home page as follows:<br />
4.1.- In the quick search box (located at the top right of the browser) &gt; Click on the arrow-down right next to the magnifying glass (below the red X) to open the drop-down menu options &gt; Click on 'Manage Search Providers' &gt; Select 'Google' from the list of
 search providers &gt; Click on 'Make Default' and then 'OK'.<br />
4.2.- Click on Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Delete the contents of the text box in the 'Home page' section of the 'General' tab, and type-in:
<i>http://www.google.com</i> &gt; Click 'apply' and then 'OK '.<br />
4.3.- Make sure (a) security settings are at least set to medium-high (default), (b) SmartScreen Filter and pop-up blocker are both enabled.<br />
4.4.- Restart IE9 and check if now working ok.<br />
<br />
5) Same goes for Google Chrome. See 'How-to' on Google Chrome support &gt; <br />
'<a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete your cache and other browser data</a>' AND '<a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2765944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Default search engine, homepage and other settings
 that have been changed</a>'.<br />
<br />
6) That's it. You may now upgrade MSE - if need to/not at the latest and current version yet, as commented above. It may take some time to install the new files.
<br />
When you're done, reboot the OS and reinstall <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (<b>Free</b>-Edition ONLY!)</a>. Run a full system scan. Please note that MBAM is not meant to replace any AV software (though it acts like the best). You may use this program once or twice per month to scan your system, as an on-demand
 scanner/complementary (double-check) to MSE's complete scans.<br />
<br />
7) Finally, to help MSE better-protect your system, you must ensure not only Win7 and IE9 are both fully patched, but all your installed third-party software (as Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Player and/or the Java Plugins, for instance, that are known infection
 vectors) are always at the latest versions. As your browsers were compromised, I think it might be a good idea if you remove them all and do a fresh reinstatement. See related information on the latest and current versions for these programs:<br />

- <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/flashplayer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adobe Flash Player Support Forums</a><br />
<i><u>-Note:</u></i> Adobe Flash Player plugin is directly integrated with Google Chrome and enabled by default. Available updates for Adobe Flash Player are automatically included in Chrome system updates. Learn more about it
<a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=108086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>, and further info on what to do about other possibly out-dated plugins on Google Chrome
<a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1181003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.<br />
Therefore, it's only the Flash Player ActiveX Control for Internet Explorer 9 that you would need to take care of.<br />
7.3.- Oracle Java Plugin &gt;<br />
Here I have a different advice for you. As this piece of software is a threat itself nowadays, I would suggest you '<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/plugin_cache.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear the Java cache</a>' AND '<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/uninstall.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remove
 ALL VERSIONS of the Java plugin</a>' from your system (and DO NOT reinstall it back!). Trust me: You won't need it and shall be safer without it!<br />
<i><u>-Recommendation:</u></i> If you find out later on that you 'genuinely need' (otherwise stay away from Java) to continuously visit a 'legitimate website' (for example, your banking website might legitimately use a Java applet) that requires Java to display
 their content properly, you can always reinstall it (obviously the latest and current version) back from
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Java.com</a>. Enable it only on your alternate browser, which to be used for your Java-based website(s) only! and stick to your Java-disabled main browser for everything else.<br />
7.4.- Additional Tips &gt;<br />
Always remember that...<br />
- The Windows Firewall should be ON (enabled) at all times,<br />
- The User Account Control (UAC) must be always ON and not running with elevated privileges.<br />
- You never click on links from unknown sources, and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.<br />
- You never open unsolicited e-mail attachments, even if it 'seems' to come from a known contact.<br />
- The best protection you'll ever have, is not your AV, it's sitting right in front of your PC :-)<br />

            <p>That link provided by RickCP is for making general feedback, not for conversing with anyone at Microsoft directly to get a response, which typically isn't possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you are asking is really; "Why didn't MSE detect whatever was creating the ads?" correct?&nbsp; So what you need to undertand is that all antimalware applications from Microsoft have certain criteria, which if applications such as&nbsp;adware stay within the
 boundaries won't be classified and/or removed as malware by Microsoft programs such as MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How <span>Microsoft</span> antimalware products identify potentially unwanted software</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/shared/objectivecriteria.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/shared/objectivecriteria.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in this particular case, though the ads themselves may have been irritating and undesired, if you accepted the installation of the Freeze.com or another toolbar application which provided the ads and it otherwise stayed within the boundaries of the Objective
 Criteria at the URL above, MSE would not include detections to remove it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a search for Free Offers from Freeze.com I found that it is often incuded with screensavers and other "free" applications that you might easily have downloaded and installed.&nbsp; In fact the top listed&nbsp;search result from Bing was actually an ad offering
 a screensavers.com download which is titled "Freeze.com Screen Savers", so obviously they must be considered to be following the above criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem here is the difference between following the criteria, which are reasonable, and doing what the user wants.&nbsp; Adware at its best has always ridden the fine line between these two often opposing choices.&nbsp; While anti-adware applications often remove
 such "on-the-edge" applications, because that is their entire purpose, many anti-malware applications avoid this since it takes resources away from their core purpose of protecting against malware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, Microsoft isn't anti-advertising, since in fact that's a portion of it's own business and to begin randomly selecting potential competitor's products for removal without the strict criteria above would quickly start a war between them and
 those 3rd-party advertisers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, one of the above listed products found on your own PC, Babylon,&nbsp;is a perfect example of an item that at one point was detected by MSE and has since been removed from detection once the offending situation was corrected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Adware%3aWin32%2fBabylon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Adware%3aWin32%2fBabylon</a></p>

<h2>            Large cursor instead of dot while inking in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with the store version of OneNote (not OneNote 2016). When my pen is above the paper and I am trying to ink something, the large crosshairs cursor appears instead of the usual small dot for inking. More strangely, the small dot appears,
 when my pen is hovering above the ribbon items. This is very inconvenient for writing. To my knowledge, this problem does not occur in any other applications but OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/CB1DD7F5-3730-4705-B4B2-5178F589F88D">wowrameezali</a>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Nokia forum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If it's not possible to text in Urdu or read SMS when sent in Urdu,&nbsp;</span><span>your E5</span><span>&nbsp;</span>will not support this language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You will be able to add a language to your phone at a Nokia Care centre. After the language has been added you will be able to read SMS sent in Urdu and you will be able to send SMS in Urdu yourself, too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can find your nearest Nokia Care centre by visiting your local Nokia website. You will be able to find addresses for Care centres under the Support tab.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You will be charged for adding another language, the Care centre will be able to give you an exact price as the cost for this differs depending on your country.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how you get on.</p>

                    <div>I have asked this question several times but everyone keeps giving me the wrong answer, since they do not seem to understand the question. &nbsp;I am NOT asking how to DELETE a chat, NOR am I asking how to DELETE a CONTACT. &nbsp;So here is the question. I am using
 Apple Laptop and Chrome browser. &nbsp;If you log on to Skype and then from the pull down MENU in the Browser go to FILE and then select NEW CHAT, a box will open up saying NEW CHAT. &nbsp;Int &nbsp;this NEW CHAT window there are several names which appear . &nbsp;I want to delete
 the names of those people who are NOT ON MY CONTACT LIST..I am NOT able to do so. &nbsp;Thank you &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<p><span><span>When you are saying that you are using Chrome browser, then I guess that you have opened Preview Skype for Web application in this browser (</span><a href="https://preview.web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://preview.web.skype.com/</span></a><span>).
 Actually, there is no difference at all whether you are trying to do this in the browser application or using the installable Skype application on your Mac computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I don't have access to any Mac computer, but presume that the behaviour will be similar on Skype installed on a Windows computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The New Chat window can be opened either from the File menu or directly from the New Chat button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A list of all contacts will be shown, and additionally some "suggested contacts" might be shown too. These "suggested contacts" might be some leftover from older contact
 invitations, which you have not accepted as your contacts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/413975ce-4fb4-4430-95b0-ff21b3a6693c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/413975ce-4fb4-4430-95b0-ff21b3a6693c?upload=true" /></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Right click on one of the names listed in this New Chat window and select View Profile. Scroll down. If the name represents one of your contacts, you will see the option
 "Remove from contact list", If not, then the only option available will be "Block contact".</span></span></p>

<p>When you bought the 2520 it could do what you needed, where you needed to use it, right. Now it still does the same.</p>
<p>It could only be useless if it did not meet your needs at the time of purchase, buying error.</p>

            A response that is useful. When I got it Verizon/Microsoft/Nokia were showing support for the tablet. I get it, then order the keyboard cover for it which went to back order for months. Then when I started School I was thinking man this is great I can
 use this and be able to do my course work on breaks and do some work on the application development required in the courses. Ahhh I was wrong. Can't use it other than IE and Office. So in essence the tablet is now useless especially knowing that Microsoft
 will not provide a full Windows 10 to the device. So all that money for nothing.

            <p>I don't like Office because its user interface is too fancy and tiring.&nbsp;The Metro-style apps are great for all your hardware intensive times of learning. How long can you work intensively on the dev tools anyway (not dreaming and feeling spoiled)?</p>

    <title>Calendar Control Not Available - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardlowndes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar Control Not Available</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a new laptop and bought Office 2013 along with it. When I try and open a spreadsheet I have with the calendar control inserted it doesn't work, furthermore if I try and add a new calendar control the option doesn't seem to be
 there. There also seem to be other controls that I have used in the past missing. Am I looking in the right place or have these objects been removed from the latest version of Excel?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help appreciated.</div>

It is difficult to keep track of the various office versions and what is included with each.<br />
It appears that Office versions with Access have the calendar control, others don't.<br />
<br />
There are alternatives available.&nbsp; My free excel add-in date picker at... <span>

After installing (like any excel add-in), right-click a cell and choose Date Picker.<br />

            Thanks very much for your reply, it's helped a lot. I did ponder about getting Access as well, but decided against it. Would it be relatively easy for me to get it added on to my Office package?

In the past, one could purchase stand alone versions of Word, Excel and Access.<br />
I am not sure what MS offers for 2013 or how "easy" they make purchasing/renting/installing.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for creating this add-in. But it is not compatible with MS Excel 2013 -- whoever left the feedback that the add-in works in 2013, clearly have no idea of what version of MS. Office suite they're running.

<p>Thanks again for the effort.&nbsp; See below. </p>

Thanks for giving it a try.<br />
The Get Your Own Date (Date Picker) add-in, when originally released, would install on xl2013.<br />
The current date picker release does not install on xl2013 as you discovered.</p>
<p><br />
I got reports that the right-click menu item was not always visible on xl2013.<br />
This, as I discovered, was because of the Single Document Interface (SDI) forced on users in xl2013.<br />
</p>
<p>The date picker program installed a right-click menu for each workbook window but each workbook/window is a&nbsp; separate instance in Excel 2013 and new windows/workbooks are created with brand new menus (no date picker).&nbsp; I decided to prevent install of the
 program on xl2013.<br />
<br />
XL2013 is a trouble prone version with a Single Document Interface that I cannot find any positive comments about.&nbsp; Good work MS.&nbsp;

<h2>            Audio notifications</h2>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use skype principally for just one purpose:&nbsp; &nbsp;to hold video calls with my ageing parents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With 'old' skype (v5) i was able to have an address list that only had them in it;&nbsp; and, more importantly for me, i got an audible notification every time they came on-line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New skype gives me a very cluttered list of contacts, and i can't find any way to get an audible notification when a specific contact comes on-line.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this no longer possible?<br />
</p>
<p>[I'm a linux user so have always had the luxury of running multiple desktops, so i can have a 'skype' desktop without cluttering up my various work desktops.&nbsp; &nbsp; And the parents don't like to call me.]</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks....</p>

            1. Individual delete is possible only for alerts sent by you where you can right click &gt; remove chat
<br />
<br />2. If you want to delete the received alerts - It will not be possible to delete received alerts individually through Skype application. But you can delete the entire conversation by right clicking on left pane &gt; Delete conversations.
<br />
<br />3. If you install Classic Skype (not Windows 10 client) - If you want to clear entire History &gt; Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Privacy &gt; Privacy Settings &gt; Clear History
<br />
<br />But if you want to delete individual received chats, you will need to get into main.db and delete that. This requires third party tools. Let me know if you want the process for this.

            <p><span>Hi Yossi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to update the chipset and the display drivers and check if it works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key&nbsp;</strong>+<strong> X</strong> on your desktop and click on
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Locate the display adapters</li><li>Right-click on the driver icon and click on <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Search automatically for the updated driver software</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions to update the driver.</li></ol>
<p><span>Also check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows update if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>You may otherwise download and install the drivers from the&nbsp;Samsung website and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer the following Microsoft help article to connect a second monitor and check.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Joy,</p>
<p>both methods didn't work. the driver seems to be updated. the laptop doesn't detect a 2nd monitor. I've tried it with two different monitors - same results. BTW - when I press the F10 key (for displaying to a projector, usually) - the message is "your PC
 can't project to another screen. try reinstalling the driver or using a different video card" ... I've already reinstalled the driver ..</p>
<p>
</p><p>any idea?</p>
