<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update causes internet connectivity problems</h2>
                    I have installed the mandatory 8.1 Update 3 times over the last month.. Each time it says it was successfully installed. However, after the restart, I can't access the internet. My computer, prior to the Update, always connected to my network automatically.
 After the Update I have no connection and no access to any networks.&nbsp; After trying everything I can think of, I uninstall the Update- KB2919355- and restart. Immediately, my computer connects to my network and everything is back to normal. This has happened
 3 times so I am confident that the Update is causing my problem. I am certainly no expert&nbsp;problemsolver but I tried all troubleshooter programs on the computer &nbsp;checked out if my Norton A/V was at fault&nbsp;&nbsp;, read the forums to see if anyone else reported this
 issue. I came up empty. I have no idea what to do. This Update is said to be critical and needed for any future security updates. My PC has an intel i7 processor, 8gb ram 1tb hd. It's about 16 months ol

            <p>I am having a similar problem. Windows 8.1 updated a whole bunch of things automatically and now I can't connect to the internet and trying to use the diagnosis tools does nothing to solve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just built this computer last week, everything worked great until yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted all of the updates that it installed (not seeing Update- KB2919355) and it's back to working.</p>

            Same problems for me with ie after April and May Updates. The most common is ie's opened tabs are NOT closing instantly but after a big delay(about 30 seconds).&nbsp;The tabs remain blank, the URL active in bar, but tabs or whole ie do not close. This does
 not happen every time but only at almost 10% of browsing day. There is also a big delay(about 25 seconds)&nbsp;at windows after showing desktop to "stabilize". For example if in that 25 sec's period I select a folder with many files the big RED delete X(not the
 close x) button is dim and becomes red after almost 25 sec's. Watching task manager and disk activity at this period the "thing" that works most is Windows Defender. It looks like it firstly scans files and then lets you delete. It is also very strange that
 Right click Delete option appears instantly.

<p>Interesting to see you have no problems when you remove KB2919355. Makes one wonder why "leftovers" of Norton or McAfee would only cause a problem when installing this update. Logically it would appear that is not the issue. There are thousands of posts
 on this forum related to this particular update which have nothing to do with "leftovers". You may want to contact Microsoft support about this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>===============================================================</p>
<p>[1] TIP: If you find that a particular update causes problems in accessing the internet and your computer is operating fine and without any issues before the update and after you uninstall the update it could be the update itself which is causing the problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying. Re#6 That is what I'm telling you- only those two of the six updates you listed were actually listed in Installed Updates.</p>
<p>No, I don't have any backups, but my use of the CCleaner Registry Cleaner happened months ago and I haven't had any problems until I tried to download the compulsory 8.1Update KB2919355 in early May. When I delete the update or restore to a point prior to
 installing the update-VOILA-the problem disappears. The only conclusion is that the update is causing the problem.&nbsp; How do I contact Microsoft Support without&nbsp; having to pay to talk to someone about this problem? What other options do I have if I cant get
 this update to work?</p>
<p>I'm beginning to think my children and grandchildren are right.&nbsp; I seem to be the only one left&nbsp;in my family still using Microsoft. Everyone else has switched to Apple products. I always resisted because I resented Apple's controlling nature but it's obvious
 that Microsoft is trying to manipulate and control as well. </p>

    <title>Optical mouse HID suddendly rejected by Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nycticorax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Optical mouse HID suddendly rejected by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My problem is an absolute cancer: for a couple of weeks I have been able to use
<strong>flawlessly </strong>a gaming optical mouse on my Acer Aspire 5742g laptop. But now it's been three days since the mouse has kept disconnecting and reconnecting randomly, to the point where I cannot use it anymore. No matter which USB port I plug it
 into, the same behaviour occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to find any trace of this weird behaviour in the Event logs, and I have double-checked my USB ports for possible power failures etc., but I could find no hardware inconsistency. Other mouses work on my laptop, and other computers are able to
 use my mouse without any issue. Which leaves me to think that it might be a software issue? Possibly a conflict with some low-level piece of sofware?<br />
</p>
<p>Also, I discovered in the Device manager that the mouse was trying to install itself many times, resulting in the creation of many instances in the manager (I had to show "hidden" devices to see this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clue would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>N.</p>

            <p>1. Are you using a Laptop or Desktop? </p>
<p>2.&nbsp;What is the make and model of the mouse? </p>
<div><br />
Method&nbsp; 1: </div>
<div><br />
Run a virus scan on your computer.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/security/scanner</a>
<div><br />
Note: If any infections are detected during the scan, there might be a chance of data loss as the infected files will be deleted.</div>
<div><br />
After removing virus check with the issue. If the issue persists, proceed with the method 2.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Method 2: Test whether the Mouse work properly in Safe Mode</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.<br />
Refer this link to boot into Safe Mode:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Start your computer in safe mode</div>

<h2>            &#40;Waiting for&#41; explorer.exe Playing logoff sound...</h2>
                    When I try to log off Windows 7, I get the following error message:<br />
<br />
(Waiting for) explorer.exe Playing logoff sound...<br />
<br />
My options are to "Force log off" or "Cancel".<br />
<br />
If I force log off, it shuts down.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Is there anyway to make this shut down cleanly?

<p><span><span>===========================
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start, type
<strong><em>MSCONFIG</em></strong> in the Search Bar and Press Enter to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click the Services tab, check the Hide All Microsoft Services box and click Disable All (if it is not gray).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click the Startup tab, click Disable All and click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Restart the computer and test the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please monitor the system in the Clean Boot environment. If the problem does not occur, it indicates that the problem is related to one application or service we have disabled.
 You may use the MSCONFIG tool again to re-enable the disabled item one by one to narrow down the problem.<br />
<br />
After I went through this process, it looks like the clean boot resolved the issue.&nbsp; Perhaps there was something hung that got freed up upon the clean boot.</span></span></p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now in the market for an i7 surface Pro 4 with 256Gb but I see that there seems to be two types, that is the&nbsp;TH2-00002 with 16Gb RAM &amp; a 2.2Ghz CPU, and the&nbsp;CQ9-00002 with 8Gb RAM &amp; a 3.4Ghz CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which of these is the faster please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I have an i5 Pro 2 with 256 &amp; 8 and I have been very satisfied with it but it is now time for an upgrade &amp; would like some advice on which of the other two to go for.</p>

<p>I did not experience this problem with windows 7 32bit and cannot find a solution! does any one have any idea why this is happening?</p>

            &nbsp;What happens when you set your correct timezone and then manually alter the time/date to show the correct time for your location? Does it revert back 2 hours at the next reboot?

<p>television, but internet keeps silence :(</p>
<p>All I know is that it permits to change dozens of parameters of windows 10 pro which could be accessed</p>
<p>by the special key in windows registry. But I have no information about this key :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to run "regedit", but the comp replies that he knows nothing about this prog :(</p>
<p>Does this mean that the user can not work with registry in windows 10 pro even as an administrator?</p>

<h2>            Windows could not finish repairing the problem because the following action cannot be completed&#58; Renewing your IP address</h2>
                    
<p><span>Last night after doing a reboot my internet stopped working.&nbsp; I am getting the error stated in the title when I click "repair" under the Local Area Connection Status window.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am using a cable modem and going thru a wireless router.&nbsp; I know they work because I am accessing them wirelessly to type to you all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I type "ipconfig" in the cmd program I get the following (which I thought was odd):</span></p>
<p><span>Connection-specific DNS Suffix: Knology.net</span></p>
<p><span>IP Adress: 0.0.0.0</span></p>
<p><span>Subnet Mask: 0.0.0.0</span></p>
<p><span>It was also odd to me that I could not access my router by typing 192.168.1.1 in my IE window.</span></p>
<p><span>Also why I type in ipconfig/release I get a message that says "IP Address for adapter Local Area Connection has already been released." and when I type in ipconfig/renew I get, "An error occurred
 while renewing interface Local Area Connection: The RPC server is unavailable."</span></p>
<p><span><span>Just another note to add, I did a system restore to a point one week before I had the problem and I still have the same issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I hope this is enough detail for all of you experts out there.&nbsp; Thank you in&nbsp;advance! :)</span></p>
<p><span>PS Sorry if this was already answered, I've been digging thru forums for the last two hours.</span></p>

<p>Your machine is not obtaining a IP address from the DHCP server.&nbsp; Without an IP address, it will not communicate to any device on your network.&nbsp; Did the error say "RPC server is unavailable" or "RPC service is unavailable"?&nbsp; Either way, check to see that
 your DHCP client service and your RPC service is running:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Start-&gt;Run-&gt; "services.msc"</p>
<p>In the window that pops up, confirm that both "DHCP Client" and "Remote Procedure Call (RPC)" is present and its status is "Started" and its Startup Type is "Automatic".&nbsp; If not, double-click on it and make it that way.&nbsp; Also check your System Log for any
 unusual errors:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "eventvwr.msc".&nbsp; Check both "System" and "Application" logs.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />

<p>Thanks for responding, i have already tried everything in that forum article and the phone support has tried everything with me too&nbsp;</p>
<p>things that i tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing wifi networks</li><li>resetting my computer</li><li>reinstalling the Xbox app</li><li>resetting the Xbox</li><li>changing just about every setting in the Xbox and the Xbox app</li><li>changing settings in the router&nbsp;</li><li>reinstalling drivers on my computer</li><li>using different controllers</li></ul>
<p>Also when I open the Xbox app on my pc sometimes i am able to connect when the Xbox is turned on but not if it is off(it is set to instant on), but once I'm connected i can test game streaming and it will say all good but when i actually go to use it the
 app just crashed with no error code.</p>
<p>Also i do not know if this is related or not but the home screen in the Xbox app just shows "something went wrong while loading this info" and whenever i try to view my friends captures the app will crash and I've also found out that the app will just freeze
 up when i try to join a party.</p>

            Hi Janna.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Does it tell you it's "checking the disk?"  If so it might be failing.  Run diagnostics to know for sure, like this bootable Seatools full scan:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most through way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Jenna,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

            Hi vishnu2016, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

<br />
<br />Detailed steps:
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />Image
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Exception: you can double click the ISO (or right click it, choose Open with &gt; Fiel Explorer), mount it and start the upgrade in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a Drive with Limited Space

<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.

    <title>Branded Cheater but can no longer re-earn Achievements removed from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wosh jilliamson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Branded Cheater but can no longer re-earn Achievements removed from me.</h2>
                    
<p>I was branded a cheater in 2010 for using a Memory Transfer Cable to gain achievements amongst&nbsp;other things. I full hold my hands up to what I did and I'm not posting to complain or try my luck to having it removed (because frankly it was stupid). But since
 my 'branding' I am no longer able to earn achievements I had rightfully taken from me e.g. the completion&nbsp;of Halo: Reach chapters on Legendary. I understand that maybe I shouldn't be able to do so, but I only play my Xbox 360 for the Halo franchise alone and
 I would like to try increasing my score on Halo Waypoint again. I fully admit to cheating and I understand completely on the grounds of my Status if there is nothing that can be done to resolve this, but I would like to know if in some way I could have my
 Achievements for Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST and Halo: Reach hard-reset so I can once again earn them. Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They cannot regain previously earned achievements</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Correct me if Im wrong, but modding isn't earning, is it? MS says they reset EARNED chevos. Huh. Odd.</p>

            <p>It's not that Microsoft doesn't care, it's that modding in general is not allowed, and if someone has been found after a thorough investigation to have modded their Gamerscore, they have to be taught a lesson to not do it again.</p>
<p />
<p />
<p />
<p />
<p>So they reset their Gamerscore to "0" to teach them the lesson that hard work pays off in the end, and that cutting corners by modding your Gamerscore has consequences.</p>
<p />
<p />
<p />
<p />
<p>The consequences are, Gamerscore reset to "0", Your Gamerzone is permanently set to "Cheater" and you will never be able to earn any of those achievements ever again. They could just ban the account but they want you to prove yourself to them that you won't do it again. If you do, you will be banned</p>
<p />
<p />
<p />
<p />
<p>I hope this clears up some confusion.</p>

            <p>Hey DeathByDespair but your account does say cheater, click on your gamertag to the left of your post in your gamercard. It will be a bright orange bar in your profile. If you don't see it, sign out of xbox.com than come back to this&nbsp;thread than click on your gamertag. As I said it's to teach you a lesson, you will need to start a new account to earn those achievements again.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What is the exact certificate error message that you get when you try to access websites?</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span>Follow these steps to fix the certificate error:</span><strong><br />
</strong><br />
<span>1. Open Internet Explorer and verify that the page you are trying to view is listing a certificate error.<br />
2. To clear the certificate error, go to Tools --&gt; Internet Options from the menu.<br />
3. Click on the Advanced tab and scroll down to the security section. Clear the boxes for: "Check for publisher's certificate revocation" and "Check for<br />
server certificate revocation".<br />
4. Click Apply and Ok.<br />
5. Attempt to reload the page by clicking the Refresh button at the end of the address bar or by pressing the F5 key. Your page should now load as expected.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span>If that doesn’t help, then refer this KB article and follow the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Warning message when a user tries to connect to a secure Web site by using Internet Explorer 7 or 8: "There is a problem
 with this website's <br />
security certificate"</span></span></strong><span><br />

<p><span><strong><span><br />
Step 3:<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span>If the issue persists, then optimize Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer this KB article for steps:<br />

<p>OK, I do use FEEDBACK but I want an answer now, not one maybe when!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I Did that but there does not seem to be lot of Lastpass users with the problem. &nbsp;Could be they just gave up with EDGE which seems to have a lot of with Windows 10, could it be because I use the
<strong>Pro version</strong>. &nbsp;<strong>At the momment EDGE fails to even remember that I want all Tabs closed no matter how many times I tick that box too.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IE11 does not work properly, an update makes it erratic and then eventualy another update makes it work, ad infinitum. &nbsp;Google Chrome has problems with W10. &nbsp;Firefox seems to work OK but I dont like the way it handles Favourites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be nice if the tech guys put the work into making W10 reliable for all, instead of **silly gimicks for things the average user does not want or alternatively do not have the time or ? to get the gimmicks to work.</p>
<p>**Creators Updates is one such stupid marketting idea!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span><span>I am a little perplexed by the questions; you obviously have something in mind.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Lastpass has never worked with EDGE.<span>&nbsp; </span>EDGE was launched without any addon capability and when Lastpass first became available it did not work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried numerous times to install the app but it never worked before or after any of the much advertised major upgrades.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make EDGE work reliably and better than any other browser and solve the problem. Chrome does not work with my Supermarket shopping payments to AMEX, IE11 has problems currently with hyperlinks and on it goes, hunt the browser that works fully with this
 website.<span>&nbsp; </span>Prior to Win 10 I never found IE11 to have <span>&nbsp;</span>these problems!</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>No idea, first installed Win 10 Home Upgrade on clean install of Win 8.1, later probably used a quick format for the install of Win 10 Pro from a downloaded .iso.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Original HDD with a number of partitions for the original Win8.1, my Data and another partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Win10 Pro was installed as 1. Above</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Data was already on HDD as 2, above.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I refuse to allow Microsoft the opportunity to destroy my data and I have better things to do that reinstalling things that don’t need to from backups.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Had a look at the number of problems with Address Books that Microsoft took such care of!<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not sure to what sort of Backup you are referring, I do not use Windows Backup for Data or any other software except SyncToy at that time.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I hope you are not suggesting we users cannot transfer data from a previous Windows version.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I am currently using Win Def as I got rid other the previous as I wanted to delete files it found without my being able to know what it wanted to delete, ludicrous.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I refuse to pay good money in advance and find I bought a lemon.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3rd party currently is Malwarebyte and SuperAntiBlaBla. and they are only occasional use when I think I may have something unwanted, never included any system files and not run in parallel to WD.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I downloaded from the Lastpass App from the STORE, no warnings about unsuitable and a recent check shows that it does not have anything in plain sight.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Not in the habit NO but I have used CCC once but cannot be certain as to which machine, maybe the Pro or a
<span>&nbsp;</span>Home.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Home machines are family members and I do not have access to them as they are 250 miles apart from me and them from each other plus the users have limited competence, they find the split between Control Panel and Settings
 too confusing. Getting them to try adding Lastpass to Edge is a world to far.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>My daughter’s laptop has crashed probably during the Creators Update (which failed, on my machine anyway, to identify itself or the length of time it would take to install).<span>&nbsp;
</span>All I got was a KB number so anyone who had not memorised that, if they ever even knew about it, had little warning of the time it would take.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I did not want the bloody thing for the additional crapware it contained anyway.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will be totally honest with you, you have heard me say before that I would happily go back to Win XP if I did not need internet access and ditch the space consuming lump that Windows has become.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No one understands the full code anymore or the ramifications of a small change<span>&nbsp;
</span>If younger and still had my old memory I would ditch Windows altogether and I do not mean for a fruit.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>O yer, one more: cannot access Ms Answers on Edge with having cookies allowed, WHY.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an effort to get this right I have run sfc /scannow with no errors, run DISM with no errors &nbsp;I have deleted all browsers, turned IE11 off in Features and&nbsp;deleted Lastpass, all&nbsp;with multiple restarts.&nbsp; I then ensured that all remaining debris folders
 were removed from both Programs and Program Data (not registry).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 2 entries for Lastpass in the App Store, both say for Edge, and I tried both with the removal and a restart between and&nbsp;neither could manage to remember the password for the auto logon option.&nbsp; Running a large search needs lots of tabs and
 why do I need to re-logon every time I close the browser as the fastest way to get rid of a lot of tabs.&nbsp; So many websites need the viewer to logon now and without Lastpass it becomes a real pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having removed IE11 and after reinstalling it from Features, I then selected it as my default browser , I find I am now having the reoccurring "Select Browser" popup and&nbsp;so I have&nbsp;RESET IE11 in the Options&nbsp;/&nbsp;Advanced Settings.&nbsp; I found that the usability
 of IE11 had been further destroyed since I last had this problem. Somewhere along the line it would appear that Microsoft have made it more difficult for anyone to use IE11 as their default App.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See&nbsp; link below for cure to current problem, I&nbsp;know that it
 was not&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;involved when I first had the problems last year.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is EDGE really so bad they&nbsp;Ms have to resort to these kind of tactics to get people to use the unreliable and clunky piece of rubbish.&nbsp; Most things Ms decide to originate anew have the same happen to old software, introduce faults into&nbsp;them and make
 bits not work.&nbsp; Being kind, I suppose it is possible that in the "<em>improvements"
</em>made that consequential damage&nbsp;occurs &nbsp;unintentionally.&nbsp; Yer, pigs fly!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am old fashioned, I want a browser that is quick to load and does not have GLITTZE on every new tab I start.&nbsp;If I am searching for something, do I really need the 101 news feeds, videos and other rubbish.&nbsp; Maybe Edge only does it with the home page
 but it is data and not everyone has fibre into their home,&nbsp;as a rural dweller I do not even have ADSL2. and 2MB download speeds are very common.</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect to Microsoft Account despite good internet connection</h2>
                    <p>I have just received my laptop back from PC World after the attempt to update to Windows 10 failed and led to a corrupted operating system (all after a failed hard drive). Therefore the laptop has factory settings but they did install Windows 10 for me.
 No other programs downloaded yet and no other settings changed. (Or if I have tried changing them I have changed them back).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I have tried to do is to make the main account my Microsoft Account (this one). Every time I try to "Connect to a Microsoft Account" it says that the service is unavailable and to try again later. 2 hours of searching forums suggest waiting
 won't make a difference. I have run all the troubleshooting tools - internet connection is fine (both wifi and phone internet - tried with both). I have tried to login via different methods - account settings, mail, Windows store, one drive. I have checked
 all updates have been done/are up to date. The clock time is correct. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I connect to my Microsoft account without losing Windows 10 again? </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I have logged into my account on different browsers on a range of devices so the account is fine. The issue is getting the laptop's administrative account to become my Microsoft account. I was experiencing this issue all evening
 yesterday. At no point have I not been able to log into my account and anyway I can never get as far as putting the address in!!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>

<p>Hi, the informal answer to your last question is “Upload your iOS <em>Contacts</em> to Microsoft’s servers”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking personally, I find the language used to be devious; it implies an attempt to disguise this grab for information as a gesture of convenience. If the purpose were more honest, Skype would allow users to select what details were uploaded, and permit
 fine editing of contact information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remain hopeful there will be change in this matter, to the benefit (respect) of the user base.<br />

<h2>            Garbled text input from keyboard</h2>
                    
<p><span>When typing on my keyboard my input is sometimes garbled or rearranged.</span></p>
<p><span>Running 64bit Windows 7 Ultimate. Problem appears occasionally. Goes away when computer is restarted. Might go for weeks without a problem. Computer is
 on during the day and off each night.</span></p>
<p><span>When the problem occurs I can plug in a different keyboard and the problem continues. When the problem occurs, I can input successfully if I use the "On-Screen
 Keyboard" application.</span></p>
<p><span>The garbled characters appear in&nbsp;the same sequence as the key order on a QWERTY keboard.&nbsp; In other words, for example, I might try to type "green" and
 the characters may appear as "asdfg" or "xcvbn" or any other 5 characters that are sequential on a QWERTY keyboard, including numeric keypad. Shift key works properly.</span></p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have (I hope) manged to solve the problem with the help of another forum. I say solved because it is now 3 days since I have had the problem and it used to occur daily.</p>
<p>The problem occurs because of a fault in ZoneAlarm (in my case Extreme Security but could well be others.) The solution is to upgrade Zone Alarm to the latest version and hopefully it will also solve your problems.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

            <p>I've actually been trying to solve this problem as well. But since you're the first person I've found who's posted about it, I'd like to try a few things and cross reference your experience with mine if you're up to it. I've actually been noticing (for the past few weeks on my&nbsp;S and now on my X that I just set up), that all HDR functionality on any media related apps are giving us the grayish letterbox bars and ugly haze over the picture. It's like all TV smart dimming functionality is gone, and the HDR is in no way darling blacks or brightening colors. Something we'd see on a cheap TV with too harsh of a backlight. So I first noticed it when I popped Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in the player, 4K HDR and everything. But the bars were that grayish color, and everything looks dull. Then I tried watching Netflix. EVERYTHING on there looks greyish too, HDR content or not. Amazon Video will appear okay at first, but as soon as HDR content kicks in, greyish black again, just like the others</p>
<p>So after running a ton of trial and error tests, it looks like any app that causes your TV to go into HDR mode (on my Vizio it'll indicate near my input at the top that it's switched to HDR10), the blacks and colors will be all off. If the TV doesn't switch to HDR mode, you'll get nicer black on those bars, but the image itself is still SDR, not HDR. Netflix and Blu-ray will automatically put my TV in HDR mode on start up, so everything on those apps looks terrible. Amazon will only switch HDR on if it detects the specific video I'm watching in HDR ready. SO as long as my TV doesn't switch to HDR, the image looks like an okay SDR image. As soon as it switches to HDR mode, regardless of the content being SDR or HDR, everything looks like ****. So needless to say... somethings completely **** with all HDR enabled apps on Xbox right now, S and X.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>I've all but confirmed the problem lies specifically with the Xbox Apps, because when testing my TV with Netflix through the Smart TV apps and not Xbox, HDR kicked in and looked beautiful. On top of that, all HDR gaming looks awesome on the Xbox. So my TV is completely capable of giving me correctly displayed HDR content. It's just when you use an Xbox media app (Netflix, Amazon Video, Blu-ray), and the TV goes into HDR mode, and that's when we get some very off results. I swear this wasn't the case before. Something must have happened in the last console update maybe?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I think you should try out everything I did if you can, and if you get the same results, I'll be able to rest easy and know it's definitely the Xbox apps themselves that are causing the problem.</p>

            <p>It must be the Xbox bluray app. I don't have the problem with Netflix or Amazon through my tv apps or through my PS4 pro. Only with 4k UHD discs on the X. I even pulled out my One S again to double check if it was just the X. The S looks like crap now too. These are movies I've seen before so I know what they should look like. Has there been any response from Microsoft?</p>

<p>I haven't found any response from Microsoft yet concerning this issue. I have been talking with support over Twitter, but they're just asking me to go through the basic troubleshooting steps for people who have no idea what they're doing with tech. It's completely useless. What worries m though is that you aren't having these issues with apps like Netflix or Amazon. Because that makes me start to think the problem is with my TV. But I just don't understand how that would make any sense. My TV does HDR correctly with built in apps.... and with games on my S and new X... but decides to not communicate specifically with all video related apps? I don't get how that could happen. This is really frustrating.</p>
