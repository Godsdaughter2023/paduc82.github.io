    <title>16 GB DDR3 Installed, 8 GB showing as available - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            16 GB DDR3 Installed, 8 GB showing as available</h2>
                    <p>I have a PC running Windows 8.1 64 bit, all updates/patches/fixes installed.&nbsp; All BIOS updates complete.&nbsp; The proc is an i7, with all functions enabled in BIOS.&nbsp; The BIOS shows all 16 GB installed properly.&nbsp; Windows reports 16 GB installed, but only 7.99
 available.&nbsp; All memory tests report 16 GB functional (no bad DIMMs or sockets).&nbsp; The proc is 64bit enabled as is the memory&nbsp;and the system bus.&nbsp; I've seen the q/a for Windows 7 and for 32 bit systems, but this is a 64bit system w/64bit OS.&nbsp; I upgraded from
 an i5 to the i7 (after the i5 failed) and, since I had to open the system, figured it was a good time to get this done.&nbsp; The system showed 16 GB under the old i5.&nbsp; Key system specs are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Operating System<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 8.1 64-bit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;CPU<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel Core i7 860 @ 2.80GHz&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lynnfield 45nm Technology<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;RAM<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 670MHz (9-9-9-24)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Motherboard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MICRO-STAR INTERNATIONAL CO.,LTD P55-GD65 (MS-7583) (CPU 1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any advise on how to get this corrected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>______________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never mind - I fixed it with a little work on the BIOS and the various settings buried in the sub-sub menus.</p>

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you using a dual channel memory kit or 2 single channel module?</li><li>Do you have them in the proper slots if using dual channel (you may refer to users manual)?</li></ol>
<p>Usually dual channel is a kit of two modules of memory of the same size, i.e. 8GB + 8GB = 16 GB, that are placed in the proper slots on your motherboard per your owners manual. Dual channel actually works with CPU to run faster. It increases the bandwidth
 of transfer of information. Now, If you are using two single modules of the same size and were not part of a kit then they will operate as a single module only.<br />
<br />
Check your packaging of the memory, it should say it on the label. <br />
<br />
Be careful if it is dual channel. Make sure you place them in the right slots so it can utilize that feature. You can refer to users manual for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            The memory is all DDR3, dual channel, from&nbsp;Corsair and is installed properly.&nbsp; It turned out to be a problem in the BIOS, in one of the sub-sub menus that I didn't&nbsp;check&nbsp;after I set up the new proc.&nbsp; Thanks for the feedback, but that wasn't the problem
 this time.

    <title>How to get support for issue that has gone on for over 2 months - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chootoi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get support for issue that has gone on for over 2 months</h2>
                    
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ticket <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">number is
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. My gamer tag is chootoi. I want this issue escalated immediately to someone with actual decision-making authority who will make it right.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>
Beginning in December 2015, my Xbox One began powering down on its own and then having difficulty powering back up. It would start up on a completely black screen for 15 minutes or so, then go to the green Xbox screen for approximately 45 minutes, and then
 display a system error: E200 000000EF 000000. There was no explanation for this error, and no useful information from Microsoft Online.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
On February 7, 2016, I completed a service order (<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></span>), and on February 8, I sent the Xbox One in for repair.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
The device was received by Microsoft on Thursday, February 12<sup>th</sup>, but the status of my online order was not updated. I waited until Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> and contacted Microsoft support to find out what was happening with my Xbox. After trying
 chat, telephone, AND Twitter that day, I still received no firm answer about the status of my Xbox.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
As your web site indicates, the status of the service order should change, but it did not. I explained repeatedly to your representatives that the online process was not working as intended, but was told simply told things like, “don’t you worry,” in addition
 to wildly conflicting descriptions of what was happening and what to except.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Since no one was listening, and to prove my point, I cancelled my service order. This should not have been possible, since your web site clearly says, “Services may not be cancelled or refunded once Microsoft has received my Xbox Product and has processed my
 Order.” But it turns out the cancellation was processed with no issues, which proved my point.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
I tried again to get answers on Sunday, February 15<sup>th</sup>, and finally reached a floor supervisor, Kameron (<span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>)
 via telephone. Kameron was the first person out of the six I had dealt with at that point who actually gave me useful information, telling me that while FexEx showed that my Xbox actually arrived at Microsoft, it would not actually be delivered to the service
 center for a few days, and that’s why my status wasn’t being updated.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Kameron told me that the current issue with status updates was that I had cancelled the service order. I explained to her that I did so to prove the process is broken and to try to get attention when the resulting error surely popped up in the support center.
 Kameron told me that she had added extensive notes to the order and that the repair would proceed, but that I wouldn’t be able to see any status updates online until the 26<sup>th</sup> of February because of the cancellation status. I was somewhat satisfied
 that at least the issue was being addressed at that point.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
However, on Februrary 23<sup>rd</sup>, I received my Xbox One back from FedEx. As I soon discovered, the device not only had not been repaired, but it had now been damaged in transit. The faceplate had been snapped off one end and cannot be placed back. I don’t
 know what other internal damage may have been caused. I have provided photographic evidence of this.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
On February 25<sup>th</sup><span>, I reported this to Xbox support and was told that I should pursue the issue with FedEx. I noted that FedEx’s procedures online indicated that only the contract holder could be reimbursed for damage,
 but the Microsoft support rep “strongly suggested” I take the problem up with FedEx. I can provide this transcript as well.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>
I then filed a claim with FedEx as instructed, along with the appropriate documentation and photos, only to have it denied because FedEx said only Microsoft could file a claim per their contract with you. I can provide you with FedEx’s letter. This is what
 I told the Microsoft rep in the first place, but I was given erroneous information.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
I contacted Microsoft again, and chatted with a supervisor named Kis. Kis told me that my Xbox had actually arrived damaged to the repair facility, and then told me that the repair center accused me of tampering with the Xbox. I was told it was shipped back
 to me because of the damage. I pointed out that it was UNDAMAGED when I sent it, and that it was returned to me with NO documentation, NO update, and NO evidence of it being damaged.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
I expressed my anger and disgust at being accused of tampering with my Xbox and lying about it, and Kis assured me he or she understood and that this was not the service experience I should expect. I did not, and never have, tampered with my Xbox. As infuriating
 as this whole sorry episode has been, that accusation is by far the most insulting and outrageous part of it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Kis sent me photographs of the obviously damaged shipping box and Xbox from the repair center and told me to file a new claim with FedEx.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
I filed a new claim with FedEx, which was rejected, because even though I dropped the Xbox off with FedEx for shipping, it was done under a Microsoft label. FedEx’s shipping contract with Microsoft says that ONLY Microsoft may file claims. That makes twice
 that I have been told by a Microsoft rep to file a claim with FedEx when they MUST know that only Microsoft can do so.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>The last encounter I had with a support agent, Glen S., was via chat and was mostly positive. He assured me he would take personal ownership of my case and see it resolved. He promised me a resolution by April 7. He then followed
 up with a couple of e-mails prior to the April 7 date. I responded to all but one of those. On&nbsp;March 31, I received an e-mail from Glen asking if my issue had been resolved, and informing me that he would close the case if I did not respond within two days.
 "Odd," I thought, but I responded. No reply from Glen. Five more responses over the next week. No response whatsoever. So more *** runaround from so-called "support."
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>
I have now purchased a new Xbox One because I could no longer wait for this seemingly unending scenario to be resolved. I feel like I’ve been jerked around, given bad information repeatedly, and been treated like a nuisance rather than a loyal customer who
 has spent thousands of dollars with Microsoft in the gaming arena alone, not to mention the personal computing and mobile phone arenas where I have also been a steady customer. All I’m looking for now is an end to this miserable experience.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
If you want to file a claim with FedEx and reimburse me, that’s fine. If there’s another approach, that’s fine too. Just keep in mind I have now purchased another Xbox One due to all this craziness. Please understand that I don’t particularly want to go through
 any long chat session where I have to repeat all this, so please connect me straight to a supervisor or anyone who can actually once and for all deal with this situation and get it resolved quickly.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
This ordeal is now over two months long. All I want is an answer from someone with actual authority about how exactly Microsoft is going to make this right and when it will happen. I don’t need any more kind words about how I shouldn’t have to go through this.
 I don’t want any more runaround and misinformation. I definitely don’t want any more accusations about how this is my fault. I want an actual answer. I want it now. I want it from someone with the actual authority to make it happen, and I want it in writing.
 And finally, I want an apology for the ridiculously horrible lack of service I have experienced, and most importantly, for being accused of being at fault for the whole mess and for lying about it.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>So the question here is whether ANYONE at Microsoft gives even a small *** about my case, about customer service in general, or about their customers. My experience with this god-awful ridiculous ordeal says no. Does ANYONE have any idea how I might be able
 to get hold of someone who's not an absolute liar or incompetent? That would be so very great. Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

    <title>Drag &#38; Drop file icons into file dialog boxes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Drag &#38; Drop file icons into file dialog boxes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a long-term Mac user who finally took the plunge and moved everything to Windows 10 (this was possible thanks to the Fall creator update). Now, I'm up and running and everything is great. I have the same apps etc. There is one thing that I'm missing
 from Mac's finder and that is the ability to drop file icons into a file dialog box so that the dialog box goes to that directory location and selects the file I just dropped as icon. The behaviors in Windows is that it would actually copy the file to the
 location that the dialog box shows. I really don't understand this workflow. But either way, I'm wondering if there is a flag or a hidden feature somewhere to enable the Mac finder experience for drag &amp; drop. If this indeed doesn't exist - can we add this
 to Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, and I apologize for not explaining it better. When you have a file dialog box open (either save file or open file) and then drop a file icon (from an explorer window or the desktop) into that dialog box, on windows, that file is copied to the location
 that the dialog box is - regardless of the actual operation that the dialog box is meant to do (open or safe). In Mac's finder when you drop a file icon into such a dialog box, the dialog box is navigating to the location of the file and from there you can
 either save or open. It's a very handy thing to have if you orient yourself along files and directories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a clip on YouTube that shows the exact feature:&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Nima K<br />
<br />
Thank you for Posting on Microsoft Answers.<br />

If you haven't already tried, try uninstalling the language pack while in Safe Mode?<br />
I'm including how to boot into safe mode just as an FYI: - some people don't know how

<p>In the <strong>User Accounts</strong> window, click <strong>User Accounts</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong>User Accounts</strong> tasks window, click <strong>Turn User Account Control on or off</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If UAC is currently configured in Admin Approval Mode, the <strong>User Account Control</strong> message appears. Click
<strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Clear the <strong>Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer
</strong>check box, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Restart Now</strong> to apply the change right away, or click <strong>

                    <p>Alright, I do believe it is necessary to state that my brother and I are in a Microsoft Family, run by my father. Both my and my brother's accounts are set as Adult in the Microsoft systems. However, when we are on the Xbox One console and try to change our gamerpic to a custom image, we get the foreseen message, "For custom images, you need to be older." Now, let me reiterate, both accounts are definitely set to Adult settings, and again, we are in a Microsoft Family, my father being the leader. I think we, my brother and I, are set as Child accounts in the family, or whatever you may call a Sub-Account in the Microsoft Family. The problem still persists, while we both have our actual birth dates set on our profiles. We are both seventeen years of age, and yet&nbsp;this problem still persists. My father claims not to know why this problem is, and does not know how to fix it, this coming from a Novo IT. Funny, I know. I do believe he just does not want to try to figure it out, but, in a

<h2>            Windows 8 metro apps running in background turn off their internet connection &#40;Unable to recieve IM&#39;s&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I recently bought a microsoft surface pro, the shop worker advised me to get an antivirus product, so I bought kaspersky internet security 2013 which clearly states it works with windows 8, installed it, and my instant messaging doesnt work as the background
 apps appear to turn off their internet connection if I'm not using them.<br />
<br />
Also I noticed that if I disabled kaspersky then turned it back on again, some of the apps would work in the background as if having an internet connection (messenging app works but not IM+). Also, I tried turning individual components of the kaspersky app
 off but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
This is really frustrating, I hope someone can give me an answer.

<h2>            Unable to send or receive messages for the Hotmail, Windows Live Mail Error ID&#58; 0x8DE00002</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned in the title, I have this problem with my windows live mail 2011.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unable to send or receive messages for the Hotmail (...............@hotmail.com) account.</p>
<p>Server Error: 5102<br />
Server: 'https://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/Sync.aspx'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x8DE00002</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using WLM for quite some time and my hotmail account is configured in it&nbsp;and approx&nbsp;2GB+ &nbsp;of my local HDD space has been piled up in it in all previous mails etc stuff.</p>
<p>Occasionally my WLM 2011 did gave me similar&nbsp;synchronization fails but I was ok after trying little&nbsp;tricks ( found on&nbsp;searching net) like closing and re-opening WLM any times, like making IE default browser and resetting its all setting to default( even
 though already default) &nbsp;then launching WLM and many other similars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps after WLM updated recently, it is not synching with my emails and no such above trick is working.&nbsp;I am stuck up. ( my hotmail account on web is working finen
</p>
<p>Windows LIve mail&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Version 2011 (Build 15.4.3555.0308)'&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;is showing up at the moment in WLM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By searching on net recently feels to me like I am not alone and many others have had same issue after the WLM update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading several posts here, two common solutions given either delete your email account in WLM and re configure it or your account need to be adjusted by somebody.</p>
<p>I am quite uncomfortable in deleting my account to reconfigure it, it has piled up and I do'nt want to start from scratch downloading everything from my hotmail server to local system provided if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as said my hotmail on web is working&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>also in WLM my calender is updating correctly as 'calender updated' message is appearing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please provide some better solution for the issue soon.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry.&nbsp; I do not see any red notification or a Private Messages tab.</p>
<p>Yesterday Windows Live Mail stopped receiving mail on my XP machine.&nbsp; I have gone to Control Panel - Add or Remove Programs and repaired Windows Live Essentials.&nbsp; It did not resolve this issue.&nbsp; Today I have been using a Vista Machine and have had no problem
 with Windows Live Mail until a few hours ago.&nbsp; The Vista machine no longer receives email either.</p>

            <p>HI again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As expecte me too got a Private message hoping to resolve my issue and afterwards my WLM worked fine for a couple of days. Also When I re-added my hotmail account, it downloaded all my web stuff on my pc for hours. ( approx 2gb)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a couple of days I experienced same problem as I stated. That was the point I switched off WLM and configured my hotmail in MS outlook 2010 via connector. That also took web downloading in its own folders approx 2gb. But yeah I am not getting any crashes
 now as was for WLM. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let the concerned resovle this annoying WLM bug. By the time I am on outlook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Actually I have already done&nbsp;it i-e&nbsp;deleted my hotamail account and added again in WLM.&nbsp;synching took long hours. afterwards it was working fine but&nbsp;ocassionally got same problem in WLM as I stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>POP 3 SETTING / SEND and RECEIVE MAIL FROM OTHER ACCOUNT</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I have checked and found no other items/duplicates in it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>check your POP settings if it is set to allow changes in your emails using other devices. Please refer to these steps to learn how:<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>POP and Deleting downloaded messages category</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>I found a difference in settings here:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>My setting was ticked on</strong></span></p>
<p><span>'Don't let another program delete messages from Hotmail. (If your other program is set to "delete messages from the server," we'll simply move them to a special POP folder. They won't be deleted.)'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Now I changed it to:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>'Do what my other program says-if it says to delete messages, then delete them. '</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>then I opened WLM, at the moment it is synching without errors. </span></p>
<p><span>But as stated it troubles time to time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I will be using WLM and outlook in parallel for&nbsp; some days.</span></p>

<p>Sir, </p>
<p>Regret your methods are not solving my problem. I followed the steps [given]recommended by you.</p>
<p>Please note the answers for your questions.</p>
<p>(1) I had Windows 7 Home Basic original version earlier. When I was directed by Microsoft to upgrade it to Windows&nbsp; 10, I just followed the instructions of Microsoft.</p>
<p>(2) When I load PB9, the application is running okay. But When I click at the icon - "Help" on the PB Painter Bar, nothing is happening &amp; no error is reported.</p>
<p>(3) All other applications installed with the Windows 7 are working well with windows 10 also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you, Krishna Mohan</p>

<p>Depending on your app, you can try to run it in safe mode. If it allows you, then you can check if the
<strong>Help </strong>button will work while in safe mode. If it does, it means that some add-ins that your program uses now that you have Windows 10 do not sit well with the OS, and would have to be disabled.</p>
<p>If the program is not accessible in safe mode, try to reinstall it altogether.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>
<p>The problem, it seems, is the HELP file in PowerBuilder 9.0 has been created / developed using the old&nbsp;method. This&nbsp;is not compatible with Windows 10. Being myself an experienced Software Engineer, I have tried all possible methods to solve my problem. I
 could discover that the "HELP" icon in the Power Builder Painter bar stopped working from the date I upgraded my OS from Windows 7 Home Basic to Windows 10 ( Automatic upgrade ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see any problem with the Windows 10 OS. All other applications which used to run well with Windows7 are fine in Windows 10 also.
<p>
</p><p>I feel I have made myself clear to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your time. Krishna Mohan</p>

<p>How much trouble would it have been to just spell it out in the beginning?&nbsp; The program is pretty old and no longer supported by it developer.&nbsp; You said in another post, "Being myself an experienced Software Engineer, I have tried all possible methods to
 solve my problem."&nbsp; If that's the case, what's the point in asking?&nbsp; It's clearly not compatible with Windows 10.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which version of Assassin's Creed III have you installed? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>c000007b</strong> Errors are caused in one way or another by misconfigured system files. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Windows Compatibility center suggests that the game is compatible, 30 votes shows that the game is incompatible with Windows 8.1. Refer to this article.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Assassin's%20Creed%20III&amp;vendor=Ubisoft&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=5&amp;BreadCrumbPath=assassin%E2%80%99s%20creed%20iii&amp;LastSearchTerm=assassin%25e2%2580%2599s%2Bcreed%2Biii&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Assassin's%20Creed%20III&amp;vendor=Ubisoft&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=5&amp;BreadCrumbPath=assassin%E2%80%99s%20creed%20iii&amp;LastSearchTerm=assassin%25e2%2580%2599s%2Bcreed%2Biii&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1</a></p>

    <title>Photo Viewer seem to be using the wrong color profile. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve516  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo Viewer seem to be using the wrong color profile.</h2>
                    I created a custom color profile using color calibration equipment from X-Rite. &nbsp; All my programs on my Windows 7 PC are displaying colors correctly except for
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Photo Viewer</span> which is showing all colors to dark.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For example in Photoshop or in&nbsp;Microsoft Office picture manger, you can see details in the shadows, but with the same picture in Photo Viewer, the shadows are so dark they you can not see any detail and all colors seem to much darker and intense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I used to use windows XP and did not have this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; The color calibration equipment is new and I am using the latest X-rite software on my Samsung SyncMaster monitor.&nbsp; I found this same problem on another Windows 7 computer with a different Samsung monitor,
 but I don't think its really a Samsung problem since I can not find another program except Windows 7 Photo Viewer that has this problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I would like to keep using Windows Photo Viewer because it is quick and easy and is well integrated with other windows functions.
<br />
I think it would be a simple fix to tell Photo Viewer to use the correct color profile or to just increase the brightness in Photo Viewer, but I can't find where the setting is.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

            <p>You might try a third party application to monitor your bandwidth.&nbsp; I'm sure there are free programs, too.&nbsp; I don't have any particular to recommend.&nbsp;&nbsp; My internet service provider has a usage monitor that keeps track of usage daily.&nbsp; You could check to
 see if your ISP has a usage monitor.</p>

</p><p>You can also turn off background apps.&nbsp; Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background Apps.&nbsp; Back to Task Manager, if you click on the App History tab, you can see metered network usage by app&nbsp;there.&nbsp; I have not used this feature, so I don't know how helpful it

<h2>            Sonic The Hedgehog games on Backwards Compatible on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>While 39 classic games that I did suggestions, I still decides to add one more suggestion with me by the end year of 2018 for my final suggestion and I'm still like to put Sonic games to add Backwards compatible on Xbox One by contact developers for future
 of favorite children's games experience to play like me for Xbox gamers. So here selection of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing with Banjo-Kazooie (Xbox 360 exclusively version) (2010)</p>
<p>Sonic Heroes (Xbox version)</p>
<p>Sonic The Hedgehog (2006) (with fix glitches, fix bugs issues and fix load times) (If this Sonic 2006 game are bc or not)</p>
<p>Sonic Mega Collection Plus (Xbox version)</p>
<p>Sonic free Riders (with Kinect and Controller)</p>
<p>Sonic Riders (Xbox version)</p>
<p>Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (If this still bc with disc on Xbox One)</p>
<p>Shadow The Hedgehog (Video Game) (Xbox Version)</p>
<p>Sega Superstars Tennis</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that will be it for me and I'm still done with suggestions and questions with me while Microsoft Agents and Sega Developers would appreciate. Farewell, Tommy Way.<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;ThomasWay211991,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we can understand your desire for more Sonic and other Sega published games to be made available for Xbox One, the forum isn't the best place to put these requests and suggestions.&nbsp; Your forum history shows you keep making the same requests nearly
 every week. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to BC games, it is <strong>entirely up to the publisher</strong> to make their old titles available for backwards compatibility, it's
<strong>not</strong> a decision that can be taken by Microsoft alone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, some games can no longer be made BC. For example, Sega Superstars tennis contains licensed content from third parties that Sega has not renewed with them.&nbsp; Unless that changes, this game will not be available to be made backwards compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to take up your requests directly with SEGA, posting them here not going to change anything.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            drivers disappearing for usb sd cards and cameras on windows 10 PC and Laptops then causing cyclic reboot</h2>
                    <p>I have been loading business photos from SD cards to my Lenova PC windows 10 pro latest updates 2018. The ability to connect the SD card reader and cameras disappeared and when tried to update went into an eternal restart loop that goes nowhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another PC in the office - different operator - has failed and cyclic reboot for same reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The temporary laptop I have has been working fine on network for past week whilst waiting for cure to Lenova windows 10 Pro driver problem.</p>
<p>However now after uploading over 30 photos last week and this week it now has lost the device drivers no longer recognising the SD card reader or cameras.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting very annoyed with Microsoft updates so looking for a solution that doesn't lose my local data&nbsp; ( networked drives safe) and allows our computer to operate without update glitches.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            BSOD Error 0x00000101 in WIndows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I just build a new computer with the follow parts:</p>
<p>OEM version of Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</p>
<p>CPU - Intel Core i5-2500</p>
<p>Motherboard - Asus P8h67-M Evo Rev 3 with latest BIOS 1850</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4MB (2 x 2GB) Crucial BL2KIT25664BA1339</p>
<p>Antec case with Antec NEO ECO 620C 620W power supply</p>

<p>USB Keyboard Microsoft 600</p>
<p>USB Mouse Logitech M510</p>
<p>Pioneer DVD DVR-219BK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am constantly getting the BSOD with the following error message: "A clock interrupt was not received on a secondary processor within the allocated time interval"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All drivers are up to date and I have even updated to the latest BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I only have 2GB of RAM installed&nbsp;then the computer is stable, but it is never stable with 4GB of RAM. From what I have read this is a common problem with Windows 7 64-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I am now at my wits end on figuring out how to fix this constant problem.</p>

            Well its seems I finally found the answer. I went to Intel's web site and downloaded a newer driver,
<a href="http://downloads.guru3d.com/download.php?det=2789#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Intel</span></a> HD Graphics 15.22.50.2509 64-bit&nbsp;
 , for the integrated graphics processor and I now have stability! This graphics driver is not available on the Asus site, you have to go to Intel to get it.<br />

            Send to&gt;Bluetooth appears for me when select multiple files, but I can tell you right now that your phone won't accept all the files at once. For some reason, Windows Phone can only do one file transfer at a time.<br />

</p><p>But the problem is it is always having resolution problems and always needs to me sign out and sign back in. Anytime I plug in an external monitor, anytime I disconnect a display, and even after I restart the computer. I will turn off the computer, turn
 it on the next day, sign in, start working and realize that nothing is scaled correctly and it is saying I need to sign out again. I can understand a sign out-sign in after first changing but I haven't touched the resolution settings since I first got the
 computer and yet it is still constantly making me sign out and sign back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if there's just some setting or something I'm missing to fix this, if it's a problem with the OS or the Laptop Make/Model itself, or if this is just some existing bug and there's nothing that can be done about it for now, but thought I'd ask
 here to see if there was any useful insight or tips otherwise just report it so it can hopefully be fixed in the future if possible.</p>
