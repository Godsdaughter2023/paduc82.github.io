            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.

<h2>            Win 10 PEOPLE app not sync&#39;ing with Google contacts</h2>
                    <p>I did have it working when I initially set up the connection from WIN 10 MAIL app on PC to GMAIL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I needed to disconnect GMAIL.</p>
<p>When I reconnected GMAIL then mail and calendar work perfectly but contacts do not go into the PEOPLE app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is driving me potty. I have removed the MAIL and PEOPLE apps completely and then reinstalled from the STORE. I have run the MS troubleshooting programme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is like cardDav isn't working or something.</p>

            <p>Thank you for offering some ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am looking at my Google Contacts, I click 'Leave Contacts preview' and it returns to the old-style list of Google Contacts. All of my Contacts are listed on the left-hand side in a folder called 'My Contacts (891)'...891 being the number of contacts
 which changes if I delete or add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - I think I am already doing as you suggest.....unless you think I have it configured wrongly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the url click through...I think that is suggesting taking Google Contacts into Outlook and then connecting the People App to outlook. Would any additions, changes etc made to a contact in the People App flow back to the Google Contact and so sync
 with other devices?</p>

            Solved. &nbsp;Open the People app and go down to the settings button and open settings. Click on "Add an Account" and select Outlook.com. Sign into your windows account. You will now have a Gmail2 account and it will start syncing your contacts. You should
 now see all of your contacts if they are linked to your outlook

            I went into the people app, removed my google account, then re-added it from the people app and it seems to work fine. And it hasn't effected my google calendar or gmail syncing.

            This doesn't work. Windows quickly and rightly recognises that you've already signed in with your outlook account. Unless you're saying you have 2 outlook accounts? Whatever the case, it hasn't worked for me. And I'm not surprised either. &nbsp;There's no reason
 for an outlook account to suddenly be recognized as a gmail2 account.&nbsp;

<p>Most links that remain are to the online (web) installer and won't work now that Microsoft has retired Movie Maker 2012. There are some copies of the offline installer from archive.org and that's what I'd recommend for reinstalling.</p>

<p><span><span>So, Im looking for anyone who is a Creepypasta Fanatic, Im probably like literally the most serious Creepypasta fanatic on xbox live, i got the gamertag</span><span>The
 crew, the insanity and the social outcast skills to go with and ALOT of games, And I want to find more people who are creepypasta fanatics like myself, NO Not some fanboy, not someone whos heard of it, NOT someone who just like jeff the killer, I mean someone
 who Effin' outright LOVES&nbsp;</span>Creepypasta and everything that it is, A real fan. Get it?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have two friends, xLAughing JAcK and the other xBenxDrowned, Both of them are practically my brethren, And My other bestfriend is Jay, He was going to join the group soon and change his gamertag to a Slenderman gamertag. Oh! and also if anyone actually is
 a hardcore fan and wants to join this group I only want someone, who is willing to stick with us and Change their gamertag to something Creepypasta related, We arent some stupid Clan, We arent no MLG gamers, We arent no competitive bastards (note:well then

<p>I don't think the preview download should be done in the middle of a game. My online games are expensive to play when I get kicked off line.</p>

    <title>PES 2012 - Released October 14th - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PES 2012 - Released October 14th</h2>
                    
<b>PES 2012: The Season Begins October 14th</b>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<b>KONAMI dates ‘most ambitious and advanced football game ever’</b>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>Konami Digital Entertainment GmbH has announced it will unleash its eagerly-awaited PES<br />
2012 title on October 14th for PlayStation®3, Xbox 360® and Windows PC, stating it is the most<br />
ambitious and advanced football experience ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PES 2012 goes further in giving the user total control than any other football title, offering AI<br />
innovations and gameplay additions that cover every aspect of real football.</b> Central to PES<br />
2012 is the all-new Active AI system which ensures that teammates work to close down space,<br />
defend zonally and hold their line to minimise attacking options. As such, as players defend, their<br />
colleagues will look to hold the defensive line and mark oncoming offensive support. Conversely,<br />
when attacking, the player will see that their teammates will make dummy runs, draw defenders,<br />
and work to give the player more options in attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Furthermore, the emphasis on the team as a unit is demonstrated with PES 2012’s ground-<br />
breaking Teammate Control system – a truly unique addition which allows the user to control two<br />
players at once, prompting runs or drawing defenders with one, while the other holds the ball up.</b><br />
Teammate Control works in two ways; with users pressing the right analogue stick in the direction<br />
of the player they wish to control. Support play is offered in Assisted mode wherein users prompt a<br />
second player to make a timed run to cut inside or receive a ball, while total control is afforded by<br />
the fully Manual mode which gives the user complete freedom of movement of the second player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Elsewhere, PES 2012 is equally full of new additions. Animation has been enhanced, while the<br />
overall presentation has also been refined. Managers can now be seen wandering the touchline,<br />
while the general atmosphere of a big-match day has been faithfully recreated. In terms of<br />
gameplay, shooting movement and reactions are much improved, control is no longer totally lost<br />
when losing possession of the ball, a return to the classic ‘behind player’ penalty system, and one-<br />
on-one situations offer greater control as defenders press and jostle to win the ball, and attackers<br />
use upper body feints and movements to bypass and wrong-foot their man.</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>PES 2012 also continues KONAMI’s close relationship with UEFA that sees the PES series as the<br />
exclusive home of the UEFA Champions League™, UEFA Europa League™ and UEFA Super<br />
Cup™ video game licences. Attention to detail within these key tournaments has been extended<br />
to the match officials, and PES 2012 will see referees and their assistants now sporting the official<br />
UEFA Champions League™ uniforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“PES 2012 is a massive advance for the football genre, truly the most ambitious and advanced<br />
football game ever” claimed Jon Murphy, European PES Team Leader for Konami Digital<br />
Entertainment GmbH. “The additions we have made in terms of Teammate Control, Active AI<br />
and Off the Ball Control and elevate the level of play to new heights. No other game allows users<br />
so much control over their team, and PES 2012 ensures that the days of gaps in defence and<br />
shouting at teammates to make a run are long gone. This is a very exciting time to be a PES fan,<br />
and we are delighted that we can set a firm date for football fans to mark in their calendars.”</p>

<p>I'd say it has very impressive likenesses to players, not every player, of course, some have generic appearances, much like Fifa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being able to control a second player with the right analog stick to draw defenders away sounds like it could work really well. During set plays, whether it be goal kicks, corners, free kicks, throw ins, you can also control players off ball, to get into
 better attacking positions. On the 3rd August when the 'embargo' drops and the people playing the preview codes can finally talk about the game, should be interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, 2011 was a huge improvement over every next gen PES title, I think. 2012 promises to be fantastic. So I think they've finally pulled their finger out. Especially as they've included the old PS2 modes, such as challenge mode &amp; training mode, dribbling
 around those cones. :P</p>

<p>It's hard to rub your stomach and pat your head at the same time. Go ahead and try it, I'll wait. The fluid combination of the two separate motions feels unnatural, but those who can pull it off without hesitation will always have something impressive to
 demonstrate. Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 has added its own version of the aforementioned feat of coordination with a new control scheme that's extremely difficult and -- believe it or not -- much more rewarding: Teammate Controls.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teammate Control let's you control two on-screen players at once, and in short, it's a total game changer -- but that doesn't mean it's easy. While FIFA's allowed gamers to call players in for help or send them on runs, it never provided
<i>full</i> control. After years of relying on AI and semi-controlled breaks into space, gamers can now fully manipulate their surroundings – the only catch: it's quite difficult to manage. My first attempts at using the new feature caused a breakdown in coordination
 ending with me sending my teammates running out of bounds as I failed to simultaneously dribble around defenders. Other times a mental hiccup would cause both players to run around in alternating circles. Rather than smoothly kicking a player into a run, I'd
 often force him to stop in his tracks and lose momentum. But for every handful of missteps, there's that golden moment when the stars align on the pitch and you pull off an insane pass for a break and an open look at the net. Then it's all worth it.
<br />
<br />
For those of us who get their fingers tied in knots over such things, Teammate Control can be turned off if they'd like to toy with it in small doses or not use it all together. But for serious players looking to make the perfect play, it will likely become
 a staple in their virtual soccer career moving forward. I've cursed my AI teammates a hundred and one times for not sprinting into space for an easy breakaway. From the PES 2012 demo at E3, Konami showed new AI smarts to combat this frustration, but at this
 point in development they've upped their own ante by giving players full control over their nearby allies. The new maneuver is pulled off with a simple click of the right stick pointed the direction of the desired teammate.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
For argument's sake, and the fact Lionel Messi has championed PES for the past few years, let's arrange a FC Barcelona scenario. Viktor Valdes, the goalkeeper, has just made a save and lobs the ball to the foot of Midfielder Andres Iniesta near the center line.
 Iniesta beats his mark and carries the ball up the center of the field as striker Messi's waiting on the cusp of the offside trap. Traditionally, one can punch a through-ball for the striker to catch after passing his defender, but Teammate Control provides
 options. Imagine an additional defender breaking his zone to mark Iniesta harder and force a pass. Pushing in the right stick in the direction of Messi, you can make him run into space and give Iniesta a clean pass to keep possession with Barca. Alternatively,
 you can set Messi running at an unorthodox angle and give him a clear shot on goal. Teammate Control means opportunities, and it's only a player's imagination (and skill) that causes a breakdown in possibility.
<br />
<br />
While Teammate Control might revolutionize the technical aspects of charging up the field, the additional elements at play in Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 remain mired in the past. Before getting a handle on Teammate Control, every pass, shot, and scenario in
 the game felt strikingly similar to last year's outing as well as the year before. Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 is sitting on a fantastic new way to play, but are its other elements going to keep it from being great?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Superstar</b> difficulty is also unlockable from the PES Shop!</p>
<p>The animations &amp; turning look slightly more fluid on this build. Hopefully they improve on them even more. Love the ball physics for Rooney's goal, bounces off the ground then dips over the keeper.</p>

<p>Yeah erm, this PES v Fifa crap is boring me now. This thread wasn't made for this purpose. I'm slagging neither off, as after buying Fifa 11 for the PC, I was impressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But how can you slag PES 2012 off without playing it? Up until Fifa 08, Fifa was shocking. But I guess that didn't affect you because of the licenses, so you saw through all of this, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PES 2011 was a massive improvement on PES 2010. Just like Fifa 08 was a massive improvement on Fifa 07. So if Fifa can get it right... (within a year) Eventually... After years of trying, why are you so sure that PES can't? FYI, Konami have been listening
 to the fans' feedback &amp; have improved dramatically on PES 2011... I'm not saying it'll be as fluid as Fifa 12, but it's making forward strides.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having exactly the same issues. &nbsp;I've done what has been suggested in your reply to Madhubabu_992 but unfortunately it hasn't resolved the issue. &nbsp;I've collected the log files, is this any use for you?</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the “clean uninstall and reinstall” method Robert provided. If you already tried it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please &nbsp;check your Skype for business version and update it. About how to perform it: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788B8-A3CE-44BF-BB09-E334518B8B19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#ID0EBCAAA=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788B8-A3CE-44BF-BB09-E334518B8B19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#ID0EBCAAA=Mac</a>
 . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, to isolate the network’s effect, please try changing a network connection and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if the issue persists, I need gather more information to narrow down the possible cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it only happening &nbsp;during a Skype meeting?</li><li>Are your colleagues also facing the same issue? If so, how many affected users are there?</li><li>Please send me your Skype for Business version and OS version.</li><li>Please collect some screenshots of the issue if convenient.</li><li>Please send the log files to me in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">

<p>Thanks for kindly update. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The picture is a little blurred to see the characters, can you send it again in PM with the original picture?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, have you tried changing a network connection? ( You can perform this by temporarily using a mobile phone’s hotspot)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please check with your colleagues who is also using Skype for Business for Mac if they have the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, did you get the jpeg of my desktop from your last request showing the error message on Skype for Business along with the version numbers for both Skype and for MacOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I tried the hotspot and the problem was also present - however this may also be down to the poor mobile phone coverage in our rural area. &nbsp;We actually use the broadband for our mobile phone via a VOIP facility with the EE provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly I've also been running Skype for Business on my Windows laptop PC on the same wifi network. &nbsp;The problem does not happen on this machine despite on the same network. &nbsp;I have 3 Macs and the problem exists on all 3 - I did try and see if the problem
 was occurring simultaneously however this was not the case. Therefore the problem only exists on the Mac platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also been running the very useful WiFi Monitor utility to check the stability of our wifi network. &nbsp;There were some interruptions to the service and these have been reduced by manually locking the radio channel, this has helped on that score however
 it never affected any PC/Mac related network activity. In other words, even though the monitor may have detected an error - if we were on Skype, mobile phone, FaceTime call or whatever the service remained uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Finally, to your point No.3 - Can't really recall when this became such a nuisance, it feels like it's been there for 2 or 3 months or so - not really sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have received your screenshots in PM and thanks for your effort to narrow down the issue’s cause, your feedback is valuable for us to find the cause of the issue. We will do some tests about the issue and I will post back as soon as I get a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, just one more thing need to be confirmed, the issue didn’t happen from the very beginning, it happened in the process you using it, is that correct?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And is this issue just happening on your Mac or others in your organization also face it? This is check the scope of the impact which can help us figure out where the issue lies in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your cooperation again.</p>

<p>Hi Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m not too clear on your question regarding how long or when this issue happens. From memory this issue has been preent for some while, say 3 or 4 months to some degree as for the most part i wouldve just had the application running but not using it as
 a communication tool infrequently. More recently, however, I’ve been using Skype for Business on the Mac for conference calls and general comms more frequently and of course encounter the problem almost everytime i use it, particularly on long calls say over
 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from the screenshot, i waited for the message to appear “lost server, reconnecting...”, so as far as I can tell the computer wasnt doing anything else that may have affected the Skype application, nor did the WiFi drop or any other network
 interference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only affects those of us that choose to work from home on our Macs, say about 5 or 6. &nbsp;We all have PC laptops as a fall back, but would ideally like to rely on the Mac platfrom. &nbsp;I like to get to the bottom of problems whereas my colleagues “give up”
 and either don’t use Skype as much as myself or revert to the PC instead for conference calls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your efforts in helping resolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

            Hi cris10c,<br />
<br />
Firstly, I’d like to confirm if you are using an Office 365 account or On-premises Skype for Business account when the issue happened. If the former one, the issue could be related to the DNS records that are needed to log into the Skype for Business for Mac
 client. For your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2566790/troubleshooting-skype-for-business-online-dns-configuration-issues-in-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2566790/troubleshooting-skype-for-business-online-dns-configuration-issues-in-office-365</a><br />
<br />
If the issue persists after you’ve confirmed all the required DNS records are added, I’d like to confirm the following information to further investigate the issue:<br />
1. The detailed version of the Skype for Business for Mac client you are using. (in
<strong>Skype for Business</strong>&gt;<strong> About Skype for Business</strong>)<br />
2. A screenshot about the error message.<br />
3. Does the issue happen to other users in your organization?<br />
4. Since the issue occurred recently, I’d like to confirm if you’ve made any changes to the application (like upgrade) or the network environment before the issue happened.&nbsp;<br />
5. I have sent you a private message to collect the affected account (no password) for further check.<br />

Thanks,<br />

            Hi cris10c,<br />
<br />
Thanks for providing the affected account in the private message. I have checked the account and noticed all the needed DNS records have been correctly added. Thus, I suggest you try manually configuring your account in the Skype for Business for Mac client
 to see if it makes a difference. Here are the detailed steps for your reference:<br />
1. When you are in login page, click Advanced option;<br />
2. Don’t select “Auto-detect server”;<br />
3. Enter <strong>https://webdir.online.lync.com/autodiscover/autodiscoverservice.svc/root</strong> in both Internal Discovery Address and External Discovery Address.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Moreover, could you answer the rest of the questions in my first reply so we can better understand the symptom? An additional test I would like you to run is to check if you can log into your account on another device in a different network environment. This
 will help us identify if it’s a specific device issue or network problem. Thanks for your time and cooperation.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sam<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize, I missed your response until today. &nbsp;Manually entering the server as suggested seems to have solved the problem!!! &nbsp;It has only been a few minutes, but until I did as you suggested I also could not change my status and appeared offline to everyone.
 &nbsp;That issue appears to be solved as well.</p>

            Hi cris10c,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting back.<br />
<br />
From your description, I got to know the first issue is now resolved but the presence issue remains, right? If so, firstly, please be aware that the
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-your-presence-status-in-Skype-for-Business-9b64eef5-47b8-46d8-a744-f490e6f88feb?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#OS_Type=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Note</a></strong> field you mentioned is a
 customized status message which is a feature in Skype for Business for Mac. Then, let’s move forward with the presence issue based on these steps:<br />
1. I noticed the affected Skype for Business for Mac client version is 16.7.175, which indicates you are in the Office
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-Insider-releases-for-Skype-for-Business-on-Mac-7f190a71-2b56-4914-8044-668582997619#Insider=Office_Insider_Slow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Insider Slow</a> channel. However, the latest build of the application in Insider Slow channel is now upgraded to 16.7.197 based on my research. Thus, I recommend you upgrade to the latest version to have a shot.<br />
2. To reconfirm if you are indeed in the Insider Slow channel, please upload a relevant screenshot in
<strong>Help</strong>&gt; <strong>Check for Updates</strong>. For example:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f2a2a58-3c06-4294-99fc-62f7a21da2bd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f2a2a58-3c06-4294-99fc-62f7a21da2bd" /></a><br />
3. Please <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
start your Mac in safe mode</a> so that it performs certain checks and prevents some software from automatically loading or opening. Then check if there is any improvement.&nbsp;<br />
4. Since the issue doesn’t occur to your colleague, could you try setting up your account on their Mac and test if you can successfully change the presence status?<br />
5. Also, I have provided you with a test Office 365 account which works fine from my side. Please configure this account on your Mac to see if the problem can be duplicated. This is the link to access the private message:<br />

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to change date and time on your Windows 7 computer and getting message "You don't have permission to perform the task ". The issue could be if there is some user profile corruption or some settings corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to turn off the User Account Control temporarily on the computer and check if you are able to change the settings for the Internet time on the computer or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Start.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click User Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on Change User Account Settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Drag the slider to Never Notify.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click OK.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If issue persists, try to enable the Default Administrator on the computer and check the status of your issue.
<span>To enable the default Administrator account, perform the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Click <strong>Start </strong>and type <strong>CMD </strong>in the <strong>
Start search box.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2. <strong>Right click on CMD </strong>in the list and click on "<strong>Run as administrator</strong>"</span></p>
<p><span>3. Type the following command: <strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong></span></p>

==============================================<br />
Just wondering...did you try to purchase from the following site?<br />
<br />
Microsoft Store - AutoCollage 2008<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/ThemeID.27509700/AutoCollage-2008/productID.216407800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/ThemeID.27509700/AutoCollage-2008/productID.216407800</a><br />
<br />
FWIW...AutoCollage is included in Windows Photo Gallery 2012.<br />
only problem is...it only runs on Win7 and Win8.

    <title>Remote Desktop Causes High CPU Utilization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lexluthor5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Causes High CPU Utilization</h2>
                    
<p>We just started using a remote desktop connection to a Windows 2003 Server.</p>
<p>When I connect via my XP Remote Desktop client, I get high utilization in mstsc.exe after a short period of time.</p>
<p>It runs around 25-50% of the CPU and basically prevents most other operations from working at normal speeds.</p>
<p>Any idea at all what could be the problem or how to even troubleshoot it?</p>

<p><span><span>Hello LexLuthor5,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try the below methods to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you set your computer to clean boot and try to connect using Remote desktop and check if the usage spikes up.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can refer the below article that will give you information on ‘How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state’:</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>On my research on this issue, I also find that some of the users were able to fix this issue by setting the Video Hardware
 Acceleration to highest: </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Start, Control Panel.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In the classic view, double click on the Display
 icon.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select the Settings tab and click on the Advanced
 button. The Advanced Settings dialog box appears.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click on the Troubleshoot tab.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Move the slider to Full next to the ‘Hardware accelation’.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Tish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your firewall is not the one blocking your ports, it could be a third-party antivirus program that causes the issue. For us to effectively assist you, kindly provide us the information that we need below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Describe to us how exactly have you set inbound and outbound ports in Windows Firewall to make sure that we didn't skip any step.</li><li>Are you using any third-party antivirus programs? If yes, have you tried to disable them and see if it helps?</li><li>Were you able to use the printer before?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer that may have triggered the issue?</li><li>Is the printer connected via network?</li><li>Have you checked if you have any pending updates for your computer?</li></ul>
<p>

            <p>It's moot at this point - I did a System Restore to last week before the AIMP Player had been installed and everything related to it is gone now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, in answer to your response I did try rebooting into Safe Mode and fixing it that way. In Safe Mode I went into Computer, OS (C:), Program Files (x86), AIMP, AIMP system folder. I got exactly the same result as when I was not in Safe Mode - the file
 couldn't be deleted because it was open in Windows Explorer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I did the System Restore I realized that the music I had listened to when the AIMP Player was installed was still somehow associated with that program (actually that's just a guess, but every song that had gone through the AIMP player had been updated
 to the date of the system restore). None of my other music had changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for trying to help. I really should have thought of System Restore myself.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the detailed feedback. It actually contains some details that you might have included in your original post, e.g. the fact that you installed the AIMP Player only very recently. Without this knowledge a respondent could not possibly suggest a
 System Restore. In your case this was probably the easiest solution - well done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do a Google search on "how to delete locked files" then you'll find several suitable tools to do the job. As an alternative you could boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode and delete any file while in Console Mode. Your solution was a bit more
 drastic but far easier to apply.</p>

    <title>Have gamertag, but nothing else - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awiun4t92u4nti9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have gamertag, but nothing else</h2>
                    
<p>I just got a new game for the 360 after quite a few years, and it's saying that I have to sign into my account to do any sort of save whatsoever—if the console turns off, my game is done for.&nbsp; So I tried using my gamertag on the console, and it says an email/password
 is required.&nbsp; I put in my email address, and it says the email is not recognized.&nbsp; I've only had one email address for the last ~14 years, and I don't imagine the 360 is older than that.<br />
<br />
I've therefore created an account through this website, and tried adding my gamertag to it, but it says the gamertag is in use.&nbsp; The support pages say the following to access my account information: sign in with my gamertag on the console, and my account info
 is given in the upper right corner.&nbsp; But that's why I need help—I can't sign in because my email isn't recognized.<br />
<br />
So now I'm stuck in an infinite loop where I need my account information to retrieve my account information.&nbsp; My original 360 red ringed after ~6 months and there was zero compensation for it, and that's where most of my information was created/stored (that
 I know of), and the transferring process claimed copyright infringement and couldn't get any of my data from the old hard drive.&nbsp; The new hard drive is internal (where the old one was external), and therefore I cannot hard-wire or solder it in to retrieve
 this data from it.&nbsp; So I'm not sure I have any other information on this 360 than simply my gamertag and associated game data/achievements, and I can't access any of my old information for the mentioned reasons.<br />
<br />
How can I sign in to my existing account and play my new game?&nbsp; My gamertag is Amatzikahni.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear that you're having issues. &nbsp;If the console you had red ringed at the 6 month mark then you should have set up a repair of the console as, if the console was new, it would have still been covered under warranty.</p>
<p>If your gamertag was not associated with an email address and the system will not allow you to transfer the data then there's nothing that can be done about it.</p>
<p>However, if the tag was associated with an email and password then you can contact phone support. &nbsp;They will ask you some account specific questions. &nbsp;So long as you can answer them they will give you the email associated with the account.</p>
<p>Finally, I see you mentioned about self repair of the console. &nbsp;Please be aware that discussions of self repair is not allowed on the forums. &nbsp;Also, any modification of your console will void its warranty and could result in the console being banned from the Live service as it is against the ToU and CoC of the Live service to modify Xbox hardware.</p>
