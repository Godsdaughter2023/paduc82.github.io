            <p>I also have Lenovo Flex 3. The black screen would suddenly appear while I am still using the computer. 9 out of 10 times it would occur when the power is not plugged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same as the original post, I would press any button, plug and unplug any external display, and plug and unplug power source, but nothing. The screen would be black and the power would be on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single time, I would need to do a hard restart but shutting the computer off by holding the power button, and then start the computer as I normally would. The computer doesn't even ask if I want to restart using Safe Mode as if it didn't record the
 black screen or abnormal shut off.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Windows Live Mail stopped working about a week ago.&nbsp; I need to get it working again (or at least retrieve my contact information and some old emails).&nbsp; How can I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail was originally installed under Windows 7.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 in the fall and Live Mail worked fine until last week.&nbsp; MIcrosoft support said that they do not support this, but I need to get at the old information.</p>

            <span>Thanks for responding to my problem.<br />
<br />
The problem began almost two ago. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I first noticed it when I was talking with Microsoft support after I got the message "account temporarily suspended" when I tried to use a new app I had downloaded, OneNote. &nbsp;I soon found out that I could not create a new account using a new Outlook email address.
 &nbsp;Within a few minutes of creating a new account I would get the same message, "account temporarily suspended" with the new account. &nbsp;The email accounts I usually use are all gmail. I do not use Outlook. &nbsp;Windows Live Mail&nbsp;was OK the day before the problem
 with suspended accounts occurred. &nbsp;The problem with suspended accounts has been resolved, but Windows Live Mail still does not work. &nbsp;The problems may be unrelated, but I don't think so.<br />
<br />
There are no error messages. &nbsp;I click on Windows Live Mail, I see a timer for a few seconds, then the timer disappears and nothing happens. &nbsp;I have tried to access Windows Live Mail in several different ways -- all with the same result.</span>

            <p>I tried to follow your instructions.&nbsp; I had to modify them somewhat because I am using Windows 10.&nbsp; I do not have Start&gt; etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I displayed the list of programs and them looked for Windows Essentials.&nbsp; I did not find it. What should I be doing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most important to me is that the files are not erased as I repair the program.&nbsp; I tried to backup the Windows Live Mail directory, but got an error message that a file, edb.log, was open and could not be copied.&nbsp; The program Windows Live Mail is not active.</p>

            <p>Thanks for getting back to me.&nbsp; As you can imagine not having access to contact information is a big problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried what you suggested in your most recent reply (03/24/2016), but had problems with step 5 "Repair all Windows Live Program" .&nbsp; A window opened up saying that it was repairing the program, but it did not seem to be doing anything.&nbsp; The percent completed
 remained at 0% even after 10 minutes.&nbsp; I attempted to cancel the repair and it is still trying to cancel the repair after 25 minutes.&nbsp; I will try to send you a screen shot in a separate email.&nbsp; When I included it with this email I got a message saying that
 the email was too large.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed another problem with the Windows Live Mail program and wonder if it is related. A few days ago, while attempting to backup the directory with the Windows Live Mail Programs and files I got a message stating that it could not copy a file because
 that file was open.&nbsp; As far as I know no files were open.&nbsp; I waited a while with no change and there was no option to close the file.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem that has existed since March 6 (I think) and the error message is as follows:</p>
<p>
The host 'mail.xxxxxx..id.au' could not be found. Please verify that you have entered the server name correctly.<br />
<br />
Subject 'wlm11'<br />
Server: 'mail.xxxxxx.id.au'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC0D<br />
Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 587<br />
Secure(SSL): No<br />
Socket Error: 11001
</p><p>
</p><p>It seems to me the only answer is to dump windows altogether and move to g-mail or yahoo but I then have the problem of transferring files like tax information etc..</p>

</p><p>I have a Western Digital Elements 10A2 1TB external hard drive, it has been performing as if it was connected to USB 2 even though the USB hub I'm using is for USB 3 and it has the blue color on it too. The speeds are ridiculously low, I'm getting a max
 of 20MB/s even though other users with similar model have reached up to 150MB/s.</p>

</p><p>Hi Mahesh,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1. Does the issue persist with every USB device?<br />
<br />
<em>Yes unfortunately, the USB3s are performing like the USB2 so I just plug it in USB2 because sometimes when I plug the external in one of the USB3 the laptop would shut down immediately.</em><br />

<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled all the drivers, restarted the laptop, rescanned for new changes, the usb drivers are back, I've clicked one each one to search for recent update on the web but all were the latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My external doesn't have started to not show up anymore, this is before uninstalling the drivers, I thought it could be something with the lettering so I went and checked Disk Management but haven't found it there. The external is working and running (in
 terms of power) and the lights are on but not showing on my laptop. If I plug it in the USB2 it works fine but neither of the USB3 and this problem of plugging the external to the USB3 and the laptop suddenly shuts down is really bugging me off, I'm losing
 my stuff without saving them, it's truly annoying.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have tested the external on my brother's laptop and he has USB2 and the speeds would reach up to 35MB/s.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Not sure what to do anymore, I think the USB ports are defected or something, I don't have the warranty because the laptop is 3 years old I think.</span></p>

            <p>Please look closely the output of USB viewer. The mass storage device is showing up in a port that is &nbsp;not marked SS. Note the SS symbol above the usb logo. &nbsp;The controller is not detecting this device as a super speed device. Try another USB3 device that
 you know works at superspeed in this port and see where it appears. If it appears as a non-super speed device then something is wrong with the internal circuity of the port or there is some bios option turned off superspeed. Or it could also be that the OS
 knows that this is bad USB3 device and forces it to be 2.0 device. Post the VID/PID of the device.</p>

    <title>Partition Problem - can&#39;t delete &#40;or combine&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessica4nyc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Partition Problem - can&#39;t delete &#40;or combine&#41;</h2>
                    Did a clean install of Vista and now my hard drive is partitioned. Now I have not space on my C drive because there's a partition and I can't delete the D drive.<br />
<br />
When I pull up Computer Management and there are two partitions. It is now showing 2 local disks: "Local Disk (C:) which has 281 MB free of 6.83 GB" and "Local Disk (D:) which has&nbsp;68.89 GB free of&nbsp;71.15 GB" (also 71 unallocated).
<br />
<br />
Everything is on the C: which is now full. I tried deleting the D: by right clicking on the D: but "Delete volume" is greyed out. I tried deleting it for the command prompt (doc) that did not work either.<br />
<br />
How can I delete this partition and have my entire hard drive back?<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />
<br />

<br />
Above is how you are supposed to do it.<br />
<br />
We can not solve problems that you encounter when you use 3rd Party Software, such as KillDisk.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you do a clean install of Vista, and use the built-in Disk Management Tools to partiiton your Hard Drive, if&nbsp;you need to.<br />

            <p>Did you have anything unusual happen before this point? I've seen others report that they were making continual changes to a project and then at some point they tried to save and got an error. The next time they opened the project it was corrupted such that
 the storyboard was completely empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this what you have seen? Any other symptoms/steps you can provide?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, it appears your project has been corrupted. If you have been prudent and have saved your project with different names as you go along (File &gt; Save project as), I would go back and find the project file just before this round of edits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have no such backup of your work-in-progress, then you have to find a way to either start over or manually edit your project file to fix the corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another thread (among the many on this topic), where I describe the steps. Hopefully you are able to get your project working again.</p>

    <title>Cannot adjust screen brightness on my Sony VAIO Fit Series 15 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexisbugeja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot adjust screen brightness on my Sony VAIO Fit Series 15 SVF1521JCGW</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I'd like to acknowledge the many other questions that have been posted on the Microsoft Community regarding the same issue. So far every question and answer that I have trawled through has not been able to provide me with an adequate solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, in regards to the model number, the sticker at the bottom of my laptop says that the model number for my device is SVF152A29W but when I opened Sony Control Center, it says that my model number is SVF1521JCGW (the one noted in the title above).
 Another but, is that when I type in the former model number, the one found on the base of my device, into support pages and search bars on various Sony websites, it seems to be non-existent. When I type the latter model number, the one found in Sony Control
 Center, it says that nothing can be found in relation to that model. Although when I typed that model number into Google search, the results are from computer and electronic stores advertising the laptop for purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have tried numerous attempts to resolve my problem, such as opening Sony Control Center and turning off the screen brightness; opening the advanced power options and making sure that adaptive brightness was enabled - which it already was - and opening
 VAIO update and being sure that my device is completely up-to-date, which it is. Like I said before, I have typed the model number that was found on the bottom of my device into driver updates and all the rest on the Sony websites but the website does not
 recognise my model. I have typed in the latter model into the same search bars, now when I do this, it refers me to Sony Asia-Pacific which in deed is where I am located, but when I type this model number into the Asia-Pacific search bar, it cannot find anything
 relating to the number I have just provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you for taking the time to read my question,</p>
<p>Alexis</p>

</p><p>Thanks for taking the time and effort to respond. Unfortunately I still have not been able to solve the problem. I think it has occurred because of a previous update, I wouldn't know which one.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            PalmCheck Help</h2>
                    <p>I've recently got a new windows 10 HP for Christmas. I went into a game I was playing, and noticed that I couldn't move my mouse while typing. I've looked at many forums that have had kind of the same problem, but they all had the "<strong>PalmCheck-Enhanced"
</strong>feature in the settings. I tried to go into the settings, and change the settings for PalmCheck. But once I went into the settings I couldn't see the setting for it. Its like the PalmCheck was gone. Is there any way I could enable PalmCheck so I can
 type while moving my mouse? </p>

            I have also&nbsp;been having great difficulty with the aftermath of loading Windows 8 which took more than 40 hours over a 2 week period. The end result is that I cannot download AOL or, Skype, except for China Tom Skype which is useless to the expat community
 living in China. Google Chrome has also disappeared, the Aol Windows app, with limited function,&nbsp;stopped functioning completely&nbsp;in less than 24 hours, my screen saver no longer works and although I have met some really nice people at Microsoft, I still have
 the same problems weeks later. It is unfortunate that Microsoft did not give fair warnings about the possible consequences of downloading Windows 8 ,like health warnings on packs of cigarettes.Also I have been told that this is an AOL problem not a Microsoft
 problem.&nbsp;I&nbsp;also lost Word from Windows Office. With the amount of time ,money and effort I have put into this&nbsp;process I could easily purchased a new computer. Very disappointing.

<div>AOL may be the problem, but my wife and I both use the AOL software for emails, etc. &nbsp;With the limited finances of AOL these days............I wonder how they will address this BIG issue.
<div><br />
<div>Regarding Word. &nbsp;Ummmmm. &nbsp;I have re-installed Microsoft Office and all things work well. &nbsp;Fortunately, &nbsp;I have a couple of computers we use that still have W7. &nbsp;I am only using &nbsp;W8 on a couple of tablets.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am sort of the local family guru on all things computer wise. &nbsp; A friend wanted a new laptop and I found some new W7 ones at our local big-chain computer store. &nbsp;I am not recommending W8 for new friends. &nbsp;At least for the time being. &nbsp;Microsoft has the

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>If you pre-ordered Overwatch from the Xbox Store, the Overwatch Beta was unlocked in the Xbox Store before the beta began. If you have already pre-ordered, go ahead and search for 'Overwatch Beta' through the Xbox Store to begin installing! For more information, please check out <a href="http://us.battle.net/overwatch/en/blog/20055970/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Blizzard's Overwatch Beta Blog</a> Post.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to check with Lenovo and Intel Support and Documentation as not all CPU's that will fit in your socket will work with the other electronics, BIOS, chipset, firmware and so on. Any conditions and/or limitations will be from those concerns and not Windows
 as it will run on any CPU that those support.<br />

    <title>msg.exe file isn&#39;t in System32 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> owenclark  say:</h3>
<h2>            msg.exe file isn&#39;t in System32</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to run the command "msg" on cmd. More specifically "msg * MESSAGE". I got an error stating: "'msg' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." I did some searching, and figured out it was because msg.exe
 was not in my System32 Folder. I am running Windows 10 64-bit, by the way. I searched the whole windows folder for msg.exe, and found the file under the directory of:&nbsp;C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-t..commandlinetoolsmqq_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.14393.0_none_569ddcdcc2b7c2e9</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i ran cmd again and I changed the directory to the one above, and ran the msg command again. I got a pop-up error saying that the msg file only works for 32-bit systems, and to contact my OS publisher to get the 64-bit version. Is there any way I can
 be able to run the msg command? Is there a 64-bit msg.exe file I can download and put in System32?</p>

<p>I downloaded a copy of MSG.EXE found in a backup (AMD) directory on a Windows 10 system.&nbsp; This OS says MSG.EXE is a 16 bit program.&nbsp; That means it can only run on 32 bit hardware - not on 64 bit OSes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSG.EXE is not found in \Windows\system32&nbsp; on Windows 7 64 bit and Windows 10 64 bit Operating Systems.&nbsp; From my search, nobody is addressing this problem.&nbsp; Many who have seen the problem do not realize that MSG is not on their system or are not discussing
 differences between 32 bit and 64 bit Operating Systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, I need the MSG.EXE function&nbsp; I have the same question that others have - and is never answered.&nbsp; How do I restore MSG.EXE (for 64 bit OSes) or what other program does the MSG.EXE function?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Laptop - No Sound Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually don't try to update my laptop since it always leads to issues. On wednesday, my laptop finally had enough and forced me to update. Now my audio, both speakers and headphones, won't work. I can see the "visual bar" moving, but I can't actually hear.
 I've tried many things to try and fix it: update drivers, uninstall and reinstall drivers, reroll update, clean boot. Yesterday, I decided to just screw it and reinstall my pc. Now it's just weird. Sometimes when I turn on my laptop there's no sound. Then
 when I restart, boom - there's sound! Guess what happens in the next restart? No sound.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span>What if your business depends upon VOIP, Voice communications, Screen sharing (yes, that is mentioned) and heavy-duty use? A mobile app that is supposed to perform as a true business program has NEVER occurred. I hope
 you can break that mold, but based on your performance to date, and responses I have received, you are coming late in the game to try to challenge snapchat.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Work to your darned strengths, will you. Support your core users BEFORE attempting to garner a new demographic.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So a New Skype is out. WILL MY REPO TELL ME AN UPDATE IS AVAILABLE, OR WILL I NEED TO GO OLD SCHOOL AND REMOVE THE CURRENT TRASH BEFORE I DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL WHAT YOU OFFER NEXT? At the moment, I do not seem to be
 able to get to https://repo.skype.com.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Will this be Skype for linux beta 5.5? Or, as you infer here, "Skype Preview" 5.5? No one at Skype seems to understand version numbers, but this is important to us.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT] Holy Cow! you put a version number in the DEB name??? Version&nbsp;8.5.76.55323? Thats a far cry from 5.4.0.1, and much later than the 5.2 that I was told by MS was the latest! I just checked my software sources, and Skype is enabled. I just checked for
 updates, and there is NO update for Skype yet. I think your Repo is dead. You should tell us when you do stuff like that.... Is https://repo.skype.com still operational? Or do we need to use this download link?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT2] Have you changed the platform requirements? Originally this was Ubuntu 14.04+, which makes sense. The current Long Term Support and later. I now have unsatisfied dependencies, which makes me think you changed more than just the versioning scheme.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello JSV_450,</p>
<p>thank you for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype Preview 8.5 is released to separate update channel (unstable) in our update repositories, as it is an early version, which needs you to opt-in to it. It can have some unforeseen issues, so any feedback is greatly appreciated and helps us make a
 great product you will enjoy using. The preview channel will receive regular updates and eventually becomes the new Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This version already addresses many issues reported for Skype for Linux Beta 5.x by you, the Linux community, including the addition of screen sharing, more languages, spellchecking, code-snippet sending, improved A/V settings and calling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Linux client is going to get the same features as the Windows and Mac versions for the first time, so that is the reason for changing the client version number, to be in sync across all our platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no change in requirements compared to the Skype for Linux Beta 5.x. If you hit any issues, please provide more details, so we can address them as soon as possible. You can use either this Community forum, or directly the "Report a problem" option
 in the client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>stay tuned :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>JonasT</p>

<p>When using the new Skype Preview&nbsp;8.5.76.55323 I can no longer send chat messages to users on version 5.4.0.1 of the Linux client; they just sit there on "Sending" and never go through. I can call these users OK, but the call quality sounds a lot worse that
 when I was using 5.4.0.1 myself, it sounds a lot more muffled, sort of like it's struggling for bandwidth…</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had to revert to&nbsp;5.4.0.1 due to being unable to send chat messages.</p>

            I tried it. But how do I know whether my status is available to others or not? And icon tray should show my status (like in skype 5.x: if I'm invisible, the icon is white and if I'm available, the icon is blue.

</p><p>Got past a couple of glitches (the logs are useful) before hitting wall :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- dependencies added: libsecret, libv4l2 on top of what skype beta needed</p>
<p>
</p><p>- PLEASE dont hardcode paths, let us control $PATH. Eg. /usr/bin/wget. In my distro (Tinycore) that links to Busybox which does not support all options. Installed full wget at /usr/local/bin/wget but of course, the path is hardcoded. Had to manually relink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got logged in, could see recent chats, clicked on one - Skype window blanked completely. Menu remains but nothing responds. Only option that worked was Quit Skype from the tray icon. In fact whatever I click on having logged in it does that so unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nice to know this is actually happening. All those frustrations aimed at you during Beta (guilty as charged) would have been lessened if MS just communicated with us. Though the whole premise of removing P2P and basing on Electron is still wrong.</p>

<p>Okay, I think I need to align my terminology with yours. I suggest better details on the intent and changes you have made, such as a Changelog we could review. In my world (as small as it is), this "Preview" would actually be considered a "Beta Test Article".
 I have found it does actually work for receiving and making VOIP calls. A significant step up from the "Beta" 5.4.0.1. It is functional, not quite production quality, but can be used with caution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My dependancy issue turned out to be the&nbsp;GNU Standard C++ Library. My system had v4.7-dbg, and this Skype preview wanted v4.9-dbg or higher. Once that was corrected on my system, Skype For Linux 8.5 installed without issue. This is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried two cameras, a Logitech Quickcam Pro 5000 and a Logitech C170. I tried them independently (not connected at the same time) both on /dev/video0. Skype 8.5 preview found them, but could not use them. When a video call was placed, Skype 8.5 hung and
 could not be brought back. I killed the process and rebooted. Both cameras worked with Skype 4.3 and Cheese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I put out a beta article to test, I often provide access to log files that would not be present in the production program. This so when a race condition/infinite loop/bad other thing happens, I can ask the tester to forward me the logs. I could not
 find that here. In the camera issue, where Skype 8.5 hung, can I find log files to forward to you? Logs that I get view and vett (i.e. human-readable)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will put the VOIP component and chat to test today for evaluation. Video will wait until we see if there is something missing from Skype, or if a specific config is needed for my system. I'll get back to you with my opinion if this fits the bill as a useful
 tool again, even if it's "preview", or if it more akin to the 5.4.0.1 frustration generator.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account Payment Option Not Showing Up</h2>
                    
<p>I'm currently trying to (and have previously attempted over the past few weeks) purchase DLC through the Xbox Games Store on Xbox.com and it is not showing my Microsoft Account as a payment option, just my two credit cards. &nbsp;When I try to purchase the content
 on my console it does give me the option to use my Microsoft Account. &nbsp;I'm heading out of town in a few days and will be away from my console but would still like the option to purchase DLC through Xbox.com with my Microsoft Account. Is my account bugged or
 is this normal?</p>

    <title>Fable TLC really buggy while running&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fable TLC really buggy while running&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought Fable TLC (disc version) to play it on my Xbox 360, and something that I'm noticing is that while running around, when turning it's extremely buggy and your character would sometimes go from running to walking in an instant. Does this happen to
 anyone else, or is it just me? And is this issued fixed if I just buy the DLC from the marketplace (which I'd rather not do since I like the second ending better).</p>
<p>It's kind of an annoyance because when I reached the hero's guild as a child there's a sidequest that you have to race to the demon door and back in under 50 seconds. Which is extremely hard to do when every time I make a turn my character decides to start
 going for a walk instead of run.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is in the wrong section, this is my first post.</p>

<p>It's a fine section.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You're finding it a little laggy or choppy, particularly with movement? Honestly, there isn't much you're going to be able to do. It's an old game and it has bee made compatible for the 360 (that often doesn't produce a well-functioning game) so you might
 just have to deal with it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I was watching it being played two days ago, actually, and it didn't look too bad to me but I can hardly speak for your experience. Hopefully it isn't too bad for you to look past it to play the rest of the game : )</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, I assume you picked it up because you've played Fable II. Good choice... in my opinion it is far superior to the second one but either way, it's worth a shot.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Actually, Fable; Lost Chapters always had a lot of slow-down even while played on the Xbox. It was more or less "rushed out the door" because it was the true and correct version of Fable that was not ready when Fable originally
 Retailed. This was one of the reasons for the "shorter" Retail Copy of Fable in that Fable LC had slow-down issues they could not resolve.<br />
<br />
In short, they thought they had an entire Game "ready to go" (Fable LC) but couldn't resolve the last of the slow-down issues without removing a sizable part of the Game. So Marketing, Publishing and Development said, "let's release what works for now and later
 if we get it fixed we can release that too but if we don't we can release it anyways as another version".

<p>I've played all 3 Fables. I picked this one up just because I wanted to restart each Fable game from the beginning (Fable TLC first) then Fable 2, then 3 lol. (I own 2 &amp; 3 but didn't have my copy of The Lost Chapters anymore + I like the The Lost Chapters
 ending a lot more).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for the replies. I ended up buying Fable 1 the DLC version and running around isn't choppy at all like in The Lost Chapter. So I guess I'll be playing that one. And thanks for the welcome.</p>

<h2>            computer instability</h2>
                    <p>Computer running windows 7 32 bits and is rated at 5.5.</p>
<p>Computer crashes very frequently just after the windows screen is shown. In addition it runs very slowly with lots of lagging when it doesn't crash. However when running in safe mode with networking, it rarely crashes and operates at a very high speed both
 in terms of accessing the hard drives and the internet. It does not seem to be a heat issue or viruses. I recently updated a driver for the nvidia GeForce 8800gts graphics card which didn't seem to have any lasting positive impact. I have detached and reattched
 connections with the motherboard but again without any impact.</p>
<p>Since it runs very well in safe mode I am assuming that it is not a hardware issue. Do you agree?</p>
<p>My guess at this point is that it is a friver issue or requires a reinstall of windows. Can the reinstall be done out of safe mode?</p>
<p>Thanks for any input.</p>

<p>When your computer runs well in Safe Mode but poorly in normal mode, that means that something that runs in normal mode only is causing the problem.&nbsp; You can determine what that is by repeated experimentation.&nbsp; This is a bit tedious, but it should enable
 you to get to the root of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by disabling all non-Microsoft services:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click Start, type msconfig into the Search box, and press Enter</li><li>Select the Services tab</li><li>Check the box at the lower left to "Hide all Microsoft services"</li><li>Click "Disable all"</li><li>Click OK</li><li>Restart (not in Safe Mode).</li></ol>
<p>If the problem is solved, then the cause is one of those non-Microsoft services.&nbsp; Narrow it down by returning to msconfig and check (enable) half of the non-Microsoft services.&nbsp; Restart.&nbsp; If the problem is still solved, then the cause is one of the non-Microsoft
 services that is still disabled.&nbsp; If the problem recurs, then the cause is one of the non-Microsoft services that you just re-enabled.&nbsp; Repeat this method until you determine the service that cause the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem is not solved when all non-Microsoft services were disabled, then the cause is not a service.&nbsp; Return to msconfig and re-enable all services, including all non-Microsoft services.&nbsp; Then select the Startup tab.&nbsp; Disable half of the items and
 restart.&nbsp; Repeat this method until you determine which item causes the problem.</p>

            <p>I think Windows 10 has a build in tool now. You can just right click an&nbsp;ISO file and select mount, which will then create a virtual drive.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can just double left click the&nbsp;ISO (like opening any other regular file) and Windows 10 should auto-mount it.</p>

I wish it would have the but the problem is you never get to step 6 (where you select the installation location) as shown in the following link under the section titled
<br />
The following is from Imran M's reply:<br />
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</a></b></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><b>&nbsp;</b>You should refer the section ‘To install Windows 7 using the Custom option without formatting the hard disk’</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<b>Note:</b> Make sure that you backup all the user settings and important data before reinstalling Window</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
Instead you receive "The unattended answer file contains an invalid product key" message thus halting installation.<br />
<br />
Let me be clear, the initial Windows 7 installation from the Windows 7 Upgrade disc worked perfectly when upgrading from Vista.&nbsp; It was after I went back to reinstall Windows 7 I received "The unattended answer file contains an invalid product key" message.&nbsp;
 It was a real pain because I had to reinstall all downloaded programs i had previously installed (Firefox, anti-virus software, Windows 7 updates, etc..) and retrieve my pictures, movies and music from my backup
<br />
external drive.<br />
<br />
So I had to do the following to reinstall Windows 7...<br />
<br />
I had to reinstall Vista and then use my Windows 7 Upgrade disk in order to install Windows 7.&nbsp; There should be an option to enter your Vista product key when prompted during a<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold">reinstall of Windows 7 using the Windows 7 Upgrade disc</span><span style="font-weight: bold">.</span><br />
<br />
Apparently if you purchase the Windows 7 Upgrade you cannot reinstall it over itself since it is an "upgrade" and not a "full" version of Windows 7.&nbsp; This is really silly and there should be some type of work around for this issue going forward.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps and someone from Microsoft can reply as this is true or perhaps point out where I went wrong.&nbsp; I certainly don't rule out the later.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to others experiencing this situation.<br />

If you&nbsp;can not even turn your Laptop on, there would appear to be a serious problem.<br />

If under Warranty, contact your Manufacturer.<br />

If not under Warranty, contact a local, reputable Computer Repair Shop.<br />
