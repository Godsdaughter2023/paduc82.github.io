<h2>            Lumia 950 no longer has typing feedback after update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got a Lumia 950 last week and was very happy with it for the first few uses, especially the keyboard which was providing typing feedback and was correcting the few typing errors perfectly. &nbsp;It then went through several update-and-restart cycles and now the
 feedback is gone and there seems to be far more typing errors and no feedback (there is sound but no physical feedback).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a work phone used almost entirely for emails etc. so I would love to get it back the way it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> &#40;&#58;&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 365 adding border to pictures in-line with text</h2>
                    <p>I just updated to the latest Office 365 software from Office 2010. &nbsp;The new version of Word will not let me access the border function under Picture Tools - Format when I click a picture. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried with several pictures and no luck, cannot access the border tools - they simply remain inactive (gray).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pictures are oriented "in line with text". &nbsp;When I change the photo to any other position using the Wrap tool I can then right click the photo and hit the Format Button under the Picture Tools and the Border Box is accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I want to add a border when the picture is in line with text.</p>
<p>

    <title>Can&#39;t insert section break - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brucesiegel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t insert section break</h2>
                    Hi. I'm trying to add a section break but that command is grayed out. (I'm using word for mac 2011.)&nbsp; The page in question has nothing but a single line of 24 pt. text, formatted as Heading 1. A frame appears around this text for re-sizing, and there's
 an anchor symbol above it. I'm doubly confused, because I thought anchor symbols only appeared for graphics. So how can I add a section break following this line of text? Thanks in advance!

            <p>Well, it still makes no sense to insert a Section Break at the beginning of the 1st page... that totally superfluous &amp; unnecessarily complicates the structure of the document :-) Additionally, a Section Break (Continuous) is not an effective means of varying
 H/F. Also, I'm not at all clear on your game plan but I'd have to question it if a Text Box is involved... Basically, they should be used sparingly &amp; best avoided in H/F if possible. They are foreign bodies injected into the flow of a document which can accomplish
 little that cannot be handled more appropriately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All documents begin with Section 1, which continues to the end of the document until a Section Break is inserted somewhere along the way. Headers/Footers are Section properties. Whether their content appears on all pages of the Section or whether the 1st
 page H/F differs from the others in that Section is determined by the properties of the H/F. A Section Break is required only if the specifications for the new Section need to differ from those of the previous Section.</p>

<h2>            How to Automate Dynamic Dropdown List &#40;Data Validation&#41; when you have Named Ranges in Thousands &#63; URGENT PLEASE HELP &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hello<br />
I am working on a bulk product import sheet which I will be using for my website. The problem is that I am having almost 7680 Dynamic Named Ranges in my workbook but now I am facing a lot of problem in assigning those named ranges to each individual cell one
 by one.
<div><br />
<div><strong>Problem Description:</strong></div>
<div>Let's suppose I am having a product say "Men's T-Shirt" in "sheet 1". Now, this T-Shirt might have certain attributes such as Brand Name, Colour, Size, Fit, etc. These all attributes are placed in adjacent columns starting from P2 to&nbsp;X2 (P2: X2). Now I
 wish to create a dropdown using Data Validation under each attribute for which I will be referring Named Ranges that I have already created.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Dynamic Named Ranges for this product type is Located at CCC1: CCK1. The sequence of each attribute and its respective Named Ranges is exactly same which means if "Brand Name" is placed at P2 then its Named Range "Men_Tshirt_Brand" is placed under
 column CCC.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Is there a better way so that I can insert all Dropdowns using these named ranges in the shortest possible time?</span><br />
<br />
<div>Could someone please suggest or share a Macro for it?</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance !!</p>

            <p>You might be able to use dependent data validation - you need to be able to figure out the correct Data Validation named range from a previous entry. &nbsp;For example, if cell O2 could contain</p>
<p>
</p><p>Men's T-Shirt</p>
<p>Boy's T-Shirt</p>
<p>Women's T-Shirt</p>
<p>Girl's T-Shirt</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then the named ranges for the Brand list for each of those should be consistent and calculable:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mens_T_Shirt_Brand</p>
<p>Boys_T_Shirt_Brand</p>
<p>Womens_T_Shirt_Brand</p>
<p>Girls_T_Shirt_Brand</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, "calculable" means apostrophes are removed and dashes and spaces are replaced with underscores, and the attribute is appended with an underscore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then your DV list for P2:Pxxx could use the formula (if Brand is in cell P1):</p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDIRECT(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(O2,"'",""),"-","_")," ","_")&amp;"_"&amp;P$1)</p>

<h2>            Outlook Security Alert&#58;  The security certificate has expired or is not yet valid</h2>
                    
<p>a client of ours reported the following:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">&nbsp;"our website ssl cert expired last week. i renewed it. i sent it to our developer partners to install. they did.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">so...now we're getting these notices (below). no set pattern. intermittently. the developer can see where she has installed the new certificate. we've cleared our caches. i get the pop up at various times when i’ve got outlook
 open."</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84040c25-3544-42b1-a7cd-26b8837b29b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84040c25-3544-42b1-a7cd-26b8837b29b3" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i had the customer change the time on her pc, reboot and try again (the time reset from server connection).&nbsp; time was correct but the error returned.</p>
<p>i had the client click on view/install cert. &nbsp;no change in problem.</p>
<p>i had the client attempt to run the outlook remote connectivity analyzer but it would not complete. &nbsp;it timed out in about 20 seconds. &nbsp;attempted a second time with the same results.</p>
<p>this only seem to happens when the desktop app outlook is open</p>
<p>this company is running nonprofit e3 and the problem did not arise until the new cert was created/applied.</p>
<p>the problem is occurring on multiple computers.</p>

<p>hi william,</p>
<p>thanks for the information. according to the rca test of the domain myhonor.com on my side, i noticed that autodiscover is try to connect to 65.245.209.51 when attempting to resolve the host name yourhonor.com in dns, which is not an expected behavior in
 office 365. in office 365, outlook uses the http redirect to get autodiscover services, and failed the
<br />
url <a href="https://yourhonor.com:443/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">yourhonor.com:443/.../autodiscover.xml</a> and
<a href="https://autodiscover.yourhonor.com:443/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">autodiscover.yourhonor.com:443/.../autodiscover.xml</a> attempts.</p>
<p>this may be the root cause: outlook is try to retrieve information from the on-premises exchange (65.245.209.51). however, since there is no entry for autodiscover in on-premises exchange, the office 365 email account cannot be configured.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/643f91f7-6f0a-449a-a054-67b59a0b522c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/643f91f7-6f0a-449a-a054-67b59a0b522c" /></a></p>
<p>here is a workaround that we can prevent outlook to connect to on premise exchange server:</p>
<p>1.start registry editor.<br />
2.locate and then select the following registry sub key: hkey_current_user\software\microsoft\office\x.0\outlook\autodiscover</p>
<p>note: x.0 in the above registry path corresponds to the outlook version (16.0 = outlook 2016, 15.0 = outlook 2013, 14.0 = outlook 2010, 12.0 = outlook 2007).</p>
<p>3.add two registry entry value = 1 for:</p>
<p>excludehttpsrootdomain<br />
excludescplookup</p>
<p>for more detailed information, please refer to the kb: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2212902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2212902</a>.</p>
<p>the workaround to modify the registry may be difficult, especially when there are quite many users in his organization. therefore, they may need to decommission the on-premises exchange completely or stopping the internal dns to query the on-premises server
 for yourhonor.com/autodiscover.</p>
<p>please let us know if you have any updates.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
alex</p>

<h2>            Office 2010 Glitches with Word&#47;Excel and Outlook - FIXED &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Office 2010 and there are two little items that drive me Crazy.&nbsp; Is there a fix or does anyone know how to change a setting or whatever to stop this from happening:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Word - Typing Replaces Selection</p>
<p>This option comes unchecked at random times.&nbsp; It has been suggested that I am accidently hitting a keystroke combination to do this but I don't think so.&nbsp; This is not the same as insert/overtype.&nbsp; I highlight with my mouse and instead of deleting the old
 text and replace with amended text Word keeps the old text and adds the new text to the document.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook in conjunction with Word/Excel</p>
<p>If there is an unsaved document in word or excel and you have Outlook open, routinely the document cannot be closed because when you click close or save the new window opens BEHIND the "Word" document with no way to move the window.&nbsp; To get out of this,
 I need to press escape to close the open dialog box, Close Outlook, save my document then re-open outlook.&nbsp; One possible trigger for this scenario is when you need to send a document using the send as attachment option (which I use a lot) within Word or Excel.&nbsp;
 Even if the document you are sending is saved, any open document in either Word or Excel is subject to this little glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two things are driving me out of my mind because once you get into a work routine these annoying little matters pop up and disrupt train of thought and work flow.&nbsp; Anyone else having this issue...more importantly, how is this fixed?</p>

            <p>It does not affect a specific document.&nbsp; Rather this is a global intermittent problem (please don't groan... I know these are the worst because you can't always recreate to condition that causes the problem)&nbsp; I can manually go into settings, under the advanced
 tab and select the "Typing Replaces Selection" box.&nbsp; Once this is done, the program works as it should without even having to restart Word.&nbsp; The problem is that something is&nbsp;causing this box to become deselected.&nbsp; I have even tried opening the master word
 template, selecting the option and&nbsp;saving the changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes&nbsp;I will&nbsp;go for three or four days with it working fine.&nbsp; Other times&nbsp;I have to fix it three or four time a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Outlook, this issue does not always pop up after trying to send a document directly from Word, although this is the most common trigger.&nbsp; (It may be worthy to note while I refer to Word, this issue does affect Excel but seemingly less so but this
 may just be a perception by me.)&nbsp; Once the condition hits, there are only two ways, that I have found, to fix it.&nbsp; First is to shrink the active document window to less than 1/4 of the screen and try to save.&nbsp; This way when the "Save" dialog box opens, there
 is enough open real estate on my screen to see the box and either move it to expose the buttons&nbsp;or the buttons are already exposed and I can proceed.&nbsp; The other option is to restart Outlook.&nbsp; Once Outlook is closed the issue with saving the Word document disappears.</p>

<br />
When options in the Word Options dialog box don't stick, the cause might be a damaged registry key. In the registry editor, try deleting the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Options and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Data
 keys; do this with Word closed. See also&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541/en-us/</a>. Restart Word (Word Options will have reset to their defaults) and then select
 "Typing replaces selected text" again.</p>

</p><p>No one in this (old) thread has suggested that this should be a hardware issue. On the contrary, registry keys corrupt now and then. It could occur for example if Word is forced to close when Windows restarts following an automatic update. (It follows that
 leaving a file unattended, say, over night is not a good idea, but I'm sure you have already considered that.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Office 2010 for years and never had any problems with it, so I can assure you that there is nothing wrong with the Office 2010 installer.</p>
<p>

            <p>Whether it is the installer program or whatever the cause, something is not working correctly.&nbsp; The IT department at the office has assured me that there is nothing wrong with the registry key and they are not prepared to verify 130 different machines currently
 experiencing the problem.&nbsp; I find the suggestion that because you have not had the issue there is no problem Ludacris.&nbsp; These issues arose on mine and all of the other machines upon the installation of MS Office 2010.&nbsp; Broad spectrum issues are very tough
 to justify with coincidence.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My reference to the installer program was only in response to the suggestion that it was a corrupt file.&nbsp; If such is the case, our office had 130 separate instances of the same corrupt file coinciding exactly with the upgrade to MS Office 2010.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for fixes I have tried, specifically.&nbsp; The more technical stuff (registry keys and such) is not me and I defer to the expertise of the IT department that looked into the issue following the suggestion of a corrupt key.&nbsp; I personally have to perform a
 manual per incident fix of Click office button, select options, advanced options, click the little box for typing replaces selection (same procedure for spell check as you type under that menu).&nbsp; I have tried doing this with the Normal.dot template file in
 hopes it would correct the issue.&nbsp; Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the saving issue.&nbsp; The save dialog box being "always on bottom" is a tough fix for a non-programmer like myself.&nbsp; Don't even know where or how to start looking.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for this being an (old) thread, one would have hoped that given enough time a fix would have been released.&nbsp; As the issue appears to be imaginary on my part one is not forthcoming.&nbsp; My apologies for the sarcasm however, once again the issue comes back
 to tech support suggesting if they can't solve an issue, it doesn't exist.&nbsp; Such is exactly how I feel in this circumstance.&nbsp; I wish I could say that I had enough time on my hands to randomly make up issues just to&nbsp;enjoy the experience of contacting tech support.&nbsp;
 I would much prefer however, that the software work in the manner in which it previously did.</p>

            <p>The fact that I haven't seen any problems with installing Office certainly proves that there isn't a general issue with the installer. Of course, it's still possible that there is a problem with the way installations/updates are pushed to users' computers&nbsp;in

<h2>            Excel 2010 Webrowser in a PDF using VBA</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Inorder to show Reports in Proficy Historian, I am using Historian's "Excel Add in" feature. But I am facing a problem right now while activating a excel sheet in my workbook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My requirement is show all the excel reports in a webbrowser, but I am using one more webrowser inside one excel sheet to invoke a PDF document. So my problem is, while activating the excel sheet which contains webbrowser(PDF), another excel window opens
 outisde the parent webbrowser. I followed added the registery keys as mentioned in the below link:-</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982995/en-us</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All excel sheet I can view inside the webbrowser, but during the activatation of excel sheet with PDF, one additional excel window opens up. How can I avoid the opening of the same? So that I can display everything inside my parent webbrowser?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Anoop MV</div>

No too sure what you mean by an 'owner' file - but do a soft reset, and then try the delete again.

            If Laura's advice does not do it for you then you may need to change the attributes of the file to delete.&nbsp; RESCO file explorer has that ability.

<h3> ekk004  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Office 365 link to a file for both Chrome and IE</h2>
                    <p>SharePoint with Office 365 seems to work pretty well with both Internet Explorer and Chrome when you click on the file in its actual location. We are using IE 8, so under IE it just opens the file, and Chrome it gives you the option to edit online or fully
 in excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a link to the file, however, it doesn't seem possible to enable both browsers to successfully use the link. Our old link from the old version of SharePoint only works with IE (Chrome just downloads the document rather than allowing live updates). If
 we get the link from the file (using the ... button or copying the link when it opens the window to chose online or full excel in Chrome) it only works in Chrome, and IE cannot open the page as the version is too old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can direct our users to use one browser or another. But is there a link we can find for the file or a shortcut made to the file location that will work for both Chrome and IE 8?</p>

            Hi Ekk004,<br />
<br />
We can get the best SharePoint Online experience with the latest IE version, we suggest you use the link in IE 11.
<br />
If you still want to use IE 8, please tell us more details about "Our old link from the old version of SharePoint":<br />
1. How did you get the "old link"? <br />
2. What do you mean by "the old version of SharePoint"?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
James

            <p>Unfortunately we cannot update our Internet Explorer, but I understand how that would be the best fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unsure, but I believe the old link was made by right clicking on the file in its actual location and selecting "Copy Link address". If that's done on Office 365, the link copied is unsupported by IE 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Old SharePoint" was a 2007 Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping there would be a way to make a shortcut or link that would work for both, kind of in an if/then sort of format: if IE is being used to select the link, then open the file, but if Chrome is being used, then open the online preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It very well may be that this isn't possible, but it would be ideal.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>printing old versions of Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> old_hand  say:</h3>
<h2>            printing old versions of Word</h2>
                    <p>OK, the new HP pc came with basic <strong><em>Office 2010</em></strong> installed, but I still cling to my old
<em><strong>Office 95</strong></em> Suite.&nbsp; Trouble is, I have to pick up the 95 file in 2010 to print it [without saving it, of course]. And
<em><strong>Win 7</strong></em>&nbsp; doesn't recognise its old progeny, so, clicking on a word file also draws a blank unless I change "open with" to the newer version.&nbsp; 95 lists all the available printers, but nothing happens... out-of-date driver interface?&nbsp;
 Any solutions, please?</p>
<p>When you say you don't support something, you surely aren't exaggerating!&nbsp; Yet, I've seen references to Win 3.1 still being used...</p>

            <p>It's only a matter of syntax what one refers to the package as.&nbsp; As a matter of fact Word 95 works OK with Win 7, as a basic wp package - which is all some of us need - And, after fiddling with the Help menu to get on-page help, there's never been a problem,
 except the Print bit which won't work.&nbsp; I've come across a lot of people who don't like Office 2003, 2007 or 2010 compared with 95 or 97, some even try to revert to it. They don't seem to have the Print ability, either. Anyway, if there is no solution, I'll
 just have to keep pulling the documents into 2010.</p>

    <title>Macro opens another workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomhillberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macro opens another workbook</h2>
                    <p>As I develop a worksheet, I rename it&nbsp;(xxx r1, xxx r2, xxx r3, etc.)&nbsp;before I move to the next area of updating. Now I am finished and when I run any of the macros it open the original worksheet. I want the macros to run only on the open worksheet, in this
 case the most recent version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To complicate it a bit more, the worksheet I modified as above, has now been copied into another workbook with other worksheets that have nothing to do with the worksheet that has the macros.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes sense to whomever is reading it.</p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Norman - Your response may be the answer, but I do not know how to 'replace hard-coded sheet names with the ActiveSheet property", I don't even know what 'hard-coded' or 'ActiveSheet property' refer to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please 'dumb down' your response with step by step&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>If the code is only to act on the active sheet, you could avoid the renaming problems by replacing instructions of the type:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Worksheets("Sheet1").Range"A1").Value=100</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ActiveSheet.Range("A1").Value=100</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you post the problematic code, it should be possible to provide a more useful response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

    <title>how do you manage a pst file that is 9gb&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dfkeusch  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do you manage a pst file that is 9gb&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>o this is a question to users who may have this concern:</p>
<p>until last week i had 4 pst files from 2006 and before, then 2007, 2008, 2009....</p>
<p>i saw on this website that i could have now up to 20gb size, so i consolidated everything into the default pst and now i have a 9gb pst. file.</p>
<p>question here is not to talk about the problems i had importing, losing few stuff etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>question is to ask the community what "the big pst " users&nbsp; are doing. of course as i expected outlook is a bit slower when i switch to inbox or to sent (i must say here that after using outlook since 1997 (?) i do not have anymore subfolders, all is in
 the inbox and in the sent items, when i sort, i find it more efficient. 48000items in the inbox though) as i expected, the search function, great with win7 indexation, is also a bit slower.</p>
<p>i consider to recreate an archive, keep 6 months of messages, and keep only one big secondary pst.</p>
<p>the question is: what do you do on your side to handle big psts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you very much in advance</p>

<h2>            Reactivating an inactive account</h2>
                    I understand that providing the account has not been deleted it should be possible to get an inactive account reactivated. I also understand from searching the forums there is no other process for requesting this than posting a question on the forums.
 May I therefore request that someone please contact me to enable my old Hotmail account to be reactivated?

            ZigZag3143 thank you for the quick response the error I get is:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;"That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different email address or get a new account."<br />
<br />
I understand the policy and fully expect a loss of email / data however unlike the account I am using now which was inactive longer than the one I am trying to reactivate, I cannot re-register it, therefore unless someone else has taken it and is actively using
 it I assume I can regain the address. At the very least I need to regain control as it is linked to some other sites which have only just notified me it is no longer valid.<br />

<h2>            memory usage fluctuates frequently</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 2010. When I open a document larger than 600 pages (36133-b31.doc from 3GPP web site) the memory usage fluctuates gradually but severely from 60/70MB to above 1GB and during this time Word becomes irresponsive for several minutes. It is
 too annoying and furstrating to wait for several minutes each time this happens and this happens quite frequently (ever 4-5 minutes). Then the memory usage falls slowly to its original size only to rise again after several minutes.</p>
<p>Can you please help me? I am an engineer at AT&amp;T headquarters and this problem is affecting my job performance.</p>

            Any chance your autosave interval is 4-5 minutes?<br />
<br />
Other than that, my first inclination is that you have an addon that is doing something in the background.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><b>NOTE:
</b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.<br />
<br />
</p>
<b>Don’t Assume ANYTHING!</b>
<p>Don’t assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesn’t apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just aren’t aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too easy to have
 an unwanted app installed if you don’t carefully read every screen. <br />
<br />
</p>
<b>Uninstall Recent Software</b>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following Skype links are an example of this issue<br />

&lt;snip&gt;I found some posts on line about opening each product that was closing in safe mode and disabling the ABBYY Reader add-on.&nbsp; THis solved my problems.&nbsp; Not sure why but I disabled that add on in WORD, EXCEL, and OUTLOOK and they all work now.&nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; While I couldn't precisely say whether the problems from Office stemmed from the iCloud Panel software, I decided to uninstall the software as I don't use it anyway. After doing that, Office is now working perfectly fine. No more
 re-starting or crashing when I'm running IE at the back, nor trying to copy something in Word or Excel. It looks like the iCloud Panel software does have some compatibility issues with Office. &lt;/snip&gt;

<p>Starting in March 2012, "Skype click to Call" has been causing problems File Open problems, and Copy/Paste problems in Office Apps.
</p>
<p>The quick test for this problem is to close all open browsers. If the problem goes away it is probably Skype.</p>
<p>March 30 – MS has released an update to Skype that fixes the problem. Go to the Skype site, download and install the newest version ofc the program.<br />

<p>For anyone reading this, I figured out the problem after surfing the web for the past 3-4 weeks. Painful process. I have a paid version of Advanced SystemCare Pro, v5.2.0. 3-4 weeks ago, while scanning through it's vast offerings, I came
 across a feature I could activate called "Smart RAM". I turned it on and checked the 5 boxes it offers in the settings. The last of those 5 is "Clean Clipboard". I unchecked this box a few minutes ago and it fixed my issues. I now have no problems with copy/paste.
 Info only, it case it helps anyone.</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt;<span>&nbsp; </span>Hi, I recently came across this problem in MS Word 2007 where after I type or hit any key on my keyboard while in the Word window, I can no longer highlight text with my mouse (by clicking once at the beginning
 of the text and dragging the mouse to the end of the text portion that I want to highlight). I have found that if I click out of the Word window and press any key on the keyboard, this seems to resolve the problem and I can finally highlight with my mouse.
 However, as soon as I type anything in the Word window again, highlighting with the mouse no longer works. Clicking on any key again within the Word window does not resolve the issue- I have to push a key outside the Word window in order to resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I just figured out the problem. I had installed the Synergy program 1.5 weeks ago and by uninstalling it the problem appears to be resolved. Thank you both for your time and help. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; I had the same problem, i ran windword in safe mode successfully and disabled ABBYY FineReader 9.0 and the problem was solved as well, all is fine now and office is awesome!!&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; <span>
I ran my old Word 2010 and removed the ABBYY add-in. I didn't have to disable the whole program. I also did the "Quick Repair" and the "Online Repair" of Office 2013 Preview, but I'm pretty sure it was the add-in removal that made the difference.
</span>&lt;/snip</p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word suddenly giving me messages about "Downloading the Required Feature," freezing up, slowing down...</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Ultimately had to uninstall Office</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reinstalled it from the Microsoft website with my product key, choosing the 64-bit version instead of the Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Installed all new updates from Windows Updates</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restarted computer</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word working quickly with no messages, but became unresponsive when trying to open old files</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Went to File-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-Ins-&gt;Go-&gt; and unchecked Bluetooth.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Everything seems to be back to normal, if not better than before.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<p>
My problem is if I copy text from a web site or from Excel, Access etc into Word all I get is a black spot.</p>
<p>
I have tried a repair install and checking all the settings against my laptop - where this function works properly.
</p>
<p>The problem is caused by a defective Bluetooth add-in for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, turn off the Com Addin.</p>
<p><b><span>Additional Notes:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The defective Bluetooth add-in is usually installed by a Bluetooth driver. (In my case - Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Adaptor (v1.1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Updating your Bluetooth driver (or reverting to an older version) may also resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Unfortunately simply disabling the add-in through the Word options may result in a 3 second freeze when loading Word 2007. (If this is a problem, changing to a different bluetooth driver version may be the better option)</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Win7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <strong><span>Step 3</span></strong> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<span>Here is a truely Off-the-wall solution that is in the same class as bad RAM and bad Video Cards</span></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; My problem turned out to be related to the WYSE thin clients we were using to connect to the Win 2008 R2 Terminal servers.&nbsp; The software that allows/enhances use of dual screens called WYSE TXC Multi-Display v1.2.1.7 was causing
 the applications to crash (including IE 9 32bit).&nbsp; Once this software was disabled - The errors stopped.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this software doesn't like Windows Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; It was being used successfully on Server 2003.&nbsp; I have seen a&nbsp; few other posts on Google for people searching for an updated version without success. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>

 any problems printing in Office 2013 Excel, Word or Outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both of my Laserjet printers will print anything on Internet Exployer or non Office based programs without any issues.&nbsp; I have downloaded the latest drivers for these printers and looked for any

<p>I installed the printer driver Vista version for my HP Laserjet 1522 and that fixed the problem with the Spolling / Cache issue with Office 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Buy and HP via phone could not come up with this answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks again!</p>

<b>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</b>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that
 you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time
 the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

    <title>Photo duplication and sync issue post 7.8 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Photo duplication and sync issue post 7.8 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone was updated to 7.8 earlier in the week and all is OK apart from an annoying photo\sync issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst scrolling through my photos last night I noticed that numerous images were duplicated with a different file name. OK - no problem, I'll link the phone to Zune and delete the duplicates. This took over an hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then noticed that only a small&nbsp; number of the deleted images were being deleted off the phone. I tried to resync and removed\re-added the phone to Zune but to no avail. My collection had over 2200 images whilst the phone had 1000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, fed up with this, I&nbsp;moved the entire contents of my PC pictures\videos folder (the 'This is where Zune puts pictures and videos taken with your phone' folder), ensured that my Monitored and Zune folders were empty and then chose the 'Erase all content'
 option in Zune. Everything was now empty. I could start again. I disconnected my phone from Zune.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I renamed all of the pictures\videos and then copied them into the 'This is where Zune puts pictures and videos taken with your phone' folder. I then connected my phone to Zune and watched the painfully slow sync process begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason, some of the files, even though they've all being renamed, are reappearing with their old file name in both the collection and the phone. Why? Files with these names no longer reside on my PC and, before the resync, weren't present on my
 phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, some of the files are now showing today's date rather than the date the image was taken. Why is this happening? Why are only a portion of the files showing this date when they were all renamed? If I scroll through my photos by date I now see numerous
 incorrect results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really like my Windows Phone (this is my second) but the sync process is an absolute mess. It requires a degree of experimentation to understand how it works and then presents numerous annoying issues to the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to have to reset my phone. Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p><br />
Sean</p>

            <p>After two further unsuccessful attempts I came across the answer - deleting the entire phone and collection contents followed by a simple power off\on of the phone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resync worked fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows Phone\Zune combination isn't the best when it comes to providing useful error reporting and reacting to error\fault conditions.</p>

            Where did you get this key you are now using?&nbsp; When you bought the Office Academic / University discount package they should have set up an online account using your school email address.<br />
<br />
Belarc and other tools should reliably extract your key from the place it is stored on your computer.&nbsp; Here are some more similar tools. They should all report the same Office Pro product key, that is the one you should be using for activation.<br />
<br />
<div>
<b><span>Tools to Extract Product Key</span></b>
<p><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Your original package or purchase confirmation email</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Online download account</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You can extract the Product Key from the machine itself</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Image copy backups of system with Office installed</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Activation backup utilities</span></p>
<p>The <b>Tokens.dat</b> file works as a digitally signed file, which stores the majority of the windows activation files.</p>
<p>From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called TOKENS.DAT to store encrypted product keys:</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\Tokens.DAT
</p>
<p>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareLicensing\Tokens.data</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</p>
<p>I have tried the first 6 in this list with various degrees of success:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span>- not only does <b><u><span>Belarc
</span></u>extract product keys</b>, it reports on a WHOLE BUNCH of other stuff you want to know. Printing the report, or saving it is probably a good idea.</p>

If you continue to have problems, do a phone activation. Don't reply to the initial prompts, you already know the key won't be accepted. Wait until the system offers you the option of talking to a live service rep. Then explain the problem. They have access
 to the activation system and should be able to better explain the problem.<br />

What can you do if Office product activation is refused?</p>
<p>If phone activation fails you can ask the same person for help though most likely it’s a mix-up with the activation code.</p>
<p>If you don’t get an activation code, Microsoft staff should explain why authorization can’t be given. If they can’t, then ask to speak to a supervisor. Try to find out exactly what the problem is and ask about further appeals process.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive syncing is not working</h2>
                    <p>OneDrive won't sink. I have reset, uninstalled and reinstalled it, and the dialog box displays only the circulating arrows and message that OneDrive is updating.</p>
<p>Is there a simple fix?</p>
<p>If the fix is not simple, where can I go to get help to fix the problem?</p>

<p>Hi Ryann,<br />
<br />
First, I suggest you perform the following steps to enable sync SharePoint library and OneDrive for Business library with the
<strong>new OneDrive sync client.</strong><br />
<br />
1. Navigate to<strong> Control panel &gt; Programs &gt; uninstall a program</strong> &gt; uninstall
<strong>Microsoft OneDrive</strong> if there is one.<br />
2. Use <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> browser to open <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-users-to-sync-SharePoint-files-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-22e1f635-fb89-49e0-a176-edab26f69614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></span>, and perform steps in the
<strong>Test SharePoint Online sync for Windows</strong> part.<br />
Download and install the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=844652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">latest OneDrive sync client for Windows</a></span>.<br />

Restart the sync client:<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, please first perform the troubleshoot steps in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-OneDrive-sync-problems-on-a-Mac-6129abf1-a6c8-4526-9d66-119cd650acf4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></span>, then I would like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1. A screenshots regarding "OneDrive syncing is not working "<br />
2. Did you want to sync your personal OneDrive, OneDrive for business library or SharePoint site?<br />

                    <p>When I simply open and close a document in Office 365 - without modifying it - the Modified Date for the document changes to the current date. I don't want this to happen as I need to keep the actual modified date. I just open the document to check some

    <title>Excel for Mac cannot connect to SPO data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph_n_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel for Mac cannot connect to SPO data</h2>
                    <p>I have a list in SharePoint Online. I connect it to Excel, so that my workstations can easily refer to the data if offline, and also for backup purposes. I recently updated the SPO data, then, in Windows, I accessed the data and, in Excel, refreshed it.
 Worked fine. The worksheet updated correctly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Mac, I tried the same thing with Excel (ver. 16.22). I received an error message, which read, "A connection to the SharePoint site cannot be established. To synchronize or refresh your table, you must be able to connect to the SharePoint site." When
 I File/Open, my SPO is one of the Places, and Excel has no trouble listing the current files. So I'm connected and can connect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why won't my data sheet connect and update?</p>
