<h2>            Nokia Aeon</h2>
                    Now im sure this is nothing new to you, as its something that has been floating about on the net for a long time now and i had completely forgotten all about it until i re-stumbled upon it on the net today.<br />
<br />
I personally cant wait for a phone like this, its pure beauty in the palm of your hand.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know when this is likely to be completed.<br />
<br />
I personally think it wont happen as most concept designs are never made public.<br />

            I saw this a few months ago and wanted it!<br />
<br />
In reality I think we are at least two or three years away from seeing something like it (i.e. small, thin with dual touch screens).<br />
<br />
Lets hope they get the touch technology right when it's released next year on a S60 device.

But im looking forward to that day.

            It might take less time. Having the newly released S60 Touch concept in mind I doubt Nokia will let it go. I suppose we'll have one or more touch screens from Nokia Q4 2008...

            Those are not it's specs, the aeon was just a concept model.<br />
<br />
Those specs look like the N76's to me.

<h3> ordnance1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Match employee names to employee ID</h2>
                    <p>I have 159 employees and we have assigned each employe an EmployeeId.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a worksheet that has 2 columns. Column A is the new EmployeeID and column B is the employee name. I have second worksheet that has just over 23,000 rows. Each employee has hundreds of rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need to do is come up with some sort of formula that I can put in column A of worksheet 2 (the one with the 23,000+ rows) that will look at column B of worksheet 2 (this column contains the employee names) then find the matching name in column B of
 worksheet 1 and return the correct EmployeeID from column A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is possible but if so would be an incredible time saver.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 and Microsoft Exchange Accounts</h2>
                    I have a brand new computer with Windows 8.1. I installed Outlook 2013. It configured one Microsoft Exchange email account but will not configure a second Exchange Account. The program says installation is complete, but the account does not exist. Also,
 the exchange accounts do not appear under "User Accounts" in Control Panel/ All the addresses are confirmed with GoDaddy. Why can I only configure ONE Exchange account. Both configured perfectly on Outlook 2010 running on Vista.

<p>I have a complete novel which needs changing. &nbsp;The issue is,&nbsp;<em>a character's thoughts</em>. &nbsp;Currently these thoughts are shown between single 'American' quote marks. &nbsp;I'm looking for a simply way to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Find only the sentences between quotation marks. &nbsp;Because words like her's and their's are found by an ordinary search I need something which can search for spaces before and after the quote marks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 I need to convert all text between the quotation marks to&nbsp;<em>italic text</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 I need to remove the 'quotation marks'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that all of these requirements are simple to achieve. &nbsp;I just don't have the expertise.</p>

<p>Hi Doug</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great progress is being made! &nbsp;Many, many thanks for your patience!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One small glitch exists. &nbsp;Text between 'quotation makes' is being changed to italic. &nbsp;However, at the end of a sentence or paragraph, where a 'quotation mark' exists, the macro changes all of the text between the last mark and the next. &nbsp;That is to say,
 all of the text between thoughts. &nbsp;An example below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Julii looked closely at the arrangement of the hide and shiny knife thing lying on the grass.&nbsp;
<em>It all looked very dead.'</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<em><span>To show he meant Julii no harm, the shiny pink man opened his empty hand to let her know he had nothing concealed within.
</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<em><span>'How wonderful.</span></em><span>&nbsp;
<em>We understand each other without words.</em>&nbsp; Julii could not believe she was thinking like a silly girl.&nbsp;
<em>What was she doing?</em>&nbsp; This man represented more danger than anything she had ever seen in all of her life.&nbsp;
<em>Stop this!</em>&nbsp; <em>Stop it now!'</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes sense.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Doug, here is a chapter. &nbsp;i think it's self explanatory but please let me know if you have questions?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>To pass the boring days of patiently nursing her shiny pink man through his coma, Julii filled her head with all sorts of fanciful ideas.&nbsp; She particularly liked to imagine what he would say
 when he woke up because, despite what everyone else in her tribe said, she knew that he was going to wake up.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>'They were all wrong.'&nbsp; 'He was going to wake up, and she was going to have fascinating conversations and he was going to answer all of the questions she was dying to ask because he was going
 to wake up!'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>'His broken leg was healing, so that must mean his broken head was healing too.'&nbsp; She imagined how fantastic he would look when he stood up tall and proud.&nbsp; Of course she already knew how long
 he was, she could see that, but people looked different standing up.&nbsp; She just knew that her shiny pink man would hold himself upright with pride when he woke up.&nbsp; 'He was definitely going to wake up!'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>'Would his first words be words of thanks for the loving care she had given him?'&nbsp; 'Would they be cheeky and flirtatious?'&nbsp; Julii particularly liked that scenario.&nbsp; ‘Or would they be mundane
 words like:&nbsp; "Where am I?"’&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Of all the possible questions he would ask when he woke up, Julii thought answering that one would be the easiest because she believed she knew all there was to know about her world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>She had spent lots of time with the elders of her tribe.&nbsp; She had listened attentively and learned all there was to learn about her world; she knew their land intimately all the way to its boundaries.&nbsp;
 The elders told how her people had been chosen by the sky God, and Julii believed that the gods had placed her people in this valley as a reward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>But the information was false.&nbsp; Everything she knew about her people, her life and her world was based on many life times of misinformation.&nbsp; She simply did not know that the land she lived on
 was called Tennessee.&nbsp; She simply had no idea the land had been named Tennessee by the Cherokee people.&nbsp; Truth be told, she had never even heard of the once proud Cherokee Nation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Julii had also never heard of the Koasati tribe.&nbsp; She did not even know that she was a member of the Koasati tribe, and therefore, could have absolutely no idea that she was one of a very last
 of the Koasati people left in this place called Tennessee. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>She did not even know the true reason why her tribe called this tiny but beautiful, well sheltered and fertile, valley “home”, or that her ignorance was caused by nothing more than simple human
 shame.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>It was shame that prevented Julii's great grandfather and great grandmother from telling their offspring about being banished from their respective tribes.&nbsp; Even when they were very old, the
 couple, still filled with shame, could never find the words to explain the raw emotions that caused their banishment.&nbsp; Those once intoxicating, impulsive, life and death feelings that had simply worn away with time.&nbsp; She, the powerful Chickasaw chief's only
 daughter, and him, far too low down the pecking order of a secondary tribe like the Koasati, to be taken seriously.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Their love had been ignored and eventually overruled by the elders of both tribes.&nbsp; She was simply too valuable an asset to be wasted on a nobody like him.&nbsp; Even in their youth they understood
 that a strong alliance between her people and important tribes like the Cherokee, or the Shawnee, or the Yuchi, or even the Quapaw would have been the best thing for both of their tribes but they loved each other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Their meetings were made more exciting by being carried out in secret, but when she started to show with his child, their excitement turned to agony.&nbsp; Both his and her entire extended families
 had been banished, forever, forced to live far away from the safety of their tribes.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Their shameful new home had been chosen for them because it was known by both tribes as a 'bad spirit place'; a place where no other humans ever wandered.&nbsp; This was a spiteful, dishonorable and
 terrible punishment made worse because they were considered outcasts, even within their own banished families.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>After a lonely life together, Julii's great grandfather and great grandmother both went to the sky believing that their longed for tribes still lived happily in their ancestral hunting grounds,
 just as they had for many thousands of years. The awful truth was the direct ancestors of those two love sick fools were now the only native people left on the sweet lands east of the great Mississippi river.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>The old couple simply did not know that both of the tribes they longed to rejoin, and all of the tribes in Tennessee, had been herded away west on the “trail of tears” by the ever treacherous
 white man.&nbsp; Like very poorly treated cattle, many of the native people were driven to their appalling deaths and, by a strange act of destiny, the old couples punishment had come just one moon before these so-called “tribal clearances”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Julii, like all of her people, did not know the real reason why she was where and who she was. Her father and mother had told her what their father and mother had been told by their father and
 mother.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>All of the original “banished people” had been too ashamed to tell the truth about their foolish love-struck parents, so they made up the more palatable story of being the sky God’s 'chosen people'.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Until the arrival of her shiny pink man, Julii had believed that the members of her little tribe were the only people in the whole wide world.&nbsp; Now she believed that her shiny white-pinkish man
 laying naked by the fire in her father's tipi was going to explain everything about the world outside her valley - all he had to do was wake up.&nbsp; 'He was going to wake up!'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>From time to time, her pink-white man would stir long enough to sip water but he wasn't really awake.&nbsp; The noises he made were not words, they couldn't be, because Julii understood all of the
 words in the world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>As a child, Julii had sat for many, many hours with the elders learning every word they knew.&nbsp; People in her small tribe even came to Julii to learn about words, because she was recognized by
 her people as the one who knew them all.&nbsp; This is how she knew that the shiny pinkish-white man's unintelligible noises could not be words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>'Why won't he wake up?'&nbsp; Leaning over the shiny white-pink man, Julii lifted his neck and removed the leaves from the pus-oozing gash on the back of his head for the umpteenth time.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>On the day she met him, she had not noticed the terrible cut on the back of his head because she was too afraid to get close to the man who represented so much danger.&nbsp; The deep gash had only
 been found later, by her mother, as she helped Julii pull the strange gray hide from his body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>She smiled at the thought of her fear on that first, strange, day.&nbsp; He seemed so harmless now that she had seen him naked.&nbsp; ‘'Not harmless exactly, just different.'&nbsp; 'Exciting.'&nbsp; 'What was she
 thinking?'&nbsp; 'He needed fresh leaves!' </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>For the umpteenth time in three days, Julii left the tipi believing she needed to gather medicinal leaves.&nbsp; The truth was, there were already more leaves in her father's tipi than the pink-white
 man was ever going to need.&nbsp; Fetching leaves was simply the excuse she needed to go outside and calm herself down.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>When she wasn't gathering leaves, Julii sat looking and waiting for the shiny pink-white man to wake up and answer her questions.&nbsp; His face seemed somehow familiar but that perception must have
 grown during the days she spent by his side.&nbsp; There was simply no way she could have seen him before, so it must be that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>She looked closer and smiled.&nbsp; His face made her feel like smiling again.&nbsp; 'More leaves!'&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>She had many chores to do, but she kept putting them off because she had so many questions that needed answers.&nbsp; She could not remember ever having so many questions, even with the elders.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Julii had cleaned him and all of his shiny things more than once.&nbsp; She had told him all about what she was doing as she rubbed his body with the soft, damp, deer hide just in-case he could hear
 her, but he would not wake up and respond.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>The shiny things were all neatly lined up beside him.&nbsp; Each object had a list of questions, 'so many questions.' &nbsp;Each list was stored in her head waiting for the moment he could speak.&nbsp; 'There
 were just so many questions', and the list grew every time Julii looked at the shiny pink-white man's naked body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>She looked at his naked body a lot, and even her own denial had to admit there were just too many leaves to justify fetching more. &nbsp;When the feelings he evoked inside her became too confusing,
 she distracted herself by re-cleaning his shiny things.&nbsp; 'There were just so many questions and he would not wake up.'&nbsp; 'But he was going to wake up!'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>The bowed thing on top of the horse had been the heaviest of the shiny pink-white man's strange shiny possessions.&nbsp; It was not too heavy, just large and difficult to bring down from the horse,
 and hard to clean properly.&nbsp; Julii really wanted to clean everything properly.&nbsp; She believed that the shiny pink-white man would be more willing to answer her questions if he could see that his shiny things had been looked after properly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>The black moccasins were also not as heavy as they had looked before they were removed.&nbsp; She had tugged and tugged them away from his leg, and underneath even his feet were covered in a soft
 woven hide.&nbsp; 'Did he really fear air touching his skin?'&nbsp; 'So many questions for when he wakes up.'&nbsp; 'He will wake up!'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>While cleaning the black moccasins, Julii found they were covered in a magical substance that, when rubbed, began to shine more and more black.&nbsp; It was incredible to see such a wonder, and many
 of her tribe watched in astonishment as her rubbing action kept bringing more and more of a shine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>None of her tribe could understand why the shiny pink-white man would go to the extraordinary lengths that must be required to create such a magical substance.&nbsp; No one in the tribe had a use
 for it, so they all assumed he must be a very vain shiny pink-white man who must be unhealthily obsessed by his appearance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Upset by this negative assessment of her shiny pink-white man, Julii thought long and hard about a practical reason for his magical substance. &nbsp;She eventually surprised and amazed her tribe by
 pouring water onto the long black moccasins.&nbsp; It just fell off in beads and did nor soak into the hide beneath the black substance - proving the magical substance was to protect the moccasins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Now Julii could be proud of her shiny pink-white man because everyone in the tribe could see a use for his magical substance.&nbsp; Many even wanted some for themselves, but other than the layer that
 was already on his long moccasins, the shiny pink-white man did not have any more among his possessions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Proving her shiny pink-white man was not vain had been a relief for Julii but also caused her a lot of worry. &nbsp;Before she had dared show her tribe the trick of pouring water on the moccasins,
 she had first tried to cover the shiny things attached to the heel.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Much to her horror, the thing on the heel came off in her hands.&nbsp; She did not want her shiny white-man waking up to find that she had damaged one of his shiny things.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>At first Julii thought she had broken his black moccasin.&nbsp; She felt sure that the shiny pink-white man would wake up and be angry with her.&nbsp; Worse, he would not answer any questions because he
 would be so furious but, much to her relief, she realized it was meant to come off.&nbsp;&nbsp; To prove it, she removed the shiny thing from the heel of his other black moccasin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>The purpose of those shiny things had been a mystery until Julii's close friend Ringwind worked out what they were for.&nbsp; Just by chance, Ringwind had noticed the shape of the shiny thing scarred
 into the horses flanks.&nbsp; Ringwind was clever.&nbsp; He saw how the pink-white man had made the horse move with the shiny things.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Then, much to her annoyance, Ringwind said that this was proof of the pink-white man’s cruelty.&nbsp; He said that they should send him away now, tied to his scarred horse, before he wakes up. But
 Julii used her extensive vocabulary to form strong arguments, and she did not let that happen.&nbsp; 'She was never going to let that happen.'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Julii had known since the day after she found him by the waterhole that Ringwind didn't like her shiny pink-white man.&nbsp; This annoyed her because he had no reason to dislike him.&nbsp; Her pink-white
 man had not said, or done, anything to offend him. &nbsp;How could he?&nbsp; He had been asleep since the moment she freed his leg from the horse.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Halfway through the second day, Ringwind had simply poked his head into Julii's father's tipi; he looked at the man laying naked, then looked at her sitting beside him.&nbsp; He made a strange facial
 expression she had never seen before and walked away.&nbsp; From then on, Ringwind simply decided not to like her shiny pink-white man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>It was while thinking about the day Ringwind had poked his head into the tipi, Julii noticed the long shiny knife was no longer beside her pink-white man.&nbsp; It should have been there with all
 of his other shiny possessions, but it was missing and Julii was extremely concerned about it.&nbsp; The shiny hollow thing that covered the long shiny knife thing was there, but the knife itself was missing.&nbsp; 'How can that be?'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Leaving her father's tipi, Julii asked everyone she saw where the long shiny knife could be but no-one knew.&nbsp; It was her mother who eventually told her that the knife and the horse had been put
 to work by her father.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Upset, Julii went out into the forest to tell her father not to use the pink-white man's things because he would be very angry about it when he woke up.&nbsp; 'Because he was definitely going to wake
 up!'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>When she found him, Julii was horrified to see her shiny white- man's horse loaded with freshly chopped firewood.&nbsp; She told him to stop what he was doing but her father told her that he simply
 didn't think the pink-white man would care because he would not survive the yellow sickness oozing from the cut in the back of his head.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>This made Julii furious with her father.&nbsp; "How can you say such a terrible thing?"&nbsp; "What if the sky gods heard you saying such things?"&nbsp; "My pink-man is going to wake-up!&nbsp; "He is definitely
 going to wake-up!"</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Unable to convince her father to stop using her pink-white man's knife, Julii gave up and returned to nurse him back to health.&nbsp; She just knew her father was wrong.&nbsp; 'She just knew that her pink-white
 man would survive. &nbsp;When he woke up, she would explain how helpful his long shiny knife had been and he would understand.'&nbsp; 'She would explain it all to her white-pink man.'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>'Although it was summer now, he would know that winter always followed and they would need the firewood.'&nbsp; Then she wondered.&nbsp; 'Would he know that?'&nbsp; 'Is it like that where he is from?'&nbsp; 'More
 questions for when he wakes up.'&nbsp; 'Because he is definitely going to wake up!'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>To take her fretting mind away from the impossible predicament her father had placed her in, Julii studied the pink-white man's gray body covering. &nbsp;It was clean, patched and hanging from the
 tipi.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Julii had beaten it on a rock at the water hole for the greater part of a morning because the stains had been caught within the woven fabric.&nbsp; She now thought of it as fabric and not hide, because
 no hide she had ever seen absorbed water like her white-man's coverings did.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>She marveled at the tiny, beautiful stitches joining all of the separate tightly-woven panels together.&nbsp; She was particularly fascinated by a small part at the bottom of the gray covering.&nbsp; In
 the place where men make water, there were two panels that were not connected by stitches.&nbsp; There were holes on one panel and round shiny things on the other.&nbsp; On the day she and her mother undressed her pink-white man, Julii had watched her mother force the
 shiny round things through the holes to make the two panels come apart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>While washing the gray garments, she had pushed the shiny round things in and out of the tiny holes several times.&nbsp; It was so simple but so clever.&nbsp; Of course, everyone in Julii's little tribe
 had carved bone clasps that join one piece of hide to another, but nothing that hid themselves so cleverly away like her pink-white man's shiny round things.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Looking at the top part of her pink-white man's gray covering, Julii admired the shiny things embroidered around the yellow thing that fitted so tightly around his neck.&nbsp; 'He must be important
 to have such extraordinary clothes, maybe even a chief.'&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Julii felt proud that she was taking care of someone so important.&nbsp; 'But why won't he wake up?'&nbsp; 'Her father cannot be right.'&nbsp; 'Her pink-white man will not die.'&nbsp; 'Her shiny pink-white man will
 wake up and tell her about the world he is from.'&nbsp; 'He has to wake-up.'&nbsp; 'He will wake-up!'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Looking over her shoulder to make sure no-one was watching, Julii prodded her pink-white man.&nbsp; She had been prodding her pink-white man with her finger from time to time for days.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Every time she did it, she told herself it would be the last time but, just sitting looking at him, she couldn't restrain herself.&nbsp; Julii had to know more about the world outside of hers, she
 had to learn everything about his world.&nbsp; 'There were just so many questions.'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Then, one day, her waiting simply came to an end.&nbsp; His eyes just flicked open, just like that.&nbsp; No prodding required, not even one of her gentle ones.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>After glancing at her and all around the tipi, her pink-white man became scared and panic-stricken.&nbsp; Julii wondered why he seemed so terrified; it was for no reason she could understand.&nbsp; He
 tried to stand.&nbsp; He couldn't do it.&nbsp; He was too weak.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Water and a little cold possum soup wasn't enough for a man like this, and Julii knew it.&nbsp; She would have liked to have fed him more, but there had simply been no way of doing it in his condition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Julii held out a large leaf with cold meat and berries on it.&nbsp; He pulled away from her as though she were evil.&nbsp; Then, moving rapidly, he rudely grabbed the leaf and forced everything on it into
 his mouth with his hand.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>'Meat and berries in one mouthful?'&nbsp; Julii was confused.&nbsp; Here was another question to ask her shiny pink-white man.&nbsp; 'Who eats meat and berries in one mouthful?'
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Already she was learning something new about her pink-white-man and his strange world.&nbsp; 'This was exciting.'&nbsp; She handed him a deer hide water skin.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>While chewing and slurping desperately at the water skin, he looked at Julii.&nbsp; It wasn't the look she had been anticipating.&nbsp; That look would have been grateful and excited, even a little flirtatious.&nbsp;
 The look he was giving her was angry, fearful, contemptuous, even a little disgusted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span>Julii reached for the empty leaf and he pulled away from her as he spoke a string of gibberish.&nbsp; What came from his mouth had no discernible meaning but she could not mistake the scornful tone
 in the noises that sounded something like: "Get your goddamn red-**** hands away from me!"</span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t sign in to word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tessa de bruin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in to word</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of today, Office 356 Proplus kicked me out saying that my product is unlicensed. However, when I sign in online I do have a licensed office package. When I try to sign into word with my workaccount, it says that another account from the organisation is
 already singned in on the computer. It says I could enter a product key instead but I haven't got one anymore since I got a year's license through work from surfspot.nl but I don't work there anymore. Therefore I cannot sign into my surfspot work account anymore.
 Please help.</p>

<p><span>Hi Tessa,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s possible that your Office program showed as unlicensed due to it needs a reactivation from your Admin. Because, Office 365 Pro Plus is a subscription that came from
 the organization and they have an ability to cancel it if the employee is no longer with them. We suggest that you contact them for more information regarding your Office program. Otherwise, if you have a personal email account that has an Office program associated
 with it, you can install it from there by logging in to your account using this <a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Should you have any other concerns, don’t hesitate to let us know.
</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Excel and Word not saving with CTRL &#43; S - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Excel and Word not saving with CTRL &#43; S</h2>
                    <p>I have discovered a disturbing fault within Microsoft 365 whereby documents opened from an email link or website won't save when using CTRL + S.&nbsp; There isn't even a pop-up to request the user change the file name or location it is being saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened to me several times when using Microsoft Excel and Word.&nbsp; on all occasions, I have lost countless hours of work,&nbsp; with the same problem having occurred on several different computers, at home and at work, as a result of this flaw.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see there was a question/discussion thread back in 2011 where a user had the same problem.&nbsp; In that thread, another user stated there must have been some app that was preventing the CTRL + S feature from working on the users computer - however I find
 it hard to fathom how both my home computers and two different work computers would have the same apps causing the same problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has Microsoft not addressed this issue when it's been a known issue since 2011?&nbsp; My discovering the thread from 2011 and the concern that was previously raised, is no consolation to me, after having lost so many hours worth of work here at home and at
 work.&nbsp; I know better now, but given there was no reason for me to believe this feature would not work in 365 when it had worked in every other version of MSWord I have used before, on all the same computers, how could I anticipate this problem?&nbsp; Microsoft
 you have let me (and I dare say countless other users) down on this and discovering you knew of this fault in 2011 adds insult to injury.</p>

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm an independent advisor that Microsoft asked to assist customers. I'm an experienced user of Office but do not speak for Microsoft. I've been assisting my fellow users for more than 20 years. I hope I can help you.
<br />
<br />Files opened directly from email are saved as temporary files on your computer. They do not necessarily even show up as recent files.
<br />When you hit Ctrl+S you save back to the temporary file location.
<br />
<br />Please consider, instead, saving the attachment to a known file location and then opening from within Excel.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. I am going to check on possible ways to find the temporary file for you but it will take a few minutes. I will respond with more when I find something.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem. 
<br />
<br />Regards,

<p>Hello Charles</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt reply and suggestions to try to solve the problem of my missing files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything you have suggested, plus what the moderator has suggested (bar the Clean Boot as I am not sure how to log in as an administrator and the instructions I have accessed online don't help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I've lost nearly 4 hours trying to resolve this problem without any luck, so I am resigning myself to the fact that my work is lost and I won't meet the due date for it to be submitted.&nbsp; Lesson learned, I will know better in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do really appreciate the effort you went to in providing suggestions.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp; I think I just have to resign myself to the fact I've lost my work and I hope Microsoft sorts this issue out.&nbsp; In previous versions of Microsoft Applications whenever I used CTRL + S on a document I had opened from another
 source, I would be prompted to save the document to a specific file location (ie:&nbsp; dialogue box would open, requesting I specify where to save the document) - this does not occur in Office 365 (at least not in Word or Excel) and I'm sure I'm not the only person
 who has been caught out by this.&nbsp; I'm surprised Microsoft has not fixed the problem after having known about it for over 6 years.</p>

<p>Hi Nichole,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't shoot the messenger! :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you have observed is not a product fault, it is a purposeful design change to the products.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In preparing for running Office applications on various diverse platforms such as the Cloud, on the Mac, Android, iPad, and iPhone they had to make changes in where file saving is allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what you are exactly seeing but when I open an attached file from an Outlook email, it's in read only mode. I have to click the Duplicate button and save the file to a location from where I can edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please share a screen clip of what you are seeing when you open an attached Word document directly from Outlook?</p>

<h2>            Outlook Search Folders - Shared Mailbox</h2>
                    Hi There
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A colleague of mine has set up some search&nbsp;folders&nbsp;on his outlook Mailbox without issue. (so far, so good)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, when he tries to set up an Outlook search folder on shared mailboxes that he has access to he is&nbsp;unable&nbsp;to create a search folder. The correct window appears&nbsp;allowing&nbsp;him to configure a search folder, but it only offers his user mailbox as a possibility
 to apply it to.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He does have one search folder in place on one of the shared Mailboxes that was set up a long, long time ago. He says that he 100% did this himself using Outlook 2007 on windows xp. However, he now seems unable to do it. His issue is consistent across
 Office 2007 pro and 2010 pro versions and also regardless of if it is XP or windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Essentially i have two questions:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) is it possible to create search folders on shared mailboxes</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) if 1 = yes...how!?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All these mailboxes are exchange 2008</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

<h2>            Turning off notifications when managing another calendar</h2>
                    <p>I manage my boss's calendar and create meetings on his behalf. He&nbsp;<strong>does not</strong> want to receive any notification emails about this, as they clog up his inbox. I have turned off response notices (do not allow new time proposals, do not request
 responses), but he ends up getting the meeting invite itself. I can't seem to find a way to turn this off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I create the invite from his calendar, not mine, and he is not in the meeting invite To: line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The invite does say "From *me* on behalf of *boss*", and yet it still comes to him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a solution?</p>

    <title>Cross Reference for Document and Table of Contents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lmseaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cross Reference for Document and Table of Contents</h2>
                    <p>My new questions applies to how I use certain cross references in the Word 2007 document and how they apply to a&nbsp; Heading, and the pager number of a separate section of the document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here is the process I learned to create the headings for different types and then how I am doing the cross reference.</p>
<p>Heading I with the name "Article" starting with the number "I".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you want the first heading to be the title Article I, and you want the title below it to be words, first click on Heading 1 under Styles which addes the words "Aricle I"., And at the end of the word Article, click twice on Shift + Enter, and then type in
 the title.&nbsp;&nbsp; This way the title of the Article I will be in the Table of Contents even though is below the Heading.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Heading 2 with the starting word Section with the first number 1.1.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Click on the Heading under Styles to create the first beginning of the paragraph as Section 1.1.Then&nbsp; Type in the title of the paragraph and the two spaces.&nbsp; And after those two space before typing in the paragraph, click as follows, as this is the style separator
 so the title of the paragraph shows up in the Table of Contents and not the rest of the paragraph in the Table of Contents.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(a) With the cursor at the end of the title, press the enter key.<br />
&nbsp;(b) Use the left arrow key to move the cursor to the left of the paragraph mark.<br />
&nbsp;(c) Press Ctrl+Alt+Enter.<br />
&nbsp;(d) Use the right arrow key to move the cursor into the words after the style separator.<br />
&nbsp;(e) Press Ctrl+Shft+n.</p>
<p><br />
So when I have an Exhibit that I mention in a paragraph and add to a document, the Exhibit name is cross referenced to the number of the paragarph it comes from.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if in the paragraph Section 1.1, if I refer to an Exhibit, I want to cross reference to the
 number 1.1, not the words Section 1.1, so just says Exhibit 1.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I want to do that in the paragraph itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to do it???</p>
<p><br />
Secondly, when I create a new Header so when I create the page of the Exhibit, I created a Header that only uses the beginning word "Exhibit" and no number.&nbsp; And then when I create the Exhibit as a separeated section, I click on the Header, it adds the word
 "Exhibit" and then after that word, I want to cross reference to the number of the paragraph its mentioned in, so for example, 1.1, but not Section1.1.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I want to do that in each Exhibit I created from the same Heading.&nbsp; Is there a way to do that as well?</p>
<p><br />
And finally, when I create the page number of the Exhibt page, it is not linked to the previousl page, the Exhibit page is a new section, and I set up the page format so it includes the chapter number.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is there way that the chapter number is the 1.1 and the page number is Page 1.1-1 and the next page is Page 1.1-2 etc, and that's what shows up in the Table of Contents re the Exhibit, that also shows the words Exhibit 1.1 not just the word Exhibit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to all for reading this and hope someone can help.&nbsp;&nbsp; And please note, I need the details of how to do it, not just something else to read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

            <p>You can insert cross-references to heading numbers using References | Captions | Cross-reference: Insert reference to Heading; Insert reference to Heading number (or one of the other heading number options). If you have used Insert Caption to insert your
 exhibit number, then "Label and number" is the closest you can get through the Cross-reference dialog, but see

<p><span>Since you have autonumbered headings using the built-in heading styles, you can add the number of any heading level as the "chapter number" in captions and page numbers. These page numbers will be picked up
 by the TOC. See <span><span><a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/ChapterNumber.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/ChapterNumber.htm</font></a>.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you but this is not clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to add to a Header that I use for a Page, and the Header&nbsp; which is used, is Header&nbsp;9 with the word Exhibit and no number.&nbsp; So after I use Header 9 in the document, when I add to the word Exhbit, a&nbsp;cross reference to a paragraph number in the
 document where that paragraph number comes from a heading, I want that cross reference to be a caption that shows up in the page number and the Table of Contents.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you explain it to me please?</p>
        </p>

            <p>I learned from someone else that when I cross reference to Section 1.1 and I don't want the word Section in it, I highlight it when it shows up, right click on it and the Toggel Fields area, and add \t to the field and takes care of it whereever I cross
 reference it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And doing in the header of the word Exhibit, in the Tabel of Contents it shows up as Exhbit 1.1, not Exhbit Sectinon 1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is what I need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So again, the last question is how in the Exhiibt page and its page number, can I have the page number 1.1-1 not just 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank</p>

            <p>To All, Here is a full summary of the situation and hope someone can give me good advice:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>When I am in a Word 2007 document with headers, they are from multlists and which are linked to the headers when creating the mulitlist.<span>
</span>One of my headers, Header 2, shows up first as Section 1.1 as in multilist set up, under the enter formatting for number, I put in the word Section-1.1 and that also sets up the numbering for the heading I use going forward.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>When I cross reference to the number as the paragraph number in the cross reference, it always shows up as<span>
</span>Section 1.1, not just the number 1.1, and I read someplace that if you right click the cross reference, click on Toggle Field Codes, the field code that shows up is { REF _Ref354083577 \n \h }.<span>
</span>I then add at the end of the field code<span> </span>‘\t’<span> </span>and save it, update the field, and the cross reference shows up as 1.1, not Section 1.1</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>So in the paragraph when I want to refer to an Exhibit I am adding at the end of the document, I refer to the Exhibit in the paragraph as “Exhibit 1.1”.<span>
</span>And do it by typing in the word Exhibit and the cross reference to Section 1.1, with the field change to “\t” and in the paragraph is shows up as “Exhibit 1.1.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Then as a new page at the end of the document, which is separated, I click on Heading 9 which is set up from the mulitlist and linked to Heading 9, with just the word Exhibit and not a number type thru the multilist
 process.<span> </span>So when I click on Heading 9, the beginning of the new page is the word “Exhibit” and<span>
</span>and then I do the same cross reference and it shows up at the top of the page, Exhibit 1.1.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>So at the bottom the Exhibit page, I would like the page number to be 1-1.1.<span>
</span>So I put in page number 1, and did the same cross reference an field change, and it show up on the page number as 1-1.1.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>In the table of contents when it refers to the title of the page, it shows up as Exhibit 1.1, but the page number with respect to this Exhibit page, still only shows page 1, not 1-1.1</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In addition, instead of putting in the page footer the cross reference to Section 1.1 with the field adjustment, I found out to cross reference to the Heading and the referring is to Heading text, and the number 1.1 comes
 into the page number, but not in the table of contents re the page number.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>So is there a way to have page number in the Table of Contents show up as 1-1.1, as left hand side of the Table of Contents shows both the word Exhibit and the cross reference 1.1, but the page number in the
 Table of Contents does not show the cross reference number from either way of the cross reference in the page numbe footer.?</font></font></span></p>
</font></font></span>

            <p>To All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read recently that there might be a way to add SEQ fields next to the page number in the footer, and as to the Identifier, I put in the word "Exhibit'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to use this Field and include the cross reference to the numbers I cross reference to as stated above, and then modify the TOC field to recognize the changes to the Page number that then includes the number 1.1- before the page number in the
 table of contents?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, since the header is not set up with a number, there is no Caption to refer to, so is there a way to add a SEQ field or other field before the cross reference at the top of the page or make the cross reference the Caption for the heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And based on any of the foregoing, what do I change to the TOC field to show the numbe 1-1.-1 as the page number?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much, as the help in the past from many people has been great!!</p>

                    For the last 3 days now, the emails I send do not send out right away, they go into an out box instead of sending.&nbsp; They seem to sit there for 3 to 4 hours before they are sent.&nbsp; Tried sending them from there, but they do not, they are not received for
 3 to 4 hours even after doing that.&nbsp; It seems the emails I receive are also delayed now too.&nbsp; Is something going on with the server??&nbsp; It sometimes shows the message that it is not connected to server??

<h2>            Editing documents in Android with Office 365 for Education A1</h2>
                    <div>Hello 👋</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The secondary school I belong to has Office 365 for Education A1, which is perfect for creating and editing documents on the computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is that the Android mobile application doesn't allow me to edit documents. However, according to the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-you-can-do-in-the-office-apps-on-an-android-ios-or-windows-mobile-device-with-an-office-365-subscription-9ef8b63a-05fd-4f9c-bac5-29da046833ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office support page</a> it should work. It indicates that for Office 365 A1 plans editing is allowed on devices with screens up to 10 inches and my mobile phone meets these conditions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The truth is that it would be really good to make last-minute changes (even if it was with limited options) and have synchronized documents on all devices, but I do not find the reason why it only allows reading-only. Can you imagine why this happens?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you very much 😁</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Office 2016 cannot find my subscription</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have now used my primary account, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, and shared it with another email address, the one I am posting with, but my Office 2016 on El Capitan 10.11.1 still gives the same error, that the "system needs a valid license" in order to continue,
 and then asks me to "Buy Office", whereas I have a Office 365 Home subscription, valid till July 2016, as you would notice from my account information.</p>
<p>I have been using Office 2011 just fine, and decided to install Office 2016 today, after uninstalling 2011, using instructions on Office's website, and now I am stuck with an unusable version.</p>
<p>Looking for some help here</p>

    <title>N9 and N950 Facebook App Keeps Disabling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colmsmyth---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N9 and N950 Facebook App Keeps Disabling</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Over the last 1-2 weeks the Facebook app will say 'Account Disabled' when you try to refresh it, and linked to this the Facebook IM service on the phone just continually tries to connect but never does.<br />
<br />
The only sure way to fix this seems to be to delete the Facebook account from the phone an re-add..this is a complete pain as when you re-add all your contacts get messed up and have to be re-merged.<br />
<br />
Im assuming the issue is something related to Facebook, some recent change or something but you will need to correct this fast as pretty much the app is useless otherwise.<br />
<br />
Im using an N950 with PR1.1 installed<br />
<br />
My last post to 2 months to get a response, this issue is urgent now please investigate.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Colm</p>

            When you say disabled, do you mean "password incorrect" if you look in the availability app?<br />
<br />
There is something funky going on, it seems its a long standing bug. I'm doing some digging to see if I can track down some more info as I'm sufffering from it a lot now I'm using PR1.1 on both an N950 and N9<br />
<br />
Do you have any other accounts that appear in the availability list? like gtalk?

<p>I faced the same issue and Jaripi solution works for me.</p>
<p>So delete all your account (nokia, facebook, email, skype ...)</p>
<p>Then reboot your N9</p>
<p>Recreate all your acocunt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 1 week, I don't have to enter my password again.</p>

<p>Rgds.</p>

<p>IMHO,</p>
<p>You may not have understood why Windows Insiders beta test new Insider builds. We try to use all our programs, apps and skills to see it we can find a problem, fault or bug. Then we inform MSFT via FH. The idea is to find problems, right up to blue/green
 screens, not to boast that we have no problems. Personally I have had numerous problems right up to blue screen crashes. But I had the backups and some knowledge for recovery and re-install. For me an IT greenhorn it sometimes is necessary to post here for
 my peers to help me.</p>
<p>The harder Insiders attempt to find Win 10 faults and problems the more problems they post here. If you don't have problems then ......</p>

<p>&nbsp;As has been said already, it's the folks having problems that you mostly see here. &nbsp;Most folks with no problems don't post here with the exception of a few of us who like to try helping those with problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I've installed every insider build since 10/1/2014 with very few problems, but I usually know what to do when I get some cryptic error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;That said, you can see some characteristics among those posting problems. &nbsp;They are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Surface Pro 3 users. &nbsp;Apparently there's been some unique compatibility problem with them that affected a lot of folks. &nbsp;MS has said they now have a fix available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Laptop users. &nbsp;Laptops use proprietary parts, unlike desktops. &nbsp;That creates a greater potential for driver problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Tinkerers. &nbsp;People who fiddle with both hardware and software and get in over their heads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;People who install incompatible software like a lot of the 3rd party antivirus programs and some older games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Non-technical folks who have little or no idea what to do when they get errors, and don't bother to do searches on those 0x........ error codes or other cryptic error messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Others with very unusual hardware and/or software. &nbsp;The further you get from the "beaten path", the more likely you are to run into problems. &nbsp;Windows is a huge complex system, and there's no way for Microsoft to test every one of the many millions of systems
 &nbsp;that are using Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Like others have said, Microsoft created the insider program specifically for us to find and help the above kinds of folks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seems to me you are the one doing the crying here. A little understanding without the attitude would go a long way. We are all only users helping users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't wait for the day you have an issue and require help. We all do. Been a computer hobbyist since the dos 3 days, and I am very grateful to the many people that have helped me along the way. It is a constant learning curve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you ever even wrote a config.sys file just to load your drivers. Probably before your time. Please show a little respect, for these same people are just trying to learn for themselves.</p>

<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What

6.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the Reset Internet Explorer Settings dialog box, click Reset.<br />
7.<span>&nbsp; </span>When Internet Explorer finishes applying default settings, click Close, and then click OK.<br />
8.<span>&nbsp; </span>Close Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your changes will take effect the next time you open Internet Explorer.<br />

    <title>Excel Web App bouncing when scrolling to bottom - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dciii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Web App bouncing when scrolling to bottom</h2>
                    <p>I've seen a few posts and topics about this issue dating back to 2012. Generally, when scrolling a spreadsheet in the Excel Web App or Excel Online, Excel will jump back up a view rows when it hits what it thinks is the bottom of the table. We are using
 Office web apps on premises and IE11. We can change the zoom of the browser and see the bottom rows. Our work-around was to place some content (spaces) in a cell well below the area of the table we needed to see. This basically tricks Excel into thinking the
 table is longer so it doesn't bounce until much further down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft have a&nbsp;have a fix for this issue yet or do we have to continue to frustrate our users?</p>
<p>

            <p>1. We have not tested on anything other than PCs running on Windows 7 Enterprise.</p>
<p>2. The issue does not occur in Chrome</p>
<p>3. I duplicated the content (values only) of the problematic file. The issue still existed, but to a lesser extent. I could keep scrolling and after several "bounces", it would display the bottom of the table.</p>
<p>4. Excel Online and other operating systems are not available to my users within our domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have requested that my primary user perform additional troubleshooting, but he seems to be happy with the work-around. At least the work around is provided for anyone else having this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            MAC full Office 2016 15.15 - Powerpoint keeps asking for activation &#40;not office 365&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to 15.15 in the hope that it fixed the constant crashes/hangs etc. It didn't but since the upgrade just Powerpoint asks on a regular basis to activate it. I simple select the activate button and it disappears - no prompt for a key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook, Excel etc, but they do not ask for any activation.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had the same problem, Powerpoint was asking for activation on every launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed this by simply deleting the folder &lt;UserName&gt;/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Powerpoint</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder will be recreated with default settings on the next launch of PowerPoint.
</p>
<p>Be sure to check for any individual Files inside (shouldn't there) and backup the folder before deleting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably it's enough to delete only certain files inside the folder (i.e. /Preferences/com.microsoft.PowerPoint.plist), i didn't try that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>

<h2>            Visio 2013 crashes when using a 4k &#40;3840x2160&#41; Resolution</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Y50-70 laptop and use Visio for work. &nbsp;However, in Visio 2013, whenever I try and open a document, Vision crashes. (Visio has stopped working....)</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook on the web&#58; Calendar invitations in inbox have no &#34;Reply&#34;&#47; &#34;Accept&#34; options and no notes.</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife recently sent me a number of invitations to calendar events regarding doctor appointments for our son. She invited me to these events my adding me as an attendee via my hotmail.com address. When I received the attendee invitations as emails in my
 Outlook.com inbox, they did not contain: </p>
<p>
</p><p>- an option to respond with Accept, Decline, Accept with comment, or any such options</p>
<p>- any of the extra information my wife put in the Notes part of her invitations (address details, prior relevant medical history, our son's birthday yes she really did include this in Notes in case I forgot haha)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So essentially I have no option to accept the invitations. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My calendar does not have any entries at the times noted in the invitations i.e. it doesn't appear as though the invitations were automatically accpeted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see that the date and location information are in the body text of the email - which is good because I can manually put the event into my own calendar - but that is obviously not how it is meant to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example screenshot is attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further info that may be relevant:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I exclusively access my hotmail.com emails using Outlook on the web at outlook.live.com using Chrome browser. I do not use an Outlook client to manage my emails or calendar</p>
<p>- I have been migrated to the Office 365 Exchange server but my wife has not</p>
<p>- I'm an Office 365 subscriber. My wife shares my subscription for installations of Word, Excel, etc on her laptop</p>
<p>- My wife sent the attendee invitations using an iPhone default calendar app</p>
<p>- If I view my inbox on my phone using the Outlook.com app for Android, the invitations look exactly the same, i.e. no Accept option exists and no Notes info is present</p>
<p>- This has been noted the morning of today, Saturday 7th Jan 2017. I can't recall the last time I received a calendar invitation from her, so I can't pinpoint when this issue started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.&nbsp;</p>

                    This has been happening on and off for the last few months. It SOMETIMES receives mail, but on the most part it just gives an error message to the sender. Also, when I try to send emails out it does not show in my sent box so I have no idea if it actually
 gets sent
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to upgrade a few times thinking this may solve the issue but I am unable to (error message telling me to try again later)&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div>I have tried to find a way to contact Microsoft directly about this but it seems that person to person support applies to actual products that you have purchased from Microsoft</div>

</div>
<div>My email account is the most important thing I have to do my business I really need it to be fixed!</div>

            Hi there - thanks
<div><br />
<div>I was finally able to sign in using my regular email - but now I cannot remember what user name and password I used for the temp email I created so do not have access to the private message area - could you set it up again using this, my real email?</div>
<div><br />
<div>My email is showing that they are being sent, for the moment - but it is an on and off thing that has been happening consistently for the last few months</div>
<div><br />
<div>I checked the 'group by conversation and pre-load messages' and it was already on 'show messages individually'</div>

            <p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know how important it is to be able to send/receive emails. Let us see how I can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To verify, is the email address you've provided on your first post&nbsp;(removed for privacy)&nbsp;also the account in question?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, w<font><font color="#000000"><font>e have checked&nbsp;the said&nbsp;account and it seems that it is working fine. However, we recommend that you delete messages because your storage is nearly full. Please get rid of unnecessary email to free up some space
 from your account.&nbsp;This could be the reason why you are having problem sending/receiving from this account. For further, more detailed information on this, please refer to the article below.</font></font></font></p>

            Hello - thanks for getting back to me!

<div>Upgrading sounds like a good plan! When I try to upgrade it does not allow me to change my country to the UK - how can I change that?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>I had this problem a while ago as well. I resolved mine by doing the following:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Choose Tools<br />
2. Account Settings</p>
<p>3. Change your profile</p>
<p>4. More Settings</p>
<p>5. advanced. <br />
<br />
Then look if you have the following setting in your account: <br />
<br />
Incoming Server POP3: 995 (SSL)<br />
Outgoing Server SMTP: 25 <br />
Encryption connection: AUTO<br />
<br />
That resolved it in my case. If this does not work I can also recommend you a service called
<a href="https://myhelpster.com/gethelp/fix-outlook-issues-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MyHelpster</a>.
<br />
<br />
They have quite good experts in place (and are cheap). Have used them already a couple time, when I was not able to resolve it by myself.
<br />
<br />
Anyways, hope the description above is already enough and helps you.<br />

            <p>because i cannot do without email at all, i called the service provider - he told me to download google chrome, which i did and it works fine again. &nbsp;so he said it was a compatibility issue only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx for trying. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MV</p>
