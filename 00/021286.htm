    <title>Word vs Wordpad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerrymarynik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word vs Wordpad</h2>
                    I originally purchased a Dell Inspiron 14R/15R (Windows 7) a few years ago and&nbsp;eventually installed&nbsp;Windows 10. Didn't like Windows 10&nbsp;and, when uninstalling, the laptop went belly up. We had to obtain from Dell a new Reinstallation/Operating System. But,
 it&nbsp;was only a Home Premium SP1 with limited "Wordpad", which has no ability to open some previously self-created documents&nbsp;in "Word" on the prior Windows 7. How do I get back to "Word" capability without having to purchase an completely new upgrade?

            <p>Depends what exactly you purchased from Dell in the first place (The system configuration specifics)</p>
<p>No version of MS Office or Word was supplied with any PC unless that PC maker chose to bundle a version with their PC.</p>
<p>There was a period when some PC's with Win7 had Office Starter included with them, which included a cut down version of Word &amp; Excel.</p>
<p>As it stands you would need to purchase a version of Office or Word, though this 'Office like' program is free

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to sign into your Office Account with the same email address and password for the Microsoft Account that you used when you first setup your Office.&nbsp; Sign in here:&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://stores.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://stores.office.com/myaccount</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only use Office 2013 on one computer therefore normally you need to uninstall your Office 2013 before installing on your new computer.&nbsp; Because you cannot do this you will need to contact Microsoft Support so they can 'deactivate' Office on your
 old computer.<br />

<h2>            Delivery has failed to these recipients or groups&#58; 1 user in particular</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Good morning/afternoon (dependant where you are in the world!),</strong></p>
<p>We currently have two separate O365 domain's where we manage two organisations.
</p>
<p>Internal <strong>and</strong> external users are getting NDR's (bouncebacks) when sending emails to this one particular user 'Joe Bloggs' in Organisation B's O365 exchange. NDR's are also sent when sending emails to distribution group (in Organisation A's
 AD)&nbsp;that the user is included in.</p>
<p>This in turn is causing confusion and issues when external clients email the distribution group.</p>
<p>The issue is not always present and at times the recipient has received my email perfectly, others I receive a NDR.</p>
<p>We've been unable to find a cause as of yet.</p>
<p>Can anyone guide me in the right direction?!</p>
<p>Please and a big thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Matthew.</p>

<p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>According to my experience, this issue might be related to the MX record. Please go to the DNS provider page to check if the “Joe Bloggs’s” MX record has been set up correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Record Type</b>:&nbsp;<b>MX</b> </li><li><b>Priority</b>:&nbsp;<b>0</b> </li><li><b>Host Name</b>:&nbsp;<b>@</b> </li><li><b>Points to address</b>: <b><i>office365-com.mail.protection.outlook.com</i>
</b>(For example, the custom domain is Office365.com) </li><li><b>TTL</b>: Set this value to&nbsp;<b>1 hour</b>&nbsp;or to the equivalent in minutes (<b>60</b>), seconds (<b>3600</b>), etc.
</li></ul>
<p>Then remove any other MX records.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, could you provide the following information for further troubleshooting?</p>
<p>1.The NDR. I have sent you a private message to collect it. You can click on the link below to access your Private Message.<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>2.What did you mean by “others I receive a NDR.”? Do those recipients who bounce you an NDR have anything in common?</p>
<p>3.Do any others in your organization meet the same issue?</p>
<p>4.Where did the issue occur, in OWA or the Outlook client?</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

<p>Hi Toby,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>I will send you the NDR now.</p>
<p>My apologies, sometimes a NDR is sent and sometimes an NDR isn't. It's not always consistent but has been occuring for a while.</p>
<p>At this time, it only occurs whilst emails are sent to Joe Bloggs.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>Based on the NDR, I notice that the recipient is you. So regarding “At this time, it only occurs whilst emails are sent to Joe Bloggs”, do you mean that this time the sender doesn’t receive NDRs when sending emails to Joe Bloggs but deliver failed and you
 have provided the DNR when the sender cannot sent emails to you before?</p>
<p>I have checked your domain name and noticed that the MX record is not pointed to Office 365. May I know whether you have any special settings need your MX record points to other server? If not, I’d like to confirm whether you have changed the MX record as
 Toby suggested. If no, please give it a shot and then check if there is any improvement. This can also help us narrow down the issue. The link below for your reference:</p>

<p>Note to remove the old MX record.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after changing it, I’d like to collect some information below for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. Does Joe Bloggs use the same domain name for your email address?</p>
<p>2. If not, please provide the NDR which generated when sending emails to Joe Bloggs to us via private message after you get one. Because emails delivery failed have many difference reasons, the reason may be different when senders cannot send emails to Joe
 Bloggs and you. In other words, the NDR may be different and we need it to analyze the root cause of this issue.</p>
<p>3. Do you have a hybird environment?</p>
<p>If anything is misunderstood, please give more detailed information about why the recipient is you in the NDR but not Joe Bloggs.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Larry</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone advise me what to do about the 'answer a call' button please ? (the button with the little green telephone on it) It has come loose on one side, would a spot of glue solve the problem please? I am rather disappointed in the length of time this
 phone takes to load pages from the internet, and how (very quickly) the numbers/syllables have rubbed off. It's a shame because it's a neat little phone, takes lovely photos, but the quality of the casing seems very poor. Thanks :0)</p>

<h2>            Free upgrades for Visio&#47;Project aren&#39;t free&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We recently switched to Office 365. When we install Office 2016 Visio 2013 and Project 2013 get uninstalled,</p>
<p>According to [URL="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Error-Stop-you-should-wait-to-install-Office-2016-We-ll-have-to-remove-the-following-if-you-continue-a225347f-e102-4ea6-9796-5d1ac5220c3b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US"]Error: Stop, you should wait to
 install Office 2016. We’ll have to remove the following if you continue[/URL] we should be eligible for a free upgrade. I went to the [URL="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus?forceorigin=esmc"]Answer desk[/URL] link in that article and worked my
 way down to a request for the product ID. I don't have the ID for the uninstalled version handy, so I entered the Product ID from the one that's still working. I was informed that:</p>
<p>"This Product ID indicates that there will be a charge for this Microsoft support.<br />
The product ID number you entered is not eligible for online support. Enter another product ID Number or select a different support option."</p>
<p>So what's the real story?</p>

<p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>Office 2016 and standalone Visio/Project 2013 cannot be installed on the same device. To resolve this issue, please follow this article to obtain a free upgrade to 2016 version for your qualifying standalone applications:

<p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;I have comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp; This forum SW is horrible, spamming my email with (so far) seven copies of my OP. &nbsp;I am looking forward to many more.
</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; I made it explicit in my first message that I know they cannot coexist. </li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;The link in my first message is missing an important fact from the link you provided: one should contact Accounts and Billing at the Answer desk.&nbsp; Not having any guidance I assumed Small Business Support was appropriate. Never would have guessed Accounts
 and Billing. </li><li>I spent about half an hour in online chat with Accounts and Billing.&nbsp; Turns out that the only way to get an upgrade is to have the Project 2013 or Visio 2013 installation associated with an email address in the hotmail.com, msn.com, live.com, or outlook.com
 domain. She could not tell me how one does that association or how anyone would ever have any clue that such an association is required.
</li></ol>
<p>I suggest that you add those explicit requirements to both pages. Personally I'd like to see a note that there may be one or two people on Earth eligible for a free upgrade, but the chances for someone viewing those pages to qualify are in the near vicinity
 of zero.</p>
<p>Hands up, everyone that has:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Office 365 subscription </li><li>An email address in one of those domains </li><li>An installation of Project or Visio that has been associated with that account, whatever that may mean.
</li></ul>
<p>Anyone?&nbsp; Bueller?</p>

<p>I have called Microsoft 6 times now and spoken to Office 365 Billing and Accounts twice. Billing and Accounts tells me that I need to start and Issue ticket via the Portal. So I open a ticket, they call back, they can't help, they close the ticket and tell
 me to call Bill and Acounts. Rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>Can you please publish a direct number that your Office 365 Business Customers can call to get immediate assistance. This is very poor customer service, from Microsoft. I am extremely disappointed.</p>

<h2>            Kindle skype calls still not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm just wondering if you have any plans to fix the the kindle skype problem, or if I need to find a different way to video chat.</p>
<p>I have a kindle OS 5.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have already uninstalled and reinstalled.</p>
<p>Trying to make a video call, when the other person answers, my screen goes white and the call is dropped.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This has been happening for 2 months, and from what I see online this has been happening to MANY people, so please don't insult my intelligence and try to tell me it is my device.</p>
<p>This is an app glitch and I want to know if you have plans to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Robynn</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>There are emails I need to receive on my server(s) which are relayed by outlook.com's server and they never reaches their destination...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, actually it does sometimes with <strong><em>some </em></strong>domains but not others.</p>

</p><p>The servers which are supposed to be the final recipient of those domains do not even see a SMTP connection from outlook.com servers. I am the admin of those servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the same email relayed to a domain which actually receives it I see that the sender SPF record of the sender (caaquebec.com) is actually erroneous and does not list the server which is actually trying to relay the email to outlook.com.</p>

<br />-I understand the million question is why the relay pass through some recipient’s domain and not for others.
<br />
<br />-I have some questions:
<br />-How is the relay configured in Outlook?
<br />-Which are domains that are not receiving the emails.
<br />-The recipients affected domains, never receive an email from Outlook relay? Or happens randomly? 
<br />Take in account All messages are not the same, may be ones be considered as Spoofing and others SPAM, Malware, and the action taken by the relay server will be different depending on that.
<br />-Can we perform a message trace in the sender side? 
<br />-Have the sender any NDR received? 
<br />----------------------------------------------
<br />Well based on my experience consider this solution:
<br />-The best practice here is that the sender add to the SPF configuration all sender Server (relays) IPs, plus configuring DKIM and DMARC, to avoid this kind of issues, that will protect recipients including your company as well from external attackers spoofing the sender domain.
<br />-But if your plan is managing the relay to your server and protect the messages from malware, viruses, SPAM, I highly recommend you use Office 365 Exchange Online Protection Plan so you going to have access to an Admin Center to configure the spam/malware filter, and can block or withe list wherever domains, senders, IPs as your convenience.

<p>
</p><p>There are emails I need to receive on my server(s) which are relayed by outlook.com's server and they never reaches their destination...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, actually it does sometimes with <strong><em>some </em></strong>domains but not others.</p>

<pre><strong>I have been having similar issues Nick for the last 48 hours.</strong> </pre>
<p>For example, some emails did not reach the recipient's inbox until 17 hours after they were sent. Hmmm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While for other outgoing email I am not sure what their status is because I just sent them while testing within the last hour. I.E., I don't know if they are delayed OR will never reach their destination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a little testing to try to isolate the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I SENT TO THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS FROM OUTLOOK.COM:</p>
<p>@gmail.com PASSED</p>
<p>@outlook.com&nbsp; PASSED</p>
<p>@cox.net FAILED (had been working for months)</p>
<p>@sbcglobal.net FAILED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like the tech support folks need to have someone take a look at the outgoing server. But that's just a hunch.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It takes two to Tango so it could be a problem with outlook.com servers or the receiving servers (or possible routing issues between the two which are always a possibility).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could also be DNS problems (which, once again, could be caused by routing issues).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time the emails were most likely queued on outlook.com servers (many of which could be involved) and were eventually delivered to the receiving server(s) when the issue was corrected..</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Well, outlook.com to outlook.com, I am not surprised it worked...</p>
<p>
</p><p>gmail.com, I would not be surprised if, routing wise, it would be handled as a special case because of the sheer number of emails which must transit between outlook.com and gmail.com...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the others, both cox.net and sbcglobal.net have multiple emails servers to handle this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of cox.net they are all hidden under the host name cxr.mx.a.cloudfilter.net. which has 4 IPs (DNS A records) assigned to it (there does not appear to be more, I consistently get the same 4 from their DNS). So a total of 4 servers with identical
 priority (100).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For sbcglobal.net, once again there appears to be 4 servers with identical priority (all of the MX records are set at 10) with the host names al-ip4-mx-vip1.prodigy.net, al-ip4-mx-vip2.prodigy.net, ff-ip4-mx-vip1.prodigy.net, and ff-ip4-mx-vip2.prodigy.net
 and all of these only have one IP (DNS A record) assigned to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since both domains have redundant servers it sounds more like a problem with outlook.com or a routing issue (or something similar).</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>Looks like the tech support folks need to have someone take a look at the outgoing server. But that's just a hunch.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For your problem I agree that's the best bet, for mine I am not fully sure if the incoming, outgoing or something in between (-; they should take a look at...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There appears to be special handling of some domains (and I am not surprised that there might be for a domain like gmail.com because of the probably astronomic number of emails between outlook.com and gmail.com). I am however surprised that there might be
 special handling of teksavvy.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why would that special handling come into play when the SPF record of the sending domain does not list the server which is using outlook.com servers to relay, this makes no sense...</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are all supposition, only outlook.com server administrators would know for sure by looking at their logs...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my problem, it has been there for months, possibly years and I only know about caaquebec.com having that problem, there might be thousands of others...</p>

Forget about it. There is no way to stop others from printing, copying, reproducing, ... your work. If your document is displayed on the screen, then it can be copied. The&nbsp;worst case scenario for the copier would be to type over everything they see on their
 screen to duplicate your document, but it is still doable.</p>
<p>Besides, any restrictions you try to impose on your document are just requests to the software which displays your document. The software can choose to ignore those requests if it wants. So even if you manage to somehow protect your document in Microsoft
 Word, someone else would just open it with OpenOffice/LibreOffice&nbsp;or an 'adjusted' version which doesn't care the least about your restrictions and just print it.</p>
<p>The only real solution would be to let people sign an agreement before they get access to the document.</p>

    <title>windows phone 10 - update before reset&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows phone 10 - update before reset&#63;</h2>
                    just bought a new lumia 950 but it is clearly not updated to the latest version of windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I did an update of the software, I tried doing a full reset and then chose to copy over my backed up settings from a prior windows 10 phone.&nbsp; Unfortunately
 it never successfully backed up from my prior phone correctly and I was left with having to reset again and again but it never worked.&nbsp; I then reset using the default setup and then did the very long process of updating to the latest version of windows 10
 software.&nbsp; My question, therefore, is if I were to do a reset again (after I've completed this update to windows 10), will the reset revert me back to some older version of windows 10 or will it respect the updated version of windows 10 and keep it?

No, I did it with PowerDVD, and it worked for 10130 and 10158, so not sure if what you say is so true, but thank you anyhow.

That's basically the same as mounting it on a virtual drive, which also didn't work. But I'm doing another download of 10162 to see if maybe something in the files became corrupted during the first download. But thanks!

    <title>Hide tray icons&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eidolon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hide tray icons&#63;</h2>
                    Hello all, I am trying to find a way to hide icons in the notification area along the top of my WinMo 6.1 screen.
<br />
I.e., i have TWO icons showing me what GPRS service i am connected to. One which is a big square saying "H", "E", "3G" depending on what service i am currently connected to. And right next to that i have a smaller square, which shows EXACTLY the same code,
 plus the traditional 5-bar signal indicator. <br />
<br />
I would really like to hide the big square, since the little one shows exactly the same information, plus more, and having the both of them takes up precious screen real-estate on a phone screen.
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help!

<p>
</p><p>I have set the row height <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">repeatedly</span>.&nbsp; However, when I do a print preview, the row height is variable.&nbsp; In a table of 20 rows, for example, the first row is OK, The second row is double the height.&nbsp; The third
 row is OK again.&nbsp; The fourth row is double again,&nbsp; This pattern continues for the rest of the table.&nbsp; This means that the information I inserted in the rows on the Word screen isn't in separate rows on the print preview screen.&nbsp; I checked out the printer and
 don't find a problem there.&nbsp; So, how do I override the single/double pattern?&nbsp; I use tables constantly and this is making me crazy.&nbsp; Help!</p>

<h2>            When trying to save a particular Excel file it keeps corrupting</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a particular excel workbook that I am trying to save using Excel 2010 but for some reason every time I try to save, it corrupts.&nbsp; I would like to point out things, (1) the workbook is a copy of a Excel 2010 work sheet from another file created by
 a Macro, (2) The workbook I'm trying to save does not contain formulas or macros, but does contain conditional formatting which relates to colour. (3) I have been able to save a workbook created by the same macro each week for the past 12 months without a
 problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message I get is <br />
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="true"?&gt;<br />
-&lt;recoveryLog xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"&gt;&lt;logFileName&gt;error061240_01.xml&lt;/logFileName&gt;-&lt;additionalInfo&gt;&lt;info&gt;Damage to the file was so extensive that repairs were not possible. Excel attempted to save your formulas and
 values, but some data may have been lost or corrupted.&lt;/info&gt;&lt;/additionalInfo&gt;&lt;/recoveryLog&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no issue saving other excel workbooks at this stage.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a particular excel workbook that I am trying to save using Excel 2010 but for some reason every time I try to save, it corrupts.&nbsp; I would like to point out things, (1) the workbook is a copy of a Excel 2010 work sheet from another file created by
 a Macro, (2) The workbook I'm trying to save does not contain formulas or macros, but does contain conditional formatting which relates to colour. (3) I have been able to save a workbook created by the same macro each week for the past 12 months without a
 problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message I get is <br />
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="true"?&gt;<br />
-&lt;recoveryLog xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"&gt;&lt;logFileName&gt;error061240_01.xml&lt;/logFileName&gt;-&lt;additionalInfo&gt;&lt;info&gt;Damage to the file was so extensive that repairs were not possible. Excel attempted to save your formulas and
 values, but some data may have been lost or corrupted.&lt;/info&gt;&lt;/additionalInfo&gt;&lt;/recoveryLog&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no issue saving other excel workbooks at this stage.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are lots of reasons why your Microsoft Office Excel can’t save a particular file. Your application might be corrupted; some third party add ins can cause the issue as well. Location of the file might also be a reason for the issue. I would suggest
 you to check out this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/kb/271513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> with regards on how to troubleshoot Excel when you save Excel workbooks.</p>

<h2>            public folder address book keep disappeared - SOLVING</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>For people that follow for a long time, the question in this link (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_winother/public-folder-address-book-keep-disappeared/c3562c53-d32c-446b-9b6c-52e771b19ac0), I think I've got the your
 solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, after 2 years I discover that this was caused by my firewall. I spend some time without Web filtering active in my firewall and people no more complain that public contact folders desappearing. But when I reactivate it, all people loose the public
 contact lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I created an exception, considering this link recomendations and I think it is solved. Thank God!!!</p>

            Since an SSD doesn't have clusters are you sure you're even using the right tool?&nbsp; SSD geometry is radically different from an HDD so do some research into whether its even a good idea to use chkdsk on one.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be better served to check with Intel for a health status tool of some type... Most SSD manufacturer's provide one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a free tool called CrystalDiskInfo that will read the internal chip and report any type of failures... It can be a bit hard to understand at times though..</p>

                    <p>I have tried to contact support too, but no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I can log into www.outlook.com and see my inbox full of messages</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I put information into Outlook desktop&nbsp;(tried&nbsp;activesync s.outlook.com and POP pop-mail.outlook.com and IMAP imap-mail.outlook.com) I can't connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have contacted support and they could not help and did not escalate either</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. My Microsoft ID is old (from the days of Passport) so it has different domain than outlook.com or Hotmail.com but of course I still should be able to connect because I can connect to Microsoft webmail (www.outlook.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. This worked earlier and suddenly stopped, so there has to be something wrong with my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Same thing with iPad or iPhone, I can't connect but could connect earlier, it just suddenly did not work anymore.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you, but I now double checked this and CNAME is set as it should be, autodiscover.mydomain.com points to autodiscover.outlook.com.</p>
<p>Also, as I can't connect even using POP or IMAP details which I can see when logged into my account with browser, I think the problem must be other than CNAME.</p>
<p>Our domain has not been registered to the program you refer, it's just part of the login (it didn't have to be hotmail-address long time ago).</p>

<p>Finally I also had to remove old username and use only outlook.com username to get sending email to work ok too.</p>

            <p>Have you visited the Microsoft site? You may get some ideas. You should be able to use the 2010 templates as well as earlier templates.</p>

<h2>            docmd.sendobject Problem &#40;Access Crashes&#47;Freeze&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Below is a code that sends a report via Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; The email portion works when you follow thru the process and send it out.&nbsp; The problem I'm getting is if a user decides to cancel the operation, MS Access crashes.&nbsp; How can I prevent that from happening?&nbsp;
 Is there a code that can trap that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

            <p>As you've experienced, there are a lot of limitations to the DoCmd.SendObject command. It requires Outlook to be open, uses the user's FROM address, and requires going through the MAPI security confirmation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a paper we wrote on the command: <a href="http://www.fmsinc.com/MicrosoftAccess/Email/SendObject.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DoCmd SendObject Command in Microsoft Access: Features and Limitations for Sending Emails</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more robust way to send emails is to use SMTP rather than Outlook.</p>
