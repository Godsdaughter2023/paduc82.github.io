<h2>            Sway Analytics&#63;</h2>
                    First off, we have enjoyed using Sway as a means to distributing a monthly newsletter for our organization.&nbsp; We are reaching around 250 people and like the fact that it can be viewed on all kinds of devices.&nbsp; Our issues is does anyone know how to best
 determine how many are actually&nbsp;viewing our monthly newsletter to stay informed?&nbsp; There do not seem to be any tools for analytics other than getting a read receipt from the e-mail we use to send this out, which isn't exactly a good measure.&nbsp; Are there or will
 there be any tools that will help provide analytics for Sway?&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi Tone,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'd like to explain that view analytics feature in Sway is not available. I understand that is would be much more convenient if we could record the
 view analytics on Sway, therefore, I would suggest you vote this article in Sway Uservoice:
<a href="https://sway.uservoice.com/forums/264674-sway/suggestions/6594567-see-stats-such-as-number-of-views-in-sway-admini" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
See stats (such as number of views) in Sway administration pane</a>. Many new features came directly from customer's feedback.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides, as a workaround, you can use
<a href="https://docs.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">docs.com</a> to share Sway to see the number of views, comments, and likes for your Sway. For more details, please refer to:
<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/08/05/sway-general-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/2015/08/05/sway-general-availability/</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            <p>I agree with Tonewalker completely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has made a truly great product in SWAY, but until it has options for detailed analytics it's just for very novice or home use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">As others have noted, and we agree, Docs.com is an option, but it wraps the sway with a header and left-menu which detracts from the simplicity
 of the sway, and confuses readers with more "out of context" menus. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">So Docs.com really is not a realistic option.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">Since MS has comprehensive analytics for many other products, hopefully this is easy to add in the near future.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">Until then, we'll just keep using the simple - easy to use other great options that provide great analytics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">We'll check back in 6 to 12 months.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">Cheers</span></p>

Id love to be able to see this sort of thing aswell. We distribute an internal newsletter but to make it worthwhile, your suggestions of data collection are what we really need. The number of times it has been viewed doesnt cut it.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>use command provided in the previous post by opening command prompt in Windows recovery environment.
</strong>Please follow these steps: </p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD or USB</strong>", do so.
 If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>" to start
 the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Command Prompt</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bcdedit /set {default} safeboot minimal</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>download Windows 10 ISO files and create a Windows bootable media or DVD.</strong><br />

    <title>Different language Office installs for family members from the same - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leslie bonney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Different language Office installs for family members from the same Office 365 subscription</h2>
                    <p>I have just spent over 4 hours with two separate Support Technicians only to be told the answer to my problem is to purchase an additional Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a Mac environment and I was trying to install a Danish language version of the Office Apps onto my daughters Mac. &nbsp;She has been setup as a family member of my subscription account. &nbsp;My install and the Office 365 subscription is in English. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The FAQ on the Office 365 Home install page clearly states that:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">
<em>"Microsoft offers simple and cost-effective solutions for multilingual individuals, families, and small businesses.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style="font-weight: bold">Office&nbsp;365:</span>&nbsp;Each time you install Office on an additional PC or Mac at&nbsp;<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.office.com/myaccount</a>,
 you can choose the language in which to install Office."</em></li></ul>
<p>Despite this clear and unambiguous statement I was told my the Support function this is wrong and the only way you can achieve a Danish install is either to change the whole subscription and all installs to Danish or purchase a separate subscription/installation
 for my daughters Danish install. &nbsp;I was told you can't have multiple language installations on a single Office 365 subscription in a Mac environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this or in fact been successful in have a multilingual Mac environment? &nbsp;Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

</p><p>Sorry that you've been given the runaround here. The truth is that all language support is built into the Office 2016/365 for Mac applications. When you launch an app such as Word for Mac, we look at the language of the operating system, and automatically
 adapt the user interface to whatever the operating system prefers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I suggest you do on your daughter's Mac:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go into the operating system System Preferences -&gt; &nbsp;Language and Region, and verify that Danish is the preferred language</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open Safari, and download the Office 2016/365 installer by navigating to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=525133 (this is a 1.65GB package, so it might take a while to download)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Double-click the pkg once it has finished downloading. You should immediately see that the user interface is in Danish. This will install all of the Office apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Once installed, start one of the applications, like Word. At this point, you need to sign-in and activate the product. If family sharing has been set up, you should just be able to enter your daughter's email address to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Win10 compatibility issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zenmasta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Win10 compatibility issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, anyone having success running windows 10 on their surface pro? So far it's been failing pretty hard on me.</p>
<p>I've been using the preview on my primary pc at work since day one with virtually flawless performance, so I'm pretty surprised to encounter the exact opposite on a surface pro. I guess to be fair though, I'm using 95% desktop applications on that pc with
 the exception of Microsoft apps, namely spartan, music preview etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempt one was a straight upgrade from 8.1 and all of my apps, games etc. After about an hour of use, something went haywire when I toggled between tablet mode and back. explorer.exe crashed and pretty much every time I logged in it was a black screen.
 Trying to start explorer from task manager would sometimes get things going but only for a split second then it would crash again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up doing a recover install of 8.1 since it was not possible to boot from a win10 usb. After this clean install, I tried the upgrade path again. It seems a little more stable but explorer is crashing on me again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time when I reboot though it usually loads cleanly without any errors. It seems to happen most when toggling between tablet mode or minimizing an app. I can't make any real sense of it. I'm checking application logs and seeing several crashes for shellexperiencehost
 searchui werfault and explorer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uploaded various all errors from the event log in various formats to one drive and then the full logs from Applications and System</p>
<p><a href="http://1drv.ms/1c401gx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows 10 log files">http://1drv.ms/1c401gx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I was mostly using tubecast, hulu and spartan. These issues seem so large to blame on hulu but either way this needs some looking into. Tomorrow I'll try avoiding the hulu app and see if I experience the same problems.</p>
<p>

            I tried using the create media tool and obviously there isn't a choice for windows 10 so I choose 8.1 Pro. But when I try to boot from the drive it still says 8.1 even though the ISO I specified was the win10 preview.

    <title>Fake Outlook Password Entry Request From Poland - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gripadeedoodah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fake Outlook Password Entry Request From Poland</h2>
                    <p>Hello there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago I was emailing a work colleague in Poland.&nbsp; Shortly after that I received a text message from a Polish number requesting I click a link and re-enter the password for my Outlook account.
</p>
<p>It instantly smelt fishy so I deleted the text message and DIDN'T click the link.&nbsp; Almost as soon as I had deleted the text my phone kept prompting a re-entering of my password in order to keep using my mail account.&nbsp; Still not convinced this wasn't a bit
 dodgy I have been trying to find a solution to the Poland problem.&nbsp; I finally logged on through my laptop and went to change my password settings, but once again, all of the verification codes are coming from Poland.&nbsp; Is this normal???&nbsp; I can't seem to find
 a straight answer as to whether this is bogus or not, and if it is how to go about resetting my security legitimately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<h2>            Export an entire Word &#40;2010&#41; .docx as a high-resolution image file</h2>
                    <p>I am creating musical examples (sheet music) to be published in an academic journal. &nbsp;My modus operandi has been this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Using my music notation software (Finale 2012, if anyone's interested), I create the music notation</p>
<p>2) I export the excerpt I need as a JPEG file, 1200 dpi</p>
<p>3) I insert that JPEG into a MS Word (2010) document, and add annotations (additional text, arrows, circles, text boxes, etc) as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now, I have a bunch of separate one-page .docx files that look exactly how I want them to look (apart from extra "white space" on the page). &nbsp;I am requesting any help with converting each of these .docx files into an image file (note: I want the whole
 page; I do not want to extract the images from the document).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried converting to PDF and then using Photoshop and/or Acrobat to convert that PDF to an image file....but image quality seems to suffer greatly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any tips on how to convert an entire .docx page into a high-resolution image file, I would love to hear your thoughts!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Limitations of my MS phone.</h2>
                    <p>Have had a Windows phone for years.&nbsp; It's been a great relationship.&nbsp; But I think we might have to break up.&nbsp; Recently got a new car, and one cool feature is remote interaction; think start, warm, set&nbsp; temp., etc.&nbsp; But when I tried to sign up online for
 remote services, they don't support the MS platform.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Next, being a wine Somm., I need apps offered by vendors and retailers, and guess what they don't support the Windows platform either.&nbsp; Every time I deal with this issue, I get more exasperated.&nbsp;
 What can be done.&nbsp; This is my feedback:&nbsp; If you want to grow market share in the phone man./support segment, start pushing the development of common/highly desirable apps so the loyalists can stay loyal.</p>

            As pointed out several dozens of times in this forum, Microsoft cannot force anyone to develop apps for Windows Mobile nor can they simply port them themselves, as they do not own these apps. It is way too late for anything to be saved, let alone grown,
 just get another phone and get on with your life, I did it 2 years ago and never looked back.

<h2>            I got this letter today and I don&#39;t know what to do. Help anyone&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I had registered for the insider programme to try out new builds on my phone and to provide feedback to shape up windows 10 mobile. As a mark of my feedback, I received a mail today by post stating that I was eligible to receive new hardware to test and provide
 feedback for continuum. Upon reading the mail I found out I had to reply to it by 15th Dec. 2015 whereas today is 2nd Jan. ! So my question is whether I would receive the new devices( a lumia 950/950xl, a display dock and an Actiontec wireless adapter). I
 have already replied back to them at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and am waiting for a reply. Could anyone help please?<br />
<br />
Happy new year folks!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

 that they will start preparing package. Then two weeks of silence and finally, they sent me tracking number, transportation was like Fast and: I just got lumia 950 XL.</p>

            <p>Wow, congratulations. Nice story you've got.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, could you tell where you live? I mean, I live in Indonesia, and it so far away from US. You have to cross the entire planet from US to Indonesia. I got the mail in 16th January 2016, and the mail suppose to arrive before new year (I guess). I think
 there was a delayed on mail delivery, if they delivering by the ship.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So according to the mail, I suppose to get the packages within 10-14 days after the email responded. And because the mail was late/delayed for a month, I guess the packages will got a delay too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you live outside of US, I will be glad to hear that. Thanks.</p>

            Although the software you're using is probably different, the cause explained in
<a href="https://support.lexisnexis.com/system/selfservice.controller?CONFIGURATION=1057&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;TIMEZONE_OFFSET=&amp;CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=64242&amp;cust_PrevNextFlag=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this LexisNexis support article</a> is probably the same: a macro stored in the Normal.dotm template is named TmpDDE, which is a special name as far as Office is concerned. Try following the instructions there, and let us know how it goes.

            <p>Hi KenLyle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-4 steps on both sections are same. it starts to differ from 5th onwards depending on the requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, say you followed the 1 set of instructions. You'll have your Outlook profile and email accounts deleted from Outlook and you can start fresh. But your old data won't get deleted. They will be staying in your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, if you followed the second set of steps, you will be deleting the data and then the Outlook profile and email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to delete old data as well, I recommend you follow the second set of instructions as it is much more convenient than to follow first set of steps and later on locating where your old data are to delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly vote for my answer if it helped you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>Just to add some clarification&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Removing a PST data file from a profile does NOT delete it from your system</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Deleting an IMAP or Exchange account will delete the .ost files associated with that account from both the profile and the system</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - To "start over" - the easiest approach is simply to use the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app and create a &lt;New&gt; profile (where "new" = starting from scratch, not copying an existing profile and then making changes to it) and configure your email accounts &nbsp;When
 done, ensure that you have set this newly created is set as the default for the next time Outlook opens.</p>

<h2>            Remix 3D is powered by Xbox Live&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>Remix 3D is powered by Xbox Live! Here's a little more about what that means for you:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Why is my Remix 3D profile changing to an Xbox Live profile?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We’ve combined Remix 3D and Xbox Live profiles into one profile, tied to your Microsoft Account. When you sign up for Remix 3D, you are creating an

<em>and</em> gaming.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have an Xbox Live profile, you're already connected to Remix 3D!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>How will I show up on Remix 3D?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Having one profile for Remix 3D and Xbox experiences means your display name ("gamertag") and pic ("gamerpic") will be the same whether you are collecting models on Remix3D.com or playing games in the Xbox Live community.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you just want to use your Xbox Live profile for Remix 3D, that’s okay!
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Can I change my profile name (“gamertag”)?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Yes. The first time you create a profile name, it's free. Any additional changes can be made on
</span><a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/ChangeGamertag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Xbox's website</span></span></a><span>, for a fee.

 more about updating your gamertag on Xbox.</span></span></a><span>)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anytime you change your profile name, it will change on Remix 3D and Xbox.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Can I change my profile pic (“gamerpic”)?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Yes, you can change your profile pic (“gamerpic”) as many times as you'd like, for free!
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you change your display pic on Remix 3D, it will also change on Xbox. Additionally, if you change it on Xbox, your pic will change on Remix 3D.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>What can I do with an Xbox Live profile?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>In addition to Remix 3D, your Xbox Live profile also unlocks a ton of gaming and entertainment experiences on your PC, Xbox console, or mobile device.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Can people find my profile on Xbox, even if I just use it for Remix 3D?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Yes, once you create a profile, your profile name (“gamertag”) and pic (“gamerpic”) will become discoverable in Xbox experiences. Your Remix 3D content will not be visible in Xbox experiences.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Can my Xbox friends find my Remix 3D stuff?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Once you sign into Remix 3D, your profile and content will be discoverable by anyone who accesses Remix3D.com, including your Xbox friends.

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Do Xbox and Remix 3D share one code of conduct?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Yes, whether you are on Remix 3D or playing on Xbox Live, you are expected to follow the

</p><p><strong><span>What kind of communications should I expect to get?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You will get informational emails about your Xbox Live profile from the Xbox Live and Remix 3D teams.

    <title>Spare Parts Database - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khurram ahmed khan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spare Parts Database</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,<br />
</p>
<p>I am working on access database which has been designed to create purchase orders, make payments of the orders, track delivery of the orders etc. Actually, we do import spare parts for machinery from all over the world hence the database has been designed
 specifically for import department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am working on the front end, therefore, I haven’t full access to the database model to make the amendments in the database design. However, I have found some flaws in the database design model through my little knowledge of database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only access to the order form screen to enter the purchase requisition &amp; spare parts details into the order form. As far as I know, the data may be stored only in two tables
<strong>Inquiry</strong> &amp; <strong>Inquiry Details</strong> tables which are linked through the InquiryID. I would prefer to talk only following three entities which are related to my query.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Suppliers (1) Machine Manufacturers (2) Traders</strong></li><li><strong>Products</strong></li><li><strong>Brands</strong></li></ol>
<p>We have two categories of the suppliers as mentioned above first one is <strong>
Machine Manufacturers</strong> and second one is <strong>Traders</strong> or you can also call them brokers who purchase parts on our behalf &amp; supply us on commission basis. The details of both categories of suppliers are stored in Suppliers table. Actually,
 we purchase the same products from both Machine Manufacturers &amp; Traders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Machine Manufacturers use many parts of different brands in their machines and they assign their
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">own unique part #</span> of each product in order to identify the product when they receive price request from us. So, when we ask price for the product from Machine Manufacturers we have to provide their part # so that
 they can easily identify the required product &amp; send their offer without any difficulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, when we ask price for the same product of any brand from Traders they contact to the Brand Manufacturer to obtain the price of the requested product then Traders offer their price after calculating their commission / profit. Similarly,
 we have to provide part # of the Brand Manufacturer in order to identify the product.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem we are facing in the database is to store multiple part numbers of each product. I mean Machine Manufacturers &amp; Brand Manufacturers part numbers. In my case, Traders do not have their own unique part numbers of the products because they
 are just a middle man between buyer &amp; manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution I found for this problem is that there is one-to-many relationship between product and brand. Because, one product can be available in many brands. So, we can add multiple part numbers by linking ProductID in the parent and child tables. But,
 my approach might be wrong so I would like to know the experts advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem I found in the database is that there is a part # column in the Inquiry Details table, however, it hasn’t been assigned as primary key which has cause the redundancy of the data because same product has been entered in many inquiries with
 different part numbers. I thought the part # column must be unique to identify the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Experts advice are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>P.S. Above I have mentioned Machine Manufacturers and Brand Manufacturers, both are different.</strong></p>

<p>You can create an index that is set as UNIQUE so as to allow only one entry of each part number.</p>

<p>
</p><p>According to my presumptions, I have mentioned three entities which are involved in the database design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to know that how to store multiple part numbers of one product in the database. Suppose, one product we purchased in the past from Machine Manufacturer and later on we purchased same product from Brand Manufacturer through the Trader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is that how can we store Machine Manufacturer &amp; Brand Manufacturer part numbers of the same product in the database?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my thread both have their own unique part numbers of the products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope now you may understand my point.</p>

<p>You would need to identify the product uniquely at a level above both Machine Manufacturer &amp; Brand Manufacturer and add their numbers (and maybe the names that they use) in a related table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have access to the database then you cannot do the necessary changes.</p>

            <p>I am presently employed in municipal government as the "Parts &amp; Inventory Coordinator", and we have a similar situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What our system (which honestly sucks) has created is our OWN part-numbering system. It's mostly an accounting program that has an add-on "inventory module" ... (which, IMO, is pretty much "lipstick on a pig".)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway ... some of this does make some semblance of sense as it relates to both of our situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real rule is that each "IVITM#" (Inventory Item Number) has to be unique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a separate table that relates the IVITM# to a 4-character Manufacturer abbreviation, a sequence number, and the manufacturer's part number(s)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the table below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>04002 is our system-created IVITM#</p>
<p>"CHEC", "GLOV", "CARF" are the manufacturer abbreviations</p>
<p>01, 02, 03 are the sequence numbers<br />
49883, AF27910, FA 1883 are the mfr. part numbers.<br />
There is also a boolean (Y/N) field that determines the "Preferred Vendor"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22e02fd9-3b18-4d0e-abe2-61b6d6458bf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22e02fd9-3b18-4d0e-abe2-61b6d6458bf8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's assume that the database table containing the sample data above could be used to create a subform named "sbfInventoryItems". (this subform could be used on both main forms)</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO, the way to view the information in a way that makes sense (at least to me) would be to use a linked main form / subform approach ... probably 2 different sets of forms?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"frmSupplierItems" might have a LinkMaster/LinkChild relationship with "sbfInventoryItems" on the 4-character MfrCode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"frmInventoryItems"&nbsp;might have a LinkMaster/LinkChild relationship with "sbfInventoryItems" on the IVITM#</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as Karl has pointed out ... this conversation is pretty much moot unless whoever controls the access to the program and data tables is willing to share it and/or collaborate with you. (I'm also in this frustrating situation at the present time.)</p>

            <p>Thanks Don, But, in my case, inventory table is not included in the database design because we do not maintain inventory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, inventory is maintained by spare parts stores and store keepers maintain inventory in their own different database separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing another problem with the part numbers in my current database. The parts number of the machine manufacturers &amp; brand manufacturers are often replaced by another part number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a real case, I have seen many part numbers which have been replaced by new part numbers. Sometimes, I found two or three part numbers of same product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it is another problem to store replacement part numbers of each product in the database.</p>

            <p>One, or both of us are obviously confused. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said (in your latest reply):</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I am facing another problem with the<strong> part numbers in my current database.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So OK ... <strong>whatever </strong><strong>table that stores your part numbers</strong> is what I was referring to as an "inventory table"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, many mfr's often change their part numbers. It's often referred to as a "supersession" or "change-up".</p>
<p><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supersession" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">supersession (definition)</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, if the supplier supersedes from an old number to a new one, it will like require you to follow suit and change your part number in your table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many systems also have more than one part number for an identical or "nearly identical" part.</p>
<p>Many auto parts stores will offer the same part in differing levels of quality (and therefore price)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's use brake pads for example. They have "economy" pads, "premium" pads, "heavy duty" pads", organic pads, semi-metallic pads, ceramic pads and on and on. ALL of these pads are offered for the same vehicle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sample table that I posted earlier *could* be used to display <strong>a nearly infinite number of replacement parts.</strong> That sample (04002) is our number for an air filter that fits several Dodge and Ram Trucks.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25f6fc85-cb69-492e-b210-a8d42ddf39e1" /></p>
<p>The "Part Number" that I order is dependent on which supplier we wish to choose for a particular purchase.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm ordering from "CHEC", I would order a part # 49883.</p>
<p>If I'm ordering from "GLOV", I would order a part # AF27910.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, the receipt would be recorded in OUR inventory table under OUR part number "04002"</p>
<p>I hope this clears things up a bit.</p>

 account a long time ago.&nbsp; I think the difference is because one is an app and the other I guess I went to the outlook web site to login.&nbsp; Not even sure that's how I got on the account.&nbsp; I also have a office 365 business account which issued me a ..@.onmicrosoft.com

<h2>            &#39;Camera Shots&#39; Album - HTC Touch Diamond - New Photos Not Showing There</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
Whenever I take photos (in any mode) they do not appear in the Camera Shots album, regardless of whether the pic will be stored in main memory or not.
<br />
<br />
Presumably they should appear there if the pic has just been taken? And should this be true wherever the photo will be stored?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It used to do this but I fear I may have messed something up when I tried to force the camera to do Burst and Sports mode.
<br />
<br />
How can I get it to store under Camera Shots again? <br />
<br />
Cheers in advance<br />

            OK, I think&nbsp;I've sussed it.&nbsp;I recently added a program to change some of the system language from French to English. This mght have confused the file location because of the different name of the folders. Imterestingly, it didn't make any difference whatever
 language or name I gave the folders. <br />
<br />
Basically the pics are stored where they should be now but the downside is I'm stuck with French! My fault :)&nbsp;

<h2>            Multi-Monitor Snap keyboard shortcut</h2>
                    <p>I have a multi monitor setup. In Win7 and Win8.1 if you use the shortcut (Win)+LeftArrow/RightArrow the in-focus application will first snap either left or right. If you hit it again, it will move the application to the screen left or right of the primary
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win10-TechPreview, this functionality is messed up. If you hit left or right arrows again, it doesn't do anything after the first snap, and just switches sides of the primary screen on the second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a side note, I did notice that there are new "Snap" sizes with the shortcuts (Win)+UpArrow+LeftArrow/RightArrow.</p>

            Yeah, that's the first thing I noticed. I actually used the Shift + Win + Arrow combinations. It did that without having to snap the window first. It just moved the window to the other monitors. Looks like it's gone with Windows 10. I hope it's just a
 bug, because that key combination is really convenient.

            Just throwing a "me too" in here. If I snap, it no longer switches monitor - just switch left/middle/right on the one monitor, making it a fairly useless feature for multi monitors. I often use it in Windows 7/8.1 to move monitors - especially as my TV
 is picked up as a monitor even when it's on a different input (IE: PS4), so sometimes I can't see the "third screen" to drag manually.

            Please, I need this functionality back also ASAP. It's hugely important feature to me, doing many business Lync based presentations on a multi screen setup, and being able to bring windows in quickly to the presentation and take them out Again using a
 hot key is crucial to make this a fluent experience as well as control what audience sees and don't see using screen sharing from one of the monitors.

    <title>Weird home page on my IE - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Weird home page on my IE</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently changed the home for all my users through a batch file with the following command:</p>
<p>reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main" /v "Start Page" /t REG_SZ /d "<a href="http://www.bing.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bing.ca</a>" /f<br />
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main" /v "Secondary Start Pages" /t REG_SZ /d "<a href="http://hnyyztcsvrfpr64/sites/Intranet/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://hnyyztcsvrfpr64/sites/Intranet/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/Home.aspx</a>"
 /f<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works just fine, but I noticed that along with those 2 websites, I've got&nbsp;an&nbsp;strange website added to my home&nbsp;pages as well sometimes is something like:</p>
<p>http:\\\\</p>
<p>http:\\xf-34&nbsp;</p>
<p>sometimes it looks like a foreign language like japaneese or something like that, I tried to look inside the Registry for the entry to try to correct it but no luck..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are using IE9 and 10, but I noticed that even IE8 gave me the same problem..Yes, we are connected to a domain server.</p>
<p>We use that batch because we have more than 100 users and to change the home page for each and every one of them it's a bit of a pain. It works fine, the problem we can't figure out from where those weird pages come from..</p>

            Don't use REG_SZ for secondary start pages. Use REG_MULTI_SZ in the Registry.

<h2>            Confused.. please clarify</h2>
                    <p>I am a long-time Skype user who pays for both Skype phone number and phone service.&nbsp; I do not use Outlook, will never use Outlook and wasn't even interested in having a Microsoft account.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I recently came here to search for an answer to problems
 I'm experiencing with Skype since Microsoft assumed ownership.&nbsp; To post, I was required to have the unwanted Microsoft account.&nbsp; I set it up.&nbsp; Now I see that I have received an email saying that my outlook.com email address has been added to my Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this affect me in any way?&nbsp; In other words, I do not check outlook email and have no intentions of doing so.&nbsp; The only reason the account even exiss currently is because it was required to interact here in this community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I wish you would be more "inclusive" by allowing users to register for the Skype community using only a password/username/2FA combination or our business domains addresses or alternatives.&nbsp; It is rather sad to see that MS feels a need to corral people
 into fenced pastures with locked gates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Are they still shown after you restart Outlook?<br />
Are they being re-added after you recreate your mail profile via the Mail applet in Control Panel?<br />
See; <a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/newprofile.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/newprofile.htm</a></p>
<p>What level of permissions do you have on the Exchange mailboxes? Is it Full Access permissions set by your Exchange admin or did someone delegate his/her mailbox to you via Outlook level permissions?<br />
Which version of Exchange are you using?</p>
<p>In the case of Exchange 2010 and Full Access permissions, your Exchange admin needs remove the "Automapping" property for these mailboxes.</p>
