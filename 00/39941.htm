<h2>            Gamestop Return Policy on Consoles&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Got a brand new console from Gamestop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defective out of the box within a day.&nbsp; I really don't want to pick up another one to be honest and would just rather get my money back or at the very least some store credit.&nbsp; Oh and yeah I know ive reverted back
 to silver lol.&nbsp; And this is in regards to a 2nd 360 I bought that really I didn't need, just got it for the bedroom.&nbsp; Have really no interest in sending it off already to MS, just rather take it back to Gamestop if I'm able to and just get the money back or
 store credit at the very least.&nbsp; So what is their return policy on something like this?</p>

                </div>

<p>My landline is down, has been for almost a week and Gamestop is 26 miles from my house. &nbsp;So that is why I'm asking for help in this. &nbsp;Don't really want to waste fuel unless I know for sure.</p>

<p>So NO one on Xbox Live has ever returned a defective console there before? I find that hard to believe no offense or anything. &nbsp;I emailed them a couple of hours ago and have yet to get a response. &nbsp;And like I said no landline and 26 miles out. &nbsp;Can't really
 find anything out through any means I've tried thusfar. &nbsp;Just don't want to waste the gas and the time to be honest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah they really should. &nbsp;I just thought someone might have dealt with an event like this before and knew how the return worked. &nbsp;Might be a wasted trip but thusfar looks like I will just have to waste my day and make the drive in hopes of just getting my

<p>Buyer's remorse. &nbsp;It strikes us all at one time or another. &nbsp;Trading in really is the best option. &nbsp;Then, if you want, maybe sell it or something. &nbsp;*shrug*. &nbsp;Any time you buy a product, and the retailer has an exchange policy, you should always opt for that
 before resorting to a manufacturer's repair. &nbsp;Even Xbox Customer Support would recommend going back to the retailer for another one rather than waiting the week or two for a repair to get done.</p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play any online games, connected to xbox live though.</h2>
                    Hi, I've had this problem for about two days and I'm going to tear my hair out. I've reset my router, done everything I can think of. My xbox one is connected to xbox live. The connectivity is great. I can download things and stream stuff in a flash. But
 I can't play online on any game. ghosts, assassins creed, battlefield 4, they all tell me their servers are down, or I'm not connected to xbox live. I played call of duty ghosts online once, then after that' my NAT was set from open to strict. Any ideas?

<p>I'm having a similar issue. Mine connects to live just fine and I can use the apps without a problem but when I try to play Multiplayer in games I cannot connect to the required servers. When I run the connection tests it tells me its a DHCP error but everything
 I've tried does not solve the problem. Posting here so that maybe someone can answer us!</p>

<p>I am having the same issue the support tech told be to hard reset my router. When it resets I am good for a few games but then it kicks me out of multiplayer and gives me the message again. I then have to reset the router again this is getting frustrating.

<p>That probably would work, but unfortunately the alternate MAC address is how I connect to my college's network because for some reason the network says that the regular MAC address of the Xbox One is invalid</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 keyboard not working properly</h2>
                    <p>Im also having issues in win 10 after 1 month of having no problem suddenly my keyboard doesnt work. I need to press harder on my keyboard laptop inorder for the character to show. On screen keyboard is no problem at all. I have done similar steps to check
 the driver and clean up dust but nothing happens. I have restored back to my previous os win 8.1 but it seems that the keyboard still the same issue. Drivers have been uninstalled and re-installed but still same? Any patch for this? Its already annoying and
 i cannot perform my work properly.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate - Memory Card Reader, Windows Media Center, Login Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;3 major issues that I have faced in Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate Edition:</p>
<p>1. I am quite unable to login on <a href="http://download.kotakseconline.com/equity.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.kotakseconline.com/equity.htm</a> or 203.199.75.55 with respective login details provided by Kotak Securities.</p>
<p>2. When I have installed card reader driver during installation then why I am getting message in action center like "Your memory card reader is missing a driver. An update is available that solves this problem" (The model name of your memory card reader
 is JMB38X MS SD SD/MMC xD Card Reader.)</p>
<p>2a. When I was using windows vista, I found this error message in a different way in Event Viewer like "you have unplugged a card unfairly so please insert a card and do unplug after proper eject" whereas I do not have a single memory card for use in my
 notebook.</p>
<p>2b. I thought this may a fault of hardware but I always found the same driver with working condition in Device Manager whenever I do start my notebook but within 3-5 minutes it will disappear from device manager as well as printer driver shown in power off
 condition.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;After&nbsp;exit from&nbsp;Windows Media Center there are an "Explorer.exe" error and system does not responding so I must need to reboot the machine.<br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing from you soon with satisfactory solutions.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards</p>

    <title>Mouse cursor sticking between monitors in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irnoodles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse cursor sticking between monitors in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm have an infuriating bug where the mouse cursor can't easily pass between monitors in a multi-monitor setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I move the mouse at a normal (moderate to slow) speed towards the other monitor, the cursor sticks to the edge of the current screen and will not pass through without trying again at quite a fast velocity. The sticking behaviour is
<em>similar </em>to how the monitor corners typically stop the cursor from passing through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a short video of another user demonstrating the issue very clearly. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://winaero.com/blog/fix-mouse-pointer-sticks-on-the-edge-when-moving-between-multiple-monitors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Video of the issue and a proposed solution">http://winaero.com/blog/fix-mouse-pointer-sticks-on-the-edge-when-moving-between-multiple-monitors/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This users suggested registry edit fixes did seem to work for me but thought lots of fiddling it seems that killing Explorer and restarting it gets rid of the issue temporarily without the need to tweak the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bug is semi reproducible by docking the Alarms WinRT app on the right side of my right monitor and then I resize the app so it takes minimal horizontal space on screen. I then dock iTunes (I did get it to work with chrome once) on the right side right
 up against the Alarms app. At this point my mouse cursor usually begins sticking again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards.</p>
<p><br />

<ol>
<li><span>Have you tried with different monitors?</span></li><li><span>What are the make and model of the monitors that are being used?
</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>This issue could be due to screen resolution or graphic card drivers. I would suggest you to change the screen resolution and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Here is the link to change the display:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persists, you may try installing latest version of graphic card drivers from the manufacturer’s website and see if it fixes the issue.

            <p>I have used these Dell 24" Ultrasharp monitors for years without any issue so I highly doubt they're to blame. Both displays are set to their native resolution of 1920x1200. Updating the graphics drivers didn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only changes to my daily-workflow/computer-setup which coincide with the issue are that I started using the docked Alarms app and I installed the latest Windows 8.1 (which introduced windows store apps in the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting to narrow down the the cause of the issue but I can't get a 100% reproducible step yet. It seems the issue only happens with I use the Alarms app which is provided with Windows. I dock the Alarm app to the far right side of the monitors and
 shrink the app down to it's smallest size. After a certain amount of basic computer use (web browsing, file management, viewing pdfs) the issue starts happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My quick fix solution is now to simply hide the Alarms app (not kill it as I don't want to lose my timers progress), then re-maximise and dock the app once more. This fixes the problem immediately, but after a period of time (an hour or so?!) it happens
 again and I repeat my quick fix cycle.</p>

<h2>            WHY exactly does W10 have a lock screen&#63;</h2>
                    We all know that Windows 10 has a lock screen - a sad truth we apparently have to accept. But one question remains: why? Why is it so important for Microsoft that our computers must have it, that on top of making it virtually impossible to remove the lock
 screen, they had to update W10 to disable those ways that were already so complicated that they sometimes took hours to implement?

            <p>Windows is no longer for desktops only. It's designed to be used seamlessly on many types of devices. Whether or not Microsoft has actually achieved this goal is open to question. But anyway, that's the design philosophy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Windows devices use lock screens, so Windows 10 has one. Many Windows devices have touch capability, so Windows 10 has fat tiles. Are you seeing where this is going? That's why Windows 10 has a Start menu that looks like it was designed by a committee.
 Because it probably <em>was</em> designed by a committee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything has to be mobile-friendly now. That's why Microsoft calls everything an 'app' even when it doesn't make sense to call something an app. That's why Outlook now includes Mentions even though no corporate network administrator wants that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're really upset about having to deal with the lock screen, my advice is:</p>
<p>1- If you live in a state where marijuana is legal ... who cares about a lock screen?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the make and model number of the webcam you are trying to connect to the Computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to connect the webcam to a Windows 7 computer then first you have to check the compatibility of the webcam with Windows7, to check the compatibility of the device refer the link provided below.</p>
<p><b>Windows 7 Compatibility Center</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default<span>.aspx</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the webcam is compatible with Windows 7 then you may connect it to the computer and then install the necessary softwares/drivers to make the webcam work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also see the below link for further assistance on connecting the webcam.</p>

    <title>explorer.exe prevents renaming, deleting etc of media files. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            explorer.exe prevents renaming, deleting etc of media files.</h2>
                    I don't know under which cathegory THIS problem falls...<br />
Feel free to sort it where it belongs to.<br />
<br />
Following thing happens very often:<br />
<br />
I cannot rename a file or folder. It is not the permissions. It is allways explorer.exe locking the file. Logging off and back on solves the problem most of the time, so I can delete/rename the file from the explorer. In those cases where this does not work
 I logoff/logon again, open a cmd.exe shell and delete the file there without problems.<br />
<br />
The filetypes are .wma .wmv .mp3 .avi .jpg etc all typical media file types + a few others.<br />
<br />
So the source of the problem is following behavior:<br />
Vista explorer.exe opens the file to read infos there, like extif info in .jpg files, like mp3-ID3-tag, etc etc.<br />
Can explorer.exe be prevented from opening those files for reading and checking information? Win XP a way to (partly) solve that was to unregister shmedia.dll, in Vista it seems to be "wmploc.DLL", but I would prefer a confirmation first.<br />
<br />
This is even worse with .exe files, where Vista (and XP) allways open the file to check for the icon resource, so over slow network this leads to serious probelms.<br />
<br />
The Questions are..<br />
1. How can it be prevented that Vista opens various media file types to check for their contents, and partly hang due to that (rename/delete preventing)?<br />
2. Can it be prevented that Vista opens every .exe file to check for an icon resource, especially over VPN&nbsp; or ANY network connection? I do nearly all my (over VPN) filecopy stuff in a shell since I know that explorer will hang after a few seconds due to this
 behavior.<br />
<br />
KB956592 is already installed, it helps a bit, but really only a bit since it is not the folder browsing that makes it hang, it is the file-open action (especially with .exe).<br />
<br />
Before you ask: I already did change one of the biggest vista annoyances (this .reg file should explain if by itself easier than doing it in words) so it does not check media file contents anyway due to "automatic folder type detection", but it still does open
 those files when accidently hovering over such file, and therefore hangs on some files or make the undeletable and unrenameable.<br />
<br />
That stuff is confirmed by the vista resource monitor and those godly sysinternals (now wininternals) tools, I see that explorer.exe is the culprit.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, I still prefer Vista over XP : ), it is just that it needs (like XP and EVERY other OS too, no Linux exception here!) some adjustment for usability.<br />

    <title>Why does WINDOWS 8 reset the archive bit when I have not edited any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does WINDOWS 8 reset the archive bit when I have not edited any files &#63;</h2>
                    Other users have asked this question and no one from Microsoft has yet posted a proper solution.
<div>Please would a Microsoft Service Engineer come to our rescue !</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 8 is doing strange things with files' archive bits.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have always done my backups using DOS Batch files. I prefer that and I as I am more in control.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So when you do an XCOPY using the /M switch it copies files with the archive bit set and then unsets it so those files won't be backed up again next time you run a backup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That has worked fine for years and years.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I've migrated to Windows 8 (which is otherwise great) everything has gone pear-shaped with my backups.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is something lurking in Windows which, completely outside of my control, is turning the archive bit back on again for each and every file in My Documents (of which I have about 50,000 including large files such as video clips etc). So next night,
 when I run my backup, instead of just copying those files that are new or been edited since last night's backup, the whole lot copy over again taking hours and hours and hours.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So what is it that is turning the archive bit on without the user's knowledge and permission?</div>
<div>Come on Microsoft. Please give us an answer and a solution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is one of the most fundamental principles of having a computer that a user should be able to take backups reliably - and Windows is messing this up.</div>

            Hi Abdul
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the information about the "File History" facility. I am aware that I could if I wanted use another method to backup my files and will consider this further. I am aware of other similar facilities (e.g. Norton, Barclays Bank etc).</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I have to say that just suggesting an alternative method of backing up just side-steps the question that I asked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is something within the WINDOWS 8 operating system that is altering the archive bit of files, thereby indicating to auto-backup programs that the file has been changed and should therefore be included in the copy.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Although XCOPY isn't the most elegant method of doing backups (I agree that using the NTFS journal to identify changes is much neater). Nevertheless, XCOPY is still a microsoft product and its use with the /M switch depends on the archive bit being left
 untouched by other programs, and only being changed by programs which make a change to the file.</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>So we come back to the central question Abdul. What is it which is changing the archive bit when it shouldn't be, and how do I stop this from happening?</span></div>

</p><p><span>Hi SafeDavid,</span></p>
<p><span>That is absolutely not an answer to the question “when is the archive bit set?” The text you refer to does not have any explanation on this matter, the archive bit is something
 that has existed since dos 1.. something – nothing to do with filehistory (check out the “attrib” dos-command)&nbsp; - I need the answer in connection with xcopy, not any tool</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had almost the same identical problem with My SP3 i7.&nbsp; I had noticed the CPU running fast since about June.&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually went into the San Fran store on 29 June while in the US on a short visit.&nbsp; I registered my problem with them at the time (and still
 have the email confirmation)&nbsp;&nbsp; The store techs suggested I restore the computer but I was travelling later that afternoon to Sydney and didn't have the time to do a full reinstall.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got back to Sydney I kept having hardware issues but found it was easier to persevere .... big mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was having problems getting IP addresses, accessing the Wireless Display Adapter,, the system was not shutting down fully but ..... when it
 worked it worked very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally had time to do a rebuild over&nbsp;the weekend 26-27 September.&nbsp; I followed the instructions and could not get the system to restore.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the bitlocker issue and got an unlock code for that.&nbsp;&nbsp; It still didn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept telling me there was no
 recovery partition.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried the downloaded recovery System Image and couldn't get it to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least at that stage it would still boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rang Tech Support in US.&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in Aus but the tech support in the US is better.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tech was great, spent 2.5 hours with me going through the issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end the machine would not even boot.&nbsp; The tech asked when I bought the PC .... low and behold
 it was 29 August 2014.&nbsp; They said they would look into a replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I received an email to say that it was out of warranty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An otherwise great machine has been ruined by a problem that seems to be happening to more people than just me.&nbsp; Given I registered my concern on 29 June I expect to be covered by warranty but it is a bit of a worry that our circumstances are eerily similar.</p>

<p>As you live in Australia you should have 2 years warranty. You can check this on the Microsoft Australia Surface support page or ring Microsoft Australia. Your warranty should still be current. Where did you buy it? Did you register it. In America the warranty
 is only 12 months.</p>

<p>In my view,&nbsp; probably all 2TB. Here's my standard post on the subject of having multiple partitions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div><br />
<div>*The Question*</div>
<div><br />
<div>How many partitions should I have on my hard drive, what should I use each one for, and how big should each of them be?</div>
<div><br />
<div>It’s a common question, but unfortunately one that doesn’t have a single simple answer, right for everyone. Many people will answer with the way they do it, but their answer isn’t necessarily best for the person asking (in many cases it isn’t even right
 for the person responding).</div>
<div><br />
<div>*The Terminology*</div>
<div><br />
<div>First, let’s get the terminology right. Some people ask “should I partition my drive?” That’s the wrong question, because the terminology is a little strange. Some people think that the verb “partition” means to divide the drive into two or more partitions.
 That’s not correct: to partition a drive is to create one or more partitions on it. You have to have at least one partition on it to use it. Those people who think they have an unpartitioned drive actually have a drive with only a single partition on it, and
 it’s normally called C:. The choice you have is whether to have more than one partition, not whether to partition at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>*Some History*</div>
<div><br />
<div>Back before Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (also known as Windows 95B) was released in 1996, all MS-DOS and Windows hard drives were set up using the FAT16 file system (except for very tiny ones using FAT12). Because only 16 bits were used for addressing,
 FAT16 has a maximum partition size of 2Gb.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hard drives larger than 2GB were rare in those days, but if you had one, you had to have multiple partitions to use all the available space. But even if your drive was no bigger than 2GB, FAT16 created another severe problem for many people–the size of
 the cluster was bigger if you had a bigger partition. Cluster sizes went from 512 bytes for a partition no bigger than32Mb all the way up to 32Kb for a partition of 1Gb or greater.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The larger the cluster size, the more space is wasted on a hard drive. That’s because space for all files is allocated in whole clusters only. If you have 32Kb clusters, a 1-byte files takes 32Kb, a file one byte larger than 32Kb takes 64Kb, and so on.
 On the average, each file wastes about half of its last cluster.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So large partitions create a lot of waste (called “slack”). With a 2GB FAT16 drive in a single cluster, if you have 10,000 files, each wasting half of a 32Kb cluster, you waste about 160Mb to slack. That’s a substantial portion of a drive that probably
 cost over $400 back in 1996–around $32 worth.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So what did people do? They partitioned their 2GB drive into two, three, or more logical drives. Each of those logical drives was smaller than the real physical drive, had smaller clusters, and therefore less waste. If, for example, they could keep all
 partitions under 512Mb, cluster size was only 8Kb, and the waste was reduced to a quarter of what it would otherwise be.</div>
<div><br />
<div>People partitioned for other reasons too, but back in the days of FAT16, this was the main reason for doing so.</div>
<div><br />
<div>*The Present*</div>
<div><br />
<div>Three things have changed dramatically since 1996:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. The FAT32 and NTFS file systems have come along, permitting larger partitions with smaller clusters, and therefore much less waste. In fact, with NTFS, cluster sizes are 4K, regardless of partition size.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Hard drives have become much bigger, often over 1Tb (1000Gb) in size.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Hard drives have become much cheaper. For example, a 1Tb drive can be bought today for around $50. That’s 500 times the size of that typical 2Gb 1996 drive, at about an eighth of the price.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What those things mean together is that the old rationale of having multiple partitions to avoid substantial waste of disk space is gone. The amount of waste is much less than it used to be and the cost of that waste is much less. For all practical purposes,
 almost nobody should be concerned about slack anymore, and it should no longer be considered when planning your partition structure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>*What Partitions are Used for Today*</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is a wide variety of different ways people set up multiple partitions these days. Some of these uses are reasonable, some are questionable, some are outright bad. I’ll discuss a number of common partition types in what follows:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. A partition for just Windows</div>
<div><br />
<div>Most people who create such a partition do so because they believe that if they ever have to reinstall Windows cleanly, at least they won’t lose their data and won’t have to reinstall their applications, because both are safe on other partitions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In fact the first of those thoughts is a false comfort, and the second is downright wrong. See the discussion of&nbsp; partition types 2 and 4 below to find out why.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also note that as time passes, many people find that their Windows partition that started out to be the right size turns out to be too small. For example, if you have such a Windows partition, and later upgrade to a newer version of Windows, you may find
 that your Windows partition is too small.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. A partition for installed programs</div>
<div><br />
<div>This normally goes hand-in-hand with partition type 1, a partition for just Windows. The thought that if you reinstall Windows, your installed application programs are safe if they are in a separate partitions is simply wrong. That’s because all installed
 programs (except for an occasional trivial one) have pointers to them within Windows, in the registry and elsewhere, as well as associated files buried within the Windows folder. So if Windows goes, the pointers and files go with it. Since programs have to
 be reinstalled if Windows does, this rationale for a separate partition for programs doesn't work. In fact, there is hardly ever a good reason for separating Windows from application software in separate partitions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. A partition for the page file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some people erroneously think that having the page file on a separate partition will improve performance. That is also false; it doesn’t help, and often hurts, performance, because it increases head movement to get back and forth from the page file to
 the other frequently-used data on the</div>
<div>drive. For best performance, the page file should normally be on the most-used partition of the least-used physical drive. For almost everyone with a single physical drive, that’s the same drive Windows is on, C:.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. A partition for backup of other partitions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some people make a separate partition to store backups of their other partition(s). People who rely on such a "backup" are just kidding themselves. It's only very slightly better than no backup at all, because it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous
 loss of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers: head crashes and other kinds of drive failure, severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes, virus attacks, even theft of the computer.&nbsp; In my view,</div>
<div>secure backup needs to be on removable media, and not kept in the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. A partition for data files</div>
<div><br />
<div>Above, when I discussed separating Windows on a partition of its own, I pointed out that separating data from Windows is a false comfort if it’s done with the thought that the data will be safe if Windows ever has to be reinstalled. The reason I call it
 a false comfort is because I fear that many people will rely on that separation, think that their data is safe there, and therefore do not take appropriate steps to back it up. In truth the data is not safe there. Having to reinstall Windows is only one of
 the dangers to someone’s hard drive, and not even the most likely one. This kind of “safeguard” falls into the same category as a partition for backup of other partitions; it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of
 the most common dangers that affect the entire physical drive, not just the particular partition. Safety comes from a strong backup regimen, not from how you partition.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However for some people it can be a good idea to separate Windows and programs on the one hand from data on the other, putting each of the two types into separate partitions. I think that most people’s partitioning scheme should be based on their backup
 scheme, and backup schemes generally fall into two types: imaging the entire hard drive or backup of data only. If you backup data only, that backup is usually facilitated by having a separate partition with data only; that permits backing up just that partition
 easily, without having to collect bits and pieces from here and there. On the other hand, for those who backup by creating an image of the entire drive, there is usually little, if any, benefit to separating data in a partition of its own.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, in all fairness, I should point out that there are many well-respected people who recommend a separate partition for Windows, regardless of your backup scheme.&nbsp; Their arguments haven’t convinced me, but there are clearly two different views
 here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. A partition for picture files</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some people like to treat pictures and videos as something separate from other data files, and create a separate partition for them. To my mind, a picture is simply another kind of data, and there is no advantage in doing this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>7. A partition for music files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The comments above pertaining to picture files apply equally to music files. They are just another kind of data and should be treated the same way as other data.</div>
<div><br />
<div>8. A partition for a second operating system to dual-boot to.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For those who run multiple operating systems (Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 98,&nbsp; Linux, etc.), a separate partition for each operating system is essential. The issues here are beyond the scope of this article,&nbsp; but it’s sufficient to note that I have
 no objection at all to such partitions</div>
<div><br />
<div>*Performance*</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some people have multiple partitions because they believe that it somehow improves performance. That’s not correct. The effect is probably small on modern computers with modern hard drives, but if anything, the opposite is true: more partitions mean poorer
 performance. That’s because normally no partition is full and there are therefore gaps between them. It takes time for the drive’s read/write heads to traverse those gaps. The closer together files are, the faster access to them will be.</div>
<div><br />
<div>*Organization*</div>
<div><br />
<div><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)">I think many people overpartition because they use partitions as an organizational structure. They have a strong sense of order and want to
 separate apples from oranges on their drives.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)">Yes, separating different kinds of files on partitions is an organizational technique, but so is separating different kinds of files in folders.
 The difference is that partitions are static and fixed in size, while folders are dynamic, changing size automatically as necessary to meet your changing needs. That generally makes folders a much better way to organize, in my view.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)">True, partitions can be resized when necessary, but except for newer versions of Windows, doing so requires third-party software (and the ability
 to do it in Windows is primitive, compared to the third-party solutions). Such third-party software normally costs money, and, no matter how good and how stable it is, affects the entire drive, entailing a risk of losing everything. Plan your partitions well
 in the first place, and no repartitioning should be necessary.&nbsp; The need to repartition usually comes about as a result of overpartitioning in the first place.</span></div>
<p>
</p><div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)">What frequently happens when people organize with partitions instead of folders is that they miscalculate how much room they need on each such partition, and then when they run
 out of room on the partition where a file logically belongs, while still having lots of space left&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)">on the other, they simply store the file in the "wrong" partition. Paradoxically,
 therefore, that kind of partition structure results in less organization rather than more.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>*So How Should I Partition My Drive*</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you've read what came before, my conclusions won't come as a surprise:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. if your backup scheme is to image the entire drive, have just a single partition (usually C:);</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. if you just backup data, have two partitions–one for Windows and installed application programs (usually C:), the other for data (usually D:).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Except for those running multiple operating systems, there is seldom&nbsp; any benefit to having more than two partitions.</div>

<h2>            Want New Skype. I Uninstalled Skype on Windows 10, but the website refuses to let me re-download new skype</h2>
                    <p>I was having issues trying to get my skype app to look like the updated version, checked for updates and was told it was the most current version. I figured it would just be easier to uninstall and re-install, but lo and behold the website refuses to let
 me download it because "you have windows 10 and skype is already on your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have cache files or something under App Data &gt; Roaming &gt; Skype, and I don't know if maybe that's the reason I can't re-install, but I would like some help or an actual installer please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I can re-install the classic version of skype, so it seems my problem is that when I click the "Get skype" button when trying to download the new version it just does nothing. Completely unresponsive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox 1 wont turn on after turn off with voice command..</h2>
                    
<p>My X1 is having a problem turning on after I turn it off with the voice command. I have to unplug the power block from the wall, wait 30 sec, plug the block back in and then manually turn on. Sometimes when I turn the system off with the controller it wont
 turn on either. Imagine having to do this almost every time you want to play a game or watch TV. Very frustrating. Anyone else having this problem? I had to send in my console once already. Right out of the box. For something different. I&nbsp;didn't get past the
 initial update, it was a day one console. I was disappointed so bad on day one for&nbsp;getting&nbsp;a broken console and now this.&nbsp;All I want is a&nbsp;X1&nbsp;that works properly.</p>

<p>G'day KUSH! Just to be sure I understand, please confirm this: After shutting down the console by voice command, none of the normal methods for turning it on will get a response? Have you tried turning it on with voice, your controller, and the console's
 power button?<br />
<br />
If so, my next questions is this: Is the console plugged into a surge protector? If it is, try plugging it directly into the wall. Some surge protectors will put an outlet into a lower power state when it recognizes that the attached device has been turned
 off. If this is the case, it's possible that the console isn't getting enough power to start up successfully. Let us know!</p>

<p>Its been a while since my last post. I've took this last month to try out everything everyone posted to make sure I analyze everything with my problem before I posted again. Thank you every one for your input. &nbsp;@ Miss Joust thank you for your response. Once
 I turned off the console with voice command it wouldn't start back up at all. With any method. After I tried everyone's suggestions. I plugged the power block strait into my wall outlet like you suggested. After that its gotten a little better. Now it doesn't
 short out every time. I say short out because that's what it seems to be doing. I can turn it off with voice command 2-3 times before it shorts out and doesn't let me turn it back on with voice command or controller. I've been able to turn the console back
 on by pressing the power button on the console itself only. That's something I couldn't do before. Before I couldn't turn it back on other then by unplugging the power block and plugging it back in. Now like I said I can turn the console on only by the power
 button on the console. I took the time since my last post like I said to make sure I figured out when its doing it and when not. Its still some what random. Sometimes it shorts back to back. Some times it does it every 2-3 times. So after all this. My problem
 still persist and has not gone away. Seems I am not the only one with this problem either. Has anyone with this problem had this resolved by Microsoft yet? If so. Please enlighten me on what the problem was and what Microsoft did to fix your console. Did they
 exchanged your console? This is going to be my second console exchange. Wish they stopped giving me lemons. Please Microsoft stop giving me broken hardware. Very disappointing. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;franksouth!<br /><br />Sorry to hear about the power issue. &nbsp;Just to make sure that we haven't missed any troubleshooting steps, I recommend trying a few as well as the steps that Misses Joust suggested.<br /><br /><strong>Please give the following steps a try:<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Once your console has powered off, unplug the power cord.</li>
<li>Wait 5 minutes and then plug in the power cord.</li>
<li>Make sure that your console is is plugged directly into the wall.</li>
<li>Power off your console by voice command.</li>
<li>Once your console is off try to see if you can power it on by voice.<br /><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Give these steps a shot and let us know if powering on by voice was successful.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>            Dns server not responding</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I diagnose my Local Area Network connection at my university apartment, the troubleshooter says the DNS server is not responding, although it is correctly configured. I am not sure how this affects my connection, but I do have a higher than normal latency,
 and I assume this is why. I tried setting a static DNS with 208.67.222.222 (and 220.220) under IPV4 for my LAN connection under adapter settings, but then I can't even connect to a DNS server.</p>
<p>I looked at a similar unresolved post like mine, but in that person's ipconfig /all, under the "Ethernet Adapter Local Area Connection" part, I believe his IP's at least matched for his default gateway, DHCP, or IPV4, while mine are all over the place. Would
 that be a problem? I apologize that I am very bad at using/understanding computers!</p>

            <p>Hi Khagesh_786,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS (Domain Name System) translates URLs into IP (Internet Protocol) addresses (and vice versa). For example, if you type
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com</a> into the address bar in your web browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server. The DNS server translates the
 URL into an IP address so that your computer can find the Microsoft web server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>I would suggest you to clear the DNS cache and see if that fixes the issue. Clearing the DNS cache forces DNS to query a DNS server rather than using information stored in the cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>"Start"</b> button .</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the search box, type <b>
"command prompt"</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the list of results, <b>
right-click</b> Command Prompt, and then click <b>Run as administrator</b></p>
<p>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the command prompt, type
<b>ipconfig /flushdns</b></p>
<p>Restart the computer and see if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>You may run the network troubleshooter and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</a></b></p>

    <title>Can I restore my computer to factory defaults to clear my admin - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I restore my computer to factory defaults to clear my admin password&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well from everything I've read I cannot reset my password.&nbsp; I just changed it last week cause a family member got ahold of it by accident.&nbsp; I haven't logged in since I last changed it.&nbsp; I know what it is but it keeps telling me its the wrong pswd.&nbsp; I've
 tried my old ones also, even tried different variations of the one it is incase I hit the wrong key.&nbsp; I don't have a pswd reset disk and I don't have another admin acct.&nbsp; Wish I did now.&nbsp; I also don't have a windows vista disk cause it was pre loaded on my
 computer when I bought it.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So the only other thing I can think to do is to restore my computer to factory default settings.&nbsp; I thought the last time I had to do this when I had the win32 trojan and couldn't clean the system that I had to set everything up again.&nbsp; Including the admin
 acct and password.&nbsp; Anyone have any other suggestions before I try this route?&nbsp; I don't wanna use a program downloaded online if at all possible cause I have no interest in paying to be able to access my admin acct again.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any help or
 suggestions.<br />
<br />
Sorry another thought I just had was restoring the computer back to a date before I changed my pswd last week.&nbsp; Would that work?</p>

            This is kind of drastic, but you could try burning a Knoppix CD, and running chntpw from it. See &lt;url removed&gt;

    <title>Can hyperthreading be disabled in Windows 7, without reinstalling - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can hyperthreading be disabled in Windows 7, without reinstalling OS&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I have an ASUS G73JH and I want to disable hyperthreading.&nbsp; Can this be done without reinstalling OS?&nbsp; If not, where in OS install is option to not hyperthread?&nbsp; My bios, version 213, does not have option to stop hyperthreading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hyperthreading is very annoying and slows down single threaded applications terribly from what I can see.&nbsp; There should be an easy way to kill this useless option.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Heiner Philipp</p>

            <p>There is no option given to disable hyperthreading in the Windows 7 installation process. Hyperthreading is a function of the base hardware and is OS independant. Windows 7 sees and will endeavour to make best use of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't disable it in BIOS, there is nothing that you can do.. </p>
