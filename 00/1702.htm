<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having an issue with outlook not retaining the password for the server.&nbsp; I followed the suggested actions from the knowledge base and narrowed it down to a registry error - the problem is regedit and regedt32 cannot delete the registry key.&nbsp; This is
 my personal computer and I have admin access.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

Whether that works or not depends on the version of Outlook and Windows - which the OP has yet to tell us...

    <title>Auto save did not work in Office 365 on Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Auto save did not work in Office 365 on Mac</h2>
                    I opened a previously saved PowerPoint and worked on it for 5 hours. Autosave was on. I saved regularly. Powerpoint froze and I had to force quit. When I opened it up again, ALL my work was gone. The only version in the history is the original. I’ve followed
 every thread I could find. Office is completely up to date.&nbsp;The work is gone. Any help you can give would be appreciated.&nbsp;

            Hi CarolGautier,<br />
<br />
If the file is saved to another location instead of OneDrive, then AutoSave is disabled.<br />
You must open your file from the File menu within Word, Excel, or PowerPoint in order for AutoSave to be activated.<br />
<br />
In addition, AutoSave requires having an Office 365 subscription and should have signed into your 365 subscription with Office applications.<br />
And AutoSave is available only to Office for Mac 2016 users, if you are using Office 2011 for Mac, then you cannot access this feature.<br />
<br />
To better understand your situation and provide help for you, please confirm the information below:<br />
1. Please capture a screenshot of your <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19#ID0EBCAAA=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office version</a> and OS version (Apple icon&gt; About This Mac).<br />
2. Please check if the file has been stored in OneDrive: Sign in <a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
portal</a>&gt; Click OneDrive.<br />
3. Did you use the AutoSave feature for the first time? Have you ever had this problem before?<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Gloria<br />

            Gloria's reply assumes you saved your file to OneDrive. Did you? If not, then the feature involved is AutoRecover, not AutoSave.

            I want to know the names of those 3 threats. Firefox ones may be tracking cookies and doesn't affect PC.<br />
<br />
I would also ask whether other updates from Windows Update are downloading well or not?<br />
<br />
After watching the questions you asked here, I think what you are observing (MSE errors, crashes, etc.) are only surface errors the problem is very deep inside. I would recommend you to retire your XP PC and buy a new Windows 8 (or atleast Windows 7) PC. See
 this:<br />

<br />
<br />
If you want XP until 2014 then you should ask some expert to reinstall fresh copy of XP.<br />

<h2>            Binding&#63; Not Binding&#63;</h2>
                    I ran a solver in excel, and on the answer report there were several of my constraints listed as "Binding" and several listed as "Not Binding", I was wondering what this means?

            <p>Let's say that you have set a maximum of 9000 for one of the changing cells (the constraint for this cell is &lt;= 9000).</p>
<p>When Solver finds a solution, the cell could be maxed out at 9000. This means the cell value has been pushed to its limit. Perhaps a better solution could have been found if the cell was allowed to go over the limit of 9000, but because of the constraint
 that's not possible. In this situation, the constraint is binding.</p>
<p>It's also possible that the cell remains below 9000, e.g. it's only 7500 for the optimal solution. The cell value could theoretically be increased, but other contraints prohibit this. In this situation, this constraint is not binding.</p>

            No.&nbsp; It will only activate if you upgrade to it from an activated Windows 10 or Windows 10 Insider Preview install on that Virtual Machine.&nbsp; There is no product key that will activate the Insider Preview Build 10525.

It would be possible to create a macro to do that, but it would be necessary to know the exact layout of the document - i.e in which paragraph numbers the address details appear.</p>
<p>If you send a copy of the file to me at dkr[atsymbol]mvps[dot]org, I will create a macro for you.</p>

    <title>Is Windows Defender Enough&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaeljcarroll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Windows Defender Enough&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I haven't found this direct a question.&nbsp; Everyone seems to have questions about their old security software, but nowhere have I found justification for having it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is my issue.&nbsp; For years and years, I have used third-party security software because I have found it necessary based on early personal experience and articles I have read.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All the ballyhoo about Windows 8, however, suggested that the security software designed by MS is finally as good as the competition if not better.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I decided to check this out on one machine.&nbsp; One thing I noticed immediately was that using Defender and no other suite did noticeably improve my machine's behavior:&nbsp; Faster and slicker.&nbsp; My few attempts to expose the system to&nbsp;dangerous sites did get a
 timely intervention.&nbsp; However, I am not equipped to check for true resistance to malware in all its many forms.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My own feelings so far is that Defender works and I feel safe ... mostly, but ...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Has this been actually researched?&nbsp; Are third party security software necessary or not?&nbsp; If so, which suites are recommended and why?&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows Defender on Windows 8/8.1/RT/RT (8.1)&nbsp;is a full anti-virus product so when used with the built in Windows Firewall it is usually adequate for most consumers, but I am not convinced that it is in the top echelons when it comes to virus detection and
 blocking. As you have discovered though&nbsp;it does not consume as many resources as some 3rd party products.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for which is the best anti-virus product you will get many different answers depending on who you ask and it also depends on your needs. My personal opinion is to avoid McAfee and Norton. I use Windows Defender on my Windows 8.1 laptop and Surface RT
 (8.1) tablet and Kaspersky on my Windows 7 desktop. What is suitable for me, may not be best for you.</p>

<p>Jetta, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I realize that I will see a lot of recommendations.&nbsp; I'm interested in all of them, as long as they attach some reasons to it.&nbsp; Even those without reasons might constitute some sort of poll.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>FWIW, I was happy with what Norton was doing up until I began using Win 8.&nbsp; They seemed to have the software least stressful on the system:&nbsp; I noticed almost no delay in boot time and little impact on system resources while I was working.<br />

<p>That has been my experience, too, ... so far.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is the "so far" that bothers me.&nbsp; A long time ago, I thought I was happy with the security I then had.&nbsp; But then something got through (this was back in the day of the small "floppy" disks) and infected my computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes, I don't ever open an executable file unless it is one I have specifically requested and know about.&nbsp; It's the drive-by's and the backdoor invasions that have me concerned.&nbsp; I know that no one really knows for sure what can slip through unaided by the
 user.&nbsp; I was hoping that more people would bring their own experiences and concerns to post here on this thread.</p>

            <p>Since my last post, I have installed Norton Security Suite, a freebie from my internet service provider.&nbsp; NSS is essentially NIS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did this as a test.&nbsp; My&nbsp;system was running well and I had it backed up, so I decided it was a good time for the test.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>NSS installed quickly, but it was not long before it had a few quirks.&nbsp; The main one was the appearance of two icons for NSS in the notifications section of the quick launch bar.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It took a few days for me to figure out the problem.&nbsp; It turned out that I had a system conflict from one of the drivers for my monitor.&nbsp; I was about to lay the blame on Symantec until I did some checking and found out that the problem was Nvidia's not Symantec's.&nbsp;
 Nvidia had delivered a driver that my video card was not supposed to have.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Uninstall and new install.&nbsp; Problem fixed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So what impact does NSS have?&nbsp; I sense a very small slowdown in booting up, and again a tiny additional interval in arriving at the desktop.&nbsp; If these are real, then they are nonetheless&nbsp;not problematic, for me.&nbsp; No perceptible slowdown in application launching
 or behavior.&nbsp; I don't use Norton's site checker because I feel that the native checker built into IE11 is sufficient and I see no reason to overburden an already too sensitive browser to additional fingers in its pie.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A week and a half is not enough time to detect all aberrant behavior, particularly when it might be subtle.&nbsp; All I can say so far is that NSS is virtually an invisible and mostly reassuring presence.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is it enough?&nbsp; That I don't know.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I just helped a neighbor recover her computer from a severe infection from a browser and system hijacking.&nbsp; It took a couple of hours.&nbsp; So where was her Norton 360 all this time?&nbsp; Yes, it was her choice to click on a link in a piece of e-mail that she should
 have been suspicious of.&nbsp; But Norton should have interfered, should have warned her.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But still there is a time gap between the appearance of a piece of malware in the wild and the key to recognizing it, then defending against it.&nbsp; That said, I must admit that this infection was around long enough to have a site offering a recovery from it,
 which is more than Norton provided.&nbsp; (Kudos to malwaretips.com)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One other mitigating point, though.&nbsp; The woman had an active McAfee AV product (bundled into one of those so prevalent upgrade downloads).&nbsp; The existence of two active AV products can be counterproductive, and might have been the cause of Norton missing
 the initial infection.&nbsp; Might have...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will give NSS a sufficiently long opportunity to show what it can do, then will probably remove it and see what difference, if any, results.</p>

            <p>I have window defender with window 8.1 and everyday I update in each date and scan&nbsp;it but suddenly why the google .com says I have to install some kind of security that I do not know the name when I open the google.. I uninstalled Norton that hp installed
 because hp said that it is one year free but every day and time the Norton asked me to do something attention and if I need to buy or so much I had interruption during using computer so I decided to just trust the window defender to make my computer in safe..
 but now all my current problem is the firefox and google ask me to install some kind of security from saying of their indication that is telling me I must install because the window 8 or 8.1 has defect so I don't know what is going on why so this unusual problem
 started&nbsp;.. I am tired of this and feeling unsecure&nbsp;so I would like to really make sure if the window defender works no problem to protect my computer..&nbsp;ak- shimab&nbsp;</p>

            will never use Norton or avg again. both messed up my pc and got worse after I removed them. also as a parting gift from Norton it completely disabled my windows defender beyond repair and disable my pc to the point I had to reinstall system and programs.

<p>I have a hard time believing this.&nbsp; It sounds like you must have done some serious tinkering with your system beforehand to result in something like that ... or you violated one of the installation rules about a number of AV programs and left it installed
 during a major upgrade, rather than following SOP by uninstalling, then upgrading, then reinstalling.&nbsp; Is that what happened?&nbsp; If so, don't feel alone; I did it myself once and learned a hard lesson about following advice.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to IMAP server with Outlook 2010 or 16 at all&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having a really big issue adding accounts with outlook. I've had our hosting provider look into the issue and also our ISP - They've been on RDC with me numerous times and cannot come up with a solution and told me they can't help. Nobody can seem
 to find a fix, I'm hoping someone here can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to add an IMAP account on outlook gives the following 2 issues:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Log onto incoming mail server (IMAP): A secure connection to the server cannot be established.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Send test e-mail message: Your server does not support the encryption type you have specified. Try changing the encryption method. Contact your mail server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP) for additional details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning anti virus off</p>
<p>Turning firewall off</p>
<p>turning both the above off at the same time</p>
<p>Added account via Thunderbird and it connects fine with no issues</p>
<p>Telnet can connect to the domain successfully [mail.domain.com]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried with SSL/TLS/Auto and None and all give the same error. Even tried Auto-Discovery but no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be causing this issue? I don't know what to do... This is a business setup and using Outlook is vital for read receipts etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows PC - Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit Service Pack 1</p>

            That, to me, says Firewall/Anti Virus/Proxy Server settings somewhere.&nbsp; Have you tried connecting a test computer to the far side of the firewall and see if it connects to email?

<p>I'm not sure what you mean? I'm stressed as hell trying to resolve this issue. I'm not sure if I'm even thinking straight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you mean, have I tried connecting a spare PC to the network and trying? If that's what you mean, yes, I have. I've brought my MacBook Pro in with windows on Bootcamp and that does successfully connect. It's a weird one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there can't be anything wrong with 23 clean PC's with fresh windows 7 Pro could there? All PC's are connected to a switch with no firewall attached. Only firewall would be on the PC's themselves and I've disabled it for now just for testing purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know where I can find any weird settings on the PC where I can look to see if that could be a problem such as proxy etc? I've tried internet Properties but not sure where I should be looking!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            My assumption was that your ISP line would first go to a firewall, then a switch, then your networked PCs.&nbsp; If there's no firewall, forget that part.&nbsp; If you brought in a home computer that connects to email OK at home and it also connects OK attached
 to the switch at work, that pretty much eliminates the ISP line and the switch.&nbsp; So, what kind of Anti Virus?&nbsp; If it's third party, like MacAfee or Norton, and has an email scanner, suspect the email scanner part, they are trouble prone.&nbsp; I know you said you
 turned the A/V off, but some third party A/V apps don't understand <strong>OFF</strong> well.&nbsp; What version and build of Outlook are you using at work, are they all 2010?

<p>Build version at home is: 14.0.7197.5000 32-bit. I think the work is on Beta but that's strange because it was bought from Amazon last year and not a download. Not really sure what's going on there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right, ok!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just made a Zoho account as a test and added the account to outlook and it successfully connects...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The plot thickens!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As all these outlook clients are connected the same, I can't see why it won't work with our domain but everyone else's (zoho etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds like something to do with the hosting but I've had them check this out and they can't find anything wrong...</p>

<p>Hello SirJackWhittle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restriction of your Domain Admin is one possible cause of this issue. Since you mentioned that you already reconfigured your email and the issue still persist, it will be best if you will contact your domain support or have connected with your email service
 provider and ask if there is other configuration that can help to work your account.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Access 2007</h2>
                    <p>I suddenly realized that I&nbsp;accidently deleted 2 crucial files that&nbsp;were&nbsp;Microsoft Access 2007 from my hard drive (C) in my computer a while ago.&nbsp; But these files were stored in my external hard drive (F) - also in Microsoft Access 2007.&nbsp;Since I accidently
 deleted the files in my hard drive C, &nbsp;I have been&nbsp;entering a lot of data in this &nbsp;Microsoft Access 2007 database in&nbsp;the C drive.&nbsp; Is there a way that I could integrate both Microsoft Access 2007 together without losing any of the data that has been entered.&nbsp;
 Please advise.&nbsp; This would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank You.</p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this question, you had replied to me as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you had 2 database applications created with Access 2007? You deleted them from your C Drive? But you continued to enter the data? I'm sorry but your post is somewhat contradictory and you aren't making sense.</p>

<p>
</p><p>And I had replied to you that I was away from my external drive and that I would get back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files that were deleted from my C drive are now on the F external drive and they are not accdb files: one file is with a .rtf extension and the other as .xls file. &nbsp;When I enter data that I need to input in the Microsoft Access 2007 application which
 is the database, files are updated automatically and these two files are two of the files that are usually updated. &nbsp;These two files are in my F: external drive, but are not in my C: drive. &nbsp;How can I get these files back in my C drive and for them to appear
 in my Microsoft Access database application without disturbing the data that has been inputted or updated since they have been deleted. &nbsp;Please advise. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

            Ok, it sounds like your Access application is either linking to or writing to those two files (rtf is used with Word, xls with Excel). You simply need to copy them from your external drive to the folder on your C drive where Access expects to find them.
 However, I can't tell what that folder is since its in your Access database.

 Access expects to find them. However, I can't tell what that folder is since its in your Access database.

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done that.&nbsp; I copied the files from my F drive to my C drive.&nbsp; Is it possible that a command in the Microsoft Access database has been deleted that would stop the files to be updated?&nbsp; If so, do you know if this can be rectified?&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp;
 Thanks.</p>

            <p>Again, Access expects those files to be in a certain folder. But I can't tell you what that folder is. It is somewhere within the app. But I can't tell if its in your code or a linked file or what. I would first check Linked Table Manager and if they aren't
 listed there, then its somewhere in your code.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The speed dial concept is a little different in WP8. You will not be able to dial anything from 0-9 and call a person directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, from the People Hub, you can "Pin" a contact to the start screen and from there, you can just open that contact quickly and place a call/message.</p>

            Hi Jef,<br />
<br />
If your customer is not an admin, it's expected behavior that he see the message "Notification settings aren't available right now", for the Notifications setting is only available for admins.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d338510c-d07a-4777-9de8-dfffed129fd4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d338510c-d07a-4777-9de8-dfffed129fd4" /></a><br />
<br />
If he is an admin and encounter the message in Office 365 Settings page, please check if he have the Exchange Online license. If so, he needs to go to
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa</a> to set up the mailbox, for Notifications works with the Exchange Online license. When users receive emails, they will get notifications.
<br />
<br />
If this is not his scenario, please provide detailed steps and related screenshots about how he encounters the issue.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

<h2>            MS Project 2010&#58; Missing resources when running visual resource reports from linked schedules</h2>
                    <p>We are using a master summary schedule that has about 25 projects linked into it. When running visual resource reports from the summary schedue (yes, I did have all tasks expanded in the summary schedule) the resulting pivot table in excel is missing resources
 from some projects. Also, when reviewing resources in the resource usage view it shows multiple lines for the same resources, even when I group the resources by name (which&nbsp; usually consolidated the resources from the individual projects.</p>
<p>The resource reports are unreliable and I cannot use a master resource pool since this causes project to crash over and over again. What other fixes besides buying and migrating to Project Serves (which we do not have the funding to do) are there to get
 this to run accurate reports?</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            Axel,
<div>First, let's check some basic things. Do you have the latest updates installed (i.e. SP1 and cumulative updates)? If not, go to,&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ee748587, download and install them. Ignore the misleading "guidance" that the updates
 are for Project Server. They apply to all versions of Project.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Are your resources contained in the master or in each individual subproject file? Note: you do not need a separate resource pool file, you can have all the resources in the master, if you want.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fact that attempting to create a resource pool causes Project to crash may be indicative of file corruption. First unlink all subproject from the master. Then save each of the subprojects as XML and then re-open each one. Finally rebuild the master.
 Does it work now?</div>

<h2>            Windows Phone Error 80070002 Answers</h2>
                    If you have had an error problem with your Nokia Windows Phone while playing music:
<b>error 80070002</b>, I think I found the solution.&nbsp; It bothered me like crazy, and I couldn't find any answers on what was wrong and how to fix on the net and the Microsoft Community.&nbsp; But, I think I have found out the problem.&nbsp; The problem (for me) was that
 the files that would not play and showed the error were files that I had renamed while in the windows phone music folder.&nbsp; I do not have a sd card, and I was dragging music from my computer to the phone, and I may have renamed the file, such as taking out
 the track number or adding the artist name.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So therefore, I had to end up deleting those music files in the windows phone folder, as well as on the windows phone to make sure it is not duplicated on the phone.&nbsp; Then I re-dragged the file, as is.&nbsp; Do not rename.&nbsp; I have not had a problem since.
<br />
<br />
FYI, make sure your file extensions are mp3.&nbsp; If you use itunes, they are initially m4a.&nbsp; You would have to convert them to mp3.&nbsp; The windows phone may not play protected files with m4a extensions.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.&nbsp; <br />

    <title>&#34;Cannot save the attachment&#34; error from Outlook 2007. File IS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;Cannot save the attachment&#34; error from Outlook 2007. File IS written, but, with Zero bytes.</h2>
                    
<p>A number of people in the same office, having the same problem. They all have Office 2007. They open an attachment, or right-click on the attachment, and get the error. Then, they have looked at where they were saving the file, and find a Zero byte file.&nbsp;
 This just started around the time that McAfee sent the bad definition file. They had thought it had something to do with that.&nbsp; I told them, if the McAfee problem would have affected them, it would have been trouble getting on their computer, not just saving
 an attachment.</p>
<p>I even checked whether it was the Outlook Temporary Folder 99 plus, file problem (on one of the pcs).&nbsp; I found the Hidden Temporary folder. There were Alot of files there, but none beyond 4 (on the count). Got rid of them anyway. Still same problem.</p>
<p>Just looking thru the e-mail again. Seems to be the problem when they are saving to a Network drive, but, when they save to the local C, it seems to be ok. They have the same Network access they had before, unless, maybe a recent MS Patch has changed something?</p>

<h2>            Outlook stuck &#34;synchronizing&#34;</h2>
                    Outlook problem: I have Office Home &amp; Business 2016 running with Windows 10.&nbsp; When I start Outlook the send/receive function doesn't seem to complete, although it does download my emails.&nbsp; The "synchronizing" status bar doesn't go away.&nbsp; Then when I delete
 an email. for example, it seems to get stuck "synchronizing trash."&nbsp; Or if I send an email, it gets stuck "synchronizing sent" items.&nbsp; I have to close it and restart to be able to receive any new emails.&nbsp; It has also gotten into a Not Responding state, in
 which case I have to reboot the computer in order for it to work again.&nbsp; If I close and try to restart I get an error message, but I haven't been able to recreate that scenario today.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate some guidance.<br />

            <p>Because the Enterprise edition is downloaded through the TechNet evaluation center, its possible it might be using the Akamai download manager. Even though both the Technical Preview and the Technical Preview for Enterprise are hosted on Microsoft properties,
 they are actually probably distributed through different server. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only differences in the Enterprise version are the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* DirectAccess: Give mobile users seamless access to corporate networks without a need to VPN.</p>
<p>* BranchCache: Decrease the time branch office users spend waiting to download files across the network.</p>
<p>* Federated Search: Find information in remote repositories, including SharePoint sites, with a simple user interface.</p>
<p>* BitLocker and BitLocker To Go: Help protect data on PCs and removable drives, with manageability to enforce encryption and backup of recovery keys.</p>
<p>* AppLocker: Specify what software is allowed to run on a user’s PCs through centrally managed but flexible Group Policies.</p>
<p>* Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) optimizations: Improved user experience for VDI with multimon and microphone support, which have the ability to reuse virtual hard drive (VHD) images to boot a physical PC.</p>
<p>* Multilingual user interface: Create a single OS image for deployment to users worldwide.</p>
<p>* Networ Boot License, VDI start of virtual discs</p>
<p>* 4 Virtual Operating Systems</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Subsystem fo UNIX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of these additional capabilities will require access to a Windows Server.

<h2>            active sync puts all calendar entries into the current half hour</h2>
                    All was working ok up until two weeks ago. I have not done anything differently.<br />
On my desktop my HTC touch diamond 2 - all syncs OK<br />
On my laptop - it syncs OK with the Contacts but it now puts hundreds of blank appoinments into the half hour time slot that I attempt the sync. and does not update any calendar items at all. It goes through the process and tells me it is syncing but doesn't.<br />
<br />
Any clues?????

            One of the suggestions was to erase the data from my device then sync. This was not an option for me as I been using the phone and had 5 weeks of updates that I wasn't prepared to lose.<br />
My solution was to have it all done via a remote server. I now have something that works.<br />
Not as I would like but it works.&nbsp;
