<h2>            Save As Prompt doesn&#39;t prompt you if it is going to overwrite a file</h2>
                    <p>When using the Save As in Windows 7 64b Home Premium there is no prompt to prevent overwriting an existing file. This problem has been tested on two different computer installs. To Test create a&nbsp;document in Word and Save it. Now create a completely new document
 and select Save As, select the original&nbsp;document file name and the file will be over written without any warning prompt. Trying the same in Windows XP there is a warning prompt.</p>
<p>How can the Windows 7 prompt be activated???&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Windows 7 does not control this action&nbsp;using Word. It is a function of Word.</p>
<p>If you create a document in Word and save it, then attempt to save the same open document with Save As with the same name, it will treat it a just Save with no overwrite prompt.</p>
<p>If you close the document, then create a new document and use Save As&nbsp;to save it to the same name as the document previously saved, it will give you an overwrite prompt.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Slow Upload Speed with newest update.....</h2>
                    
<p>I normally have no problems with my xbox live connection since i bought this console on day one...I am on wireless and my service is 60 mbps down/5 up.....i have noticed since I got the 1409 preview (WHICH IS NOW LIVE for all, hence
 why im now posting in here)...my upload speed is only around 1mbps...download still at 60....also, my wireless strength is now 20% less than my normal 90-95%....When I change from my 5ghz network to 2,4ghz network it goes back to normal, yet my upload speed
 still remains only 1mbps or even slgihtly less.....anyone else seeing this? &nbsp;help?</p>

<p>Something you could try is hard booting the console. Hold down the power button on the console for 10ish seconds the console will completely turn off. Not just go into standby, once you've done that pull the power cable for a full 30 seconds. After 30 seconds
 plug it back in and see if it changes at all. If it doesn't you may also want to try pulling the power cable for 30 seconds from your wireless router as well as they will sometimes nee to be reset.</p>

<p>I am also having trouble with my upload speed, playing games is now prob but if i try to upload clips or stream a game in twitch it has a lot of trouble doing so. i ran speed test in the xbox one settings and it shows me 0.6 upload speed. i have tried many
 things to improve this but all fails, this kinda makes upload studio and twitch pointless for me to use. sure i can watch other peoples vids but i would also like to show mine as well.

<p><br />
With all of that information (thank you) I have a suggestion for you...</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Using a relatively thick piece of cardboard (say from a shoebox), cover the touchpad on your laptop while you type.&nbsp; See if your cursor continues to 'jump around' or if it ceases...</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>You see I do not believe this to be an operating system issue nor a hardware issue, but a function of your body (wrist, thumbs, etc.) touching the laptops touchpad while typing.&nbsp; By covering the touchpad while you type with something that will not allow
 the touchpad to react to you - you will test this theory out.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
It has been the case many times over, will likely be the case many times over and is certainly much more likely than anything suggested so far for a cursor jumping around.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

Given you are not the original poster, how can you be sure their issue is not the touchpad?&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
I have an ASUS Windows 8 tablet and two different Dell's with Windows 8 - haven't seen that issue.&nbsp; I have heard that some touchscreens are more sensitive than they need to be and/or some people touch the screen more than they think they do. heh</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen this problem arise a number of times with Windows 8 and it always appears to effect only laptops, no matter what the make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an ACER laptop that had the same problem with the curser jumping around. I searched the internet for a solution and finally found that in order to resolve the problem, I had to disable the touchpad (Which isn't a problem for me as I use a wireless
 mouse 99.9% of the time). The reason given was that even vibration from typing could cause the curser to jump around.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used three different&nbsp;operating systems&nbsp;on my ACER and the problem only arose when I installed the full version of Windows 8. Even more curious is the fact that&nbsp;this problem&nbsp;DID NOT manifest itself when I used the beta version of windows 8!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, to disable the touchpad on the ACER press Fn + F6&nbsp;OR F7 key. On my model of Acer, it was the Fn +F7 key that worked for me. This sequence of keys may work on other makes of Laptops but I don't know for sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I pressed Fn + F6 keys, my screen went black. I got it back again by pressing the same two keys. I then tried the F7 combination. It worked and I have had no problems with cursor jumping whilst writing this script or with any other mediums that require
 me to type since using the Fn + F7 combination to disable the touchpad.</p>
        </p>

            Hi OBray,
<div>With reference to my post on July 2nd. Since disabling the touchpad as described in that post, I have had no further problems with the curser jumping around whilst I type.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>From what other people have posted, the problem does indeed appear to be linked to the touchpad of laptops. It does not appear to be restricted to any particular make. Microsoft need to get this Windows 8 problem sorted. It is probably the most annoying
 glitch I have encountered and like you, it was driving me crazy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as my laptop is concerned, the problem is obviously now resolved.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Check your laptop instructions on how to temporarily disable your touchpad and see if it works. It may be the same key sequence as for Acer.</div>
<div>
<div><br />

                    My AVG program comes up showing this error in the registry. It doesn't seem likely but is this a true error? I keep getting references to different errors listed as 32:HKEY_........ I know of no such registry listing, this may be an AVG problem. Thanks

<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)

<br />Expand the network Adapters section

            Hi Dean,
<br />
<br />It sounds like your hardware (well, your onboard wireless that is) probably doesn't support it and it's been on 2.4 GHz wireless until up to this point. The most elegant solution I could think of is to get an external wireless USB adapter, like this one: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NET-DYN-Wireless-Adapter-150Mbps-Internet/dp/B01CBZRY78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/NET-DYN-Wireless-Adapter...</a>
<br />
<br />Of course, you should do your research in looking at different adapters and see which one best fits your lifestyle.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need any help with that or have any additional concerns like if you believe you already have 5 GHz wireless, but I hope this helps.

<h2>            How to Change the Priorty sequence of the Network Adapters in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>As I attempt to connect to the internet using Windows 10,&nbsp; the computer checks for the adapter which will allow me to connect to the network.</p>
<p>The Ethernet adapter icon appears first before the Wifi adapter&nbsp; which makes a successful connection with the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the ethernet adapter appears first in the " Network settings change adapter panel," ethernet adapter access is checked first.and the checks the wifi adapter which successfully connects to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ethernet adapter is disabled and no network cable is attached to the laptop.</p>
<p>The wifi adapter appears next in the sequence and is enabled. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The default network access is set to connect automatically</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how to change the sequence of the adapters so that it checks wifi first before it is connected to the internet</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            SMS messages</h2>
                    Why is skype not sending my SMS messages to Romania ? Also why are those messages to Romania, sent from 12th October onwards, that have been&nbsp; arriving, delivered&nbsp; under different numbers some from&nbsp; "notify" some from 1765 or 1836 or&nbsp;0748414885<br />
&nbsp;0752703755,or 0752649940. Frankly Skype this is one for you I do not expect the |Community to answer such technical or operational questions and you should not rely on it either. Access to Skype Support invariably diverts one to the Community which is not
 good enough. Time to take responsibility for your own mess ups, don't you think

<p><span><span>&nbsp;There is no error message with these failed sms&nbsp; the only reason I know they have failed is that 1. There is no green tick on the fone icon in skype and 2, my friend say they don’t
 have them. Hoever the earlier reply suggesting I opt for contact ID in my Account seems to have solved the problem, what I don’t understand is how the settings got changed in the first place, which must have happened because it has worked perfectly for years.

    <title>Wired computer disappeared from my home network. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m rick y  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wired computer disappeared from my home network.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">My main computer - wired only, no wifi, just got an upgrade to win 10. Vanilla home built machine, Gigabyte MB, Sata drive, 4GB RAM, boring. Been playing nicely with other devices until now.
<br />
<br />
Wireless bits in my house consist of 2 win10 laptops, 1 win10 desktop, 1 win7 netbook, 1 win98 laptop, 2 roku streaming devices, a smart Blu Ray payer, and a wireless Epson printer/scanner/copier. They all work just as they used to, pre-upgrade.<br />
<br />
Prior to upgrade all devices saw all other devices. I performed backups to the other desktop HD, streamed music to the Roku music player, and printed from the wired device. Post upgrade, I can no longer see any of the wireless devices in the network window
 and wireless devices can no longer see the wired machine. I am assuming the issue is with the wired computer, as everything was working prior to that particular upgrade. Also note: the wired computer sees the internet perfectly. I'm keying this note on it.<br />
<br />
Steps taken:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
- Yes, I turned the modem/router off and on. About 20 times.<br />
- And yes, I did the same to the computer.<br />
- I found some blog somewhere that had me go into services and change a few from manual to automatic. This was a no go.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- I updated the driver for my network interface to the latest win10 driver.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- Yes, I rebooted everything after that.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- As I cannot print, I figured I'd hard wire to the printer, which is stand alone across the room. USB works great.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- The Win7 netbook won't take an upgrade (1GB RAM I figure). It cannot see the wired computer, though it used to.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- The Windows Facebook page (a beautiful, happy place filled with color and magic and lovely sparkly ads that have convinced me I made the correct choice in upgrading) didn't like the tone of the post I left there but cheerfully
 sent me a link to a thread on this site, where the problem was a laptop with a network driver incompatibility. Thank god for Facebook bots. At least it got "network" right.<br />
<br />
After an hour and a half on the phone with a level 1 guy (did you unplug then plug in the modem? Did you unplug then plug in the PC? Okay good. But did you unplug then plug in the modem?) I had to give up and put my kids to bed. I am, frankly, too terrified
 to go through that again.<br />
<br />
So there I am. Yay.</p>

            <p>Hello Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are facing this issue even after trying the above mentioned troubleshooting steps, I request you to contact the manufacturer of the router and reset it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you reset the router, reconfigure the connections and check if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us with the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have any further queries, feel free to contact us. We will be happy to help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for this very useful advice, Amit. I will reset the router for the 21st...I don't know, could be the 25th time. Did I not mention that? What I did not mention was there was a tech on the other end of my phone from support team that handles my modem/router.
 I was having so much trouble getting through to Microsoft I took the alternate route.
<br />
<br />
Anyway, that idea certainly shows promise of fixing my issue, which I must assume was almost certainly not the result of the Windows 10 upgrade.<br />
<br />
You can be assured that after I perform this always-effective task, I will reboot my computer. Do you recommend a reboot, or a full power-down and restart? I have only done these things 6-7 times each, but you never know. Maybe it's a time zone thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm particularly pleased to see that you took the time to note this connection was preexisting and fully functional prior to the upgrade. I'm not a tech support person, but I have to assume this must mean that Windows 10 made configuration changes in my
 router. Less probable yet still possible is that the Windows 10 upgrade swapped out the hardware completely. So I will follow this logic and make absolutely certain that both the physical and logical hardware changes made to my router by the Windows 10 upgrade
 aren't the cause of my issue before coming back to tell you that resetting the router didn't help at all. I will make sure that I have a technical support professional on the phone to tell me how to hit the reset button, and how to unplug then re-plug the
 router into an electrical socket, a router which in it's current configuration automatically connected to and served data - internal network and Internet - to 3 other Windows 10 devices in the house with no issues, thus my assumption this particular upgrade
 and the wired nature of the connection are the root cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your diligence and support. I'll get right back to you. I will go out on a limb and tell you in advance that it is rather unlikely that resetting my router had no demonstrable positive effect. Also, this may take several hours. Tech
 support hold times and all that. You know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Hey - Here's a real possible troubleshooting tip that I might add: I have not (silly me) plugged a Windows 10 upgraded laptop, currently working normally wireless, into a port on the router. It suddenly seems to me that isolating the router as an issue might
 be possible that way. The best part is I don't have to turn it on and off another 21 times to perform this testing task. Sorry I thought of this so late in the game. I was seeking technical support. I didn't expect to troubleshoot this alone.</p>

            <p>Given I have nothing but time on my hands, I actually contacted the technical people responsible for supporting my router. As miracles do occur, it was my internet provider, a little company called Telus. They're Canadian. So they're nice.<br />
<br />
They are little different, otherwise, from Microsoft's Windows 10 support line guys. They have no idea what they're doing. They are untrained. The are fast to say yes, I understand, I am very sorry you're having this problem. Let's work to see if we can solve
 this for you," and they say it in English that I can occasionally understand.<br />
<br />
After a 45 minute wait for a live agent, I got "Steve." I think it was "Steve," because his accent was so incredibly thick I couldn't really tell. It might have been "Mike" or "Agamemnon," I wouldn't have been able to tell. It took me five minutes to get him
 to understand that I couldn't understand a word he was saying, and to transfer me to another agent. Naturally, once he understood, he apologized profusely (I think he was apologizing) then immediately stuck me back in queue. Another twenty minutes of my life
 gone.<br />
<br />
Next was "Wendy." She was sharp, clearly spoken, and had no clue whatsoever what I was trying to describe. Here's an actual excerpt from the conversation:<br />
<br />
ME: "My wired computer - I have one wired computer - is no longer visible to my wireless devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WENDY: "Of course not. It's not wireless."</p>
<p>
</p><p>ME: "..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it went. She finally got it, and by god, she did it. Took her a zeptosecond: "Okay, I need you to reset the router."<br />
<br />
So I did. ANd you'll never believe what happened!<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
And so it went. Seconds turned to minutes, then to a little under an hour, at which point I was explaining to her (for the third or fourth time) that I had just "upgraded" to Windows 10. "Oh?" she asked. "When?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I told her. "Well," she asserted, "we don't support Windows 10, only your internet services. You need to contact..."<br />
<br />
And that was it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I died. Yes, sadly, I passed away right at that moment. I think the strain was too much for me heart to bear. It was a nice funeral, I guess. My family misses me terribly.<br />
<br />
No, not really, but I hung up on her and was getting ready to contact you bloody idiots the next day, when I encountered a friend, Robert, who is an IT tech support guy at his work. He came by, had a beer, got into my configuration, made a change or two, and
 everything works now. He didn't tell me what he did, and I wasn't about to ask. What I WAS made aware of is this:<br />
<br />
Microsoft's technical support is process based garbage, staffed by untrained kids with little or no ability to perform the task of supporting customers. They are the cheapest and least effective path toward "customer service," intended to assure folks that
 an average hold time of 10 minutes or less is worth it to achieve a failure to solve the issue, meaning a time to handle of (effectively) zero. As there is no concern about customer retention, there is no need for customer service, and this farce can go on
 and on. My provider, Telus, is in exactly the same boat. So are most companies involved in technology.<br />
<br />
I am led to this conclusion by watching my friend Robert. His job depends open effective, efficient repair of computer issues. He sat at my computer for no more than five minutes, rebooted, problem solved. I have spent several hours on the phone with Microsoft
 and a few weeks looking for answers, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been an exercise of asinine imbecility at it's finest and most publicly traded. It is not the first. Until I finally bite the bullet and buy some Mac stuff (stuff that works), I will be made to think it is my fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks, Microsoft, for once again wasting my time. Thank you for assigning perfectly fine, kind, normal people who are incredibly valuable to you for being cheap and plentiful, all the while utterly useless at the jobs you give them to apologize to me
 profusely while not fixing anything at all. Wouldn't Microsoft save a lot of money by simply not offering support at all? It's not as if anything actually gets supported, as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Thanks for nothing.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us verify some information so we can properly address the problem with your internet connection. Allow us to ask the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your computer directly wired to a modem/router, or wirelessly connected to a WiFi network?</li><li>Have you tried to restart your computer after the update?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're getting an error that its IP address is missing, let's perform an IP config to verify the exact IP address that your computer is receiving. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <strong>Search</strong> box on the task bar, type in <em>Command prompt</em>.</li><li>Once the option appears, right-click <em>Command prompt</em> and select <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>, then click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt window, type <em>ipconfig/all</em>.</li></ol>
<p>Once you have the result, please take a screenshot and share it here so we can look into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Jjn14,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try removing the GEARAspiWDM entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove the GEARAspiWDM entry double-click UpperFilters and, under Value data,&nbsp;remove GEARAspiWDM &gt; OK</p>
<p>Create a system restore point beforehand and restart the computer after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you have an application that uses the&nbsp;GEARAspiWDM, such as iTunes,&nbsp;just install the latest version of Gear drivers (4.021.1 )&nbsp;and make no change to the registry:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gearsoftware.com/support/drivers.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.gearsoftware.com/support/drivers.php</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating the Gear drivers should also fix the error.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/341fd4b0-c772-4abc-9323-111a11df0d35" title="ChristopherTheodore">
<p>
</p><p>To further investigate, what is your device's operating system and the exact version of Skype you're using? Is the issue with initiating a video call only?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional information will help us resolve the issue. Should you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.
<br />
Thank you!<br />

<p>Thank you for the swift response.&nbsp; Here is the info you requested;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype Version :&nbsp; 7.40.0.151<br />
Device Model:&nbsp; HD 8 (&amp;th Generation)<br />
OS : Fire OS 5&nbsp;<br />
(here is a link that will explain more about the OS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_OS)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that when I use Echo Sound Testing Service everything&nbsp;seems to work fine, I can hear my own voice.&nbsp; When I press the Video Icon on my Kindle Skype app the screen keeps showing my image, then the Skype screen over and over again - I have to
 go back to the Fire Home screen to stop this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I explained this well enough, and thanks in advance for your help,</p>
<p>

<h2>            My console won&#39;t ready any disc - May Update</h2>
                    
<p>I bought my Xbox 360 S console on December,2010, everything was going great until May of this year that i downloaded an update and after that my console had problems reading my discs and my console wasn't modified or anything. I opened my console thinking
 it might be a little dirty inside &nbsp;but i didn't know that if i opened it my warranty would not longer be available so I sent my console to Microsoft for a repair and they didn't do anything to the console because they noticed that i opened it :( so i want
 to know how you guys can help me with this, i herad that Microsoft is sending new consoles to the users that are experiencing this.</p>

<p>You will not be able to get a new console because you Voided the warranty by opening it you will have to buy a new console or send it for a repair which will cost you money.</p>

<p>If he has opened the console, thereby voiding the warranty, Microsoft will not even undertake a paid repair.</p>

<p>Earlier if you created a tag word, the next time you wanted it it was available in the drop down menu but now that is not available. Any setting change happened?</p>

            Tagging files in modern versions of Windows is not as effective as it use to. It seems Microsoft is minimizing the purpose of them due to the fact maybe because a lot of our data is now stored in the cloud. That said, here are some ways you can still tag files in Windows:
