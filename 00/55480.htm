<br />
These may work for you and all may be well. However, in many cases the computer will also be infected with other trojans and protected by a rootkit. These machines are extremely difficult to clean. If your machine is one of these cases, either get guided help
 at one of the specialty forums listed at the link below OR take your machine to a local computer professional OR back up your data and do a clean install of Windows. It is your choice. I don't recommend using BigComputerStore/GeekSquad types of places.<br />

<h2>            BitLocker with MacOS 10.13.4</h2>
                    <p>Within our company we are multi hardware platform to test Microsofts any platform strategy. I am a user of Apples Mac OS High Sierra (10.13.4). With GDPR approaching, we were told to encrypt all external devices - in my case an 8GB USB storage stick from
 Microsoft. Colleagues are using BitLocker to comply. I am now facing two problems:</p>
<p>I am unable to decrypt devices my colleagues have encrypted.</p>
<p>I am unable to encrypt my devices with BitLocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve the situation?</p>

            Yes, I did find it. No, I did not install it. It did not look like trustworthy software to me. Would have preferred an original Microsoft solution. Is it Microsoft certified?

            Microsoft does not have a Mac Bitlocker software. You'd have to find a 3rd party and I have no way of knowing which are trust worthy as I don't use a Mac. I strictly came up with that one via an Internet search so if it is legit or not I couldn't say.<br />

<h2>            asus k46cb ran on to blue screen of death after closing the lid.</h2>
                    <p>hi every one. I had&nbsp;updated my laptop on Monday to win10. it was fine until yesterday when windows had a minor update. now my computer didn't go to sleep. when I close the lid or put it un sleep from the stat menu pop up it ran on to blu screen with an :-(
 smiley that said windows is ran on to a problem and collecting data for restart. I have to press power button for 10 seconds and shut down manually.</p>
<p>also when I press shut down button from start pop up the screen is going to turn of but the power button light remains on until I press the power button for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>I think it is not a human way to turn off my computer. it seems medieval and nothing had fixed my problem. my video card is updated (I updated manually the first night because it didn't shut down at all) and also I did the control panel- power options way.</p>

<h2>            Major connectivity and stability issues &#40;WiFi&#47;LAN&#47;core Windows Services&#41; after migrating from Threshold 1 to 2 &#40;1511 update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to share my detailed experiences with you all with (trying) installing the latest Windows 10 - 1511 update on my 2011 XPS17 - L702X 2nd gen core i7 / 16 Gb / HDD+SSD equipped notebook.
</p>
<p>Perhaps someone can help out and has a clue, or, if more people&nbsp;experience the same issue,&nbsp;we can try to work together to resolve it.</p>
<p>Although I also had my share of issues with migrating my XPS17 from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro initially a couple of weeks ago, I was extremely satisfied with the result. I simply loved Windows 10 right from the start (in spite of the issues that I
 was able to resolve by uninstalling a number of apps and especially Cisco VPN Clients and an outdated version of the holy grail of backup apps, Macrium Reflect, in the original Windows 7 x64 Ultimate version first.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the same cannot be said about the fall update (1511) that has kept me busy for the last&nbsp;3 days already....</p>
<p>In spite of different attempts (mimicing the steps that I took in Windows 7 before migrating to 10), the result is simply unusable and seemingly cannot be fixed in the 1511 environment itself, so for now I've decided to restore my backup and defer the WIndows
 10 - 1511 update until further notice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm encountering major issues with multiple system Services no longer starting and all kinds of WiFi/LAN issues.</p>
<p>Perhaps this rings a bell with someone (or prevents you from running into the same problems that I had), so please find all the - sometimes unstructured - details of my endeavours below. Please note that I decided to cut and paste the info that I shared
 on another website which is related to getting the Cisco VPN 5.x Client to work under Windows 10 (using SonicWall or ShrewSoft&nbsp;VPN Clients. In&nbsp;my case, the latter works like a charm in Windows 10.).</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">IMHO, as an IT professional and long term Windows user, I've tried just about everything to try and stabilize the result, all to no avail and in spite of 3 different attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</span></span><span><a href="http://itthatshouldjustwork.blogspot.nl/2015/07/cisco-64-bit-vpn-client-on-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://itthatshouldjustwork.blogspot.nl/2015/07/cisco-64-bit-vpn-client-on-windows-10.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 for the background)</span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It still works after the migration to the 1511 "November Update" version of Windows 10.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, I'm experiencing a plethora of stability and connectivity issues after the 1511 update that I did not have in the previous version:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- Multiple services like Security Center, Windows Audio Service, Windows Connection Manager, Windows Event Log Manager not starting and need to be started manually</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- Initially (after a cold restart), nothing works in terms of WiFi or LAN. Only after fooling around a lot with trying to restart the mentioned services, resetting ProSet wireless etc. I could get it back to work (until the next restart)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- Intel ProSet connection for my 7260 AC Intel WiFi card shows I'm connected but Windows Connection Manager shows no connections.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- Audio Service (even after having been started) stops automatically after a while
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- After restarting, the problems are back.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- Uninstalling/reinstalling Intel ProSet Wireless&nbsp;(or disabling it in favour of the Windows Connection Manager) does not fix the issue or improve behaviour.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I have successfully upgraded a couple of other laptops and PC's to the 1511 update without ANY issues, so this is definitely somehow connected to my XPS17 setup, in which I use a lot of different VPN clients.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please also note that when migrating from Win7 to Win10 (first release) earlier, I also had major issues, and had to uninstall all VPN clients (ShrewSoft, Cisco AnyConnect, FortiClient, but also Macrium Reflect and possibly even VMWare Workstation
 Pro 12 as well since the issues seem to be related to migrating the Virtual Network Adapters of these VPN-providers and the ones associated with VMWare) in Windows 7 BEFORE attempting the 'in place' upgrade to Windows 10. That worked as a charm and yielded
 an extremely stable Windows 10 environment in every aspect (until the 1511 update came about that is...).
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After reinstalling the VPN Clients and VMWare Workstation Pro, all was still well in the initial (Threshold 1) Windows 10 environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Literally everything worked as expected and the system was both extremely fast as well as extremely stable, even when compared to the already earlier Windows 7 x64 version, that was also excellent already.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>My next approach to resolve the issue with the 1511 update will be to revert to Windows 10 (first edition), repeat the same actions that I took when I originally moved from Win7 to Win10 (VPN clients etc. see above) and then hope that the result
 will be better than currently. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep you informed...</span></span></p>

</p><p>
</p><p>============================</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>1511 update very unstable/unuseable even after carefull preparation<span>&nbsp;
</span>(2nd and 3rd attempts).</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After the Windows 10 – 1511 Update (even with the above followed procedure to first delete all VPN Clients and VMWare Workstation in the old Windows 10 environment), the environment behaves very erratically and is highly unstable and
<span>&nbsp;</span>hence <span>&nbsp;</span>simply unuseable.</span></span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>hence <span>&nbsp;</span>simply unuseable.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Symptoms:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>WiFi / LAN not working/not connecting, all kinds of services not being started (being Windows Audio, Windows Connection Manager, Windows Event Log, Security Center)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Services are not started (see below Event Viewer log messages.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Services deactivate automatically (after having been manually started)</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Event Viewer:</span></span></p>
<p><span>The Security Center service terminated unexpectedly.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has done this 7 time(s).</span></p>
<p><span>The Windows Event Log service terminated unexpectedly.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has done this 5 time(s).</span></p>
<p><span>The Windows Connection Manager service terminated unexpectedly.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It has done this 4 time(s).</span></p>
<p><span>The TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper service terminated unexpectedly.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It has done this 4 time(s).</span></p>
<p><span>The Windows Audio service terminated unexpectedly.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has done this 4 time(s).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The first messages (when the service cannot be started) all contain the message<span>&nbsp;
</span>‘The handle is invalid’.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Other checks to ensure all device drivers are OK:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>All drivers are up to date and running properly</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>All Intel ProSet WiFi drivers are up to date (Please note that<span>&nbsp;
</span>these were working perfectly in the existing Wave 1/Threshold 1 original Windows 10 version.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>When trying to manually start the ‘ Security center’<span>&nbsp; </span>
service:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>‘ Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly’. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also., when starting ‘ Security Center’ , it causes the ‘ Windows Event Log’<span>&nbsp;
</span>service to become deactivated.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows Connection Manager shows:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>‘ Not connected – No connections are available’<span>&nbsp; </span>although (with a lot of fussing around) the Intel Proset wireless does show that it is connected.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>After waiting for 5 minutes or more, seemingly out-of-the-blue it has become possible to start the ‘ Security Center’<span>&nbsp;
</span>service again, only for it to become stopped again after a while again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Last minute update 19/11/2015:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also tried.installing the cumulative update for Windows 10 here:</span></span></p>

</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>CONCLUSION FOR NOW (19/11/2015):<br />
Do NOT use 1511 update since it cripples my perfectly working Windows 10 (Threshold 1/Wave 1)

<span>&nbsp;</span>envirionment !</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The previous (original) Windows 10 version simply works perfectly, so I’ve reverted to that and deferred the 1511 update until further notice, this has been way too time-consuming anyway.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Possible next steps (when I feel like having a new go at this, for now I'm really fed up with all the time it cost me to go through this 1511 update):</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- </span></span><span>post </span><span><a href="http://itthatshouldjustwork.blogspot.nl/2015/07/cisco-64-bit-vpn-client-on-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://itthatshouldjustwork.blogspot.nl/2015/07/cisco-64-bit-vpn-client-on-windows-10.html</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;
 - as of today - mentions issues with the 1511 update as well. So perhaps more information will come available as time progresses, and it will be able to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>UPDATE March 7, 2016:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Good news: I've finally been able to SOLVE the issue with not being able to stabilize my XPS17/L702X using the 1511/10586 update !</span></p>
<p><span>Initially, after giving it yet another try,&nbsp;I had the same problems as in november:</span></p>
<p>- Security Center, Windows Audio Service, Windows Connection Manager, Windows Event Log Manager services not starting automatically.
</p>
<p><span>- When manually starting all but the 'Security Center' service, this would work out. However, when trying to start Security Center, it would produce an error, and would also stop the other services again for some strange reason.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After finding the EXACT same symptoms, I tried to take some more swings at the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Not sure which one exactly did the trick, but I think it is related to the 'Security Center' service failing.</span></p>
<p><span>My guess is that Attempt 5 (Reset default settings) or Attempt 6 must have done the trick, but I'm not completely sure.</span></p>

<p>(See <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-security-center-service-cant-be-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-security-center-service-cant-be-started</a> for some of the steps that one can take to resolve issues with the 'Security Center' service, and which I ran through below)
<br />
</p>
<p>Attempt 1: Run 'sfc.exe /scannow' in elevated Command Prompt&nbsp; (Result: No inconsistencies found !)<br />
</p>
<p>Attempt 2: Turn off 'Security Center'&nbsp; (Set to 'Disabled' temporarily. That seems to stabilize things a bit, but I would really also like to enable the 'Security Center' service as well, so decided to continue the quest.....)<br />
</p>
<p>Attempt 3: Applied Microsoft FixIt20084 (Did not work / Did not improve behaviour)<br />
</p>
<p>Attempt 4: Checked WMI Instrumention (is consistent, no need to repair !)<br />
</p>
<p>Attempt 5: Windows Firewall =&gt; Reset default settings.<br />
</p>
<p>Attempt 6: Attempted this: <a href="http://support.eset.com/kb217/?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.eset.com/kb217/?locale=en_US&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Reset Windows Security) in C:\Windows\System32\wbem renamed 'repository' to 'rep.old', the restart machine.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After checking all mentioned services again (which were all successfully started) after the restart of the system:</strong></p>
<p><strong>=&gt; SUCCESSFULL,&nbsp;I'M NOW ON Version 1511 / Build 10586.122&nbsp;!</strong><br />
<strong>=&gt; Changed back 'Security Center' to 'Delayed start' and rebooted system once more&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>=&gt; SO FAR SO GOOD, EVERYTHING IS WORKING, including 'Security Center' service&nbsp;!</strong></p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(Additional notes:</p>
<p>Maybe too far fetched and probably NOT related, but I also took the following actions BEFORE attempting the migration to 1511 once more. Please note that I don't think these were related, because I initially ended up with the same problems as before AFTER
 the 1511 update, even after taking these actions:</p>
<p>- Upgrade VMWare Workstation Pro to the very latest version&nbsp; (12.1.0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Removed older version of Macrium Reflect Server Edition (replaced by the latest FREE edition, no need to use Server Edition anyway...)</p>
<p>- Remove Juniper VPN (including some of the traces in the file system in C:\Program Files (x86)\Juniper Networks after having uninstalled all related programs through Add/Remove Programs / Apps))</p>

            <p>I also had issues after upgrading to Threshold 2 (1511). The LAN connection was up but no IP was given. I had similar problems with upgrading server 2016 to TP3 last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution for me is to delete all Virtual Switches in the Hyper-V manager with the LAN NIC configured.</p>
<p>After this deleted all the virtual Hyper-V nics and the LAN NIC from Device management.</p>
<p>Restart and re-create the Hyper-V virtual switches and everything works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Small note: IP configuration is gone in for your VMs if you delete the switches without backing up.</p>

            <p>Hi Nils,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, thanks for the feedback and the tips.</p>
<p>I'm personally using VMWare Workstation Pro 12 for all my VM's (long term favorite).</p>
<p>Thing is that I actually removed all VMWare Virtual Network adapters before migrating to 1511 (been there done that during the original Win7 to Win10 upgrade :-)....).&nbsp; Unfortunately this didn't stop 1511 to completely mess up my system....</p>
<p>Also removed any unneccesary (hidden) Network devices through Device Manager beforehand, but that didn't make a difference either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow though, my gut feeling keeps telling me this issue definitely is related to network connectivity settings (just like this proved to be the culprit the first time around with the Cisco VPN's and an outdated Macrium Reflect version in the original
 Win7 to blame...), however can't put my finger upon it just yet, but I will....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've saved a snapshot/copy of the corrupted 1511 update, so I can restore and try to apply some more possible solutions later on.&nbsp; Possibly I wil try again upon the next major update release&nbsp;(Summer 2016 ?)</p>
<p>Hence for now, for productivity reasons and daily professional use, I am sticking to the original Threshold1 Win10 x64 Pro that has made me such a happy-the-peppy guy a while back :-)).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be even happier to be able to use that new possibility to have that nice easily maintainable list of individual environment variables e.g. when updating the PATH environment variable, which has been added to 1511. To me this proves that Microsoft
 is also seriously spending a lot of effort on making power-users and developers happy with such under-the-hood improvements that the majority of regular end-users simply wouldn't care about because they never need it...</p>
<p>And how about that new possibility to Cut/Copy and Paste in the Command windows (cmd.exe), I can already use that in Threshold 1 of course, great work MS, this is surely the best Windows in many years&nbsp;!</p>

            <p>Recently (late December) I upgraded my Dell laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10 pro and have had nothing but problems since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same issues described above, multiple services crashing... &nbsp;Security Center service, Event Log service, Windows audio service, TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper service, DHCP client service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After days of testing and messing around, I have narrowed down the problem to the Security Center service. &nbsp;IF I set the Security Center service to "disabled", then everything runs fine and there are no Errors in Event Viewer for services "terminating unexpectedly".
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I click on start for the Security Center service, it crashes with the following dialog:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows could not start the Security Center service on Local Computer. &nbsp;Error 1067: &nbsp;The process terminated unexpectedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, all of the other services mentioned above also terminate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled/uninstalled all antivirus programs (including Windows Defender) with no effect.</p>

            <p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your contribution.</p>
<p>This looks all too similar, and resembles the issues I had when moving from the original (and highly stable to this day) Windows 10&nbsp;(July 2015)&nbsp;10240 build to the 10586 build ("November update" aka 1511 aka Threshold 2 aka TH2).</p>
<p>Now the waiting is on the Redstone release series for 2016, which is expected to comprise of 2 major releases.</p>
<p>Me personally, I'll settle to using the excellent original 10240 build, and wait for one or two iterations before trying again (have better things to do...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also see </p>
<p>- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10 </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>- http://www.techtimes.com/articles/123273/20160112/windows-10-new-mobile-build-available-now-as-microsoft-prepares-to-release-windows-10-redstone-insider-update.htm for more details.</p>
<p>(Note: To check which version/build you're currently using, invoke 'winver' from the search option or the command prompt.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike, I&nbsp;realize that&nbsp;this is all relatively time consuming (please create a full image of your Windows-partition using e.g. Macrium Reflect before a new attempt !), but in order to make the move from Win7 to Win10, may I suggest to attempt restoring your
 Win7 (providing you have an image to restore and this still is a viable option) and&nbsp;update again to build 10240 ?&nbsp;&nbsp;(Which has worked out perfectly fine on my XPS17).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>See download paths for the original 10240 build here: &nbsp;https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3ee1gx/windows_10_10240_esd_download_here/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional note: Unless you have used 'Disk cleanup' already and have removed your old Windows 7 environment already,&nbsp; within the time frame of 30 days, you have the possibility to revert to your old Windows 7&nbsp; (which is secured in the windows.old folder)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will hopefully enable you to make the move to a stable Win10 environment &amp;&nbsp;secure the free update to Win10.</p>
<p>(Which probably is secured already because Microsoft already stored your 'hardware fingerprint' after the initial Win10 installation and activation, which will also guarantee that Windows activiation will be successfull, even with a new fresh/virgin install
 of Win10 on this machine.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can then deal with moving to yet another newer (hopefully more stable) build later on.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to let you know that I had highly similar (if not <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
exactly </span>similar) symptoms as you, but I was now finally able to resolve the issue over the weekend !</p>
<p>Can you apply Attempts 5 and 6&nbsp;(mentioned in&nbsp;my March 7 2016 update above) and let us know if that flies ?</p>
<p>I emphasize that ALL services (including 'Security Center') are now up-and-running and stay like that.</p>
<p>There are no more event log entries either for Unexpectedly terminated services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good thing to know especially was that I was able to resolve the issue AFTER migrating to 1511/10586.122, and that there are no mandatory precautions to be taken before migrating to the new build&nbsp; (Like the problem surrounding the old Cisco VPN 5.x client
 which had to be removed BEFORE migrating to any version of Windows 10 !).</p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp;GEN3RIC81,</p><p><br /></p><p>You can earn Xbox Live Rewards Credit in two ways:
  </p>
<p>1. By finishing the offers located on the MyMissions page at <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/</a> .
  </p>
<p>-or-
  </p>
<p>2. For non-offer purchases, you can earn Credits by earning a one star MyVIP level through purchasing at least $300 USD or regional equivalent of eligible content. After you receive your first star you will begin to earn a percentage of your eligible purchases back as MyVIP payback Rewards Credit. Pre-orders, in-game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for MyVIP.
  </p>
<p>In September 2014 we changed to the MyVIP policy. As a result, payback based off Gamerscore (MyAchievements) was discontinued. Also, as mentioned in our pinned announcement at the top of the forums titled "<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/2f5ffacb-bf1e-4fca-8764-f57f69556e55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HEY YOU! We've got your answer here.</a>" (<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/2f5ffacb-bf1e-4fca-8764-f57f69556e55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/2f5ffacb-bf1e-4fca-8764-f57f69556e55</a>), we no longer award Credits for Xbox Live Gold renewals as of July 2014.
  </p>
<p>MyVIP had a recalibration for the last few years. At the end of the year, we place you in your MyVIP rank for the new year based off your eligible spending from the previous year, and set your progress to the default state. This happened in September 2015 and December 2016. We did not recalibrate this year (December 2017). Since you are a zero star member, you do not get payback Credits on your purchases. You can check your current MyVIP level/progress at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>I am getting this same problem after booting Windows 8 for the second time. Yesterday I was able to use Windows 8 without a problem, but after starting up my computer this morning I get the blue screen of death with the unhappy face. I upgraded from&nbsp;a download
 I bought via the microsoft website. On another forum I read the the problem might be ASUS Ai charger, but I have already been able to boot Windows 8 with it installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My notebook is an ASUS N76 with 6 GB of ram and 500HDD and an Ivy Bridge i7 processor.</p>
<p><br />
After the problem I was asked to restore windows, which I allowed and now the screen seems to be stuck with only the ASUS symbol in screen, it has been like this for about 40 minutes now.</p>
<p>Please help, I need my notebook documents fo work</p>
<p><br />
<br />
edit 1<br />
After the restoreing didnt work it started checking disk errors, which it said could take more than an hour. However after 5 minutes it showed a screen saying it didnt find any problems and gave me the same options one would get if starting windows 8 into safe
 boot (troubleshoot, exit, refresh&nbsp;PC and reset PC. It did ask for my login information, and after entering this information it didid recognize the info, so this hasn`t gone lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit 2</p>
<p>I just started refreshing my PC via the troubleshoot option. After beeing stuck at 99% for quite a while, Windows restarted and after the messages:&nbsp;preparing, getting devices ready, getting ready, and restarting PC, the screen turned black for a little while&nbsp;and
 then I got a Welcome text. </p>
<p>After that I got my regualr start screen and Windows started up&nbsp;just like normal.</p>
<p>If anyone know how this problem might have been caused please let me know.</p>
<p>(I did clean my registry before shutdown yesterday)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you're still accessing the recycling bin of your laptop. Let's make sure that you open the recycle bin on your external hard disk drive. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open your <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>View</strong> menu and click <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>View</strong> tab.</li><li>Under the <em>Advanced settings</em>, check the <strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>, and then uncheck the
<strong>Hide protected operating system files</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, try checking if you can now access the recycle bin folder on your external hard disk drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Intel Graphics restarts when screen turns off</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 7. I have Toshiba Portege R700-14L laptop.</p>
<p>I didn't had any problem with the screen and graphics in the previous Windows system.</p>
<p>In Windows 10, when screen turns off after some time, Intel HD Graphics turns off too. Then when moving the mouse, the screen becomes black for 10 seconds and then it returns back to Windows but some icons are being invisible for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bit annoying to wait until the graphics responds back, and I didn't had this in Windows 7. Only after upgrading to Windows 10, I had this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also doing that after I'm waking up my laptop from sleeping.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 fails to load Canon Digital Camera &#40;Code 28&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aglindsay03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 fails to load Canon Digital Camera &#40;Code 28&#41;</h2>
                    So I had to wipe my computer and reinstall Windows 7 64bit. My previous OS version (same exact as before) didn't have any problems seeing and interacting with my Canon EOS Rebel T3i camera. After I reinstalled the OS I get a message saying that "The drivers
 for this device are not installed. (Code 28)" but after going to Canons website it says that with windows 7 there are no drivers (maybe this means that windows 7 stock camera drivers are suppose to work?). I've already installed and reinstalled the software
 that came with the camera and I followed the steps exactly from the installation booklet.<br />
<br />
So how could this camera work just fine with my previous OS but when I install the same exact OS again it stops working?<br />

            It is not in the Store any more. I have 2016 version on my Surface Pro 3 which I downloaded from the Store 2 years ago. However, it no longer works. If you go directly to the ESPN website, you can access Watch ESPN and use it on your tablet through the
 website.

<p>I found a way to get the apps back on Windows 10, provided you owned/installed the app once before using the same Microsoft account. Then it should be in your Microsoft Store &gt; My library &gt; All owned. Scroll through the list to find and install it, sort
 by name probably easier. </p>
<p>I just reinstall it today 08/19/2018. It's still working fine, with all current TV service credential login too!</p>

            SO the ESPN app is no longer available in the Microsoft Store and I can't watch ESPN remotely without the app. Awesome. Why is it that the Microsoft Store removes popular apps that the rest of the world uses? This is absurd.

            I don't think it's Microsoft intention to remove the app. It's likely ESPN no longer update and abandon the app, it was built for Windows 8, you can tell from the app interface. It was nice of Microsoft to let the techie user download old app from library,
 which might or might not work properly. You can't blame them.

            As @nguyen2011 pointed out, it's still downloadable if you had it installed before it was pulled from the ms store, just use the same account. I'm using it on Spectrum and surprisingly it still works, especially for an app from 2016.

    <title>Windows 10 Xbox App Input Lag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> navillicious  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Xbox App Input Lag</h2>
                    
<p>Alright, so I'm trying to use the Windows 10 Xbox app so I can chat with my friends using my wireless headset, and also hear the audio from my games, but when I try streaming the console to my laptop/desktop there is input lag. At first I thought that's
 normal considering I'm streaming to my laptop, even though the 1 second delay from console sound to computer output was really annoying. After digging through the internet I found some reports of people saying that they have no input lag whatsoever, so I went
 digging even more to see if there's anything I can do to help reduce the input lag I am receiving, unfortunately nothing online has helped me so far. My internet is pretty good, my desktop&nbsp;is pretty good too&nbsp;so that eliminates it being a hardware issue, thing
 is it happens on both my laptop and desktop and has the same amount of input lag. Does anyone know for sure how I would fix this? I have tried a wired and wireless connection and the results are the same. Or maybe there's a better way for me to get the game

<h2>            Xbox one Network Game Transfer</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was wondering about the Network Game Transfer on Xbox one. I wanted to know if it is only applicable to games that you bought online or does it include games that you bought with a physical disk that you just installed on your Xbox one.</p>

<h2>            Is there a Windows equivalent to the Linux &#34;xkill&#34; command&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On Linux machines, when you open a terminal and type "xkill" into the prompt, your cursor turns into an X, and if you click on the window of a frozen client process, that process is terminated instantly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows, when you get a window that's frozen, you hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete, and the Task Manager may or may not come up, depending on how badly the machine is frozen, then you find the process, right-click and end the process, then Windows freezes and the
 process may end after 30 seconds to a minute, or the machine may freeze up entirely so you have to do a hard restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any command or piece of software that works for Windows that is as effective as the Linux xkill command?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>In Windows 7 use Ctrl+Shift+Esc and not Ctrl+Alt+Del. It's quicker.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Your system&nbsp;may be&nbsp;holding on to Standby memory and not releasing it to
<strong>Free</strong> memory. You can force release by restarting your computer but often this is not very convenient. Another way to force the release of Standby memory is available using RAM Map (freeware from Microsoft):<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Download and install, and create a shortcut on your Desktop to RAMMap and / or pin to your Taskbar. When you sense the system is becoming unresponsive use Ctrl+Shift+Esc to access Task
 Manager. Click the Performance tab and the <strong>Resource Monitor</strong> button. Click the Memory tab and check whether Free is near to Zero or is Zero. If it is, open RAMMap, click Empty on the Menu bar and Empty Standby list. This action instantly restores
 Free memory.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The procedure using RAMMap is an effective workaround but the true solution lies in discovering the source of the problem. Knowing the source you may be able to resolve the problem by
 contacting the provider of the software and / or updating the software. </span></span></p>

            <p>I'm not sure why your reply was marked as an answer. &nbsp;The solutions you suggested, and those suggested by other commenters, all failed to work with the same speed or efficiency as the UNIX version of xkill. &nbsp;Even the version of xkill that's ported for windows
 exhibited freeze-ups of 8 to 10 seconds rather than the instant process kill that I was hoping for. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently there's nothing available for windows that has the same effectiveness as xkill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of you miss the point that it's a kill version with graphical interface (historically
<strong>x</strong> like Unix/OpenVMS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>x Window</strong></a> but the name remained unchanged for later GUIs). It is of use if one does NOT have the PID(s) of the process(es) belonging to a certain window.</p>
<p>Eg. you have 4 IE sessions, each in an own process and one crashes. You see visually which window has crashed, but you have no idea which of the 4 instances to shut down. In this case a graphical tool like xKill comes to the rescue.</p>

    <title>RAGE Disc 2 Update not found - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            RAGE Disc 2 Update not found</h2>
                    
<p>I played throughout the first disc of RAGE no problem, but when it told me to insert disc 2, a message came up saying "This game requires an update, but the update couldn't be found" I had both discs installed to the hard drive like it recommends, then i
 deleted disc 2 to see if that would help. Needles to say it did not, and now I can't continue any further in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I installed the discs by using the normal install under My Games on the dashboard. The game told me to consult the manual on how to install but I rented it from Gamefly and do not have one. I was wondering if the game has its own custom install somewhere,
 but I couldn't find it. Regardless it shouldn't matter for this issue.</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Edit: My Xbox LIVE connection is working fine and is quite fast, no issues there.</p>

<p>Found the answer. Sorry I made this post before checking, but I figured a support page on an error message telling that an update was not found would be titled something like "update not Found" Oh well.</p>
<p>At least maybe other people who have this problem might find my post, and see this link: &nbsp;<a href="http://support.bethsoft.com/eng/resolution.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.bethsoft.com/eng/resolution.asp</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I just deleted both discs from my HDD, because starting with the second disc in didn't seem to work when loading from an auto-save like it suggests there.</p>

<br />
I have a relatively new HP Stream. It is driving me crazy. Windows wants to update, but it can't because there's not enough storage space. I've done everything I know to free up space, including following the directions, obtaining "help" and purchasing a flash
 drive. Nothing works!! I am very frustrated. Anyone out there have any suggestions? Am I missing something?</p>

<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.

<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

            Hi Andra, you would be amazed how many users with HP Streams ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Hi Andra. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.
<br />
<br />
First here are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: <br />

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there are corrupted system files on your computer. We suggest that you use the SFC tool to repair system file corruption.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>In the Command Prompt, type the command <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue remains, try scanning your computer for possible malware infection using an anti-virus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Feel free to ask back any question and let us know how it goes.</span></p>

<h2>            Printing Problems window 8.1 - A4 and DL envelopes one edge of print is missing</h2>
                    I have just purchased new pc with windows 8.1, when trying to print both A4 and DL envelopes one edge of print is missing. I have down loaded new printer driver but this has no effect, also tried different print settings.The print preview shows all of
 the type and there is enough room on the paper but the edge is still missing. Still have old pc with vista this prints fine so its not a printer issue. I'd be grateful for any suggestions.

            Thanks for your reply,
<div><br />
<div>I'm quite familiar with the printing set up, the problem is for example if i want to print an invoice A4, all of my settings are for this size of paper, the preview shows the correct page layout, but after printing the right hand edge of print is missing
 but there is still room on paper. I've tried customising the page layout but still can't make sense of it. I also need to print approx 50+ DL envelopes a week, on my old pc (vista) it prints fine, since i changed pc last week it cuts the top off the print.
 The settings are identical to before. If i try printing with settings for DL envelopes but place &nbsp;A4 paper in the printing tray, it still cuts about 6mm of print off the top even though there is bags of space on the paper, Its like it's not seeing the edge
 of my printing if you know what i mean.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have down loaded compatible printer driver from microsoft site since last week but this hasn't made any difference. Printer is HP deskjet 3520e all-in-one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'd still be grateful for any ideas</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks Nige</div>

            Hi&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Don't quite understand why i need to install windows 7 driver for printer when new pc is windows 8.1, also strangely my old pc vista which i have been using for printing mail on dl envelopes all week while having printing issues with my new set up has
 from today started doing the same, cutting top off print.</div>
<div>Now i'm really confused, nothing has changed with my old pc and i was printing envelopes fine only yesterday. This is why i can't see the link with windows 7. Why would my old pc (vista) work for years then suddenly have the same problems as my new pc.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Driver software is designed by the computer/hardware manufacturer. If they do not design the drivers for the latest version of Windows Operating System, then this is the work around that&nbsp;we provide our customers so that they can install the software use
 the program/hardware properly.</p>

<h2>            Xbox will randomly shut off</h2>
                    
<p>This is a long story so stick with me here.&nbsp; So i have had my Xbox for only 1 1/2 years now and during the summer/fall of last year my Xbox 360 Slim was shutting off and dinging constantly.&nbsp; It would shut off after starting to play it for like 5 minutes,
 and ding like the disc tray was opening (although it never did) and yes it did make the shut off sound and sometimes it would even turn itself on. I sent it in for repairs under warranty and they "found no problems" I looked for help from many ambassadors
 until one time, i was asked to remove anything that was unnecessary to start the Xbox.&nbsp; The only thing in it was a wireless adapter so i took it out, and it wasn't automatic but in a couple days it was normal. played fine all through the winter and just last
 week, what did it do? Yup it shut off.&nbsp; I clear the system cache and it seemed to help but about 3 days ago it has started dinging constantly (like the disc tray sound) and it does that about every 15 seconds when on and it even dings when its off.&nbsp; The only
 thing i have in it now is a 250gb hard drive that is needed for a game i play.&nbsp; Yes i have tried unplugging it and resetting it but it doesn't help. I would expect this from an Xbox that is like 5 years old but not one thats only 1 1/2 years old.&nbsp; What do&nbsp;
 I do, I cannot find the answer to a problem like this anywhere!</p>

<p>I honestly don't know what could be wrong. Is the power brick making any loud noises as well? I would personally request a repair again and see if you can get it fixed this time around. Doesn't sound right that they wouldn't find a problem the first time.
 I have a feeling it could be the power brick so you might need to look into that more. What color is the power brick when you have it on? It should be green when it's on and orange when it's off. If it's red that means the power brick is overheating.
</p>
<p>If it happens to be the power brick, make sure it's in a well ventilated area, free from dust and not blocking any of the vents. I had a problem where I blocked just two of the vents and it overheated, so it needs a lot of free space.
</p>
<p>But if that's not the problem, I suggest getting a repair done. </p>

<p>Clarification: After a closer examination, the beeping switched back and forth between the disc tray noise and power switch noise no matter if its on or off. &nbsp;Also those two buttons will make their noise if touched (sometimes) but neither will respond (EX:
 the disc tray wont open/close with the botton and the Xbox wont turn on or off with the button).</p>

<p>when it turns off, the power brick stays green and the xbox light flashes green slowly 3 times. &nbsp;I think the problem is the humidity</p>

<p>yup same here , 360s was fine until i got gtaV and added the 250 hard drive. now every day in the morning when i turn it on it shuts its self off with one quick beep then 3 green flashing lights then its off . :) the thing is i turn it back on right away,
 then it shuts it self off again. ok so about the 5th or 6th time i turn it on it stays on all day no problem ... i did a lot of research on this thing. first thing it is not an overheating problem because it turns off when its cool and stays on after its warmed
 up. i think it has something to do with the hard drive because thats when it started happening. &nbsp;i cleared catch to and it still does it &nbsp;.. took hard drive out and put it back in .. couple months later i just roll with it.. i know every morning that its gonna
 turn off 6 times first then i can play it all day fine. &nbsp;:( I'm going ps4 for sure next.</p>
