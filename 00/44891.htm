<h2>            Bluetooth Speaker</h2>
                    Running Windows 10 .... Bluetooth Speaker is Paired with laptop .... Windows Media Player does not recognize the speaker .... I've fooled with the Bluetooth Icon (stays red) , Speaker Icon (this plays the speakers - it functions proper) .... and wired
 headphone Icon (same as Bluetooth, no function) ...... this seems to be an issue of WMP not comunicating with laptop (driver update says I've got the latest) ..... Bluetooth Speaker pairs (and plays) with my cell phone .... Bruce

<br />6. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            <p>Hi Wayne Zelenko,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Boot into safe mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Start your computer in safe mode</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> If the issue does not occur in safe mode, you may put your system in clean boot state (in normal mode) to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to set the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>You may try resetting the sidebar to default settings and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> By resetting to the default settings, you’ll have to add your gadgets back to the sidebar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>First make sure that the sidebar process is completely closed</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click on the Sidebar icon in the system tray, and then choose Exit.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Check in Task Manager to make sure that there are no sidebar.exe processes running. If there are, just right-click and use End Process on each of them.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open up a windows explorer window and then paste the following into the location bar: %localappdata%\microsoft\Windows Sidebar</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>This will open up the Sidebar gadgets folder.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Rename Settings.ini folder. This file contains your current sidebar configuration.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click start and open windows sidebar, you’ll notice that a new Settings.ini is created in the above mentioned folder immediately.</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Windows side bar now should work with minimum gadgets.</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You may add the gadgets manually and check if it is working.</p>

            HI,
<br />you are using the latest Skype client version.
<br />It is a not Skype limit.
<br />Are you using Skype Standard version or Skype for Business?
<br />If you try from a different computer and network, does it works?
<br />
<br />Some people are using Skype version 7, Microsoft doesn't provide an official site to download it.
<br />
<br />Sincerely       
        </p>

It would be better to reset the id and password of your account before some one checks your mails<br />

            in fact the problem is with in IE 8, boy guess I came to the weong place for help, resetting the password would not help. from what I've found so far is= my home page is MSN, if I click on the hotmail in the window it takes me to the live sign on window,
 click to sign in it trys to go but comes back to sign on window, and it does not say my id or pass word is wrong yet!! when I click to sign in again thats when its says my id and password is wrong. but i found when the live tool bar is active i click on the
 mail tab which also takes my to the sign on window, with the same problem, but if i click on the sign in above right where the blue ? help is it signs me right in. Ive always heard that having two too; bars is not good, why the heck does microsoft have the
 Live bar and the MSN bar being installed with IE8 not sure if thats the problem, which I don't, but something is happening?? Oh yes Sorry wuys but I have NOT forgot my password!! he he

<br />
If you don't mind experimenting.....<br />
<br />
1. Your hot mail account may be corrupted :<br />
Remove your hotmail account. Then recreate the same account.<br />
If that does not help :<br />
<br />
2. Your anti-virus program may be interfering :<strong>&nbsp;<br />
Temporarily</strong> disable your anti-virus (AV)&nbsp;program and see if problem is gone.<br />
If that works, your AV might have the option of<strong> scanning emails</strong> <strong>
enabled</strong>. If so, please <strong>disable</strong> that option.<br />

            Hi, thats just about what I've been doing, I have Microsofts Essentials, thats not to much for adjustments there. like coming here just now, opened msn.com clicked on hotmail in the tool bar, not the web page, it goes to the sign in screen, click my name
 it starts to go and then it comes back to sign on screen. it says to go to another live site to sign in there. so i came here, clicked sign on, and it did. I have not tired removing my hotmail account, I'll give it a try and let ya know. Thanks

</p><p>I think I spoke too soon! The updates have stopped again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The links to reset don't give an option for windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker corrupted my .wlmp file and I can&#39;t open it.  How can I recover it without loosing anything&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>I currently run Windows Live Movie Maker (the latest version) and I was making a video and it randomly stopped working. I thought nothing of this because it had happened before and it usually just works again when I reopen it but when I reopened it,
 it said "would you like to recover the file?". I clicked no because every time before this, the regular file opens fine. But when I went to open the files, it was corrupted and I can't open it what so ever. I tried to repair the windows movie maker with wlarp
 but it did nothing. I am currently extremely sad because I spent hours working on that. I did not make backups because this had never happened before but I am wondering if there is any way I can recover this corrupted file.</span></p>
<p>

                    My Windows 7 Taskbar is missing the Libraries icon.&nbsp; How to get it back?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I tried Taskbar -&gt; Right Click -&gt; Toolbars -&gt; New Toolbar -&gt; Libraries -&gt; Select Folder, but&nbsp;got an extensive&nbsp;toolbar containing&nbsp;the Libraries title as well as the 4 default categories, instead of just the Libraries&nbsp;icon singly.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t accept password at login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe&#43;1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t accept password at login</h2>
                    <p>When I tried turning on my desktop earlier today I was unable to login. It keeps saying my password is incorrect. Then it tells me i can reset at account.live.com/password/reset . It still didn't work. I've been searching around the internet all day and
 i still can't seem to find a solution. Some people seem to be able to change their keyboard language with a small icon in the corner. There is no such icon for me.(i also trieduse the on screen key board and the eye icon so
</p>
<p>i know my password's right.) I've also tried booting in safe mode but it still won't accept my password. I use a wired internet connection. I've tried booting with and without the internet. In everycase its the same.</p>
<p>I never had a windows 10 disk. I download it an an upgrade to windows 8.</p>
<p>The only option I haven't tried is a complete reinstall of the operating system. I have a lot custom made files that I don't have backed up anywhere else. Reseting the entire system really isn't an option if I'll lose all my programs. The weird part is the
 password works on my other devises when signing into my microsoft account.</p>
<p>this is my first time posting here. I nomally wouldn't post anything but I couldn't find any answers for an answer. Right now I have to post from a phone.</p>

</p><p>I had the same problem three months ago and found out I had a damaged keyboard driver.</p>

</p><p>What I would type was not the characters the keyboard sent out and&nbsp;that was why my</p>

            <p>Would a bad key board driver affect the on screen keyboard? The on screen key board isn't working either. When I click the little eye at the end of the password bar it shows me what I typed. Everything looks correct. The password is the same as the one I
 used the sign in just now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how do you replace your key board driver if you can't log in?</p>

            Okay I've still yet to login into my PC. I've tried reseting my password already and it hasn't worked. I just reset it again and my PC still rejects it. When held down shift and hit the reset icon, it went into the usual trouble shooting menu. When I went
 into system recovery it asked me for my password and it worked. Its only when i'm actually trying sign in that it rejects my password. Just to make sure it was my password that was working I put in few passwords I knew where wrong and they didn't work. For
 some reason it just won't accept my password at the login screen.

</p><p>Thank you for updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have other admin account in the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are able to log in Recovery environment and not in login screen. This might be an sync setting corruption. If you have other admin account then log in using that account and you can remove and re-add the Microsoft account. If you don't have other
 admin account then you can enable built in admin account then remove and re-add Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try

            <p>Thank you for continuing to reply. As of right now, I am still unable to login.</p>
<p>I don't have another account on this PC. I just had the one admin account. Is there another way to enable the built in admin account? Because I can't log in, there is no start icon for me to click on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I'm not sure if it's important, but before this issue arose my computer crashed to a blue screen. It said it was collecting data to send to Microsoft and that I could restart once it was done.</p>

    <title>Windows Vista 64 bit - Network connection problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim0045  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista 64 bit - Network connection problem</h2>
                    Firstly the set up - Windows Vista 64 bit home premium SP1&nbsp;a Netgear WG111v3 wireless g usb adaptor and a Netgear DG834G wireless router.&nbsp; I cannot connect to the internet wirelessly. If I use an ethernet cable to the router, internet and network connection
 is great.&nbsp; I also have a laptop running XP SP3&nbsp;which connects wirelessly to the router OK, and a desktop running XP SP3&nbsp;with a Belkin wireless G USB adaptor which connects wirelessly to the router OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have downloaded and installed the latest driver form&nbsp;Netgear v1.5.0, which&nbsp;when installed has a build no. 6.1116.1228.2007.&nbsp; The smart wizard is set up with the correct SSID and WPA-PSK(TKIP) password.&nbsp; This is continually scanning for networks but cannot
 find any.<br />
<br />
In Network and Sharing center, if I click connect to a network a dialogue box reports Windows cannot find any networks.&nbsp; If I select set up a connection&nbsp;or network - manually connect to a wireless network - it reports - an unexpected error occured.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;In Network and Sharing center, if I click connect to a network a dialogue box reports Windows cannot find any networks.&nbsp; If I select diagnose why windows cannot find any networks - it reports 3 possible problems.&nbsp; 2 with a sheild - 1) Reset the wireless network
 adaptor on this&nbsp; computer - 2) Make sure your internet protocol bindings are correct.&nbsp; 1 with a green arrow - "NETGEAR WG111V3 54Mbps WIRELESS USB 2.0 ADAPTOR" is experiencing driver or hardware related issues.&nbsp; Device manager reports the device is working
 properly.<br />
<br />
The wireless adaptor is continually scanning the router channels but does not 'see' the router.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully the above text will give you sufficient information to resolve this problem.&nbsp; The&nbsp;solution to this problem is hopefully a setting with in Windows. &nbsp;I have spoken to Netgear tech support already.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you in anticipation of you help.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I posted a similar issue using the Netgear MA 311 v3 coneected to a Netgear router
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistanetworking/thread/3b060c11-be66-4da3-81f8-2ff11ef992d7/?ffpr=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.&nbsp; I've gotten a bit further than you in that I have managed to get the wireless to find my router and connect to the internet.&nbsp; I still get dropped intermittently (like now, hoping this will post), but you at least have a cnxn at maybe the techs will
 concentrate their efforts on solving both our problems if this works for you.<br />
<br />
I did a whole whack of things, but near as I can tell the following post did the trick to at least be able to find my router:<br />
<br />
<br />
*********************************** NOT MY POST, FOUND SOMEWHERE ON THE INTERNET<br />
<br />
1) Change the channel on your router from 6 to 12. Ultimately, I think this was the most important thing for my situation.<br />
<br />
2) In your Wireless Connection Network Properties, "Networking" tab, disable QoS Packet Scheduler. Don't need it.<br />
<br />
3) In your Wireless Connection Network Properties, "Networking" tab, disable Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). You must leave IPv4 enabled, you need this.<br />
<br />
4) In your Wireless Connection Network Properties, "Networking" tab, disable both of the LinkLayer Topolgies. Don't need it.<br />
<br />
5) Switch the power setting on your Wireless Adapter to "Max" or "Always On". Powering it up and down to save energy *might* cause connection problems.<br />
<br />
6) Disable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) on your router. This feature can be handy in some cases, but *might* cause connection problems.<br />
<br />
7) Get the latest firmware from your router manufacturer's website, and install it. Some router manufacturers have updated their router firmware for Vista.<br />
<br />
8) Enable "Broadcast my SSID" on your router. Some people think that unbroadcasted SSIDs don't connect properly in Vista. A diagnostic test on my machine flagged this too. It *might* cause connection problems.<br />
<br />
9) Disable Wireless Security on your router. I've since turned this back on (WPA-TKIP) with no connection problems, and it's critical to turn this back on if you broadcast your SSID.<br />
<br />
10) Turn off Windows Firewall. Some folks think the handling of packets by Windows Firewall (and other firewalls) *might* cause connection problems. I've since turned this back on just to be safe, even though I'm behind a router.<br />
<br />
11) Turn your Wireless Adapter's romaing tendency to "conservative" or "minimum". Don't let it roam in "aggressive" or "maximum" or "seek best connection" mode.<br />
<br />
12) Disable Auto-tunneling Start -&gt; Run CMD -&gt; netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disable<br />
<br />
13) Disable Teredo Start -&gt; Run CMD-&gt; netsh interface teredo set state disabled<br />
<br />
140 Disable windows firewall&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; Services --&gt; Windows Firewall<br />
<br />
******************************<br />
(Back to my post)<br />
<br />
I've also since tried the following to get a stable connection (but so far doesnt seem to help):
<br />
<br />
- Used Netgear wireless software (Netgear Smart Wizard) to detect the network instead of Vista's<br />
- Removed the IP v6 (on pc now so I can actually check) settings on the Network Connection. ) and others that I didnt find on my XP settings.&nbsp; All that's left is (through the "Manage Network Connections" in the Network and Sharing Center by right-clicking on
 the connection:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Client for Microsoft Networks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; * QoS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; * IP v4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; * NDIS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Link Layer Toppology I/O driver<br />
<br />
- turned Power Mgmnt off<br />
<br />

                    <p>I bought V-Bucks and it charged me for them twice. I would need for just one of the purchases to be refunded. I have contacted Epic Games and they told me to contact Microsoft Support for a refund. The amount spent for just one including tax was $26.49 and the over all total was $52.98. If you could please fix this issue it would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Glitchy Audio and Lagging Cursor</h2>
                    <p>I have some new bluetooth speakers, however, whenever I try to listen to a video online or to some music the audio keeps on glitching out and the overall sound quality is bad. Is there anyway I can fix this? I already troubleshooted using the control panel
 audio trouble shooter but it didn't work. And along with this, my mouse cursor has begun to lag horribly across the screen, can anyone give me suggestions on how to fix this? It would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi FlavorSpice, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It sounds like either a fault with your Bluetooth drivers, or perhaps interference. I'll give you the steps to reinstall your Bluetooth drivers first:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your Bluetooth adapter in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />You could also try using your mouse while your Bluetooth speakers are turned off to see if they're causing the interference.
<br />
<br />Please let me know how you go! Thanks!       
        </p>

            Hi Flavor.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />We can focus on the three problem areas you mention but they could mean more general system problems so we should go over those too to be thorough.
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />2) In the Device manager open the Mouse device, on Driver Tab choose Roll back if available.  If not choose Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />4) In addition run the Bluetooth and Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />5) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hey Greame.P,</p>
<p>Sorry for this response for being so late, since I took a break from using my computer. However this didn't seem to work, as after I restarted my computer (after updating the bluetooth and its adapter) nothing changed as the audio still had the glitching
 sound.</p>
<p>Is there anything else that could fix my problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hey Greg,</p>
<p>Sorry for this&nbsp;<span>response for being so late, since I took a break from using my computer.</span></p>
<p><span>I think I followed your steps, however I'm not completely sure, as I'm terrible with computers. I do quite believe my computer is updated and has the latest things that you have stated in the response.</span></p>
<p><span>I couldn't roll back in the device manager, but after restarting (after uninstalling) my computer froze and when I could move my mouse again, my memory and disk in task manager was both at 100% (which doesn't look good).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As for the checklist, I have McAfee downloaded, is that good enough?</span></p>
<p><span>And I don't think any of my files are damaged.&nbsp;</span>I troubleshooted my my bluetooth, but it just led me to stopping a few things that didn't fix the audio problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as I am terrible with computers (as I have stated before) I couldn't follow step five as I didn't know where to look for the Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>And it seems that I have a new problem / maybe glitch, the ^ button on my taskbar shows that my windows security button needs fixing (as there is a x next to it) but when I go to the security panel it shows that windows defender is ready and "no actions
 needed", is this just a glitch or another problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else that you have in your disposal that could fix the problems with my computer? Or should I just get a new computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But thanks for the advice,<br />

<h2>            Google chrome crashes</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had my pc for a year now and the start of this year my Internet is always crashing whenever I open Google or the Internet explorer for a few minutes or even when I open a new website after it's crashed previously. I checked the performance of the Internets
 ethernet connection on task manager and see that when it crashes there is 0 kps send and 0 kps receive speed. When this happens I am unable to click anything on the browser yet an online game will still actually run smoothly on my pc even though the performance
 stats say there is 0 upload and download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything on my pc runs perfectly fine it's generally just the Internet browser, I've tried Firefox/Internet explorer and Google and all have the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very quick update. Problem has been resolved. The issue was due to a sneaky malware file on my computer. I downloaded Malwarebytes and used a 14 day free trial and it destroyed a few files instantly whereas my avg didn't actually detect the malware. Hope
 this helps others</p>

whenever i play video games my 21" dell monitor goes into sleep mode. i just recently purchased an alienware computer from dell, and everything works quite well except for this one problem. i've tried putting my power scheme on high performance(via alienware fx), set my power settings for my hdd, monitor, etc to never sleep. i use an x-box 360 controller cause i suck at typing and it's therefore a lot easier for me...being handicapped doesnt help either. there are a few other things i've tried, even though i can't remember them all(except for initialzing my computer),while attempting to use the windows 7 troubleshooter. the solutions never really "hit the mark" so to speak though i'd think this to be  pretty common. i've never had this problem with xp. i know the problem is ntmy card as it is brand new and i had the tech put it, and my new sound card, in the day i got it. please help as soon as possible as this is really **** me off...it's been almost 2 months of searching for answers.

    <title>Forza Horizon- On demand Nightmare - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grueser420  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza Horizon- On demand Nightmare</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys and gals. So the other day I bought Forza: Horizon on-demand, and then promptly had to wait over 10 hours for the download to finish ( not to mention i pay for 50Mbps connection here, and with NO other machines, computers or devices connected to
 the network!). Slept, woke up the next day to play, and started the game. The menu loaded, the intro video in SP will play through, but after that it gets no further. The screen with the controller previewing your button layout will stay onscreen for a few
 seconds, then out of nowhere I get "Disc Unreadable 1. Try cleaning with a soft cloth etc..." and then sent straight back to dashboard. Multiplayer will load lobbies, and preview cars, but it cuts out as soon as the host starts the game. I have spent at least
 another 8 hours on the phone with tech support, and am QUITE livid about this situation. I have yet to actually PLAY the game. &nbsp;Has anyone else had anything similar happen to them?</p>

<p>&nbsp;**Side note** they even had me on the phone with a connection specialist who was not able to improve my download time/connection nor help me with forza, but my overall download wait time is up to 31 hours from deleting an re-dl'ing this ONE game per M$
 tech support.**</p>
<p>Any input or help anyone could offer here would be more than welcome here...I'm ready to go to Sony after this ordeal!</p>

<p>Can you give us an idea of the things you have tried thus far? I have seen when a game purchased from the marketplace with no actual physical disc gets a disc read error it usually means there is some form of corruption on the hard drive. Usually the fix
 for this is to delete the game clear the system Cache (press the guide button,then go to settings,system settings,then storage or memory,highlight the device then select clear system cache.) Then go to the marketplace and download a demo of relative size to
 the game in question. After doing this download your game once its up and working you can delete the demo. Doing this moves the corruption to a different part of the hard drive, but its important to be said that it may be time to look into getting a new hard
 drive or an alternate storage device, like a thumb drive. As to going to Sony, I mean no disrespect by this but my son has the ps3 and his download speeds are garbage and we run off the same internet connection. You should def call your ISP to see what is
 going on maybe if your on a wireless connection try a wired connection.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. With M$ Support I have cleared my system cache more times than I can count, Deleted my marketplace system files, deleted the game, the update and all files included with it. As well I had transferred the game to a 16GB flash drive
 to run it off of, as a test for my hard drive. I ran into the same issue in this test as well. Also I have been downloading other games on MP for a while now (5+years total), so I was also quick enough to think of hard wiring my xbox straight to my cable modem,
 this did not resolve the issue. I do KNOW for a fact there is nothing wrong with my connection (via speed test on IE on the console, and I can download a 15GB file on my laptop in under an hour with now slowdowns). I appreciate your suggests. But like I said
 I'm working on 8+ hours on the phone already with M$ about this, so there isn't much we haven't tried.</p>

<p>Hey folks. Sorry to hear about your troubles, that is quite frustrating. I have a possible solution for you.
<br />
<br />
First, delete the game from your HDD, and then clear your cache again. Then go to the marketplace and download some random free content (demos, videos, etc) that are equal too, or larger in size than the Forza download. Then go ahead and download Forza, and
 hopefully it will work.<br />
<br />
I recommend this, because since you are getting a disc read error on a downloaded game, that means the sector of the HDD that Forza was on could possibly be a bad sector, or corrupt in some way. Downloading that random content will take up that bad sector space,
 and then when you download Forza again, it will be on a fresh sector.<br />
<br />
Post back and let us know how it goes. Cheers!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was suggested by a representative my 1st night with the issue. It also did not help. I did notice the other day a corruption in the forza folder ( !TITLE UPDATE) on my HDD. The title update itself was corrupted. I tried to delete it with no luck. I
 even moved the whole game folder to a flash drive and removed it completely from my console. Deleted my system cache MULTIPLE times before and after this, and downloaded forza again. Then cleared system cache again before running the game. Still no luck....Thanks
 for the suggestion though.. </p>

<p>I have the same problem, but only on 1 of 2 consoles. It works on my 360S but not on my original white 360. I've tried running it from an external HDD (copy sourced from the 360S, which I know works) in case it was a fault with the HDD on the old 360, but
 I get exactly the same error.</p>

<p>I just have one console I'm trying to play it on. (360S, which DOESNT work). Like you I too have tried an external device, after downloading the game to my HDD, I transferred it to a 16gb USB drive, cleared the system cache for both, restarted my console,
 cleared system cache ( of both drives plus the internal 4gb HDD) 3 more times, tried again, still wouldn't run. Still same error. In contact with the Level 3 team who has sent me this e-mail:</p>

<p>Ok guys so, the download finished, on a fresh sector of my HDD. ( Downloaded 8.4 gb worth of demos to cycle the data then downloaded the full game again afterwards). Cleared my system cache on internal 4gb HDD &amp; my main 250gb HDD, deleted the title update,
 cleared cache again, then started the game. Again I still received the "Disc dirty" read error. I'll be contacting level 3 with my results via e-mail, and ill update my status here when theres more info.

<p>*******JUST A NOTE FOR EVERYONE: &nbsp;THIS LENGTHY ISSUE HAS GUARANTEED I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THE M$ COMMUNITY FOR THE NEXT GEN, MICROSOFT NEEDS A HUGE RE-MODEL AS FAR AS THEIR SUPPORT DEPARTMENT. IF I CALL IN FOR A PROBLEM WITH ONE GAME I SHOULD NOT NEED
 TO SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS ON THE PHONE GETTING TOSSED FROM DEPT. TO DEPT. BECAUSE THE TECHS ON THE OTHER END CANT FIND A QUICK FIX. THE POINT OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TO SUPPORT THE CUSTOMER. NOT TOSS HIM/HER AROUND FROM DEPT TO DEPT JUST TO EAT UP TIME. THE
 AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT COMES OUT OF OUR POCKETS FOR THESE CONSOLES/GAMES/ACCESSORIES, NOT TO MENTION ANY PC YOU MAY HAVE IN THE HOME, SHOULD NOT BE MET WITH PLAYING THE PHONE MERRY-GO-ROUND! IF I CALL YOUR COMPANY FOR HELP WITH A PRODUCT, YOU HAD BETTER BE ABLE
 TO PRODUCE IT! AND SO FAR M$ HAS YET TO EVEN COME CLOSE! STOP TRYING TO MAKE ALL THE NEW FANCY "SMART-TOYS" AND GET THE CURRENT ONES YOU HAVE OUT THERE TO WORK RIGHT FIRST!********</p>

<p>The challenges you’re experiencing with your Windows 10 icons could either be Windows Settings or User Profile related. To isolate your concern, create a Test user profile. This way we will be able to determine if the issue is not with your existing user
 profile. <span>To create a user profile, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Accounts</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Family &amp; other people</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the <strong>Add someone else to this PC tab</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Name the user as <strong>Test</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Set up a <strong>password</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Hit <strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign in as <strong>Test user</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Check if the issue persists.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We will be waiting for the update.</span></p>

<p>As per your instructions i have created a new user account but same problem persists. I have noticed a thing that whenever i enable "use small taskbar buttons" nothing rearranges except the last two icons and i cannot arrange them by my own unless i have
 not selected the "arrange desktop icon" option from desktop. And even after selecting that on every refresh it rearranges automatically.<br />
<br />
Here is the Screenshot which states only last two icons rearranges <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00374df2-6eb0-443b-9b2b-0e1122ab6785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>And if i disable the "use small taskbar buttons" option from taskbar settings all icons comes back to the position and then it doesnt rearrange. The problem is only occuring when i am using small taskbar button option.<br />
<br />
Please help me every time i need to rearrange icons.<br />

</strong>Also i have formatted my windows partition(C:) and reinstalled the windows again using
<strong>windows creation tool</strong> but still same thing happens.<br />
I have also tested this build on the Laptop as well but same icon rearrange issue.<br />
<br />
This Windows build has a 2 Bugs:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Icons Rearranges Automatically.</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Svchost.exe(netcvs) eats too much Internet bandwidth....even when your computer is fully updated... and U cannot stop it until you have disabled automatic

<br />
<br />
Please its a request to you to kindly fix this issue via an update. This 2 bugs are really annoying. I cannot installed windows again and again.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

 If this cures the issue, please post brand and model and firmware revision of your router.</p>

</p><p>I have just purchased Microsoft Flight Sim X Steam edition. I purchased this with the intention of using a B737 (Pref.600-800 series) add-on. Could somebody please tell me if such an add-on for FSX exists?&nbsp; Where could I find this ? &nbsp; JustFlight.com for
 eg, seems to list every single aircraft on the planet except the two most popular aircraft ever created - namely Boeing/Airbus.</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The B737-600/700 seems to be available, but the question:&nbsp; are you looking for payware aircraft or the free add ons that are often published?&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, the payware would be better modelled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, then PMDG, offers the B737 NGX 800/900 base package for USD 25, with the options of the 600/700/700WL series included in the package:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.precisionmanuals.com/pages/products/FSX/NGX6700.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.precisionmanuals.com/pages/products/FSX/NGX6700.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, if you want to look at a freeware option, then you could check this out (I'm sure there would be other sites/variations to the B737), but see this as an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://library.avsim.net/search.php?SearchTerm=Boeing+737&amp;CatID=fsxac&amp;Go=Search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://library.avsim.net/search.php?SearchTerm=Boeing+737&amp;CatID=fsxac&amp;Go=Search</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(however, you may need to register with AVSIM to get access to their library and download).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; &nbsp; Just had a look at Just Flight.&nbsp; &nbsp;And found this:</p>

<p>Very kind of you to take the time with a detailed response. Thank you Chris.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, my thinking was that PMDG Software wouldn't be compatible with FSX. However, thanks to your message, I think I will proceed with this. However, the link you included show that Just Flight run a little cheaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PMDG aircraft run very well in FSX (assuming your computer specs are above average), and they have an excellent Support base, I understand.&nbsp; &nbsp; They are also renowned for offering the highest detailed aircraft, especially with usable knobs/switches and avionics.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;You could also join AVSIM (of which I am a member) and they have a dedicated PMDG forum there as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;And their CEO, Robert Randazzo, has close relations with the AVSIM community, and always ready to help or to advertise any new offering that may be in
 development or being released.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Or else, their Support Portal is always available here:</p>

<h2>            How do I restore mouse functions&#63;</h2>
                    Within the past day or so I have started having problems with mouse functions (fyi, I'm using a touch pad on Windows 7). I noticed the problem the other day when I was I first opened the web browser to get to a page. The browser behaves as if it is not
 the active window and does not respond when I click on exit button or minimize/maximize buttons in the right-hand corner. The browser will only respond if I click on it in the taskbar to minimize it and then it functions properly once it is maximized. I am
 also unable to drag or drop files anywhere. I've tried everything I can think of as far as checking file properties and the mouse touch pad properties/functions but nothing seems to fix this problem<br />

    <title>Why is my new photosmart hp5510 printer not printing black - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is my new photosmart hp5510 printer not printing black properly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since&nbsp;I installed the black ink cartridge it has only ever printed out in grey which is readable but obviously not ideal. The other coloyrs are mostly okay though there are a couple of odd lines. I changed the black ink thinking it might just be faulty but
 had the same proble. Please help, urgently need to print dissertations. Thanks</p>

That sounds like hardware.&nbsp; You changed out INK and then got this issue - unlikely the software dynamically decided that since you changed out ink, it would not print as dark, eh?&nbsp; Even if you changed it again.&nbsp; Are these cartridges specifically those from
 HP?</p>
<p>If you print the PURE printer-only test/demo page - what does it look like?<br />
Which one specifically is it?&nbsp; (Is this the $99 printer?&nbsp; If so, is&nbsp;that is what you plan on printing a dissertation with?&nbsp; Just the DRAFTS I hope.)</p>

In any case - this sounds like a hardware issue... That is if you have checked the software (which is also provided by HP - so still their issue) and made sure you are not printing in "draft" or "ink saver" modes or something...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can restore the original factory settings to what they were when you purchased your HP Officejet.</p>
<b>Note: </b>
<p>Restoring the factory defaults will not change the date information</p>
<p>you set, nor will it affect any changes you made to scan settings and the</p>
<p>language and country/region settings.</p>
<p>You can perform this process from the front panel only.</p>
<p>1. Press <b>Setup</b>.</p>
<p>2. Press <b>5</b>, then press <b>3</b>.</p>
<p>This selects Tools and then selects Restore Factory Defaults.</p>
<p>The factory default settings are restored.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their supplied drivers. Check with<br />
HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />
