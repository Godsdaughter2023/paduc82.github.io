            <p>Hello susanevans,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can enter msconfig by following the instructions given by Corina Marie above.</p>
<p>1. Once in msconfig you will need to click on the Startup tab.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;From there you should look down the list until you locate the drivercure entry and then remove the check mark (tick) from the box to the left of the drivercure entry.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Once you have removed the check mark, click the OK button.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;You will be prompted to restart your PC.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Press the restart now button.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;When your PC restarts your copy of drivercure will be disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-enable it proceed as before but add a check mark (tick) to the box and press OK.</p>

    <title>Halo 4 Campaign not starting when using original xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ignacio angel topete  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo 4 Campaign not starting when using original xbox HardDrive&#40;Halo 3 edition 20Gb HDD&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>The Issue:</p>
<p>Halo 4 Campaign not starting when using an Original Xbox 360 Halo 3 Edition(20Gb HDD and same console with a 120Gb not working either).</p>
<p>I formatted the HDD</p>
<p>I cleared cache</p>
<p>I installed disc 1 and 2</p>
<p>AND STILL NOT STARDING THE CAMPAIGN USING THE HDD!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried using a kingstone USB 8Gb flashdrive and it worked, but when I plug the HDD back and start the Xbox 360, the problem returns…</p>
<p>Yeah, one way or another I got it to work, but I don’t like the fact that I cannot use my HDD with this game(I also plugged a 120Gb HDD with same horrible results), SO THE QUESTION IS:</p>
<p>IS OR IS NOT THE ORIGINAL XBOX 360 HDD COMPATIBLE WITH THE HALO 4 CAMPAIGN??</p>
<p>ARE YOU GOING TO FIX THIS??</p>
<p><strong>I NEED ANWERS</strong>. THIS ISSUE MADE ME LOSE LIKE 6 HOURS OF MY LIFE THAT I'M NOT GETTING BACK!!</p>

<p>Hello itopete,</p>
<p>Thanks for asking here in the forums. At any point in your process, after the cache clear, did you restart your console and re-download your profile to the memory device? &nbsp;Go to Social&gt;Sign In or Out&gt;Download Profile.</p>
<p>Let us know if the profile download helps when included in your process.</p>

<p>Hey there itopete,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now we are in the spot of troubleshooting different hardware. You said you tried 2 different hard drives on your console but did you try those same hard drives on a different console and see if the issue still persisted? If so then the issue might actually
 be with the console and the hard drives are actually working fine. That would be a great test to run if you can. Let us know what happens. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hopefully this kind of tests could be perhaps be done in-house by Xbox/343? Perhaps even prior to launch?
</p>
<p>I have spent nine hours now, trying out all the 'tips' on all forums. No success. If you want people working for you, pay them! Sorry to say, but I am tiring rather fast about Halo 4...</p>

<p>I have also returned the game and got a refund after some hassle - had to prove that the errors was not just my console . So far over nine hours wasted on troubleshooting, calls to support, trips to replacethe game... Glad it stops here, however. Any other
 business would compensate a customer for the inconvience, but no. </p>
<p>I cannot recommend the game to anyone. Soon it will be a month since the problem was first noticed.</p>
<p>Sad way to split with Master Chief.</p>
<p>343, good luck with the franchise in the future. </p>
<p>Ps now I am hearing that Black Ops 2 on the 360 has the same problems. Good I got a PS3 as well...

<p>I too have had this issue happen to me. I was using a launch xbox with the 20gb hard drive, and when I start the campaign, the intro movies would just loop and never enter gameplay. I was able to take the hard drive out and use a flash drive in it's place,
 and get into game, but if I put the hard drive back in, the issue will reappear. I do not want have to get a new xbox to just play this game.</p>
<p>Please Help!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 1803 Transparency Glitch</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi all</p>
<p>I'm having a problem with 1803. In 1803 The start menu and action centre and all of the other transparent elements have lost their transparency. The taskbar retains its transparency but loses the blur effect. Someone else had this problem and it was related
 to colour calibration settings. I can verify this isn't the case because, as I said, the taskbar retains its transparency but loses the blur effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried: </p>
<p>1. Disabling an re-enabling transparency effects from settings</p>
<p>2. Restarting my computer</p>
<p>3. Power cycling my computer (Shutting it down then starting it up)</p>
<p>4. Checking my graphics drivers (they're up-to-date)</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Specs:</p>
<p>HP Notebook (Late 2017)</p>
<p>AMD dual-core A6-9220 APU with Radeon™ R4 Graphics</p>
<p>8GB RAM (DDR<span>4-1866)</span></p>
<p><span>1366x768 Resolution screen with touch capability</span></p>
<p>If anyone knows how to remedy this issue, I would be grateful</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi SimonBond123,</p>

</p><p>There are several reasons on why you encounter the issue on your Windows 10 computer. May I know if you recall any changes made to your computer before the issue occurred?</p>

            No, it has been upgraded from 1709, which had the same issue. And I gave up after the 4th one

    <title>Windows Explorer Crashes when opening Word documents from OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Explorer Crashes when opening Word documents from OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with my OneDrive in Windows Explorer. Whenever I try to open a Word doc from my OneDrive via Windows Explorer, Windows Explorer crashes, becoming unresponsive. This happens even if I select a Word document (i.e. clicking once). This does
 not happen if I open a Word document from a PC file (e.g. Downloads or Desktop). PDFs and Excel files are not affected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open Word docs saved in OneDrive by going into Word and opening from there, however, I'd still like to know how to fix this issue as there is obviously something not right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the scan now and there are no corrupt files. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled OneDrive multiple times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            Hi!
<br />
<br />My name is German, and I am here to help you.
<br />
<br />If an Office application such as Word or Excel isn’t working correctly, sometimes restarting it will fix the problem. If that doesn’t work, you can try repairing it. When you’re done, you might need to restart your computer.

<h2>            How do I get my old email address book from Outlook Express to Windows Vista Business email&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently installed Vista Business on my computer. I forgot to save the old address book from outlook express. When the install was complete, a pop up window told me that a windows.old was created for old files etc. I can find the outlook express program,
 but can not seem to get my address book. IS is simply lost? Do I just start over by asking mutual friends to send me email addys? Please help if you can.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, Bob</p>

            You posted in an Outlook group. Outlook Express has nothing to do with Outlook.

    <title>Microsoft Agent Hotfix - downloaded file is faulty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elizabeth jane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Agent Hotfix - downloaded file is faulty</h2>
                    
<p>A MICROSOFT WINDOWS HOTFIX HAS A FAULT IN THE PROGRAM</p>
<p>************************************************<br />
SUMMARY/BRIEF RESPONSE:<br />
************************************************</p>
<p>This is the HOTFIX for Microsoft Agent</p>
<p>(Faulty file:&nbsp; 395039_intl_i386_zip.exe)</p>
<p>HOTFIX is suggested for Wndows 7 but:</p>
<p>(1) does not run properly; and (2) Does not extract properly</p>
<p>The first problem is caused by the program incorrectly and misleadingly requesting a password. This password request appears to be a programming artifact.</p>
<p>The second problem is confirmed by selecting a known location for file extraction: It can easily be confirmed that the file - which is supposed to self-extract - does not extract to this directory/folder location.</p>
<p>NOTE: The program misleadingly reports that the files in the zipped archive have been extracted, though, as it is easy to verify, this is not the case.</p>
<p>My system is an HP Compaq Presario CQ42 which has Windows 7 Home Premium pre-installed.</p>
<p>************************************************<br />
LONG RESPONSE: (optional read))<br />
************************************************</p>
<p>I downloaded the Microsoft Agent Hotfix from the Microsoft site.</p>
<p>This is the hotfix that appears to be faulty - in more than one respect:</p>
<p>395039_intl_i386_zip.exe</p>
<p>It is supposed to self-extract and fix this problem, but it does not appear to be extracting, and asks for an undefined password. I am the owner and only user of my laptop and do not have trouble installing anything else - if any program wants to make chamges
 to my hard drive Kaspersky 2010 (my internet security program) asks for confirmation. (That did not happen with this hotfix, so that was not even an issue.)</p>
<p>Here is what happened (as reported in my site feedback response in the page feedback form that I returned after the hotfix extraction appeared to be consistently failing, while at the same time reporting that it had extracted the zipped file).</p>
<p>MY QUOTED SITE FEEDBACK RESPONSE TO MICROSOFT: <br />
__________________________________________________</p>
<p>"I downloaded the Microsoft Agent hotfix, but it asked me for a password. I tried skipping and I tried using my administrator password, and I tried "Blank space" as a password - though it said that all files were extracted it wasn't the case, I think - uless
 they were extracted to a default directory, not the selected one - because, though I tried to do the extraction with the default directory I also did it with another directory - and THE FILES WERE NOT EXTRACTED INTO IT!</p>
<p>"So why is the hotfix dialog box saying they were when they were not ...and was the password requested my administrator password or something that I am unaware of that Microsoft has left in the hotfix by mistake?"</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT:</p>
<p>If the hotfix installed correctly then it did so to a default directory (C:) regardless of my selections, so this location-selection dialog box is confusing and misleading. I have no way to know if it did install because I cannot extract the zipped archive
 to a known directory.</p>
<p>The request for password dialog box is also confusing, and if a password is not required then what is this dialog box doing here? And what password is it asking for? (Apart from requiring a password, this dialog box offers two other options "skip" and "always
 skip". I wish all passwords were so EASILY OBTAINED [by moi at least!] ...apparently, apparently ... or did the extraction FAIL -&nbsp; for some security reason which could possibly be because the programmer left an internal Microsoft security password dialog box
 in the hotfix computer code to stop it from being interfered with by any else in Microsoft while he or she was writing the program for the hotfix?)</p>
<p>(By the way, I don't know why you don't make more Agents - one's that talk to you, perhaps - they are so cute!)</p>

                    I have windows server 2008 R2 installed on a server that hosts several printers, the other day I installed a&nbsp; print driver for a HP LJ M601 and the print spooler started to crash frequently. Here is what I see in the event viewer:<br />

<br />
The first error seems to be caused by a stackhash, which from my understanding, is a clash with how the data is being processed by the memory; causing the memory to fail and produce the stackhash error. I may be wrong about this. but either way it is an answer
 to "why this happening" and not "how do I fix this". I am assuming that one of HP's drivers is causing this issue, but I am wondering how I can track down the source of the problem. I have installed windows debugger and am trying to educate myself on how to
 debug the .mdmp files found in the ReportQueue folder to resolve the issue. <br />
<br />
The second error is causing an access violation (heap corruption?) caused by KERNELBASE.dll and ntdll.dll? I don't know too much about heap corruptions to go into this problem further.<br />
<br />
What I am looking for is an explanation on how to use windows debugger to point me in the right direction, or for someone to take a look at the reports being generated in my C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER folder to point me in the direction of what is
 causing the crash. I have these files uploaded to skydrive and am willing to share them to anyone who is willing to help.<br />
<br />
Here is a little background with what I am working with:<br />
<br />
Server 2008 R2 with 5 shared network printers. <br />
<br />
Using Pcounter for windows to manage printing.<br />
<br />
Printers are shared with the ability for mac clients to connect and print to printers via LPD; LPD services are turned on on the server.
<br />
<br />
Error seems to happen randomly, seems to be tied to mac users. Pcounter Control Service will "silently" stop and kill spooler. What I mean by "silently" is that the service will appear to be functioning normally but if you go into the event viewer you see the
 error messages above and then notice that the service needs to be restarted in order for it to function properly. I have been researching forums for the last few days in an attempt to fix this problem, brain feels a little fried atm, so I am unsure of what
 information I can give to be more helpful. I will stop here and explain in more detail if needed.
<br />
<br />
Many Thanks to those who can help.<br />

<h2>            Setting Status the new Skype for Window 10</h2>
                    <p>I've just been prompted to update to Skype for Windows 10. In this new version, when I click on my photograph I get a popout window where theoretically I can set mood, status, and phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY BIG PROBLEM is that the "status" drop-down is not clickable, so I'm UNABLE TO SET a STATUS and thus UNABLE to have my SCHEDULED CALL!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Understandably, I'm quite frustrated as I have a schedule and there's no obvious way to make this dropdown live, and without it I'm not online in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be so so grateful for any help.</p>
<p>thanks in advance,</p>

                    The most recent update&nbsp; for windows failed in the middle of installation. I can not get the update to install and my computer keeps randomly crashing. Upon restart, all of my files and programs have been reverted to a point about a week ago. programs I
 have uninstalled are installed again and files are gone. I am at a loss as to what is wrong.&nbsp;

<br />Scan using Malwarebytes:

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Code 19 means there is a driver conflict such as two devices trying to use the same resources.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack.<br />
<br />
Normally the above will fix that issue if not work your way down through these even if you have done<br />
them before.<br />

<h2>            Access to Spam folder for a live.com email that is a familysafety.msft.com &#34;child&#34; account</h2>
                    OK, I had set up 2 live.com email accounts for my kids some time ago and give the birthday that I entered being less than 13 I had to authorize the creation of the account with my credentials at familysafety.microsoft.com. &nbsp;THat all went fine and the child
 email accounts can sent/receive emails just fine. &nbsp;My problem is that the kid's new iPod Touches arrived yesterday and I needed to create an Apple ID for each of them. I used their respective live.com email addresses however the Apple activate your account
 email that is sent to each of the kid's live.com emails isn't appearing. &nbsp;I have had this resent from Apple several times. &nbsp;When logged into either of the kid's live.com emails accounts, neither of them has a Spam or Junk folder. &nbsp;Being that these are listed
 as child accounts via familysafety.microsoft.com I am guessing that the Spam folder is being hidden. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, how do I get access to the Spam folder for a live.com email that is a child account at familysafety.microsoft.com?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks!</div>

            So it turns out that I just needed to change the contact settings to allow the child accounts to manage their own contacts. Once allowed this the Apple ID verification email arrived after I asked for it to be resent.<br />
<br />
Problem solved other than I needed to create a different user name...<br />

            Thanks Rohit. The problem is not a bootcamp issue. It is to do with the installation not getting complete.........

            <p>Thanks to a fellow user..the problem is the dumb. Windows 8 needs NTFS &amp; I was on fat 32</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran&nbsp;C:\esd\windows\sources\installprep.exe, it turned out that my partition was fat32 and not ntfs. Strange that the dumb&nbsp;upgrade assistant did not flag that.
</p>
<p>Anyway, after converting to ntfs the install finished normally </p>

            Hi Anil, I have windows XP on my macbook. I installed using bootcamp and using both mac OS and XP. Now I want to upgrade to windows 8. Can you explain me the process? Can I install windows 8 directly from XP or I have uninstall XP and follow the bootcamp
 process to windows 8? Do I need to have Windows 8 in a DVD or Can I just download online and install it? I appreciate your help.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Looks like it is another thing that Edge may rely on the OS to provide.&nbsp; Does Tablet mode give it to you?&nbsp; I can't tell because I have two monitors and therefore can't get Tablet mode.</p>

    <title>Graphics Card Not Detected and system shows black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jumpman98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Graphics Card Not Detected and system shows black screen &#91;Solved&#93;</h2>
                    <p>About a week ago, I was using my pc just fine. No problems. I turned it off before I went to bed. It shut down successfully without any issues. When I woke up the next morning, I tried to turn it on and it wouldn't. I didn't panic, because I knew what the
 issue was. I bought my current pc from my oldest brother for a cheap price nearly a year ago. He told me the only thing I might want to replace was the PSU as the one that was in it was one he had put in there that was pretty old since most PSU's that come
 with PC's out of the box are usually pretty crappy. So, obviously, I ordered a new PSU and I replaced the old one with the new one I ordered. Now we come to the real problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I booted up the PC after I replaced the PSU, it turned on, but nothing appeared on my monitor. I waited for awhile and still nothing. I restarted and still nothing. So I hooked up an older VGA monitor to the VGA port on the motherboard and it displayed
 picture. I thought that was odd. I looked under Device Manager and my graphics card (Nvidia GTX460) wasn't listed. Only Intel HD Graphics. The Gfx card is getting power as the fan is turning. I have tried seemingly everything to get my PC to recognize the
 gfx card with no success. I took it out and put it back in, nothing. I took it out, booted my pc without it, shut it down and then put the gfx card back into the pc and still nothing. I checked my BIOS settings and there isn't anything there pertaining to
 the GFX card from what I can see. I also tried doing a System Restore and it came across some random error so I had to undo the System Restore.<br />
<br />
I looked for other forum posts about issues similar to mine and found one where this guy had recommended to check and see if it was under hidden devices and if so, to remove it and reinstall the drivers for it from the manufacturers website. I found it under
 hidden devices and so I followed the guy's instructions. However, the nvidia driver installer said there was no nvidia graphics hardware.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I'm completely out of ideas as of now. Anyone have some useful ones?<br />
<br />
(I'm using a Dell Inspiron 580, Windows 10)</p>

            I would just say goodbye to the $5.99 and remove it with this tool.
    The company is located in China and virtually impossible to contact.<br />

<p>I have had to reinstall everything following hard disk failure in an Acer 9302 laptop.&nbsp; This included missing drivers for installed hardware, without being in possession of the laptop's original drivers disk.&nbsp; This process is almost complete, but I have
 a pair of error message "? marks" in the Device Drivers section of the System display.</p>
<p>On investigation, the Device ID is shown as...</p>
<p>PCI\VEN_10DE&amp;DEV_0269&amp;SUBSYS_01121025&amp;REV_A3\3&amp;13C0B0C5&amp;0&amp;A0</p>
<p>...but running searches with this has failed to identify which driver(s) is/are missing and for what device(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice/ideas to solve this would be gratefully received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            That looks like it is an nVidia LAN controller. Did you install the nForce chipset drivers from Acer's website?

            Jennifer, Thank you for your quick reply.&nbsp; I installed this fast ring version yesterday from an ISO, electing to keep my files and apps.&nbsp; I had to do manual "clean" install from an ISO slow ring two months, due to the same error. I can't afford the time
 it would take to reinstall my desktop apps, it would take weeks and many man hours. Would your recommended solution keep all my apps in working order?&nbsp; Thanks &nbsp;

<p>Original title: <strong><span>Error 0x80240022</span> </strong></p>
<p>After trying to restore computer I got message that computer was unable to restore settings. This led me to a message that Windows defender was off although it is supposed to check regularly. Did a manual check and got error message 0x80240022 What do I
 do now?</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do you remember any changes to your machine prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Remove the current signature file of Windows Defender.</div>
<div>To do this,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click Start &gt; Run, type "Msiexec /x {A5CC2A09-E9D3-49EC-923D-03874BBD4C2C}" and then click OK.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. Open Windows Defender. To do this, click Start, click Programs, and then click Windows Defender.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>c. Check for new definitions. To do this, click the Help options arrow next to the Windows Defender Help icon, click About Windows Defender, and then click Check for Updates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try running the update and check if Windows Defender updates fine.</div>

    <title>Windows 7 Speech Recognition Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninaxyooj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Speech Recognition Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone. I have a windows 7 64 bit. My speech recognition is just not working. Every time that I click on it, it says,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<strong>"Speech Recognition could not start because the language configuration is not supported.</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<em>The recognizer language must match the language of the user interface. Please change the recognizer language in the Speech Recognition control panel under Advanced Options."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Here are some of the few things that I've had already done, YET my speech recognition still doesn't work:</p>
<ul>
<li>First thing I tried to do was check to see if my region was correct and if my language was set to English</li><li>I had already went on to Regedit and put in ctfmon.exe in the correct folders. (When that didn't work, I then installed the actual ctfmon.exe, ran the file, and then merged it)</li><li>I restarted and shut down my computer multiple times for any software updates (I also made sure that my windows 7 was updated)</li><li>I trained the default speech profile a few times and also made a new speech recognition profile in the advanced speech options and then also trained the new profile a few times.</li><li>I had unchecked the box that said, "Review documents and mail to improve accuracy" and then applied it on</li><li>I had set up my microphone already and it works perfectly. (I also went through the speech recognition tutorial)</li><li>I checked if my speech recognition was disabled (but it wasn't)</li></ul>
<p>Everything that I've tried seemed to not be working which is odd because so many people had so much success from all of the steps that I did above. Hopefully someone could have a solution for me.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Automatic Startup Repair not Repairing Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timmunro82  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Automatic Startup Repair not Repairing Startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know this issue has been posted in the past. I have read many posts on this forum and others. None of the solutions I have tried solved the issues I am having. I have also been on chat with MS support 4 times and their "next level" support via phone once.
 Dell support was far better than MS but they concluded that I need to reimage the system. (not my goal if possible)</p>
<p><strong>Computer</strong>: Dell Precision Tower 5810</p>
<p><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 Pro (up to date as of Thursday, 2/9/2017)</p>
<p><strong>Hard drive</strong>: 4TB Seagate</p>
<p>What else would be important to know?</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: (as described in subject) I restarted the computer at the end of the day Thursday. Came to it the next morning and could not log in.
<strong>I could not and still cannot get past the Windows Recovery Environment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have tried</strong>: </p>
<p>1. Automatic Repair, multiple times with multiple restarts.</p>
<p>2. Repairing from a USB with current installation media from MS. (and I formatted and re-downloaded the media files a few times)</p>
<p>3. Ran BOOTREC, BOOTSECT, CHKDSK, SFC in Command Prompt</p>
<p>4. The volume list is correct (I believe)</p>
<p>5. Cloned the hard drive to a new hard drive</p>
<p>6. BIOS is seeing the drive</p>
<p>7. I believe I have tried all of the buttons under troubleshooting (and the advanced button) in the Windows RE. I cannot repair, reset, recover, etc. It says that it can't basically. It's as if it can't find the OS.</p>
<p>8. Tried booting from the USB, clicking "Install Now" then "Upgrade." A window pops up that says "Compatability Report" and under that its says that "The computer started using Windows installation media. Remove the installation media and restart your computer
 so that Windows starts normally..."&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. I have not tried Custom install.</p>
<p>10. Cannot restart in safe mode or restart with any options available from Startup Settings.</p>
<p>I am up for anything at this point. The ideal goal would be to get into Windows and keep my files. It would be easy for me to clone a working hard drive with a working OS and start over that way. But I'd like to keep what is specifically on this drive if
 possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all help!</p>
<p>-Tim</p>

<p>
</p><p>You might check in your BIOS to make sure the boot sequence is correct...</p>
<p>It may need to be set to the EFI partition or Windows Boot, or similar, instead of C:\...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes with a major up date, an extra "Recovery" partition is added... 400mb or so..</p>
<p>This or something else may have messed up your boot sequence...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't boot to a 4TB HDD in Legacy Bios... It needs to be UEFI...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you been using that drive all along, or recently switched ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... The drive needs to be Initialized as GPT to be useable as a 4TB drive...</p>

            <p>Yes, in fact I have a few machines over the 2 TB "limit" that have been working just fine without using GPT and booting from the Legacy BIOS. But I believe the end to that is near since the machine in question is having problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, is there a way to sort of convert to GPT in its current state? As I understand it, I won't be able to simply switch to UEFI without the drive being initialized as GPT, correct? If not correct, how should I go about doing it?</p>
<p>Thanks again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the drives over 2TB Boot drives ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that Windows will not allow a partition over 2TB without using GPT... You can use the drive as a MBR, but nothing over 2TB will be recognized...</p>
<p>And that is for DATA drives... boot drives are even more strict, and can vary a bit depending on the machines BIOS capabilities...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are utilities that will enable a over 2TB drive to be utilized in Legacy Bios, but I'm certain that won't work with a boot drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as your current drive... If it was working before, it may be that the BIOS setting got changed somehow... You would know that better than I...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the 4TB has your windows installation on it, you have a bit of a problem...</p>
<p>UEFI requires a EFI boot partition as well as the OS partition... If the drive has never been UEFI it won't have one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you might try is to make a image of the drive or the OS partition, and possibly Recovery partition... EFI as well if it exists...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then delete what is on the 4TB drive, re-initialize it as a GPT, set your BIOS to UEFI, restore the image to the 4TB drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will then probably need to do some Automatic Startup Repairs, Boot Repairs, and\or etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know more of your setup and I may be able to help more...</p>

            <p>I took a look at another computer with the same 4TB drive and it is only seeing or using 2TB. The original drive in both machines was 500 GB. I cloned each to the new 4TB drives, installed them in the computers, and then extended the volumes so that the
 4TB could be used. I suppose I didn't see at the time that only 2TB were actually being used. But either way, I did not change anything else so however Dell set them up is how they are now. I assume they are set as MBR to boot from Legacy BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen shot is from the working computer with a 4TB drive. As you can see, the disk is not GPT, is 4TB, but only returns a size of just over 2 TB (I think 2.2 TB is the actual max size on MBR). I did nothing different with this computer when I replaced
 the 500 GB drive with the 4TB drive than the computer I have problems with. I have to assume they are the same.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is what you were looking for.</p>

            Here is a picture from the problem computer. Two things stand out to me. One is that the recovery drive shows that it is hidden. The other is the computer name. I don't have a computer with that name so I am not sure where it is getting the information
 from (or if it matters). But you can see the similarities between it and the working computer.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d64b9a3-1cb8-458c-bda3-325f1b4d048d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d64b9a3-1cb8-458c-bda3-325f1b4d048d" /></a>&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Computer Name you are seeing was assigned By Windows 10... probably...</p>
<p>Possibly the previous, but probably not...</p>
<p>The thing is that this type of name is usually only applied when doing a clean install...</p>
<p>You shouldn't be seeing it if this was cloned from another drive.... Unless of course it happened on the original drive before the cloning...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to think about your upgrades\installations to try to determine when\how this happened...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I see is that the working computer has two "Recovery" partitions... One is not listed as Recovery, but is 450mb and Hidden... Most likely some type of upgrade process created the 2nd.. A lot of times just updating to a newer build will create a
 additional Recovery for some reason...</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are nor essential...</p>
<p>I'm a bit confused about the 32mb FAT&nbsp; Hidden partition on the non-working machine..</p>
<p>I don't have a clue as to what might have created that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to delete it... If your boot repair needs to create a new partition for some reason, it will not be possible... You have four partitions, and that is the max on a MBR\Legacy drive... at least as far as primary partitions go...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you do something like that though... Try this sequence of Commands...</p>
<p>You mentioned something like this, but I'm not sure you did the entire sequence...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't mention it previously because these command are not effective on a GPT&nbsp; drive, which I was thinking you must have for 4TB... Do all three in the sequence listed...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>BOOTREC /FIXMBR, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, after doing this you may need to try a Startup Repair again... I have had circumstances in which it took a couple of tries with each in alternating fashion, to finally get a machine to boot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing... you may want to temporarily remove the "Diskette Drive" as the first boot device... If you actually need to boot with it, it can be selected in the Boot Options that you c an manually select during the boot..</p>

            The BOOTREC sequence is actually the first command sequence I tried when this problem started. I ran it again just now though. See the picture below. This is what I get every time I run the command. I have also done repair restart multiple times. The results,
 as you can see, worry me a little. Thanks for sticking with me on this.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21af0073-b031-4fa0-931f-024117af795e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21af0073-b031-4fa0-931f-024117af795e" /></a>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start with, I was mistaken about the number of partitions in use on your hard drive...</p>
<p>Some how I counted the DVD-Rom...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something I just thought of... Make sure your OS partition is set as "Active"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another&nbsp; thing... I suspect that your BootRec is scanning the wrong Volume...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure the machine was never set to UEFI ? I ask because the hidden 32mb partition could actually be a "EFI" boot partition that UEFI machines use...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Computer Name indicates that either a clean install was done, or that Win 10 was installed over the existing OS...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that when booting with a flash drive that is formatted FAT32 and running some type of upgrade\installation, that a UEFI install was somehow attempted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example... I have a machine that is UEFI capable, but I choose to run it as Legacy... Mainly because I am constantly reloading images of various versions of windows, and things get too complicated doing this with the extra EFI and Recovery partitions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I boot Windows from a DVD and do a install with the BIOS set to Legacy, it installs as Legacy... Same thing if I use a flash drive created with the Win 7 USB\DVD Tool, which creates the flash drive as NTFS..</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT... If I use a flash drive that is formatted FAT32, which is required to install to a UEFI BIOS machine, my installation of Windows 10 launches as a UEFI Installation regardless of the BIOS setting...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not real sure exactly how this happens, but it does... Either my motherboard is automatically switching, or Windows is switching it, I don't clearly understand...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could something like this have happened with your system ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... I would guess that if you are using a flash drive that is intended to install as UEFI to run your commands, things may be getting confused as a result...</p>
<p>Try booting your machine with a DVD, be certain&nbsp;the flash drive is not for UEFI...&nbsp;</p>
