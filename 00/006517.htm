            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>I would like to clarify, how have you setup the email account on Test profile (EAS or POP3)?</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will not be able to create Outlook 2013 Contact Groups when connected to an EAS account.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply and sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many email accounts have you configured in the new Outlook profile?</p>
<p>Are all the email accounts configured with Exchange Active Sync type?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure you have not selected a different contact folder in People.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The option to create Group contacts is not available if the email account is set up EAS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>By the look of what is being written in this forum, and the many others on the web, this is just another buggy Microsoft product, with numerous problems producing unhappy clients by the cart load&nbsp;- cant MS ever get anything right?</p>

            I tend to agree..................the only reason I have made this purchase is to be able to set up Groups...........how can I set up my accounts such that I can do it?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It seems perverse that the automated methodology of establishing your email accounts then precludes some of the functionality.</div>
<div>Two other accounts I have for clubs etc will not set up at all due to issues of encryption....?</div>
<div>Other email systems such as that attached to Windos 8 is fine and also on my Windows phone.....but on on Office365........how hard can it be ??&nbsp;</div>

I agree, not being able to set up groups using EAS, and learning this after hours of trying to figure out how, and then is no option but to reconfig and HOW would one make their company change from EAS to a POP - crazy

<h2>            Microsoft Live Custom Domain - how to make the domain private so it is only seen to anyone with a password&#63;</h2>
                    I was looking at Google Apps and noticed that Windows Live Custom Domains does the same thing if not more for free. My question is: I want to create a custom domain that is only accessable for view by those I assign a log in for. I have searched the net
 for hours and cannot find anything about this and or if it is a possibility? Thanks

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me help you with your inquiry in setting your domain account to private.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you registered your domain in&nbsp;Windows Live Admin Center and put the correct MX record, you have an option to<span> let people create their own accounts using your domain without your approval or you can approve every sign-up request they are making.
 Here's how to do it:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Go to <a href="http://domain.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://domain.live.com</a> and sign in with your administrator account</span></p>
<p><span>2. Under <strong>Your domains</strong>, click on the domain you want to manage</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on <strong>Settings</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4. Click <strong>Turn open membership off</strong>; once the open membership is turned off, the sign-up request is subject to your approval</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To create a new user, you can do the following steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><span>1. Go to <a href="http://domain.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://domain.live.com</a> and sign in with your administrator account</span></span></p>
<p><span>2.<span> </span>Under <strong>Your domains</strong>, click the
<b>appropriate domain</b></span></p>
<p><span>3.<span> </span>In the Member accounts section, click
<b>Add</b></span></p>
<p><span>4.<span> </span>Type a user name and password for the new account</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span> </span>Select the <b>
Require password change</b> at first login check box, and then click <strong>OK</strong></span></p>
<p><span>6.<span> </span>Send the user the temporary password, and then inform them that they need to sign in to activate their new account</span></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>By the way, to allow domain admins to reset users' passwords, the domain owner have to submit a formal request in this forum along with the domain name.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know if you have any questions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Best regards,<br />
Mark M.<br />

<h2>            Still cannot change primary alias</h2>
                    <p>Why cannot I change my primary alias, there is no option to switch or delete the primary alias, this should be a simple task</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to change or delete my primary alias from <span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>&nbsp;so that I can change it to a&nbsp;Rogers.com&nbsp;alias and get rid of the bell one but there is no option&nbsp;to delete or change my primary alias, and under the&nbsp;bell
 alias it says "Your organization's policies prevent you from changing your primary alias"</p>
<p>Pardon my language but "what the hell does that mean" and why can't I get rid of this, I have been trying for weeks with no success...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot disconnect the bell account from Microsoft, I disconnect it then try to open an new Microsoft account using the Roger account but I keep getting switched back to the original Bell account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a way of signing out of my Microsoft account with Bell then create a new Microsoft account with Rogers...there must....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried to&nbsp;sign out of outlook&nbsp;then re-sign up with Rogers but I keep getting sent back to Bell AHHHHH
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long speal but this is very frustrating, if I can get rid of the Microsoft account without it affecting my programs then I will b/c this is ridiculous....</p>

<h3> mgreason  say:</h3>
<h2>            After moving to a new computer and installing the newest free Skype, it&#39;s become nearly useless</h2>
                    <p>I cannot save Skype contacts.&nbsp; This wouldn't be too bad, but now the application will not respond to the keyboard (the one I'm using right now to type this message) in the 'Search Skype' dialog boxes.&nbsp; I'd downgrade to the version I was using, but that installer
 is looking for something on the web that is no longer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my computer, transitioning from Windows 10 to Windows 10. I've installed 12.10.572.0 of Skype. I've MS Office for Home and Student 2016 installed (the version without Outlook), in case that matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to get the keyboard working?&nbsp; Suggestions on how to save contacts would be welcome as well.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a mobile phone that is able to show security videos in realtime via the internet ? I have a system that works via the internet but the ony thing is that Active X has to be enabled to view the videos.It works well on a normal PC using
 internet explorer.But I need to have something that I can move around with.Any suggestions?<br />

<h2>            All Required Attendees Decline</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to have a conditional format on a meeting for which I am the organizer which will change to a color code if all required attendees Decline the meeting request?&nbsp; any visual indicator on my calendar will do (except having to click the tracking
 button)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several 1:1s every week (set as recurring meetings) and some weeks people can't make the 1:1 (vacation, other critical meetings).Since we meet weekly it's not a problem to simply decline and catchup the following week.</p>

<p>Hi VincePace,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to set a conditional format to change a color code if all attendees decline the meeting request. For example, if an attendee decline this meeting in this week, you can see the status in Tracking. I clearly know that you don’t want to check
 the meeting status by using Tracking feature. So I recommend that you contact your attendees and let they select “Send the response now” button when they decline the meeting. And then you will receive a notification email says someone has declined this meeting.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I set up folders in Outlook and then file emails in those - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomgmorgan  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I set up folders in Outlook and then file emails in those folders without the folder also being set up on my mail provider&#39;s server&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    My problem is that I can set up a folder as a sub-folder to my inbox but, when I do, that same folder is set up on &nbsp;my email provider's server.&nbsp; With enough folders and saved emails I easily run over my allocated space on the provider's server.&nbsp; I want
 the folders and their respective emails to be local (I am on a new HP dv7 laptop which is used for work and I travel and need local access to my emails).&nbsp; I have the email provider server set to delete emails in the inbox after 14 days but the folders keep
 their contents and voila, I have no room on the server and people sending me emails have their email bounce back ("Mailbox Full").&nbsp; This is a problem as I get about 100 emails daily and I need to keep a large number of them in a folder.&nbsp; I am not technical
 so I need the "easy" answer.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Are you connecting to an Exchange mail server? Everything in your mailbox in that case counts against you because it is all actually held on the server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you need to do is create Personal Folders. You can then drag and drop your mail into your Personal Folders which removes it from your mailbox on the server. However, once your mail is removed from the server it is no longer being backed up. You will
 be responsible for doing that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on File &gt; New &gt; Outlook Data File. Choose the default Office Outlook Personal Folders File (pst). Click OK. Give it a name (the default is outlook.pst if you don't). Personally I like to use my first initial last name and the date I create it&nbsp; (example:
 korland070612). Click OK. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To back it up, close Outlook. Locate the file. Right-click on it, scroll to copy, and then paste it in a folder on your network.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This all assumes you have an Exchange mailbox however. </p>

<h2>            Office 2010 isn&#39;t activating on Laptop after upgrade</h2>
                    I have a laptop that had Windows Vista and MS Office 2010. I decided to upgrade Windows to Windows 8.1 and do a fresh install. After doing so, I tried installing MS Office and it went through setup fine and I inputted the key that I had imputed on windows
 vista. It said the key was correct. I opened up Word 2010 and it showed me this:&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95d3c94e-d7c0-4642-8ce7-d6ebe260b32a" />&nbsp;
<div>and when I click next, it shows me this:&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30cd035b-5acf-48a7-bd57-45171760765b" />
</div>
<div>When I click activate by telephone and I input the numbers on the screen, it says the numbers are invalid.</div>
<div>I have also uninstalled office on a different computer and used that key, same error. I really need help.</div>

            Exactly what type of Win 8.1 "upgrade" technique did you use.&nbsp; Is there any chance that there still is a second copy of Office "carried over" from the old version.&nbsp; That is the simplest cause of this type of problem, having 2 unactivated copies of Office
 installed on your computer.<br />
<br />
For some reason the activation system does not like your product key. MAKE SURE you are reading and typing it correctly<br />

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><u>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys
</u></b></p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys for retail licenses, but not for Retail sale. They are intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who
 pay a subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. It is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>What probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons.
 Somewhere along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><u>Validate Now:</u></b></p>
<p>You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/</span></a> Click the ‘Validate Windows’ button. If the validation check fails, then you are going to have to buy your product again.
 You should contact the vendor for a refund. Depending on where they are in the scam cycle they may give you the refund or they will string you along with delays. You should also contact your credit card company to cancel the transaction or to at the very least
 give them a heads up on the scam so that they can deny the scammer any further sales.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to report the vendor to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/windows-7-ultimate-activation/www.microsoft.com/piracy">
<span>www.microsoft.com/piracy</span></a> .</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>If it is a legitimate purchase, then you are possibly having a known problem with Win7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are 3 possible causes, 4 possible fixes:</b></p>
<p>First confirm that you are not making a simple typing error.</p>
<p>Second, it may be an access rights problem. There are 2 possible fixes for it. Either activate using “Run As Admin” or “Take Ownership” of the problem drive folders and registry entries. I have provided links to several articles
 for these types of fixes. Pick one that you can follow and try it.</p>
<p>2a, try doing Windows update (it apparently worked for one person)</p>
<p>Third do a phone activation</p>
<br />

You will have to do another PHONE ACTIVATION. This time, ignore the initial prompts. Wait, a long time, until you are offered the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; They are the only people who can help you with this problem.<br />

<br />
Bingo! (maybe)<br />
<br />
Pro Plus is a limited distribution license.&nbsp; If it is bought under a Volume License, reselling it is not allowed.&nbsp; If it was bought under the "HUP" discount, it is not allowed to be resold. I don't know about other sources of Pro Plus, but I'm willing to bet
 the licesne terms say it can't be resold.&nbsp; Actually, you can check.&nbsp; On the computer it is still working on (you do have one?) you can check the license terms document by going into File menu &gt; Help command &gt; "<u>Microsoft Software License Terms</u>" hyperlink.<br />
<br />
Did you have it on 3 computers at the same time?<br />
Or did you have it on MAX 2 computers at the same time, then uninstalled one and transferred it to the 3rd computer?<br />
<br />
If you had it on 3 computers at the same time the answers is simple. The Product Key you bought on ebay is part of a "bootlegged" volume license.&nbsp; Volume license keys can be set to allow multiple activations, but there is a limit, in this case 3.&nbsp; It sounds
 like you have used up your limit.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The only remaining help anyone on this forum can provide is to tell you to do a phone activation.&nbsp; When you phone in, don't reply to the initial prompts, you'll get the same invalid key message.&nbsp; Instead, wait a long time until you are offered the option of
 talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; Explain the problem to them. They are the only ones who can check the activation system and tell you the underlying reason for the error.<br />
<br />
Please let us know what happens.<br />

            These pictures are more of a confirmation that you probably have a bootleg copy.<br />
<br />
Sure the packaging looks real, many bootlegs have very convincing counterfeits. Or it could even be a real package for Pro.&nbsp; But the screen captures you provided are for Pro Plus. There should not be that mismatch.<br />
<br />
We can keep providing suggestions, but bottom line, you should just do a phone activation.&nbsp; When you phone in, don't reply to the initial prompts. Wait for it to fail over to the error routing and it gives you the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp;
 Explain your problem. They should be able to give you more information about the error.<br />

            Hi homestarnz 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You need not use your Microsoft ID to sign in. Just use your Skype ID (old one) to sign in.
<br />
<br />However, if you want to continue with only one account, you can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your other account so that credits are not wasted and contacts are not lost.

    <title>Contact Sync of Nokia Lumia 925 with Microsoft Outlook 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cnarmad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contact Sync of Nokia Lumia 925 with Microsoft Outlook 2007</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased Nokia Lumia 925 recently. I wanted to synchornize my Phone contacts with Microsoft Outlook 2007. I downloaded
<strong>Microsoft Outlook Connector</strong> (32 bit as Office 2007 is only 32 bit). Then I added live account to my outlook. However, the sync did not work properly. I can see only half of my contacts in outlook. If I add contacts in Outlook, then the same
 contact is not seen in my Phone (or live account). However, reverse does happen at times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, I could not receive emails in my outlook after downloading outlook connector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help me in this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its quite strange that we need to do so much just to sync contacts (I have used blackberry and Nokia (not lumia phones) in past.. And syncing was as simple as connecting USB cable and using the Phone Software on PC.). Even Window phone app is useless. It
 just gives importance to music or photos. However, there are no keys to back up contacts or sync them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is very irritating since both outlook and lumia 925 are Microsoft Products and I purchased the phone for better sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Chirag Shah</p>

            <p>The phone will sync contacts from your account, not localy. This is why it works differently from other phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contacts that are synced to your phone are the one that show up on here:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://people.live.com/</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, in order to achieve proper contact sync with your phone, you should first import them from Outlook 2007 on your account through the website above.</p>

    <title>How can I remove attachments from reply emails using Outlook.com&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I remove attachments from reply emails using Outlook.com&#63;</h2>
                    <br />
<p>I am able to do so using regular Outlook (the attachments are automatically not included in the reply email). However, using Outlook.com, the attachments remain on the reply email. When I right click the attachment, I do not have the choice to "remove" the
 attachment(s). Instead, I get several options including "save page as", "save to pocket", "view page source", "view page info". Any advice is appreciated.</p>

<p>Different in what way? Would these emails be ones that have attachments and you're seeing the content of the attachment in one case whereas it's purely an attachment in the other or is this related to the character set being used or or or...........?</p>

            Thanks Karl for your &nbsp;reply. Sorry for not being clear.
<div><br />
<div>There are no attachments. It is an alert mail generated by a Java program which has tables (usual rows and columns with data inside).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When opening the mail using MS Outlook, it looks as expected (say three tables with a few rows and columns and each table has a heading just above them)</div>
<div><br />
<div>But when users open &nbsp;the same mail using webmail, it looks all messed up - few tables missing, contents of the table mixed up etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

</blockquote>
By source I meant the source I saw by viewing the source of the html - sorry for the confusion. I am talking about the difference in what I see of the exact same mail viewed using outlook and webmail.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>#1 - One messsage - the very same email viewed using outlook and webmail</div>
<div>#3 - Yes it is happening only from one sender. The emails are auto generated from one of our java programs. The mail contains a few html tables (checked and they are well formatted and no issues with tags/attributes etc). When viewing the html response
 (in firebug/chrome) sent from the webmail server for that mail, the content is different.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>One cell in the table row has a hyperlink. Could it be anything to do with the char encoding/issue with the url that the link points to?</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking purely as someone who trouble-shoots problems of all types - the underlying problem you are facing is that it's impossible to know what the problem is unless it can be replicated. Given that this is something that occurs from one sender only - that
 becomes virtually impossible unless someone happens to get the same email (or same kind of email) from this sender or one who does the exact same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next logical question is "Why does it work in Outlook.com versus Outlook?" - unless and until the specifics are identified - not a question that can be answered and begs the question "Is Outlook.com not enforcing something that it should or is Outlook enforcing
 something that it shouldn't?" That is reinforced given that FireFox/Chrome also shows the content differently which is a question you should be posing to the sender as to why that's happening - it's their source code that is appearing differently in different
 places. Given that - not especially optimistic that this is something that is either an Outlook issue or something that would even get addressed.</p>

<p><strong>Hi, does anyone else have terrible battery life on a Samsung Omnia 7? If so, do you know where or how to report this to Samsung? I fully charge my phone over night on mains, in fact it charges for longer than I end up using it. After 5 hours it has
 about 30% battery remaining, and all I do is listen to music for about 3 hours on it. I have my gmail account set to sync automatically, and thats the only account. My old iPhone 3g which had very bad battery, at least used to make it through the day.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the battery is this bad when I am hardly using it, I cant imagine what its going to be like when I actually need to use it properly.</strong></p>

<p>Charging with you computer can drain the battery instead of charging it. I don't say this is the case here, but I have heard numerous cases of which it did. Your USB port delivers at most 500 mAh for charging. Some phones need more and instead of charging,
 it drains the battery, while it is indicating it is charging. The best thing you can do is charge with the supplied adapter instead of USB port.</p>
<p>If you don't need wifi, just turn it off and see if it makes any difference in standbytime.</p>

                    <p>So as i was about to install 9841 the launcher (wrongfully) told me my computer wasn't supported so i went straight to setup.exe in the iso's source folder which installed smoothly, 9841 rans without any problem but when i went to update it to 9860 build
 i got a 2gb ram is needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Want i wanted with this question is ask for a fix to this huge mistake or at least request that 9860 iso link is made avaible although the first option is really the way to go after all this machine "couldn't run 8" but ran everything all the way to 10 preview
 9841 (doesn't run above this version because of the missing iso links).</p>

 it if not from&nbsp;the iso itself although your already running in x64 1gb, when updating you get an error because you need 2gbs&nbsp;ram.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            forwarded emails get forwarded as attachment</h2>
                    Why when I forward an email with Windows Phone (I use HTC Pure and Exchange 2003), emails get forwarded as an attachment?

            Yes this is correct, if you edit the e-mail prior to forwarding it won't be sent as an attachment.

            <p>OneDrive you can right click its icon by the clock in lower left and uncheck the box that says something like Start with windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic updates, its a beta test and part of the rules is you cant turn off the updating process.&nbsp; Just the way it is on the beta - will be different surely on the final version.&nbsp; Wait for it ?</p>

You can open pst-files in Outlook via;<br />
File-&gt; Open-&gt; Outlook Data File...</p>
<p>If there are issues with opening the file, you can use scanpst.exe to check it for errors.<br />

<h2>            Adding comments to a document then uploading in new sharepoint doucments library user interface</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our users used to add comments to documents when uploading them to a documents library &nbsp;in the "classic" Sharepoint user interface. You entered the library, cluck upload and that opened a dialogue allowing you to select the file and enter comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the new user interface the upload option only lets you pick the file/files but does not allow you to enter comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we enter comments when uploading files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
