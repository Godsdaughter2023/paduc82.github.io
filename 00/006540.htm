<p>Hi Amys255,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because browser cached your credentials in order to ensure you don't need to enter credentials every time in a logon process. To deal with it, I suggest you:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.If you need to frequently operate with both of these accounts at same time, best way is to open them in different mode of a browser (private mode and regular mode) OR open them in different browsers,
 they don't share same cache. </p>
<p>2.If you want to sign out first one before using the second one, you may need to clear cache and cookies of the browser so that the credentials would be removed, then log on the second account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope these information helps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Win 8 with IE10 and randomly get the "This Page Cannot Be Displayed" message when I try to load a page that worked fine the last time I viewed it ...and then works the next time I load it.&nbsp; The error seems to occur more when you try to open the
 page in a new tab or window.&nbsp; It is happening so often now it's ridiculous and seems random.&nbsp; I'm using Firefox instead and have 2 friends with the identical problem who have started using&nbsp;Chrome.&nbsp; The standard support advice about cache and IE setting make
 no difference at all ...this is an ERROR in Windows or IE please fix this MS it's been a reported problem from the moment IE10 started being used.</p>

<br />
Test the hypothesis.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most common failure case that I see involves having an alias host name which means that an IP address is never cached with such a lookup (e.g. via an A(record).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a workaround is to manually cache a complete lookup for IE to
 use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the Time to Live values involved that may be difficult to do and the user has no control over those.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /displaydns&nbsp; to see what I am referring to.

<br />
Not necessarily.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can also be viewed as a sign of a problem with your DNS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the only problem in Windows or IE&nbsp;would just be a deficiency in functionality in not allowing us to tune away such symptoms.

<h3> chris hayes_oh  say:</h3>
<h2>            SIgnout Issues with Chrome</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We have Office 365 for Education and are using the federated login with our ADFS server and I was wondering if anyone else is seeing this issue with federated logout from Office 365 using ADFS and Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The user is using the Chrome browser and logs into the Office 365 web page to use the web version of Outlook or One Drive.&nbsp; (restore sessions is enabled in chrome so cookies are not removed on browser close)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Office 365 session expires and is redirected to this sign out link for our Office tenant (domain removed and replace user USER_DOMAIN)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/logout?post_logout_redirect_uri=https%3a%2f%2foutlook.office.com%2fowa%2f%3frealm%3dUSER_DOMAIN</span></p>
<p><span>The logout is directed to the federated SSO logout on ADFS and the sign out is completed both on Office 365 and
 the local ADFS session.</span></p>
<p><span>3. User logs into Office 365 web portal again</span></p>
<p><span>4. Session expiration&nbsp; occurs for the user and the redirects to the link but the Office 365 sign out will not redirect
 to the ADFS Federated logout. The Office 365 signout will continue to not redirect to&nbsp; the federated ADFS sign out for all
</span><span>subsequent session expiration.</span></p>
<p><span>The only way to correct the behavior to have Office 365 redirect to the ADFS sign out on expiration is if the user actually does a "Sign out" of the service using the menu under their avatar.
 However&nbsp; this only works for one expiration then the federated SSO sign out to ADFS is not invoked again on subsequent expiration of the user session.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Chris,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my experience, it’s an expected behavior that we need to sign out of the services using the menu or close the whole web browser to
 have Office 365 redirect to the ADFS sign out on expiration</span>. Feel free to let us know if you still see the same behavior after signing out of the services using the menu or closing the whole web browser.</p>

</p><p>Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is something browser specific to Chrome and the problem persists forever if the person has "Continue where you left off" option configured in Chrome and they never manually sign out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Firefox works correctly when the session expires but Chrome does
 not work after the first call as described.&nbsp; If the two browsers behaved the same then I would agree but with Firefox working correctly and Chrome not working it seems like a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear the first expiration does remove the ADFS session successfully and you can no longer sign in to any local SSO resources without authentication.&nbsp; You then login to Office 365 again and the next time the timeout occurs it will not redirect back
 to ADFS in chrome but it does successfully in firefox.</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your situation. But the service works well in Firefox while not in Chrome, which already means that the AD FS log in/out service is well. It’s related to Chrome.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter the logout is redirected to AD FS log in page or not, the user is not able to login again without authentication. Users can manually type in the login address of Office 365 to login. There’re almost no impact to normal business. Actually, if the
 use wants to login again, what we suggest is to close the browser and then open it again to login.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have concerns about this, it is recommended that you use Firefox to log into Office 365. Thank you for your understanding.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Brook </p>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For homed user, do you mean the Office 365 cloud user (not on-premises)?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If so, are you a cloud user or your organization’s environment is pure cloud?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does the issue persist if you add a new Skype for Business on-premises user or Skype user?
<br />
<br />
Also, upload a screenshot about the “not resolved” Skype for Business on-premises contact and Skype contact.<br />
<br />
We are looking forward to hearing from you.<br />

            <p>Hi Rob,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your clarification.<br />
<br />
I have run a test and found that Skype for Business for Mac (16.0.3640) will display the Skype for Business and Skype users' complete email address (here, it refer to “resolving” we are talking about) after adding them to be my contacts. See the following screenshots:
 (blue circle for Skype user and red circle for cloud user)<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bff9749-d153-4a8d-a667-806e919d7a8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bff9749-d153-4a8d-a667-806e919d7a8e" /></a></p>
<p>So, for your situation, your Skype for Business for Mac (16.0.3640) resolves/displays the Skype user with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, please re-confirm whether the Skype user’s email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I need to collect the screenshot about the Skype user
 contact information (especially the email address) as well as the on-premises Skype for Business user’s in the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">private message</a>.<br />

            Hi Rob,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your private message.<br />
<br />
After checking the domain you provided, we have found that it is the cloud user but not on-premises user (if a user whose email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, the domain should be test.contoso.com but not contoso.com).
<br />
<br />
So, the current situation should be like the test I did (Mac OS: 12.12.1 and Skype for Business for Mac: 16.0.3640). The Skype for Business for Mac will resolve the cloud user/Skype user with its complete email address but not its name (called by you). However,
 I need to consult our relevant team for this. I will post back if I get any update. Your patience and understanding are highly valued.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            <p>Glad it's not just me! &nbsp;It does seem to be a flaw that contact names aren't displayed. I'm assuming that the Lync client is getting the names from Outlook so it should be a reasonably trivial exercise for Skype for Business to do the same?</p>

            Hi Rob,<br />
<br />
On one hand, I’d like to confirm whether you are still using Skype for Business for Mac (16.0.3640). If so, try upgrading it to a higher version (16.1.458 which I have checked it should resolve the Skype for Business contacts ‘cloud users’ to be the display
 name). But, the Skype users are still resolved to be their complete email addresses. To upgrade it: Click “Help”&gt; “Check for updates”.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            <p>Yes, I'm running the latest version (16.1.456). I can confirm that Office365 users have their name displayed correctly, but consumer Skype users and on-premise Skype for Business users just have their email address displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Lync 2011 seems to pick up a user's "proper" name from the Outlook 2016 contacts list, this lack of functionality in the S4B client seems an incredibly retrograde step!</p>

            Hi Rob,<br />
<br />
To investigate it, I have run a test and get the result as the flows:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Skype for Business for Mac (16.1.456) does resolve the Office 365 Skype for Business user (cloud user) as the name. And, it will resolve the on-premises user/Skype user as their complete email addresses.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To check whether it is related to Skype for Business contacts of Outlook for Mac 2016, I tried created 2 contacts whose email addresses are one is the on-premises user and the other is Skype user with the display name of “External Contact1” and “External
 Contact2”. After re-starting Skype for Business for Mac (16.1.456), both the 2 users (on-premises user and Skype user) are still resolved with their complete email addresses; restarting Lync for Mac 2011, both the 2 users (on-premises user and Skype user)
 are resolved to be the corresponding display name of “External Contact1” and “External Contact2”.
<br />
<br />
Given the situation, the conclusion should be that Lync for Mac 2011 pick up the contacts with the display names of Outlook for Mac 2011 but Skype for Business for Mac doesn’t.
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            <p>Thank You, I am not really thinking about actually autorunning the show, so probably I have used the wrong terminology....for example in Word I can
<strong>File</strong> + <strong>Send to mail recipient<br />
</strong>(although in Word 2010 you need to add the Send to mail recipient feature onto the quick toolbar first)....</p>
<p>...and the Word document displays in full screen in the e-mail window without the user clicking on any attachment...<br />
I want the same effect with PowerPoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are currently resorting to copy and pasting the slides into the e-mail as pictures!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure I have seen this done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grateful for any help anyone can give.</p>

            <p>Thanks Steve, I know how to do all that, it seems what I am after can't be done.&nbsp; So I'll have to fudge it.&nbsp; The idea is that it is a communication, people skim e-mail quickly and if the message we need them to catch&nbsp;is in the attachment it often doesn't
 get opened...so we need to make sure they see the content in the e-mail immediately, without any clicking on attachments or any additional steps...this is all internal stuff, so only sending within the same company network etc. but seems like the security
 has been tightened up and you can no longer do this.&nbsp; You can do it with a Word document but not a powerpoint so there is definitely inconsistency there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for trying to help though.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Android - only partial messages shown</h2>
                    It seems like when I have a longer message that has pictures, such as the headlines from the Washington Post, that only part of the message will display.&nbsp; As I scroll down, it just stops.&nbsp; I suspect that there may be a limit to message size, but cannot
 find anything in app to allow the whole message to display.&nbsp; All I've been able to do is to go to my desktop app or use something else, such as the Gmail app.&nbsp; What can I do so that I can see the whole message?

            Thanks.&nbsp; So, it sounds like there is no workaround.&nbsp; Wish that weren't the case.&nbsp; Seems like Microsoft should address it, if it wants us to use Outlook (for that matter, I wish it had all of the features of the desktop variety, such as having the task
 list baked into it, rather than having to use a separate app).

</p><p>Intimately so, since 21 October 2014.&nbsp; That you would choose that particular sentence in a greater missive, expressing my sadness at what has become of us as a group, serves only to illustrate my point.&nbsp; We came together as an eager, idealistic&nbsp; bunch of
 people.&nbsp; We wanted to test what we hoped would be a great and innovative new OS. We&nbsp;understood that there would be hurtles to overcome, as well as bugs to find, report, and attempt to resolve.&nbsp; Then with each new build, we as a group began to split, almost
 equaly, into factions that hated it, and those who supported itl.&nbsp; Microsoft did nothing to mitigate this&nbsp;growing and unnecessary hostility, as their concentration was on Phone.&nbsp; It is not my place to speculate on their motivations for their motivations for
 this, but many of us began to feel disenfranchised, as again and again our feedback went without redress. Now here we are 14 months later, and we spend more time flaming each than we do testing.&nbsp;So if you wish to disagree or admonish my point of view, feel
 free to go ahead. Just remember at one time we were all at one time, on the same team. We should be now.</p>

            <p>WELL, this seems to be a nice continuation of this (now locked) thread with over 100 pages:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_security/why-so-many-people-hate-windows-10/ad4845af-9bae-4929-bc0d-c5c427fd3989">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_security/why-so-many-people-hate-windows-10/ad4845af-9bae-4929-bc0d-c5c427fd3989</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>OK - as often stated, and not necessarily in the same order, here are MANY OF the reasons _I_ hate windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;The ADWARE ('recommendations' for 'store apps(sic)' in the start thing, in the live tiles, and in cortana's default output, among other things)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;The SPYWARE (monitoring how we use our computer and sending that information to "the Store")</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;The 'Microsoft Login' and the ANTI-PRIVACY EULA that goes WITH it. &nbsp;No longer 'strong-armed' per se, but certainly not an OBVIOUS alternative to use a 'local logon' unless you happen to know what to do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;The *HORRIBLE* *UGLY* *PIG-DISGUSTING* 2D look that Windows "Ape" (8) 'invented' (actually it's a throwback to windows 1.01 from the mid 80's).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. &nbsp;The "Start Thing" in general, *ESPECIALLY* "live tiles". &nbsp;MY! COMPUTER! IS! *NOT*! *YOUR*! ADVERTISEMENT BILLBOARD CENTER!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. &nbsp;"The Metro" in general. &nbsp;It is a reflection of *PURE* *CLUELESSNESS* to even *INVENT* *THAT* "API", and that includes "universal" apps(sic). &nbsp;It *INSULTS* *SENIOR* *SOFTWARE* *DEVELOPERS* (like me) by *FORCING US* to *RE-LEARN* what we've become GOOD
 at already, doing "the OLD SCHOOL way". &nbsp;And there is *NO* *BENEFIT* (in fact, "the Metro" apps(sic) are SLOW, INEFFICIENT, and HORRIBLY UGLY when compared to their 'native' counterparts). &nbsp;Yes, I hated ".Not" also. &nbsp;THAT was bad, but "the METRO" is *EVEN*
 *WORSE*!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. &nbsp;*FORCED* *UPDATES*. &nbsp;yeah, they never BRICK nor CRASH a computer. &nbsp;They never load and KILL your bandwidth while you're trying to watch or listen to streaming content ESPECIALLY if a DIFFERENT computer or net-connected device is using the bandwidth for
 what YOU want. &nbsp;And *NOBODY* ever has to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/17/13000_complaints_re_comcast_data_caps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PAY FOR BANDWIDTH OVERAGES</a>&nbsp;that are *CAUSED* by *EXCESSIVE BANDWIDTH USAGE* by Windows Update (~4Gb images every 3 months? &nbsp;NO! THANK! YOU!!!) *LET* *ALONE* the *DOWN* *TIME* it causes! &nbsp;And, it's *ON* *MICROSOFT'S* *SCHEDULE*, not *MINE*, when these updates
 "happen", and if *I* happen to *WANT* to use my computer for media or games while *SOME* *CPU* *INTENSIVE* *PROCESS* "decides" to *DO* *WINDOWS* *UPDATE* then I'm pretty much *SCREWED* and must *WAIT* and *BE CONTROLLED* instead of *BEING _IN_ CONTROL* of
 *MY*! *OWN*! *COMPUTER*!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. &nbsp;REMOVAL of CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS! &nbsp;That's right, _I_ do *NOT* want to have 1-pixel width borders, UGLY COLORS, hard-to-read fonts, ICONS THAT ARE *TOO* *BLANKING* *BIG*, and a title bar that does NOT reflect its active/background status via the COLOR
 like XP and 7 do. &nbsp;*INSTEAD* _I_ would like *FULL* *CONTROL* over the appearance of *MY* *COMPUTER*. &nbsp;It is *MINE*, after all. &nbsp;AND! THIS! IS! AN! ACCESSIBILITY! ISSUE!!! &nbsp;For when the colors and fonts make it HARD TO READ the screen, for "old eyes", or cause
 EYE STRAIN for "old eyes", it's JUST OBVIOUS that the ANTI-CHOICE *CHILDREN* doing the development these days are being DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST OLD PEOPLE! (like me)<br />
</p>
<p>(NOTE: &nbsp;I say 'ANTI-CHOICE' because it's *NOT* "a choice" to ONLY "let" us choose what has been handed to us as a "choice" by Microsoft, like "do you want VOMIT or MUCOUS?" &nbsp;I say *NEITHER* and want MY OWN PREFERENCES thank you, and THAT is the point)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway, THAT is a "good start".</p>
<p>
</p><p>(by the way, I've advocated windows to people up through version 7. &nbsp;I really liked 3.0 and was totally sold on the Windows GUI on my computer from that point forward, bought the SDK and the necessary tools to do windows development, etc.. &nbsp;But even VISTA
 has been better than either "Ape" (8.x) or 10-tannic. &nbsp;If Microsoft can't make a good OS any more, then us XP and 7 fans will have to "go elsewhere" and _I_ might be forced to help make that happen...)</p>

<p>Fine.&nbsp; If you hate Windows 10 so much, don't use it.&nbsp; Don't provide feedback; keep complaining and *****ing and whining petulantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, you could do something about it.&nbsp; Windows 7 and Windows 8 are both still available.&nbsp; Feel free to go back to using either (or both) of them, and leave the development of Windows 10 in the hands of people over the age of 13.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This thread isn't about Personalization nor Ease of Access and doesn't belong in this area of the Insider forums.&nbsp; By polluting it with off-topic meta-discussions you rather abuse the forum and drive away people that might be interested in engaging here.</p>

            <p>Ah man, everyone missing the point again. &nbsp;See what I mean, Zach? &nbsp;I started a discussion, and even point out that this forum in general has devolved into &nbsp;an argument between two entrenched factions. &nbsp;I began testing on build 9860 on my birthday in 2014.
 &nbsp;I hoped that as builds were released, that more significant changes would be forthcoming. &nbsp;There are issues that people have had with privacy and security that have been exacerbated by hyperbole on both sides, here and in the media. &nbsp;This goes to the heart
 of Personalization and Ease of Access. There are also two camps that won't budge with regard to the loss of options in the look, functionality of apps, etc. Also there is a significant concern that Feedback is either being ignored or backloaded in favor of
 Phone. &nbsp;We don't get to speak directly to the members of the Development Team, so I don't mean to sandbag you. &nbsp;These are just things that are argued over ad nauseum. &nbsp;I while back I started an external forum (I'm not advertising David) to let Insiders vent
 and take off topic issues off this forum. &nbsp;It has morphed into something beyond its original intent,, but many workarounds and solutions to bugs are being routed directly back here. &nbsp;I just want this OS to work, and the issues about Personalization and Security
 to be resolved at least to the point of quashing all the acrimony.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I think we're on the same general page.&nbsp; It's always weird seeing people take crazy unfounded stances and making bold proclamations about things they're not in a position to speak to... and then getting angry at a person reflecting the opposite opinions.&nbsp;
 It's just unhelpful.&nbsp; I think a lot of things boil down to "this is an awesome idea for everyone" OR "this is an awesome idea for SOME people".&nbsp; Figure out which it is, figure out how long&nbsp;it'll take, put that in the possibility queue, we can move on cheerily.&nbsp;
 Everything's possible given enough time and energy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally time tends to mellow people out.&nbsp; My hope is that as people realize that this is a marathon, not a sprint, we can have less heated conversations.&nbsp; Assuming my team decides that Feature X is the most miraculous thing ever, it's still probably going
 to be a good while before it shows up in anybody's hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody might be super excited about how terribly dumb and terrible and awful the people on my team are because we didn't deliver something RIGHT NOW, but it's not like we've stopped working.&nbsp; There's
 just a long list of interesting and excellent things to get to. :)</p>

            <p>And this is only Redstone 1, and I get that. &nbsp;The is I know a secondary refinement curve that you folks have &nbsp;to deal with, working new issues that are popping up with the new build. &nbsp;I took a couple of bans because I allowed myself to be baited by others,
 and returned hostility in kind. I tried to talk with David Wolters and have a dialog with him after my first PM from him asking me to reign it in a bit. &nbsp;And when I knew I'd messed up, I always tried to man up and discuss it with him, &nbsp;admitting to my part
 in the exchanges. &nbsp;But, one day, I was on a particularly contentious thread, and I inserted my unsolicited input in an exchange between a mod and anot her Insider. &nbsp;I said to my detriment and the distraction of others, that repeating an inaccurate statement
 did not make that statement true. Had I left it there, I probably would have been a momentary annoyance. &nbsp;But then I had to go and say that the Code of Conduct seemed to be selectively enforced by the mods, usually in the favor of those who touted the good
 they saw in Windows 10. &nbsp;That was both inflammatory and disrespectful on my part. &nbsp;This would have been bad enough, but there were four mods on the thread at the time. &nbsp;I've been trying to find a way to contact David so that we could have a civil discussion
 via PM like we used to, but so far I've had no luck so far. &nbsp;I would like my Identity returned to me, so that I could move forward as me. &nbsp;I have apologized to David and any mod on that thread at the time. I want to be MichaelMasters again. &nbsp;Starting my own
 forum and the duties that come with it, has given me a new perspective on conduct as an administrator and moderator. I know that you guys on the dev team have your work to cut our for you, and all issues, however long they've been around can only be resolved
 one item at a time. You folks have been inundated with many specious and irrational feedback that gets upvoted into the stratosphere, making prioritizing a daunting task at best. &nbsp;I will continue in this nick until the real me is unblocked, of learn to live
 with it. &nbsp;It's just a bummer having your achievements getting flushed along with your name. I've been beta testing since the days of plain old DOS (yes I am old), and this has been somewhat disconcerting for me. Since I can't post my email, I can be contacted
 via PM, under this nom de plume. &nbsp;Anytime you or any of the mods wish/are willing to have a direct conversation. &nbsp;Keep up the good fight. &nbsp;Windows 10 will be what it needs to be in its own time.</p>

            <p>must every disagreement with what is happening in windows 10 be pejoratively described as "petulant" and "whining" and the ONLY solution is "don't use it" ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't Microsoft JUST! LISTEN! TO! THE! CUSTOMERS! and give THE! CUSTOMERS! what THE! CUSTOMERS! WANT! instead of SHOVING! WINDOWS! 10! DOWN! OUR! THROATS! like it's the _ONLY_ possible operating system we could run oun *OUR* computers ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I say it's NOT the only operating system, and Microsoft's poor choice in marketing and assigning features to W10 will come back to bite them in the backside if they don't change their tune.</p>

 trying to FORCE people into "up"grading via 'windows update' like that. &nbsp;'By hook or crook', you might say, and behind our backs in all too many ways.</p>

    <title>OneNote 2016 Inserting documents &#38; emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> northessex79  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2016 Inserting documents &#38; emails</h2>
                    <p>I have been using OneNote 2010 at work now for a while and have come up with a very good way of working. Today I updated to OneNote 2016 and am having some issues with inserting printouts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2010, I liked being able to drag emails and documents and inserting them as a printout. OneNote would always inset the printout at the bottom of the page - this gave me a old to new organisation which is exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>In 2010, I also preferred that when I inserted an Excel spreadsheet, it inserted it as an image rather than a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in 2016 it seems to insert it in no manner at all and I have the following questions that I'm hoping someone might be able to answer. I have looked through some posts and checked all the setting in 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How can I set 2016 up to insert the printout at the bottom of the page I've dragged and dropped onto?</p>
<p>2. How can I set 2016 up to insert an Excel spreadsheet as an image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent hours so far looking into these and I really hope someone can help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't really help me. I know how to insert doucments and how to move them. What I'd like is for OneNote 2016 to insert any printouts at the bottom of the page instead of half way up!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find any settings that automatically does this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote 2010 did this automatically.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this. I know that I can snip the part I want but I'd like to be able to drag and drop a document into the OneNote 2016 and it print it to the page (at the bottom).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, OneNote 2010 did this automatically and inserted this at the bottom of the page.

<h2>            Pivot Table Calculated Field</h2>
                    <p>I want to calculate the coefficient of variation in a pivot table.&nbsp; The coefficient of variation is (standard deviation / average).&nbsp; In my pivot table, I summarize prices as values (once as Average of Prices&nbsp;and the other as StdDev of Prices)&nbsp; Keep in mind
 that they are the same value displayed in two different ways in my pivot table.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I make each value its own field so that when I do the calculated field both options are available?&nbsp; Right now, all I see in the fields list is the raw value as a selection (Price), I want to see&nbsp;Average of Price and&nbsp;StdDev&nbsp;of Price&nbsp;as&nbsp;options as well.&nbsp;
 I want to keep the calculation in the pivot table so that I can display this information on a chart.</p>

<h2>            Lumia Black begins rolling out</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings Lumia fans,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From today, Nokia Lumia WP8 owners around the world will start to receive the new Lumia Black software update on their smartphones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lumia Black update combines a host of new features, improvements in imaging, new apps and app updates from Microsoft and Nokia to make your Lumia smartphone experience even better. So what can you look forward to, once Lumia Black is installed?<br />
<br />
<strong>App Folder.</strong> This brand new feature makes your Lumia experience even more fluid by giving you an option to further personalize and organize your Start screen. With App folders you can group similar apps and settings into one folder, a tile,
 on your Start screen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Nokia Glance screen 2.0.</strong> Helps you keep track of information in real time, making all your most important notifications including: phone, messages, email, outlook, calendar, or any apps that use notifications such as Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp,
 or games; always visible at a glance on your screen. It saves you time and energy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bluetooth LE.</strong> Will now be enabled across the full Windows Phone 8 Lumia range for compatible gadgets like the Adidas MiCoach accessories.<br />
<br />
<strong>Nokia Refocus.</strong> The amazing Nokia Refocus comes to <em>all Windows Phone 8 Lumia smartphones with 1GB of RAM and upwards</em>. This app has to be seen to be believed, so what better excuse for showing another example:<br />
<br />
<strong>Nokia Beamer.</strong> Sharing what’s on your phone is easier than ever with Nokia Beamer. No longer restricted to just photos, you can now beam documents, presentations, anything you like, to any HTML5-enabled screen by simply scanning a QR code on
 the screen. <em>It’s coming to all of the phones with 1GB RAM upwards.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Nokia Storyteller.</strong> This app debuted on the new Nokia Lumia 1520 and Lumia 2520 late last year. Now the experience comes to other Lumia smartphones. The app arranges your photos for you, by date and by place, making it easier to tell the stories
 behind your pictures, and give extra context through the close integration of interactive maps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Nokia Camera.</strong> Combines Nokia Pro Camera and Smart Camera to simplify the photo-taking experience, and ensure you get the perfect shot every time. The app has been available for Lumia PureView smartphones since last year, but it’s now coming
 to the rest of the WP8 Lumia range.<br />
<br />
The latest Nokia Camera update also brings raw DNG support for <em>Lumia 1020 owners</em> – something that’s already available for Lumia 1520. The DNG format gives you access to pure and untouched visual information, allowing you to do more and be more creative
 with your images. If you are an enthusiast or professional photographer, now you can use your professional workflow with your smartphone images.<br />
<br />
Latest generation of imaging algorithms. The Lumia Black update further improves the image quality, especially in Lumia 1020. Among others, the improvements include a new oversampling algorithm, making your images more natural looking with reduced noise, while
 ensuring your photos remain wonderfully sharp.<br />
<br />
The Lumia Black update also brings a series of enhancements from Microsoft to Nokia Lumia smartphones. These include safe driving mode – which cuts out unnecessary distractions when you’re on the road; customised ringtones for each contact. You can now also
 close apps within the in multitasking view and lock the screen rotation if you wish.<br />
<br />
“Nokia Lumia Black updates the imaging experiences on your Lumia and makes using the Windows Phone even more fluid. New App Folders and the ability to close apps in multitasker are my personal favourites. I also encourage everyone to try out the Nokia Refocus
 app that introduces a whole new dimension to photography,” says Samuli Hänninen, vice president of software program management for Nokia’s Smart Devices business.</p>
<p><br />
<u><strong>How do I update?</strong></u><br />
<br />
The Lumia Black update has begun rolling out now for<strong> Lumia 1020</strong> and
<strong>Lumia 925</strong> smartphones, with other models in the range following in the coming weeks. For more information go to

Your Nokia Lumia smartphone automatically checks for updates every week, and will notify you when it finds one. Otherwise, you can go to Settings -&gt; Phone update and check for yourself. If Lumia Black is ready for your phone, you’ll be able to download and
 install it straight from that screen.</p>

<h2>            Display value from worksheet in UserForm TextBox</h2>

<p>UserForm2.TextBox1.Value = TextBox1.Value</p>
<p>UserForm2.TextBox2.Value = TextBox2.Value</p>
<p>Unload Me</p>

<p>Thus when I click the command button it takes the data from TextBox1 and TextBox2 in UserForm1 and displays it in TextBox1 and TextBox2 in UserForm2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to add to this code, the ability to concatenate TextBox1 and TextBox2 into a new string and then check every row in Column W of "Sheet1" for that string.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once that string is found I want to copy the same row of Column S and display it as a value in TextBox3 of UserForm2.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I have come up with so far but as I am sure you can see it’s not exactly what I need to make this work.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheets("Sheet1").Range("?").Value = TextBox1.Text &amp; TextBox2.Text</p>

            It is hard to see the point of having two userforms with the same text fields? Why not simply have one userform with the three text fields then when you click into textbox3 read the values of boxes 1 and 2 and look in the worksheet for the resulting value
 and populate the textbox with the value from the appropriate cell in the found row. Maybe something like<br />
<br />
<br />
Private Sub TextBox3_Enter()<br />
Find_First Me.TextBox1.Value &amp; Me.TextBox2.Value<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Function Find_First(strFindString As String)<br />
Dim Rng As Range<br />
If Trim(strFindString) &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Sheets(1).Range("W:W")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Rng = .Find(What:=strFindString, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After:=.Cells(.Cells.Count), _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LookIn:=xlValues, _<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UserForm1.TextBox3.Value = Sheets(1).Cells(Rng.Row, Rng.Column - 4)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UserForm1.TextBox3.Value = "Nothing found"<br />

<p>Hi Mohd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other computer which can print the same document doesn't have the <span>
Adobe Garamond Pro font. So, the problem should be more related to this font on the problematic computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>Did you configure some Windows, Office or printer drive updates before this issue? You may try the following two options:</span></p>
<p><span>1. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a new Windows account</a>. Log in computer with that account. </span><span>Print the same file.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Remove/Uninstall </span><span>Adobe Garamond Pro font and reinstall it. See if there are some improvements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, as </span><span>Adobe Garamond Pro Font is third-party font, and Word print the same document well with other fonts. So, the issue is only related to this third-party font.
 We suggest you contact the font provider to report the problem and get further assistance.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your understanding. </span></p>
<p>

    <title>Mixing Footnote styles on one word&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 665566ra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mixing Footnote styles on one word&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to have two separate styles of footnotes on the same word. &nbsp;I have a list of authors, and beside the name of each author I need two footnotes--one that is a numeral, one that is a symbol (eg: John Smith, 1, *; Jane Smith, 2, **; Jack Smith,
 3, *** where the 1 and 2 and 3 are one sequence of footnotes, and the * and ** and *** are a second sequence of footnotes). &nbsp;When I insert a continuous section break after the 1, it starts Jane on another page, which isn't what I want. &nbsp;I understand how to
 go about choosing the style of a footnote, but I don't understand how to have two different styles at the same time on the same word.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, at the bottom of the page where the footnote text goes, I would need it to be listed as 1,2,3,*, **, ***<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help, this is frustrating! &nbsp;</div>

<p>You will have to use the Footnote and Endnote dialog box to insert all the footnotes. To display the dialog, do the following: On the References tab, click the dialog launcher (the little arrow on the bottom right) of the Footnotes group.</p>
<p>To insert a custom footnote:&nbsp;In the Footnote and Endnote dialog box, click in the "Custom mark" box and click the Symbol button to specify the character that you want. If you want to repeat a character, you can use copy and paste in the "Custom mark" box.</p>

<p>Hi elissab,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible cause of this issue is if a <strong>rule</strong> is set. Kindly check if you have a rule for Outlook and delete it. Here's a

<h2>            10074&#58; We need a fix for the &#34;family safety blocks everything even for admins&#34; bug introduced in 10061</h2>
                    <p>I read that the problem described in http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/10061-no-start-menu-action-center-notifications/6a9ed620-a54b-4c9b-829e-d71823662726 is still present in 10074 (haven't verified this myself
 yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I read correctly, 10074 is being pushed both to the Slow and Fast rings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that my "downgraded from 10061/Fast to 10049/Slow" machine will soon get 10074 and become unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to stop testing, so I would like (us) to get one of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;a workaround (e.g. a means to configure the part of the system responsible for enforcing parental control so that it's just disabled or enables all apps) so that we can resume testing</p>
<p>- a post-10074 bugfix is provided that unlocks everything that becomes unusable due to the bug (start menu, Settings app, notification center, all modern apps including... the Feedback app...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we please get that?</p>

<h2>            Inserting a .pdf into OneNote</h2>
                    I am trying to insert a .pdf into OneNote. I have done this many times and never had a problem but the document I am trying to insert now has narrow margins. &nbsp;The document looks perfect in .pdf form but when I insert it into my notebook on OneNote it cuts
 off the edges. &nbsp;I am not trying to print these documents. &nbsp;I just need them to be completely visible in the notebook just like they are in the .pdf in order to send them up my Chain of Command without missing data. &nbsp;It is not the page size or paper size setting.

            Hi Angie,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information.<br />
<br />
I suggest you check<strong> Print setting</strong> in your pdf file: open your pdf file in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC &gt; Ctrl+P. Then the prompt will be shown as below:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bf9a803-f453-4595-bd3f-7f13eb4a1cd9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bf9a803-f453-4595-bd3f-7f13eb4a1cd9" /></a><br />
At the combo box of Printer, Select ‘<strong>Send To OneNote 2016</strong>’, alter ‘<strong>Custom Scale</strong>’ and then thumbnails on the right. After that, it will show how it appears in OneNote. At last, click<strong> Print</strong> to insert into OneNote.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jason

I am having this issue with Microsoft Home &amp; Student 2016 on a relatively new Dell PC running Windows 10. I am unable to open .xlsx or .xls files in Excel by double-clicking them. Excel is not listed as an available option for opening .xlsx or .xls files with
 either the "Open with..." option or by using "Choose default apps by file type". Manually choosing EXCEL.EXE when using "Look for another app on this PC" to open such files with has not worked either. When I attempt doing that, I just get a message informing
 me that, "This file does not have an app associated with it for performing this action. Please install an app or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Apps Settings page." I can only open .xlsx and .xls files by first opening Excel,
 then opening such files through Excel, but not by any other means - which is rather frustrating. I only have the one version of Office installed on my PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my internet searches in an attempt resolving this, the issue appears to be a common one. I have tried every imaginable fix I have seen so far online to resolve this issue, other than manually making registry changes on my PC. So far I have done
 Office Quick Repair and Online Repair attempts, as well as uninstalling Office completely, restarting my PC and reinstalling Office, and also using the file association fix tool provided by Microsoft. In addition, I have tried running System File Check, Scan
 &amp; Repair System Files and DISM to see if that would help at all, but the issue was not resolved after running those tools - which did not appear to show any issues that required repair in any case. I'm not sure what else I can try. Any further advice on resolving
 this frustrating issue would be much appreciated. </p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem.&nbsp; I have had Microsoft support work on this issue for the last 6-8 hours.&nbsp; I am curious if this was a recent update gone rogue.<br />

            It is definitely possible that this is an issue caused by a recent update. I had no issue opening .xlsx or .xls files by double-clicking them previously. It has been awhile (months, maybe?) since I have been working with my previously saved Excel files
 in these two formats, so I do not know which update may have been the one to cause this issue. I can't even be certain that a MS update is what caused the issue, but I am highly suspicious that is the case. It would not be the first time a Windows 10 update
 has caused me some issues. Was MS support, after all those hours working on the issue, able to resolve it for you?<br />

<p>They originally fixed the issue.&nbsp; Something about an online app conflicting with the Office 2016.&nbsp; Was working for about 1 week.&nbsp; Then same thing.&nbsp; I have had 2 technicians see if they can fix the issue with no avail.&nbsp; Now I will be sent to a level 3 technician.&nbsp;
 This is extremely frustrating.&nbsp; Anyone else find a fix with this issue?<br />

<h2>            How turn off Call Quality Survey</h2>
                    My co-workers and I work remotely and are constantly using Skype during the day.&nbsp; The call quality survey comes up almost every call.&nbsp; How can that be turned off.&nbsp; It is extremely annoying and we always give one star with no feedback to exit as quickly
 as we can.&nbsp; I'm sure most everyone else does too so you can't be getting very good data from it and by the looks of similar questions, you're also upsetting your users.

            I've tried... but when I click "Send Feedback" in Skype, it opens the Feedback Hub page and then just sits and spins forever.&nbsp; I never get a content page to come up.&nbsp; Between that and the fact that every post I can find regarding turning off the Call Quality
 Survey is "locked", it seems Microsoft doesn't want to hear about how many people are upset by not being able to turn it off.

<h2>            Nokia 6131 connectivity problem PC&#47;mobile</h2>
                    Nokia support cannot solve this problem either, so my hopes are now in the hands of this Forum.<br />
<br />
My computer (XP) can no longer connect with my Nokia 6131.<br />
<br />
I have cleaned with the special PC Suite 6 Cleaner link and also cleaned with CCleaner. I have uninstalled and re-installed<br />
<br />
- PC Suite 6 (latest version),<br />
- PC Connectivity (latest version)<br />
- Connectivity Cable (latest version)<br />
- Uninstalled all firewire<br />
<br />
This is what happens when connecting the mobile to the PC (XP):<br />
<br />
Cabel CA-53 + mobile -&gt; PC "new firmware found. Nokia 6131 USB Phone Parent". A second later this error messages appears: "A serious problem accoured when installing this firmware".<br />
<br />
BUT mobile + cabel is working perfectly on OTHER computers!<br />
<br />
Has anyone a solution to this problem? Is there a program blocking the connectivity with the mobile/cable?

            This is what it sais when trying to connect with the mobile /computer.<br />
<br />
"There was a problem installing this hardware. Nokia 6131 USB phone Parent. An error occurred during the installation of the device. Fatal error during installation"<br />
<br />
<br />
It has worked perfectly and as I wrote before, the firmware + cabel works prefectly on other computers.
