<h2>            PC freezes randomly &#40;Intel 6600k, z170, windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My new PC has been freezing randomly even when it is not under heavy load (it even happened when I was writing this post), my build is this:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
gigabyte z170n-gaming 5<br />
Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 2666MHz (PC4-21300) C16<br />
Intel Boxed Core I5-6600K 3.50 GHz cooled with Corsair Hydro Series H55<br />
EVGA GeForce GTX 950 2GB SC+ GAMING<br />
EVGA 700B bronce PSU</p>
<p>Samsung 840 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD</p>
<p>Windows 10 64 bits<br />
<br />
The CPU is around 68 F, the motherboard 83 F and the GPU 106 F. I have changed the power setting "Turn off hard disk after" to never, as i read that this may be an issue. I have to turn off the PC since reset is not even working when it happens.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help or advice is appreciated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Fernando</p>

            <p>I had similar problems with both my and the wife's builds. </p>
<p>She's running an Asus z170 Hero with a 6600k and I'm running an Asus z170 Formula with a 6700k. Both with 850 evos for the OS, an 850 evo for apps/games, a caviar blue for local storage, and 32gb of Corsair Vengeance 2666.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had issues with freezing, memory usage, cpu usage, and random bsod (primarily on reboots).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After countless hours troubleshooting and trying to track down the root cause of the issues, getting rid of windows 10 fixed it for me.</p>

<h2>            Zip codes beginning with a &#34;0&#34; in databse lists</h2>
                    In using Database for mailings lists how can you add zip codes that begin with a "0", ie 02652.&nbsp; The entry comes out as 2652, which the Post Office won"t accept. Adding a character such as *02652 can be entered but the PO won't accept this either. Someone
 suggested adding an invisible character at the beginning but how do you do that.

<p><span>BillandJane,</span></p>
<p><span>You can use the following syntax for searching: “*”.&lt;File extension&gt;<br />
For example:<br />
i. *234033.jpg -&gt; searches for file which has the content 234033<br />
ii. 234033*.jpg-&gt; searches for files which starts with 234033</span></p>
<p><span>This also works in XP search with “0” as the first character.
</span></p>
<p><span>Which program are using in which you are not having success?</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to hearing back from you.

    <title>Windows 10 and parallel port &#40;LPT&#41; printer doesn&#39;t print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> io.sys  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and parallel port &#40;LPT&#41; printer doesn&#39;t print</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated all my computers to Windows 10 and now I have a problem that none of my Windows 10 computers can print anymore. Before the update my computers were running Windows 7 where printing worked just fine.&nbsp;I have now tried many different computers,
 from different manufacturers, all running Windows 10, x86 and x64 versions, none works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer is HP LaserJet 4300n, connected via parallel port (LPT). Since everything worked before Win10 update I must conclude that the hardware is intact and this is a problem in Windows 10, maybe something with the old LPT printer port support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When connecting the printer, Windows recognizes the device, automatically installs drivers for it, and shows that it is connected. So everything looks good this far.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the printer does not print. If I print something, e.g. a test page from printers settings, I can see very briefly how the file is put into the print queue, from where it disappears quickly. No print, no errors, no any messages. Also, nothing happens
 on the printer's LCD screen while sent to printer, and there is nothing in the printer's error log.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; Microsoft did fix their initial problem with the LPT1 legacy port, and one way that I used to get around this was to purchase an LPT to USB conversion cable from Best Buys (on-line) for about $10. The hook up is simple and you can even use the same connection
 to connect your printer directly&nbsp;to any router that has printer support.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The alternative is to purchase an old LPT1 card but I suspect it would not work under Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; LPT1 Legacy Printer support was a critical issue for businesses that still used legacy dot matrix printers with multi-part forms and Microsoft did come to the table to fix this.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 goes sleep mode and eventually it becomes shutdown. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redgallows  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 goes sleep mode and eventually it becomes shutdown.</h2>
                    <p>I call this issue "Windows 10&nbsp;goes sleep mode and eventually it&nbsp;becomes shutdown."</p>
<p>I was upgraded from windows 7 to 10. Power button is assigned to perform "sleep" instead of shutdown. It's working fine in Windows 7.</p>
<p>However PC is acting weird after upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still goes to "sleep" when pressing power button, wake up from sleep mode as usual, but it only works within a certain time after going to sleep.</p>
<p>If I put PC in sleep mode over night,&nbsp;then I press power button, it looks like it's booting up from shutdown.</p>
<p>I have looked everywhere in the setting, try to find if there anything defines the behavior but in vain.</p>
<p>Is there anyone encountering similar issue?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup
 Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

<p>Sorry, but this is unbelievable. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen the same situation arising under different user accounts now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to think that, &nbsp;Microsoft, *<strong>is</strong>* pushing down apps to us, in order to inflate user download statistics - which therefore makes a mockery of their AppStore &nbsp;popularity stats- and hence will eventually impact their Share Price,
 or result in another European/elsewhere fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please stop it MS. It is just not right. Let us choose what we wish to download and don't push down stuff we don't need., or want! Do we no longer have Freedom of choice ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And some of your Staff here also think that they know better, their responses are effectively treating us with disrespect, especially when they dont read the original message content &nbsp;- their attitude is really bad, it is a very poor reflection upon MS as
 a whole, &nbsp;more-so if it continues as such. &nbsp;(Though I guess, you don't really care).</p>

<p>To let Microsoft know you don't like them, use the Feedback App in Windows 10.</p>

            Hey there, Michelle
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. 
<br />
<br />I will try and help you with this, but may be a little rusty :)
<br />
<br />Please can you answer the following:
<br /> 1. What version of Windows have you got installed?
<br /> 2. Can you see your other profile on start screen?
<br /> 3. Can you see your other profiles files by going to: File Explorer &gt; This  PC &gt; C Drive &gt; Users?
<br />
<br />Regards,       
        </p>

            Its a bug thats been occurring a lot in the latest release.
<br />
<br />Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Try creating a local account: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-local-account-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-local-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. I am Rob, and together we should be able to fix the temporary profile problem.
<br />
<br />That usually means something corrupted your profile such as a 3rd party 
<br /> antivirus, Google Updater, or other intrusive programs (even malware).
<br /> Note in every case I have seen in all Windows versions it has been an
<br /> outside influence and not something in Windows that caused such an 
<br /> issue.
<br />
<br />If needed create a new Admin Account and copy your files to it.
<br />
<br />You can use the Built-In Admin Account to create your profile and to move files (however do not use this account on a regular basis because if it corrupts you are toast).

<br />
<br />==================================================
<br />
<br />If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).
<br />
<br />In the instructions of the link below use these instead of #3. Follow all the others under Work Group (if you are on a Domain you should be working with TechNet).
<br />
<br />3. In 8/8.1 and 10 use File Explorer - Click on the Drive where users are (usually C:\ ) - then View tab - tick Hidden Items box &amp; on far upper right of ribbon Options - Change folder and Search options.
<br />
<br />Fix a corrupted user profile &lt;- method works on Windows 7 and Windows 8 - Windows 10 also.

            ubuntu installer has changed something called the partition map, its the identification of each of the hard drive partitions. ubuntu installer took the boot identification away from the partition where windows installed, and put it in the new partition
 it made to install Ubuntu on. get into ubuntu and use a disk manager to change the partition map and make the partition where windows installed bootable as well

<h2>            Windows firewall&#58; e-mail is on, yet inbound port 143 &#40;imap&#41; is blocked</h2>
                    <p>How do I get my hMailServer to work and allow the other pcs on my home network connect to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The control panel interface to allow apps to communicate through the firewall has tick-marks in all the check-boxes for "Mail and calendar" and "Mail and accounts". Yet the hMailServer only works if I turn the firewall off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have four computers in a local network, and I run an IMAP mail server (hMailServer) on one pc. This server downloads my email from external pop3 mail-boxes, and allows mail clients on the local network to access the mail store. This worked great until
 I installed Windows 10, and I turned on Windows Defender because Norton 360 had problems. Now I want to configure the Windows firewall, but cannot find a usable interface to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The interface I would prefer would have a list of rules in the order of application, and the rules would show the actual port numbers they apply to. Titles like "Mail and calendar" (my translation from the Norwegian "Epost og kalender") do not tell what
 TCP ports will be affected when I turn them on or off.</p>

    <title>DVD Writer not working after upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DVD Writer not working after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an HP Envy laptop that I upgraded to windows 10 when it first came out. Ever since this upgrade my DVD drive will not read discs. I never thought it could have anything to do with the update until I recently came across other threads stating that
 the update messed some stuff up. I was gong to use the Microsoft Fix It tool to try and solve my issue, but I see that it is not available for windows 10. Kind of odd seeing as how all the advertising for windows 10 is the reason I upgraded in the first place.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

</p><p><strong>Try Manually fix corrupted registry entries and check if it helps:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This problem may be caused by two Windows registry entries that have become corrupted. To use Registry Editor to delete the corrupted Registry entries, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows logo key + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> dialog box.</li><li>Type <span>regedit</span> in the <strong>Run</strong> dialog box, then press Enter. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click

<div>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</div>
</li><li>In the right pane, click <strong>UpperFilters</strong>. <br />
<br />
<span>Note</span> You may also see an UpperFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry. Click
<strong>UpperFilters</strong> only. If you do not see the UpperFilters registry entry, you still might have to remove the LowerFilters registry entry. To do this, go to step 7.</li><li>On the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, click <strong>Delete</strong>.</li><li>When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>In the right pane, click <strong>LowerFilters</strong>.<br />
<br />

<p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps
 carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in

<p><span>Hi spud75,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows Media Player, the reason why the chapters are changing from 1 to 10 is, media player recognize track number starting
 from 00, 01, 02,……., so Media Player searches for track number 02, as this is not there it will jump to 10. The above statement is applicable if your chapters are named in a manner like that, if not try sorting playlist entries by following the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To sort playlist entries</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Be sure the Player is in full mode. (If you are in skin mode, press CTRL+1 to switch back to full mode.)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Library.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Contents pane, expand My Playlists, right-click the name of the playlist that you want to change, and then click Edit.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The track names from the selected playlist appear in the Now Playing List in the List pane, and the Now Playing List label at the top of the List pane changes to the name
 of your playlist.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the playlist name above the List pane, click Sort, and then click one of the following options:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>By Name</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>By Artist</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>By Album</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>By Rating</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>By File Name</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the playlist name above the List pane again, and then click Save Playlist.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about sorting items in your library, see

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that there is a conflict between the application and the driver. For better assistance, we would like to clarify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the exact error message that you've received when trying to play the application?</li><li>Are you pertaining to Teredo adapter?</li><li>What do you mean by legacy drivers? Are you trying to reinstall Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapters and Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting to your reply.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Controller becomes unresponsive when left idle for a few seconds</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">I have an Xbox one controller I had purchased less than 3 months ago that I connect via Bluetooth to my pc (Win10) . It used to work perfectly fine until recently. Now while using it whether it be in
 game or in steam big picture, mode if I pause or leave the controller idle (say for example during a game cut scene) even for a few seconds (3 second or so) it stops responding. The lights on it are on and static indicating it's detecting connected to the
 PC. To make it work again I have to alt+Tab out of the game and alt+Tab back in. It also doesn't automatically connect when I turn it on until I open the bluetooth pairing menu in Windows 10. I am suspecting it's got something to do with the new windows update
 since that is the only thing that's changed since the last time it was working. I am yet to test it with USB and can't try the official dongle since I don't have it. The controller is updated. I have tried the troubleshooting steps at:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-and-troubleshoot-xbox-one-bluetooth-issues-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect

<p>Hello Aditya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Are you part of the windows insider program? By any chance, do you have a second controller to test out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end if all troubleshooting failed, that controller has 3 months of warranty on it if it was bought brand new. You will not be able to<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> set up your own repair
</a>without an xbox one console to register to your account first. This console can be out of warranty, that's fine, it is just needed to set up accessory orders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>If you do not have a console to register, please <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 also takes forever. Everything was fine 36 hours ago. Also, restore won't restore. &nbsp;The computer, less than 13 months old. Any ideas?&nbsp;

</p><p><span><span>Hi, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand that you are facing multiple issues on your pc. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you make any changes to the pc prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you installed all pending updates on the pc?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In which user account are you facing this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you get any error message while trying to restore the pc?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sign out from the current user account, restart the pc and login to the Admin account or the MSA to test if that helps with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also suggest you to install any pending Windows updates on the pc to check if that helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further, you may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there
 are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting
 automatically.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience caused to you and will assist you in trying&nbsp;to solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you&nbsp;to login to your Microsoft&nbsp;account in account.live.com website&nbsp;and refresh the&nbsp;Family and other user tab and check if the child's account has been added. If not suggest you to resend the invitation&nbsp;to the child account and check if he can accept
 the invitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to write to us for any other assistance with Windows, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Same error message here.&nbsp; Last week I added 3 children to my family successfully, and on the 4th one I started getting this message, sometimes when I click on the link in the email, and sometimes it goes to the accounts.live.com page and when I click on
 the option to join the family then I get this error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am doing this to add children to my family for getting Family Safety to work in Windows 10.&nbsp; I already had it working in Windows 7, so I click on the Windows 7 family member, and follow the steps of logging on to the newly created Microsoft account for
 that family member (Step 1), then going back to my parent account and typing in the child's Microsoft account email address to have the invitation to join the family sent (Step 2), then going back to the child's login and Microsoft account and clicking on
 the link in the invitation email, which is where the error pops up and I can't do anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another detail is that the other 3 children (for which this process worked without the error message), already had Microsoft (Outlook) email addresses.&nbsp; The 4th child didn't yet have one, so I created a new Outlook email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This child cannot use the computer until this problem gets resolved.&nbsp; It is infuriating, that I had Family Safety working in Windows 7 and all was well in our household, and then I was bombarded by all these plugs to update to Windows 10, and then finally
 when&nbsp;my holiday vacation days start and I have time to update to Windows 10, it doesn't work and we are stuck.&nbsp; I have spend several nights staying up trying to get this to work.&nbsp; This is highway robbery of our family's holiday time, to give us something that
 doesn't really add benefit, and still doesn't work.</p>

    <title>Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information &#40;in the registry&#41; is incomplete or damaged. &#40;Code 19&#41; when trying to install Microsoft BT Dongle and Asus BT211</h2>
                    This is driving me crazy! I've installed a Logitech BT dongle sometime back and I'm trying to now remove that and install a&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;or Asus BT dongle/hub. PnP doesn't work nor does the troubleshooter. I've reinstalled the new drivers and it still doesn't
 work.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've removed the Logitech software and the funny thing is that the Bluetooth (for Logitech) doesn't show in the Device manager and its working so I can't disable/uninstall. I think its running with a microsoft driver??
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried removing the logitech device and rebooting and still can't install the new BT dongles.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried reinstalling Logitech drivers and it hangs at 23% of the install process (Installing BT hub).</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help would be appreciated.</div>

    <title>Nvidia Optimus Laptop 60 FPS lock in DX11 games. Has it been - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dastardlycoxcomb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nvidia Optimus Laptop 60 FPS lock in DX11 games. Has it been fixed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I opted in for a free upgrade to Windows 10 when it got offered and I was pretty happy except for one issue: forced 60 FPS framerate lock in DirectX11 games. I searched and found that the issue was only present for users of older-generation Nvidia
 laptop dGpus that used Nvidia Optimus. The pool of people using Nvidia Optimus laptops isn't huge, the number of people for whom 60 FPS lock on a 60 Hz display is an issue is even smaller, and it only manifested in Dx11 games so... basically neither Nvidia
 nor Microsoft bothered to fix the issue at the time. And so I downgraded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System</strong>: MSI GT70 - 0NE, i-7 3630QM @ 3.2 Ghz, GTX680M 4GB, Intel HD4000?, 8GB stock ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Description of the issue</strong>: It was a normal 60 FPS framerate lock, not V-Sync. No I didn't use and forget about external framerate limiters. Nothing that I tried could solve the issue - if it ran on DX11, it had a 60 FPS framerate lock, much
 to my chagrin since the things that I played on DX11 were mostly competitive shooters.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Has the issue since been fixed or do I have to stay bound to Windows 7 forever?</strong> I'm sorry if this question has already been answered, this is so niche that I have trouble finding topics even acknowledging the problem. I just repaired my
 laptop and would like to install Win10, but this issue is a dealbreaker.</p>

<p>Hi Dastardly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you are experiencing this issue is due to some background applications that affects your FPS games. To address this concern, we suggest performing a clean boot.
<span><span>You can try to determine which background program is causing the problem while the computer is in clean boot mode.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To determine which background program is causing the issue, start by turning off all drivers, third-party programs or services, and startup items that load with Windows. If you'll not experience the issue, turn back on half of these services
 to try to isolate the interfering service. If the issue is not resolved at this point, you will repeat this process until you have isolated the interfering service. Finally, if you are able to determine which specific program or service is causing the issue,
 contact the program manufacturer to determine whether there is a solution. You can also disable the program or service to address the issue.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform a clean boot, visit this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-my/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the steps and further information.

<p>I've just tested it on a clean Windows 10 install with only Steam and Rainbow 6 Siege running. It's still locked to 60 in DX11 games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already explained that this has nothing to do with background programs or any of my settings. This issue only exists in Windows 10 on Nvidia Optimus GPUs in DX11 games, regardless of Nvidia driver version. I can run DX11 games without the 60 FPS lock
 on the integrated Intel GPU, so it's obvious that the issue is on Nvidia's and Microsoft's ends. Nvidia appear to be ignoring it and Microsoft don't appear to even acknowledge it.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for your assistance, but I will stick with Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Logitech keyboard accidentally removed</h2>
                    I accidentally removed my logitech wireless keyboard from my new computer with Windows Pro and since I recently purchased it already installed, now I don't have a disk to reinstall it. Can you help me reload it. I typed this with the on screen keyboard.
 Thanks, I will wait to hear your answer.

    <title>Windows 10 start menu has changed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcooper615  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 start menu has changed</h2>
                    <p>I've updated to Window 10 on all my computers and everything is fine except on my laptop.&nbsp; All of a sudden my start menu has changed and looks like it did with Windows 8.&nbsp; My other computers on the start menu shows Most Used, Life at a Glance (a lot of Apps)
 and settings, etc.&nbsp; My laptop start menu looks like the old Windows 8 start menu and I prefer the new Windows 10 start menu.&nbsp; What happened and how do I get back the Windows 10 start menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A side problem, is that my Microsoft Edge icon disappeared from the task bar.&nbsp; I've researched the community on how to get it back but since I have on apps on my start menu, I can't right click and drop it into my task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any help on these 2 areas.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Cooper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry to hear the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Have checked whether the Tablet Mode is enabled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the issue might due to active status of Tablet Mode on your system. Follow the below mentioned steps to check the status of Tablet mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Go to the <strong>S</strong><strong>ystem tray</strong> on your taskbar, click on
<strong>Notification</strong> Icon (I.e. Next to Time and Date).</p>
<p>* If Tablet mode is enabled, unselect it by click on <strong>Tablet Mode</strong>.</p>
<p>* Click the <strong>Start Button</strong> post that and check if&nbsp;issue fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To appear Microsoft Edge on your taskbar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Press <strong>Windows key</strong> , type <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> in the search bar</p>
<p>* When the <strong>Microsoft Edge </strong>appears in the list<strong>, </strong>
right click on it and select<strong> Pin to taskbar.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will address your query.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As for as the Microsoft Edge problem, I find Microsoft Edge but it has no icon next to it and when I right click on Microsoft Edge it will not pin to the task bar.&nbsp; Is there somewhere that I can designate Microsoft Edge as my default browser?&nbsp; I went to

            Cindy, what is the exact message that would tell you to uninstall your BIOS?  I've never heard of this?  You should run with the latest BIOS Update for your PC serial Number from the HP Website.  
<br />
<br />This is likely another bug in the buggy Windows Upgrade Assistant which is why I recommend avoiding it to run the Upgrade manually from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates.  
<br />
<br />You can also wait a few days until the Spring Creators Update version is released and do the same with it to be fully up to date. 
<br />
<br />Then I seriously doubt the nag message will come back as they rarely do when you abandon the Upgrade Assistant.

<h2>            Trying to get Spotlight to only show pictures of Animals or Birds &#63;</h2>
                    Seen one picture so far and clicked not a fan on everything else but the system seems to refuse to show me any more animal photos, is there a page or option I can enter to really dial this in and tell it to shove its landscape photo's up its USB port and
 get it to only show me animals, birds, fish ?
