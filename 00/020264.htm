    <title>PowerPoint output resolution limit &#40;for ultra-wide event - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PowerPoint output resolution limit &#40;for ultra-wide event screen&#41;</h2>
                    I am beginning to prepare a keynote presentation for an event with a VERY large screen. The multi-projector presentation resolution will be 1080x6480. Assuming PowerPoint generates an output of 96dpi, the slides size ought to be 11.25x67.50 inches. However,
 since the maximum slide size is 56in square, giving me a maximum width of only 5376 pixels, does that mean I cannot reach the target resolution?

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&gt;&gt; While I agree PPT is capable of producing a resolution to match a device/driver's settings, isn't it true that it samples a raster image at the fixed size of OS/PPT dpi&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">usually
 96&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;– times the inch-size on the slide?</span></p>
<p>When you insert the image into PPT, do you mean? &nbsp;No, but the default is to compress images on save, either to 96 or 220 dpi. &nbsp;Glad you mentioned this, because you'll *DEFINITELY* want to turn compression off ( File | Options | Advanced
 | Image Size and Quality section ... put a check next to "Do not compress images in file" ) &nbsp;You have to do this for each new file you create, or if you want to make it the application-wide default, do some registrywiggling, explained here:</p>
<p>
PowerPoint makes pictures blurry or unsharp, loses GIF animation<br />
<a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00862_PowerPoint_2007_and_2010_make_pictures_blurry-_loses_GIF_animation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00862_PowerPoint_2007_and_2010_make_pictures_blurry-_loses_GIF_animation.htm</a>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>&gt;&gt; As evidenced by the fact that you see pixel stretching if you use the "Grow" animation (MS developers at the Summit confirmed this), doesn't it follow that if you are not maximizing the resolution of your raster image (or slide size), PowerPoint
 will be stretching the output?</span></p>
<p>Not really; what you see in the Grow animation is PowerPoint effectively grabbing the image *as it currently exists on your computer screen* and enlarging it to perform the Grow. &nbsp;A defect in the Grow animation algorithm more than evidence
 of how PPT handles images internally.</p>

                    <p>I have just purchased an Office 365 Personal subscription which gives me Outlook.com Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connected my custom domain email from another provider via IMAP and have pulled in all of my email, but I cannot now remove the connected account. When I click on the delete button, the system goes through the motions, but the account doesn’t delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Chrome, Edge and Firefox web browsers to no avail, and searches suggest that Microsoft engineers themselves often end up getting involved to rectify this type of issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone assist please asap as I cannot reconfigure my custom domain at present so may lose important emails.</p>

            Same problem for me. It started yesterday when I tried to connect my gmail to outlook.com. This worked but it was not completing the sync&nbsp; so I tried deleting. This doesn't work. So it doesn't update and I can't remove it.

<p>
</p><p>After upgrading&nbsp;to Office 2016, folders no longer appear in the Recent places list (when I click

<h2>            My Microsoft Word script has become all mix top, and is almost unusalble</h2>
                    <p><span>Any ideas what may be causing this? How can I fix it?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve been having problems writing with Word for the last few days.</span></p>

<p><span>The letters and words don’t keep the correct space</span></p>

<p><span>Often letters are missing</span></p>
<p><span>The letters keep changing more than usual</span></p>

<p><span>While I write, the page keeps rolling up to the edge of the top ruler.</span></p>

<p><span>The page layout keeps changing to a different layout</span></p>

<p><span>You can see in this post what I mean with the mixed up script</span></p>
<p><span>(But it appears that when&nbsp;I copy here from Word, all is OK) I will take a screen shot of the original&nbsp;post I wrote on Word,&nbsp;to see if it shows the discrepancies</span></p>
<p><span>I thought it was something I had set up wrong, or that&nbsp;it was me skipping letters, but I have chequed all I could but could not find what was wrong.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I really noticed something was wrong today, when I started to get an error message everytime I tried to open a photograph from pictures, which I will post below as a screen shot</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;I went to MY Documents, and found that all my saved Docs from before have changed the script the same way. The worst part is that, it won't let me fix the script if I try.</span></p>

            <p>Try changing the zoom slowly, zooming both larger and smaller. I wonder if it is just an issue with the display size "falling between the cracks" of your laptop display resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that you are using 11 pt Verdona font as your Normal Style.&nbsp; Try selecting a block of text and changing the font to something else, say Times New Roman. Does that help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that you don't have Verdana font installed?&nbsp; Go to File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Advanced option. Scroll down to "Show document Content" section and click on the "Font Substitution" button. Is Verdana in there?&nbsp; I don't expect it to be, I
 recreated part of your document and the font looks similar, even though I don't have the same display issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try printing a page from a few sample documents to see if they print correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Giving us the screen capture is good. It clearly shows the issue. Could you upload a sample file to your OneDrive and share it with us, giving us an Edit link so we can download it and "play" with it.</p>

            <p>Hi Rohn,</p>
<p>Actually, I have Word set up on Verdana 12. But my font is changing at will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what you mean to post a view of the screen. You mean my whole desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have to say that I have never used my OneDrive. Isn't that the cloud? I will share, but I would need someone to tell me how to do it. Could you help with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I went to try to write something to see if there were any changes and I got the same error message plus these 2 other ones:</p>
<p>

            <p>"Post a view",&nbsp; would mean doing a screen capture. But I don't see where you got the statement from.&nbsp; Normally you don't need to capture the whole screen, unless it is a whole screen issue. Instead, it is better to focus in on the problem area.&nbsp; I see you
 already know how to upload images to the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen caps you posted just mean that something you are doing is making "too many" changes to your file, more changes than Word can handle so that the UNDO option will not be available if you continue with the change.&nbsp; Typically they show up when you
 are doing a find and replace that affects many words. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upload a file for sharing, make sure there is nothing sensitive or private in the file.&nbsp; You can edit out sensitive info or just create a new example file to show the problem.&nbsp; It helps if you Include notes inside of the example to tell us exactly
 what to look for and what you are expecting to see.&nbsp; The sample file does not have to be long, unless you think the problem is related to file size.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes OneDrive is the name of the MS "Cloud" service.&nbsp; If you have an MS email account, like Hotmail or Outlooklive, then you automatically have an associated OneDrive account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Just type oneDrive.com into your browser address window.&nbsp; Sometimes it will log you in "automatically", or use your email address and password to log in.&nbsp;
</li><li>There is an "Upload" button on the menu bar. </li><li>When the file is uploaded, right click on the file name and select "Share" from the context menu.
</li><li>In the Share dialog, select "Get a Link".There should be 2 links, "view only" and "edit"</li><li>Click on shorten link under the "Edit" box,</li><li>select and copy the generated link</li><li>Paste it into a reply in this forum</li></ul>
<p>The edit link allows us to download and edit the file. We need to be able to do that to do all of the investigation we can.&nbsp; The View link gives the person read only, no download, access to the file.

            <p><span>Hi, I must have misunderstood something about uploading the screen. Sorry about that.&nbsp;Here is my update.</span></p>
<p><span>I had Geek Squad to look my computer via internet. They worked for close to 5 hours.</span></p>
<p><span>They uninstalled and installed Office 2010</span></p>
<p><span>They repaired Office 2010 twice</span></p>
<p><span>The trouble shooted overnight until it appeared that it was fixed</span></p>
<p><span>This morning, it seemed to be working OK, but in minutes it went back to the same.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem seem to be with my fonts</span></p>
<p><span>I usually use Verdana 11 or 12 as default (not sure now) but now when I click where you change fonts, or in the area where you go to set a default, there are only these&nbsp;2 options:</span></p>
<p><span>Cambria headings</span></p>
<p><span>Calibri body</span></p>
<p><span>I had managed to get all the old fonts back, but they don’t stay, when I try to set them as default I get the message that says that there is not enough memory or disk space to complete the operation.</span></p>
<p><span>I have plenty of space in my drive. So, I don’t know. You still want me to upload this on OneDrive?</span></p>

            <p>Hi Doug, I gave your advise a try. I tried Office 2010 "repair" twice, and that didn't help. I had Office uninstalled and reinstalled and that didn't work either. Me and also Geek Squad did a lot of trouble shooting, but nothing seems to&nbsp;fix the problem.

            <p>Hi Doug, I did try the Safe Mode. Word opened to a blue page were nothing could get clicked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relating to link, I started the troubleshooting and did the Mr Fix it thing, and that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the rest has to do with Registry. My Microsoft office Repair was run 4 times in total. It was uninstalled and reinstalled completely twice, with no luck. Could it be possible that Office or Word is not the problem, but Windows and some new update that
 may not be compatible with the program? I have not downloaded the 10 Upgrade yet, and Microsoft keeps pushing for the download. I have been getting tons of new Updates, and I don't know what they are. Could any of those updates be the culprit. Have you heard
 of anybodyelse having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen other people with the same problem, but that has been in past years, and you would think that what ever the problem is would have been fixed already</p>
<p>
</p><p>OH Please what else can I do. Would doing a Windows Recover help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Since you have done Office Repair, re-install and start in safe mode,&nbsp; the next thing I would suggest is trying to use OffCat&nbsp; (Office Configuration Analyzer Tool). It may help find unpublished, still in development, fixes for your problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Download the appropriate version (32- or 64-bit) and choose the update option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to do a clean install, you'll need a DVD or thumb drive. If you just want to upgrade to Windows 10, just download the tool and choose the update option. This has worked for me 100% of the time so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried some of the other advice on the forums and it will get you the Windows 10 preview. Downloading from the link I posted works every time and gives you the production release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After getting past the update issue I've found Windows 10 works great.</p>

    <title>Reply and new email font is extra large - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aileanm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reply and new email font is extra large</h2>
                    
<p>Please help one of our computers with microsoft outlook 2003 is displaying text in the new and reply emails much much larger than the actual font setting. The current font setting is at 10pt and is showing that way to recipients of outgoing emails. The large
 font is annoying and more difficult to read but the real problem is that it will not wrap the font. I have repeatedly gone to view&gt;options&gt; and checked the box to apply wrap text. This works for one outgoing email only before it resets. We cannot get this
 change to stick. Does anyone out there&nbsp; have a solution for the large font and non-wrapping text?</p>
<p>Other&nbsp;background information. The computer in question is used by an elderly gentleman and the windows display is set for low screen resolution with extra large font. This setting has not preiviously effected outlook and when changed to normal resolution/font
 size has no effect on this problem.</p>
<p>Also going to view&gt;arange by&gt;current view does not allow us to alter these settings.</p>
<p>Does anyone out there&nbsp; have a solution for the large font and non-wrapping text?</p>

            Did you check the zoom setting? Ctrl+mouse wheel will change the zoom level in most apps.

    <title>Outlook 2007 Remember Password checkbox is missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lraz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 Remember Password checkbox is missing</h2>
                    <p>Company moved to hosted Exchange environment&nbsp;last summer (NOT outlook.com, office 365, etc).&nbsp;When setting up the new profile on some systems, the "Remember Password" checkbox was not available. (Others systems had no problems, created new profile and checkbox
 was there.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since had this problem when setting up&nbsp;'new'&nbsp;OL on new systems, which tells me the problem seen last summer was not related to something on those existing machines. Problem was seen on both WinXP Pro and Win7 Pro O/S.&nbsp; Users are able to enter credentials
 and successfully access Exchange server, just cannot save password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that all the affected instances are Open/Volume License installations. In fact, I have had the problem in&nbsp;volume license&nbsp;versions of both OL2003 and OL2007. I downloaded a clean copy of Office 2007 Standard from VLC yesterday, burned to DVD, installed
 on next system. Still no checkbox. Tried checking option to require password every time then unchecking, did not fix the problem. Systems purchased with Office installed do not have this problem, when creating new profile on these systems using identical setup
 steps,&nbsp;the Remember Password checkbox IS there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched many forums but as yet have not found a solution. This is not a case of losing the password or asking for credentials after it was once working - this occurs during initial profile setup, whether new install or new profile on existing install.
 The checkbox to Remember Password just is not there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All thoughts and suggestions welcome!&nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            Check out this <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/7991391d-b371-44fb-9ee1-6820859c5fc7/outlook-doesnt-save-passwords-on-hosted-exchange?forum=exchange2010hosters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
technet </a>thread, similar problem I think. Open credential manager, add the domain of the host exchange system, i.e., *.myhosted.exchange.com, their user name and their password. Another thing to check is if you have a GP setting disabling Outlook from saving
 passwords. You'd have to explicitly add the GPO templates for office 2007 and turn it on to enable this; it's not something that would likely get turned on by accident. The path in the group policy editor is:
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 -&gt; Security -&gt; Disable Remember Password</div>
<div><br />
<div>Registry location (if the policy is applied):</div>
<div><br />
<div>HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\Security -&gt; EnableRemberPwd Key (0 no remember, 1 remember)</div>

            <p>Thanks for the quick response! I had already tried credentials on a system I set up last week, but tried it a little differently on this one in case I did something wrong on that one. Adding credentials did not fix it, tried both *.hostname.com and the actual
 server name as showing in email account information. &nbsp;I did check to make sure I had entered username and password correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No registry entry there, would have had to enter in GP for both Outlook2007 and 2003. And that would&nbsp;have been more effort that the consultants setting up my domain server put into it.</p>

            <p>I've been playing with this as time allows over the past 2 weeks. I created the above registry entry, found other registry entries which I have also tried: HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook -&gt;SavePassword (1) and HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\Security
 -&gt; PromptforCredentials (0 to not prompt). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I had it working on one computer, but after a few times not prompting for a password, it reverted back to the login box. I've been trying these fixes on another computer and nothing has worked there so far, not even temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have not found a solution, and still do not have the checkbox for "remember my password" or whatever the wording is on the OL login (don't remember the wording as you don't see that screen when it's working, and the option isn't there when it isn't
 working!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas are most welcome!</p>

            <p>Solved! I am very&nbsp;relieved and very very embarrassed to report that the issues are resolved by installing Office 2007 SP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the users with the password-retention problem couldn't access OOF yesterday, which pointed me to AutoDiscover problem. Test E-mail AutoConfiguration failed. Online research yesterday popped a thought in my brain last night, when I wasn't thinking
 about it at all. Quick check this morning confirmed that problem installs were RTM, Rev-, initial release versions, whatever the accepted terminology is.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded &amp; installed SP3 this morning; now 'Remember My Password' checkbox is there, Out of Office works, another missing dialog box related to AutoDiscover now comes up, and Test E-mail AutoConfiguration now passes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never assume that what you download from the manufacturer's website is the latest version....</p>

            <p>Outlook 2007 window 10 with 365Microsoft exchange.</p>
<p>To get Remember Password check box to appear do this.</p>
<p>Run regedit &gt; search for Outlook.&nbsp; Expand the outlook result that has lots of folders.&nbsp; Click Security folder, set the binary code for EnableRememberPwd to 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will give the checkbox on the password popup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have to enter the password after this it is possibly caused from Microsoft using different servers. I assume eventually you will populate them all after a while with the password, not really sure.</p>

    <title>Table of Contents Created in Publisher 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Table of Contents Created in Publisher 2010</h2>
                    <p>At work, I obtained Publisher files that were created in Publisher 2010. &nbsp;The computer now has Publisher 2013; however, I am having problems changing the table of contents in a Newsletter that was created in 2010 while now using 2013. &nbsp;Everything else in
 Publisher 2010/2013 have not seemed to be any problems. &nbsp;Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is the problem because I took the updated files that were updated in 2013 to FedEx Kinkos and they had Publisher 2010 and were able to change the TOC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to do this other than going to FedEx Kinkos every time I need to change the TOC. &nbsp;lol.</p>

            <p>Is Kinkos editing the Table of Contents using Word 2010? Generally you are not able to produce a TOC automatically in Publisher like you can in Word.

<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if the original text document and TOC were produced using Word 2010 and then imported or inserted into Publisher 2010. You then have the option in Publisher to 'Edit Story in MSFT Word' which means the text and TOC are opened again in Word
 where you can edit them. When you save the edits and close Word the changes are then reflected in Publisher. Perhaps this functionality no longer works when you switch to Word and Publisher 2013?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to do away with the original TOC and create one manually, or perhaps you could recreate the Word doc and TOC in Word 2013 and import it into your Publisher 2013 publication.</p>

<strong>more</strong> option (…) next to notebook &gt; <strong>share</strong> &gt; on the pop-up window &gt;
<strong>shared</strong> <strong>with</strong> &gt; select one person &gt; click the <strong>
down</strong> arrow next to the person &gt; stop sharing</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you can do that, the issue may be related to the local OneNote 2013/2016. Please perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Close this notebook in OneNote 2013/2016 &gt; <strong>sign out all the accounts</strong> from Office programs and close Office application.</p>

<p>3. Open the OneNote 2013/2016 &gt; open the notebook and try again.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you can't stop sharing from the browser either. Please provide the following information for analysis.</p>
<p>1. Capture a screenshot of the error message "Sorry, something is preventing us from sharing this. The server couldn't complete this action. Error Code: 0x80004005".</p>

<h2>            I have an issue with open tabs disappearing on Internet Explorer 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Open tabs disappear&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very annoying problem in MSIE10 (in the Modern GUI) is that tabs disappear. This happens when, it seems, one opens "too many" tabs. As soon as one reaches (exceeds) two full rows of tabs, the top row exists no more. Does this mean MSIE cannot handle more
 than 10 open tabs? If so, shouldn't it refuse to open more tabs rather than simply discarding and "forgetting" the once already open?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More details:</p>
<p>Opening links in new tabs opens more tabs. This is how I read news and blogs every morning. Once in a while I end up having more than 10 tabs open. Since each row of open tabs holds only five of them, the eleventh pushes the first row out of sight. That's
 okay, but it is not okay that when closing tabs one will not again see the five tabs in the top row - they are forever gone. And since MSIE10 (Modern) cannot open recently closed tabs (which is also a huge annoyance!), one better hope one has memorized those
 URLs (which, of course, is hardly ever the case).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just experienced this problem again, opening multiple tabs with sites of interest. My first tabs included, among other things, TweetDeck and my webmail. Opening tab #11 pushed the first row of tabs (five of them) out of sight. I opened a total of 12 tabs,
 and thus had two rows of five and two tabs visible, respectively. When closing the tabs one by one, upon closing the second tab, focus is moved to the last tab on the top row (tab #10) but MSIE shows only one row with five tabs. Deleting more tabs doesn't
 change this: there's only one row left, though there should be two. Upon deleting the last tab on this row (which should be open tab #6), MSIE blinks and seems to restart, showing only one blank tab. What happened to the first five open tabs? This happens
 every time, so it seems to be a limitation in the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do any of you know of a solution/fix for this, or will I need to await an update?</p>

WAD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW something else that I wasn't sure of and you have made me check:&nbsp; Desktop History and MUF IE History are related.&nbsp;&nbsp;So you could get your links from Desktop History.&nbsp;&nbsp; But getting it back into MUF IE would not be exactly "fast and fluid":&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click,
 Copy in History.&nbsp;&nbsp; Switch to MUF IE and then right-click Paste and go.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the W8 DP we could actually drag links from the Address bar to the MUF IE Address bar but really that was hardly "fast and fluid" either, especially for me, since my IE Desktop
 is on non-Touch on the left and my MUF IE is on the right, it meant dragging from the far left of a wide-screen monitor all the way across and into the MUF IE Address bar--no clicks or keyboard shortcuts required but not very practical.&nbsp; I&nbsp;imagine the new
 mechanism will seem less awkward the more that I use it.</p>

Well... ctrl-shift-t doesn't work on the on-screen keyboard, at least. And it was confirmed elsewhere at Microsoft Answers that MSIE 10 Modern doesn't support open-recently-closed. What I'm looking for is a non-keyboard solution. There's really no reason why
 this command isn't found under the wrench menu with find on page.

You may not have the "full" Touch keyboard enabled?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

<p>However, I can't see why it wouldn't work with the OSK as well...&nbsp; It does.&nbsp;&nbsp;You just have to be careful about focus.</p>

I'm not on W8 right now and I can't remember what I saw which caused my remark about focus but apparently there must be a trick to doing it.</p>

    <title>Chinese characters work in Word 2007 but not Excel 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seigfried  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chinese characters work in Word 2007 but not Excel 2007</h2>
                    I have MS Office 2007 with the simplified Chinese language pack installed. When the keyboard is switched to Chinese, Word works perfectly displaying the Chinese characters. Excel does not. It only shows a blank cell when Chinese is selected.&nbsp;Excel just
 won't allow the entry of Chinese although curiously&nbsp;it will allow it to be cut/pasted from Word and displays the Chinese fonts perfectly. The computer has Win 7 Pro x64 and I have tried a repair install as well, separately, a full install of MS Office. I have
 checked on Programs/Microsoft Office/MS Tools/ MS Office Language&nbsp;Settings and Chinese (simplified) shows as installed. What can I check/set/change to get Chinese working in Excel as it does in Word?

            No, no error messages at all. If we enter data into Word, it will display and print as Chinese perfectly and if it's copied and then pasted into a cell it works fine, at least it displays properly. If, in Excel, we change to Chinese using the language
 bar, and try entering data via the keyboard, nothing is entered in the cell, the language bar will show ideograms corresponding to the key stroke in a popup window but those characters cannot be selected and entered into the cell either.

            First, make sure a correct language input method is installed / loaded.
<div>For simplified Chinese, you need to use "Chinese (PRC)" as the language. And I recommend using the Pinyin method. (You can add the input method in the Control Panel".</div>
<div><br />
<div>With the correct input method, Excel should allow input of Chinese when with a non-Chinese font, e.g. Arial.</div>

<p>It can be done quite easily. I moved from Thunderbird to Outlook successfully. I would suggest following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Outlook.com account</li><li>Set it in your current Thunderbird as IMAP account. You will have then two (or more) accounts in Thundebird - new one (newly created outlook.com) and one (or more) old one.</li><li>In Thunderbird move you messages from old folders to new folders - by drag&amp;drop. E.g. simply select emails from old Inbox and move it to new Inbox. Do it also for Sent folders (and others, if any).<br />
</li><li>All emails moved in Thunderbird to new folders should be visible in Outlook.com. If you migrate all messages, your migration is done.</li><li>Now all that must be done is to set old account within Outlook.com for sending and receiving new emails.</li><li>You can uninstall Thunderbird in last step :)</li></ul>

    <title>Nudging of text box works in Word 2010, but not Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> houstondon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nudging of text box works in Word 2010, but not Excel 2010</h2>
                    Steps I followed:
<p>Open file, "Test Excel 2010 text box nudging.xlsx" (see link at end)</p>
<p>Ctrl-left-click the border of a text box (shows solid border)</p>
<p>Arrow keys up, down, left and right do not nudge as advertized</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/move-a-wordart-shape-or-text-box-9878efc9-039c-42fc-9da9-38a96ee25e09#bm6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/move-a-wordart-shape-or-text-box-9878efc9-039c-42fc-9da9-38a96ee25e09#bm6</a></p>
<p>“<strong><span>Applies To: </span></strong>Excel 2010, PowerPoint 2010, Word 2010”</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, the arrow keys in Excel cycle though selecting each of the elements of the chart (other text boxes,<span>&nbsp;
</span>plot area, legend, both axis labels, title, grid lines, the plotted data series, the individual data points in the data series, and then repeats the cycle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same behavior that occurs when the text box is selected by left-click WITHOUT holding down the Ctrl key. It is as if Excel, but not Word, does not recognize the difference between left-click and Ctrl-left-click. In my Word files, Ctrl-left-clicking
 a text box allows nudging as expected with all 4 arrow keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior occurs in multiple Excel files of mine, including one that originated from Excel 2003 (.xls), but was saved as .xlsx format. EXCEPT--very curiously, for one particular text box, nudging reproducibly works with the right or down arrow keys (but
 not left or up). The up or left arrow keys cycle through chart elements as described previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A similar problem in Excel was reported in 2013, but not resolved.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please help or refer to appropriate others. There seems to be a well defined issue here. I have posted my sample test files for Word and Excel here,</p>
