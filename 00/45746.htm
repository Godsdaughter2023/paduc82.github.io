<h2>            Microsoft Excel stdole32.tlb</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded my PC to Vista from&nbsp;XP.&nbsp; Since installing Vista, I am having a problem with Microsoft Excel.&nbsp; Everytime I click the Excel tab or icon to run I get an error message of stdole32.tlb is missing or damaged and that a Microsoft "fix" must
 be run.&nbsp; When I run the "Microsoft "fix", Excel works fine&nbsp;for the CURRENT SESSION.&nbsp; However, everytime I subsequently run Excel I get the same stdole32.tlb&nbsp;error message.&nbsp; Anyway to make the Microsoft "fix" permanent so that I don't have to run the "fix"
 everytime I launch Microsoft Excel?&nbsp;</p>

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling Excel?&nbsp; Did you do a fresh install of Office after you upgraded to Vista?<br />
<br />
Your question is better suited for the Office community discussion where you would receive more Office focused support:<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t start defrag in safe mode &#40;Windows 7 Ultimate&#41;</h2>
                    Defrag will run from my admin account but periodically I like to run it from Safe Mode (no networking)/Admin account .<br />
<br />
I cannot do this on my Win 7 machine. Neither the ap display in the drive's properties menu nor can I invoke it from the CMD environment. No error messages, just doesn't start.<br />
<br />
I'm stumped.<br />

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Unfortunately the Defragmentation tool cannot be run in Safe Mode as the service won't run in Safe Mode. It is by design.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Defragmentation used to run in safe mode for earlier version of Windows but not in Windows 7</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>You would receive the following message if you try to run Disk defragmenter in Safe&nbsp;mode on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>“Windows could not start the Disk Defragmenter service on Local Computer.</span></b></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t allow me to change my account from local to my microsoft account</h2>
                    When I updated to Windows 10 I started having issues. I read in a forum that I should change my account from my Microsoft account to a local account. I did that a little while ago and now I cannot change it back to my Microsoft account. I have the link
 "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead" however when I click on it nothing happens. This is just the start of&nbsp;the issues I am&nbsp;currently having with window 10&nbsp;however I have to start somewhere. Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: System File Checker(SFC) scan </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. </span>Press <strong><span>Windows key + X </span>
</strong>and click on <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></strong>&nbsp;to open the&nbsp;Elevated Command Prompt.&nbsp;(If prompted for a password, type the password and click Allow)</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>2. Type “<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>” and hit<strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter</span></strong>.<br />
3. </span><span>Exit Command Prompt.</span><span> <br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><span><strong>Method 2: Clean Boot</strong><br />
</span></span>To check whether this issue is related to third party service, I would suggest you to boot your system in clean boot state and check if the issue persists.
<span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp;

<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span>Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>"to reset computer as usual.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted regarding this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the local account is the only existing account in your computer, I would suggest you to try creating a new user account and enter your Microsoft credentials during the setup. Once the new user account is created, you will be able to change it to administrator
 account. </p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">I had very very bad situation with Microsoft last month, I had my Skype account and its worked very well and I had my recovery options on Skype website like my mobile number and my email to recover my Skype
 account, but since Microsoft bought Skype they merged my Skype account with my very very old Microsoft account that I can not remember, my Skype account is:&nbsp;<em>[Skype name removed for privacy and security purposes]</em>&nbsp;, My old Microsoft account is:&nbsp;<em><span>[e-mail
 removed for privacy and security]</span>,</em> so when I want to recover my Skype account, Microsoft ask me recovery option about my old Microsoft account that I don't remember I prove them I have already my recovery options from Skype recovery options but
 Microsoft said me we can not recognize them....I know my credit card information which I used on skype and everything...I will put funny emails from Microsoft support to show You...PLEASE GIVE BACK MY ACCOUNT.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">I’m sorry to say that we’ve covered everything we can to recover the account. Please understand that Microsoft takes your security/privacy very seriously and we as support is not able to go beyond the steps
 we’ve provided.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">I encourage you to keep recovering the account using the methods we’ve tried [especially the Online Recovery form, if you remember any new details] but it may be time to consider abandoning the account.</p>

 Credit card information for which I used in SKYPE...not Microsoft it's really uneducated you can not understand read below please:&nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p><p>I know how it&nbsp;is very frustrating&nbsp;this situation might be and I do&nbsp;apologize to&nbsp;hear&nbsp;that you've been going through hoops about this.&nbsp;Let us try&nbsp;a work around and see if it will sort this out since you said that you had the recovery options attached on your
 account, let us try to access that and see if we can recover your account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Please go to&nbsp;<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Enter your Skype name&nbsp;on the&nbsp;given field and click Continue. </p>
<p>3. Once your account shows up, click on Reset password. </p>
<p>4. Choose<em> I&nbsp;forgot&nbsp;my password </em>and click Next.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Enter the captcha code and click Next. </p>
<p>6. If you can see your recovery options on the security info page, choose&nbsp;one and send the reset code.
</p>
<p>7. Continue&nbsp;on resetting your password&nbsp;and try to log in to your account with the new password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note</em> that&nbsp;if the recovery options on your account is different from the one you have access now and you choose
<em>I don't have any of these</em>, you will be directed to the <a href="https://account.live.com/ACSR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account recovery form</a> once again. Please keep&nbsp;in mind that the reason for tight security measures on recovering accounts is a policy to make sure that the true owners of the account are the one to only have access and recover it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Danida_U</p>
<p>Thanks For your reply but when I go to that link its go directly to Microsoft recovery options not skype recovery options...I had totally different recovery options on Microsoft and on Skype....different email recovery and phone number and even I made my
 Microsoft email maybe 10 years ago that I can not remember but I remember everything for my skype account like: Credit Card, Email, Phone Number...but microsoft link them without asking me and even my skype password is different from my microsoft account password...how
 Microsoft merged them without asking me ? and why they not recognize my skype recovery options ? I upload pictures to show you I still receive email from skype but Microsoft dont want to recognize my email which I used on skype before they bought skype...and
 you can see it say I already have my account but if you want it you must bring it back with Microsoft recovery options...Its ridiculous&nbsp;<br />

<p>Are you ppl insane !!!!</p>
<p>Whatever happened with Microsoft &amp; Skype has locked out hundreds, probably thousands of ppl !! &nbsp;And all I read is your stock standard answer replies to folks."...<em>oh sorry, nothing more we can do. Goodbye"</em>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>I have followed all the prompts and done everything asked, and then some, to fix my account and all I end up doing is to resetting my password time after time, and then get &nbsp;this crap below!!...</p>
<p>&nbsp;Its like a BRICK WALL every night I try, &amp; I try.....and I keep getting this tripe!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its a pity you dont have any opposition to set up a like-minded program....I hope one day you will, that might smash some sense into your thick skulls. FIX THE BLOODY PROBLEM... do us all a favour.</p>
<p>
Recover your account
The more information you are able to provide, the easier it will be to recover your account. Don't worry if you don't have all the answers, it's better to guess and be close than to leave a question blank.

            I have similar problems.&nbsp; A continuing and frustrating loop.&nbsp; Used to ok before Microsoft got involved.&nbsp; Now I have given up trying to recover my Skype account (lost after disc crash), so have decided to create a new account.&nbsp; Big problem, cannot do this
 because my phone number is on the system and I'm asked to log into my old account - which I cannot!!<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>2. Where exactly have you saved the word files? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue normally occurs when the graphics driver is outdated, you may have to update it to the latest version from the Manufacturer website. It could also occur if the graphics card is not compatible with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
<br />
</strong>Try updating the graphics card drivers and check if it works.</p>
<p><br />
Follow the steps to update the graphics card driver:</p>
<p><br />
<span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Press Windows <strong>key + X</strong> key and click on
<b><span>Device manager</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span><span>Search for <strong>Display Adapters.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span><span>Right-click on the <b>graphics card</b> and click on
<b>Update driver software</b>.</span></p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, you may download the driver and install it in compatibility mode and check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode.<br />
</p>
<p>a. <strong>Download</strong> the drivers from the <strong>manufacturer’s</strong> website.<br />
b. Right-click on the <strong>driver</strong> and click on <strong>properties</strong>.<br />
c. Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility</strong>’ tab and check the box "<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>” and select
<strong>Windows 8 operating system</strong> from the drop down.<br />
d. Click on ‘<strong>Apply’</strong> and click ‘<strong>OK’</strong> and run the file to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.</p>

<p>Found out I have many driver issues after installing 8.1</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo Thinkpad 520.</p>
<p>I have to go back to Lenovo and see if I can restore everything.</p>
<p>Never should have upgraded- 7 was good enough!</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status. I understand your concern. It seems you do not have direct drivers available for the graphics adapter, you may download and install Windows 8 driver in compatibility mode and check for the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer to this article to download and install the drivers from Lenovo website.

<h2>            Help with burning CD on Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p>I am a 73 year old woman who knows very little about computers. &nbsp;I recorded music from my digital piano onto a FD, then downloaded them onto Windows Media Player. &nbsp;They are all listed in Media Player but when I drag them over into &nbsp;play list, then hit burn,
 all of the songs are listed with an (i) in front &amp; will not burn. &nbsp;It says that the file is missing media usage rights. &nbsp;What do I do to get these where I can burn them on a CD? &nbsp;Please be very specific, as I am very illiterate on the computer.</p>

            <p>Hello Mern,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the option listed on the page at the link below.&nbsp; This is an older thread, but still applies to Media Player.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-pictures/error-the-file-is-missing-media-usage-rights/49dde716-f8e8-4a2e-81d5-588068bb9789">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-pictures/error-the-file-is-missing-media-usage-rights/49dde716-f8e8-4a2e-81d5-588068bb9789</a></p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span>By author <strong>Divya R.</strong> from that link.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>a. Cause of the error:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows Media Player uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to preserve the rights of content owners who protect their music or video products in this manner. You must have the media usage rights required to play, burn, or sync protected
 content.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>b. How to update the DRM license:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>By default, Windows Media Player will automatically attempt to acquire usage rights silently unless the server requires some input from you (such as registration information or a fee). You can turn off automatic rights acquisition. If you do so, you
 will be prompted to obtain rights for any new content that requires them. To prevent Windows Media Player from acquiring rights automatically, do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>i. Click the arrow below the Now Playing tab, and then click More Options.<br />
ii. Click the Privacy tab, and then clear the Automatically check if protected files need to be refreshed check box.</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that this setting does not affect usage rights acquisition from online stores.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Backwards Compatibility for Gears of War Judgement Only.  Can someone else check&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am having issues launching Gears of War Judgement on the Xbox One. &nbsp;Is anyone else having any issues with this game? &nbsp;Me and a few pals fire this up on a friday night and it keeps coming up with an error code when launching. &nbsp;<span>Error (0x87de2726).</span></p>
<p>All the other backwards compatibility games work so far. &nbsp;Can anyone else check that there version works? &nbsp;Please note that this is a download version of the game and not a game disc version. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I also own digital copies of gears 3 and gears 1 and both of them run fine.</p>

<p>Many Thanks,</p>

<p>GHENGIS</p>

<p>Try uninstall it, then clear your persistant data through the disc and blue ray options in settings, hard reset your console by holding the power button, then launch it back up and install it. Also go to system and check last update status, it could be that
 the update is still pending. If it is then contact xbox through the support chat and ask thrm to check your account, they may send you a code through text or email or something.</p>

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Right click on an empty space on Taskbar &gt; Taskbar Settings &gt; Turn system icons on or off &gt; Toggle on Clock
<br />If this is already toggled on, toggle it off, wait for few seconds and toggle it on.
<br />
<br />If this is still not working, in Taskbar Settings &gt; Toggle off use small taskbar buttons
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

                    <p>Hi my name is Damian. I had&nbsp;bought a "Minecraft : Xbox 360 Edition" game disc. It worked just for half a day and when I started to play again&nbsp;it was&nbsp;not working. I have gone to the support where it told me to follow some steps but it is still is not working. I tried removing the USB&nbsp;sticks and memory units, wiping the disc with a damp cloth, reinserting the disc, clearing cache of the memory sticks and USB&nbsp;and many more,&nbsp;but&nbsp;is still&nbsp;not working.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't see any scratches on the disc also.</p>
<p>The starting screen shows up, then a dialogue box comes up and says, " "Minecraft : Xbox 360 Edition" has failed to load and cannot continue".</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which updates (KB numbers) are you trying to install?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you using any third party security software?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Disable the
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>security software</span></a><span>
 temporarily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and
 other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during
 the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Put the computer in a </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Clean Boot</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow
<b>Step 7</b> from the link to start the computer to <b>Normal startup mode</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span>
</span><span>You can also install the updates (KB number) manually by downloading from Microsoft download center.</span></p>

 I am protected.</p>
<p>So I guess I am, I will be on internet assuming that I am.</p>

FYI it's the new Maps for Call of Duty: Black Ops. The extra zombie maps don't show up.<br />

Any ideas on what I can do without deleting and re-downloading? (Since I don't have internet connection to my XBOX at the moment)<br />

<p>Nah that doesn't seem like the problem. We were playing it MY Console with MY HDD at my friends place.. we WERE using his internet but MY XboxLIVE account/gamertag. When I got home and tried to play it, it wasn't there.. It wouldn't be because I don't have

<p><i><span>You just said you only took your hard drive to your mates house to download the BLACK OPS MAP PACK. Marketplace content is tied to the GAMER TAG and CONSOLE that downloaded it. The content at this time
 is tied to YOUR gamer tag and your FRIENDS console. Since you only took your hard drive back home to your console the only way you would be able to use the BO MP is if you were signed into XBL. But you don't have an internet connection at home. So my previous
 post still stands. </span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>You will need to take your entire console (hard drive included) to your friends house and perform a license migration to associate the BO MP to YOUR console. There is no other way around this. Once you
 do the LM, you will need to go to your DOWNLOAD HISTORY and re-download the BO MP (don't worry, it'll only take a second or two).
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>Now when you go home to play the content OFFLINE you will be able to.

                    <p>When I burn a DATA CD/DVD in Windows Explorer OR Windows Media Player it NEVER gets finalized/closed/mastered.</p>
<p>I clicked on the option SINGLE-USE/FINALIZE instead of the "USE LIKE A USB DRIVE" option, but upon reinserting it after burning it always shows up as BLANK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per Microsoft help article at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/close-finalize-cd-dvd#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/close-finalize-cd-dvd#1TC=windows-7</a> I put the burned disc in the drive, I click START, COMPUTER and then highlight the CD/DVD drive and I see many options across the top toolbar.&nbsp; HOWEVER, it does NOT give me an
 option like the article says called "CLOSE" or "CLOSE DISC".... just AUTOPLAY, EJECT, BURN DISC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW can I CLOSE the disc if the chosen per-burning option DOESN'T close it, and Explorer doesn't give me the option to CLOSE the disc afterward?&nbsp; ANY help would be greatly appreciated!!!</p>

 that went smoothly. 2 minutes later, im $564.00 poorer, and am the proud owner of a new xbox one! I realized that the date I ordered was a Saturday, which told me that the order would be processed on Monday, or Tuesday at the latest. And I could be playing
 it by the end of the week. "Not too bad" I thought, I'm a patient man, I can wait. Fast forward to the following Wednesday...Today. And I've realized, I'm actually quite impatient. My order has been sitting on "backorder" with the words "In Process" at the
 bottom. I'm not sure what process takes 3 days to figure out, but it certainly isn't a billing problem. M$ took my $564.00 INSTANTLY. They were able to process the money taking aspect of the ordeal. But, for some reason not the res

<p>Hello Gunsta, I ordered a xbox one one the 24th and i also ordered a xbox one bundled version also yesterday on the 29th.</p>
<p>I just got confirmation today that tracking numbers for both xbox ones were issued and they will be shipped as soon as possible. Its nice to not to see them on backorder anymore.</p>
<p>I would have to assume your in the same boat as me and you had your tracking number sent to you also.</p>

<p>This also happened to me today (Thankfully) &nbsp;I was confused this morning when I saw that the money from my order had been refunded, but I see now that it was a test to see if the return address for the money was legitimate. Why it took a full week to accomplish
 I don't know. But, I'm happy to see the order status is now listed as 'complete'! It's only a matter of time now! I was getting tired if all the uncertainty anyway. Thanks for the advice guys, it's nice to know at least one of you (SlackWareRules) was experiencing
 the same thing! P.S great profile pic dude! *BOOM*</p>

<p>M6453, that's completely normal. Microsoft Store has completed there side of the shipping process and it normally won't be updated until UPS actually get there hands on the package.
</p>
<p>The last thing I ordered from Microsoft store showed up within 3 days once it was in the hands of the courier.
</p>
<p>And it was shipped from USA to Canada. &nbsp;Excellent &nbsp;in my opinion. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Install Wizard Won&#39;t Accept Purchased Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> electro_gadgetz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Install Wizard Won&#39;t Accept Purchased Windows 10 License Key</h2>
                    <p>My machine in question is an HP Stream Mini.&nbsp; It came pre-installed with Windows 8.1 with Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I tried the straight forward route of upgrading&nbsp;with the upgrade tool,&nbsp;but there wasn't enough room on the hard drive.&nbsp; So, I realized&nbsp;it was&nbsp;going to be necessary to do the upgrade via an .iso stored on a USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, on my Mac (because it has plenty of space to download the file), &nbsp;I went to the website and downloaded the .iso for "Windows 10 Single Language Edition" (English) - sounded like it would take up less of my precious hard drive space.&nbsp; HOWEVER, WHEN I
 ATTEMPTED THE UPGRADE, THE INSTALL WIZARD WITHIN THIS .ISO REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE WINDOWS 8.1 INSTALLED AND INSISTED ON PROMPTING ME FOR A LICENSE KEY (NO "SKIP" BUTTON).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, in total frustration, I went out and purchased a license key for Windows 10 Home from Microsoft's store - WHICH I SHOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED TO DO...WAS ENTITLED TO THE FREE UPGRADE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, again on my Mac, I&nbsp;clicked the "download" link in the order confirmation
 e-mail provided by Microsoft.&nbsp; I then proceeded to re-download the Windows 10 Single Langauge Edition .iso file (I wanted to make sure that I did in fact have the right version and that it wasn't just a corrupted download issue).&nbsp; I then put this fresh .iso
 file on the thumb drive and attempted the upgrade again on the HP Stream Mini.&nbsp; When prompted for the product key, I entered my newly purchased product key for Windows 10 Home Edition...and I get the following&nbsp;error message:&nbsp; "This key doesn't work with this
 edition of Windows.&nbsp; Try a different key."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?&nbsp; It's a Windows 10 product key freshly purchased from the Microsoft store!&nbsp; Moreover, the .iso file was downloaded directly from the download link provided by Microsoft in the same confirmation e-mail that contained the product key
 (meaning the product key and .iso file should definitely&nbsp;be compatible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'M SO FRUSTRATED!&nbsp; I thought this version was supposed to demonstrate that Microsoft had gotten it's act together...THEN WHY IS THIS UPGRADE, THAT SHOULD BE VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD, TURNED INTO SUCH A FIASCO?&nbsp; Even more importantly, how can I&nbsp;get past&nbsp;this
 hurdle and accomplish the upgrade?</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2 Recover to Factory Defaults - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trrcs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Recover to Factory Defaults</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have been running a Windows 10 Enterprise install on my Surface Pro 2 and now wish to recover it back to factory defaults (I believe it was Windows 8 Pro that it came with). &nbsp;I tried to Reset it however it just reset Windows 10 back to a fresh Enterprise
 install. &nbsp;No worries, I logged in to the Microsoft account and was able to download a recovery image for my Surface as I registered it. &nbsp;However when I boot from the USB it just crashes and does not restore the image. &nbsp;The error was as simple as "encountered
 an error and could not continue". &nbsp;I tried again after cleaning the drive (using disk part) and now it says there is a missing partition. &nbsp;Why can't the image just fix the partitions and restore? &nbsp;Surely it shouldn't be this hard...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I tried to request a support callback (yes, $80 AUD) however I received two phone calls, one was blank and cut out on me, the 2nd I was talking to the tech for about 1 minute and it cut out on me. &nbsp;Sure hope I don't get charged for that service!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently no OS on this and need to restore it to factory defaults, anyone have any ideas?</p>

            I tried it a few times with different USB sticks, different computers, different internet connections. &nbsp;Eventually I just used an OEM 8.1 Pro x64 install disc so I could at least try and get an OS working on there and then work it out from there. &nbsp;However
 that did the trick - it didn't even ask for the product key during installation, and when I checked once the install was complete, it was already activated. &nbsp;So the Surface Pro 2 must have the COA embedded and automatically inserted it for me. &nbsp;The only issue
 then was drivers which I manually installed no problem.

<h2>            Casting Photos to TV via Chromecast</h2>
                    I have been trying for a long time to figure out how to cast photos from Windows Pictures sub-folders to my TV using Chromecast. I am able to cast other things but not this. When I right-click a photo in a Pictures sub-folder and then click "Cast to Device"
 I get "Searching" and then "No Device Found." PC and Chromecast device are on the same home network. I have searched the Internet many times trying to find the answer, but have been unsuccessful. All help will be appreciated.

<p><span><span>Hi Donald,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows uses Miracast for mirroring contents on other Miracast compatible devices. As of now, we cannot directly cast the pictures using Chromecast. Instead, you may cast the desktop
 and open Photos app to cast pictures.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As per my research, there are a few apps on the Store which can help you cast local/native pictures using Chromecast. You may search for an app in the Microsoft Store which supports
 this feature and install it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For Windows to support this feature, I suggest you to post a feedback in the
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Feedback Hub</span></a><span>, so that our Developer team can
 have a look into your suggestion and include the feature in the future updates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,</span></span></p>

<p>(You know that Chromecast only works with the Chrome browser, right? I'm sure you already know that, but just in case ...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's easy to cast a single photo from your Pictures folder, but if you want to cast more than a single photo you'll have to cast from the Google Photos website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Casting a single photo is easy because Chromecast can cast tabs. Simply open a photo in a tab and cast that tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cast from Google Photos:</p>
<div><br />
<ul>
<li>On Chrome, go to photos.google.com.</li><li>Click View &gt; Cast...</li><li>Select your Chromecast</li><li>To stop casting, click View &gt; Cast... &gt; Stop casting.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to respond to my inquiry. However, I was already familiar with casting from Google Photos and have been able to do it. The problem is that&nbsp;Google Photos&nbsp;doesn't do what I need, particularly being able to specify the sequence of
 photo display. The photos there are just filed by date taken and time within date. Even putting photos into "albums" within the Google app doesn't appear to allow me to sequence them as I wish.
</p>
<p>My main photo files are all stored within sub-folders of Windows&gt;Pictures and are sequenced&nbsp;by numbered file names assigned by me to reflect a specific sequence within each subfolder. The file names, access paths&nbsp;and descriptions of the subjects are contained
 in a large Excel spreadsheet so they can easily be referenced. When I show these pictures to others, I need them to display in the sequence I originally set up so it is easy to refer to&nbsp;the descriptions contained in the spreadsheet for the narration.</p>
<p>If you have any ideas of how I might make Google Photos work as I require, I'd like to hear them.</p>

<p>1. How would I go about casting the desktop and displaying photos there? </p>

<p>I'm&nbsp;afraid that I don't understand your instructions. Chromecast is connected to TV and TV and Chromecast are ON. I don't know what is meant by "Expand the Google Chromecast extension icon, so here's what I did.</p>
<p>1. Opened Chrome on PC.</p>
<p>2. Turned on TV and ensured Chromecast dongle is ON.</p>
<p>3. Set TV input source to Chromecast. Chromecast screen is displayed on TV.</p>
<p>4. Clicked on the orange icon at top right of Chrome screen, then clicked on the Cast selection.</p>
<p>5. Got the cast tab showing the TV, but nothing about a Cast screen/window option.</p>
<p>6. Gave up.</p>
<p>7. Started Chromecast app on PC. Shows TV as connected,&nbsp;but got nowhere regarding the Cast screen/window option there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must be doing something wrong. Please provide additional instructions.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. I actually already had the Google Cast Extension, "Local Gallery Viewer" installed but couldn't figure out how to use it. Never noticed the icon for it at the upper right of the screen. Once I found that, I got it to work, sort of...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My process differed somewhat from you suggestions. Here is what I did:</p>
<p>1. Turned on TV and set input source to the Chromecast jack.</p>
<p>2. Started Chrome on PC.</p>
<p>3. Clicked on the Local Gallery View Extension icon. Window opened on screen.</p>
<p>4. Used "Choose Files" button to navigate to the photo folder to be cast.</p>
<p>5. Clicked Upload.</p>
<p>6. Sequential numbers appeared as uploaded. Numbers shown are equal to the number of picture in the target folder.</p>
<p>7. Clicked on the Cast selection in the Chrome menu.</p>
<p>8. Pictures appeared on the TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issues I still have are:</p>
<p>1. Some pictures are displayed in incorrect orientation: vertical instead of horizontal, upsidedown, etc. The picture orientations&nbsp;as displayed in the PC folder are correct.</p>
<p>2. Do not understand some of the settings in the extension.</p>
<p>I will try to take these up with the developer.</p>

<h2>            Constant updates on Xbox One Console</h2>
                    Is it normal that every time I turn on my XBOX ONE console it has to update before I do anything. This wouldn't be a problem but the&nbsp; update takes a good 20 to 30 mins every time, is there a way to stop this?

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This sounds like you are part of the preview program. Preview program Consoles receive updates more frequently then consoles that are not enrolled in the program. Here is an FAQ if further support is needed :
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you would like to opt out of the program you can follow these steps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch the <strong>Xbox Insider Hub</strong> on your Xbox One or a Windows 10 PC.
</li><li>On the main landing page, select <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Manage devices</strong> and choose the one you want to remove from the program.
</li><li>Select <strong>Done</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 intermittently prompts for network credentials</h2>
                    <p>I have two Windows 10 Pro PC's connected wirelessly on my home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was working perfectly until the anniversary update was installed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I try to access remote shares on the other computer (this happens&nbsp;both ways) I am intermittently prompted to enter my network credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I cancel and retry the connection, I will usually get the same credentials prompt for three or four attempts and then I'll be able to connect to the remote share but&nbsp;without having entered the credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what could be causing this behaviour?</p>

                    I have Diamond ATI AIW HD Premium 3650 with remote. There are no drivers for the TV tuner. Are there drivers in the foreseeable future.
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. <br />
By the way in Canada we switched to digital August 31, 2011. Do you have a patch for WMC since we are all digital TV.<br />

<br />
Yes, you should uninstall first, reboot, then install, then reboot again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>the drivers from the link above didn't work. </blockquote>
<br />
If they don't work after reinstalling contact AMD (or Diamond Multimedia) about Windows 7 drivers/compatibility.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Also I have drivers from Diamond Multimedia. Which are the right ones?
</blockquote>
<br />
If you have a Diamond card - the Diamond Windows 7 drivers. Earlier I checked Diamonds website, but they didn't have Windows 7 drivers for your model:<br />

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did talk to three of MS technicians today to address this issue, but they could not fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only option that I have now is to downgrade the computers that I have to either windows 8 or windows 7 (not sure if I can even roll back to&nbsp; windows 7 as all my computers were windows 8), or use a windows 7 device that cannot really handle the device due
 to ram and cpu capacity. I do not want to waste anymore of my time to deal with this device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using MS products including tablets and windows phones throughout to complete my daily tasks and the only device that is "****" is this Lifecam studio which I paid over 100 bucks two years ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really disappointed and somewhat angry because I have no use for this thing now.</p>
<p>Huge disappointment......<br />
</p>
<p>Hope you guys either discontinue this product or fix the issue asap as all comments related to this product is negative.
</p>
<p />
