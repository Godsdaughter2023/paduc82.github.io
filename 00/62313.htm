<h2>            Running a small slide show of my own pictures</h2>
                    <p>For the last few years, I have constantly run the Gadget Slideshow in the bottom left hand corner of my screen (PC).&nbsp;&nbsp; On random change, and with over 4.000 pictures to randomise, it has been an amusement, a mild distraction and always a pleasure, reminding
 me of family, holidays, art etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to Windows 10 today, and it's gone, apparently irretrievably.&nbsp; I can't believe I was the only person to enjoy a small slideshow!&nbsp; Is there any way I can retrieve it, or will I have to revert to Windows 7?</p>

            <p>Hi Rosina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can play slideshow using Photo app in Windows 10. Open any of the pictures in Photo app and when its open, click the small Play button on top right corner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Pictures from one folder can play as slideshow. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
        </p>

            <p>The slide show takes up the whole screen, thus ensuring that I cannot do anything else while watching it.&nbsp; I tried reducing the size of the box, but even though I had done this it reverted to full screen, without any option for a smaller slide show, running
 while I worked on other things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The slide show draws, as you said, on only one folder.&nbsp; My photographs are spread throughout numerous folders and subfolders, and I enjoyed being entertained by the randomness and variety of pictures that were shown.&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as I can tell the screen saver
 manages to draw on pictures from all the folders and subfolders.&nbsp; So it should not be too difficult to provide something similar, but smaller in size, and to run continuously.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Edited to say that it does of course work like that in the 'screen save settings':&nbsp;
 now I just have to make that picture bigger, and get rid of the text and white box ...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, this worked with Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is any 'advance' always accompanied by the loss of something that was valued?&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>Has anyone else managed to come up with a way of providing the 'slide show' in a small box on one side of the screen that can run continuously and draws on all pictures in your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like the slide show gadget available with Windows 7 did, before they discontinued it?</p>

            <p>Your post is somewhat confusing and doesn't actually describe what, if anything,&nbsp;is wrong. Please see:</p>

<p>What is the make and model number of you computer?</p>
<p>What version of Windows 7 are you running?&nbsp;i.e., Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit, Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, etc.</p>
<p>What exactly are you trying to do? What are the results? Do you receive any error messages; is so what do they say (verbatim)?</p>
<p>Why did you restore it back to "factory mode a few times?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you say you just got the computer, be sure to create system repair discs:</p>

<h2>            XBOX ONE and AVCHD support</h2>
                    I am a 360 owner who is looking to purchase an XBOX ONE later in the year. However I have many home movies recorded in AVCHD format so want to ensure the ONE can play them. I have been holding out on buying a blu-ray player and just using my PC to view
 the movies. I know the PS4 can play them but not sure about the ONE. If it cannot then I could be looking at purchasing the PS4 but would rather have the ONE. Can anyone confirm if the ONE can play AVCHD discs? Thanks.

<p>Seeing as how Sony is one of the trademark holders for ACVHD, then the answer would quite possibly be no, the Xbox one will not be able to play them...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Of course, until further information for the Xbox One is released, you would have to wait and see officially.</p>

</p><div>Hello, today I tried to return to the official version of Minecraft, since I wanted to enter a Realm.</div>
<div>I decided to leave the Minecraft beta through the Xbox Insider hub, but when reinstalling Minecraft, I installed the BETA version.</div>
<div>I searched in different posts to find a solution, being that most say that I consulted the support of MOJANG or Xbox and in the other few solutions recommended to reset the PC factory, which obviously will not do, at least not for a game .</div>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>just to be sure. Did you do the following steps in that exact order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Check if there is an update for the Xbox Insiders Hub on PC</li><li>Un-enroll from the Minecraft Beta via the Xbox Insiders Hub</li><li>Uninstall the beta version for Minecraft</li><li>To be sure wait a couple of hours (or a day)</li><li>Restart the PC during that wait time.</li><li>Try to install Minecraft again via your Library on the store, make sure to select the standard version and not the Beta version, in the situation that multiple versions show up. As alternate option try to install the version from store in case installing
 from library doesn't work.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know the results</p>

<p>Hi jobimjazz,<br />

Your query is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. We suggest that you post it on the
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itprogeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet Windows 10 forum</a>, which is more geared towards IT Pro audience and Enterprise environment discussions.

<p>Hangouts on Air live streamed to YouTube can do that although the technology is a bit old.&nbsp; You just have to join the Hangout on Air on your phone after you start the event on your computer.&nbsp; Perhaps OBS Studio can do this and it would be of higher quality
 but I wouldn't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to contribute in the hangouts forum and on YouTube.&nbsp; Sorry Microsoft if you have a way to do this that I don't know about.</p>

    <title>CAncel xbox one purchase made by children - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            CAncel xbox one purchase made by children</h2>
                    
<p>Good day, I'm from Brazil. I tried to contact via phone with the customer service from Microsoft, at tel. 0800-8919-835, provided in the support area of the company website. Several times I tried to talk to someone, getting 4 times, 50 minutes waiting for
 the call, but to no avail. I could only hear music on hold and several messages in English asking to wait.&nbsp;<br />
Come across such a claim requesting the heads of the Microsoft company following cancellation of purchase "Forza Horizon 2" for U$96.38 performed on 23/09/2014.&nbsp;<br />
This purchase was made for my 6 year old son without my permission on my credit card that registered in my Live account when he played with his Xbox One game.&nbsp;<br />
I was very surprised, because as a child of only six years could get these confirm a purchase. After checking, I saw that there is an option to put a password to confirm the purchase. Just pick up the game and then a screen appears where the download is confirmed
 whether or not to download. Clicking download the game, it goes automatically to the download list.&nbsp;<br />
I tried to cancel while in download phase hoping to cancel the purchase made by the child, but a message appeared saying that even if I canceled the download does not receive refund of the purchase.&nbsp;<br />
Dear, according to the consumer protection code of Brazil, says that I have up to 7 days to request cancellation of product or service (article. 49th The Consumer can withdraw from the contract within seven days of the date of signature or the act of receiving
 the product or service, whenever the contracting supply of goods and services occur off-premises, especially by phone or home). And this case was a purchased product without my consent by a child of only six years, which in turn to play a demo game had to
 connect to an account of the xbox and just completing a purchase through the registered card in it. Before making a withdrawal from my card to my xbox live account, I need urgently and ask them the great favor of the cancellation of this purchase and that
 make the reversal in the credit card company. I beg your indulgence as I'm not in a financial position to such acquisition.&nbsp;<br />
Thank you</p>

    <title>A whole crapload of problems really. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A whole crapload of problems really.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Okayyyyy. Lets get this topic underway. Like all good people that make their way onto these forums, I've probably done something to eff my computer up, and now I am suffering and hoping for help from Microsoft^^ However, I'd like for the moment to
 put all blame on forces outside my control. Earlier tonight, around 2am to be exact (not that time is relevant) my power went out. Frustrated, because this as it always does, screwed me over while I was doing something, I pushed the power button again and
 sat back annoyed.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>10 seconds later, the power flickers off again, while my PC is in Windows load-up thing. With the loading bar and the big windows logo, just after your PC's system screen or whatever it is~ :P I was like, Oh shi-,
 that is bad isn't it? Everyone always tells you that turning your computer off suddenly is bad, especially in the middle of important processes like updates, installs, etc. That's common sense nowadays, even if windows try's to protect against it.</span></strong></p>
<p>So, I was about to turn it on again, when the power goes on and off and on and off and on and off. Annoying, so I went and did something else for an hour. Once the power stopped pulsating for god knows what reason, I came back to my PC and turned it on.
 When it had loaded up past the welcome screen, it took a ridiculous amount of time to load up the average programs and stuff that start at first. Like, usually it takes about 5-10 seconds to load everything, upto Windows Live opening up on the desktop. However
 this time it took about a minute and a half, and the computer was still really slow in performing basic things, like rightclick-&gt;refreshing. And when it was taking forever to open the startup programs, I opened up task manager to see if the processes were
 running. They were, and like 10 svchost.exe's, which if I remember at all is sorta normal. Atleast it's normal to have a bunch of them. But like all but 2 of them were using somewhere between 5-30 CPU :S That's a crapload to use on my system. I'll post my
 info at the bottom of this post to keep things better organized. &nbsp;Oh also, none of the process usernames were showing, except the System Idle Process had SYSTEM next to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I tried to end some processes that weren't system (like msn, limewire, steam, etc). That actually took a few seconds each, which normally ending processes is instantaneous. Now, I've had problems with svchost being corrupted in some way or another before.
 So I have done this before, and I'm sure it's not recommended but like most people, if it works quick and easy, and brings me no ill effect to my knowledge, I'm going to do it probably :P I ended the svchost that was using the most CPU, and my PC sped up enough
 to be able to use the internet :D! (Yay, i can post on microsoft now) However, I realized then that my sound wasn't working, because of instead of a sound going to my headphones confirming the ending of processes (well I noticed before svchost obviously, but
 whatever, i'm forgetting details in chronological order) so I tried music and stuff. I tried my front and back Audio plugs on my pc (one on the little USB dock underneath my dvd drive) and neither work with headphones or my sound system :[ So i went to device
 manager to try to update/repair my sound drivers or something, and that didn't work. I tried restarting in hopes that all these problems would resolves themselves, and that didn't work. So i tried to open the internet and google myself some info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THEN i noticed another problem. My taskbar wasn't working (I didn't notice this when all I had open was taskmanager :S) I could click the start button and all, and the start button worked. AND my taskbar displayed time and icons next to that. But, no windows
 were being docked on the taskbar. Even now, with 5 windows open my taskbar is empty. And my quicklaunch bar is gone too. This makes it a pain because if I minimize or anything, I have to resort to alt tab to navigate my windows. :[ sadface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I tried to download some fixes. For my audio first. I uninstalled my soundmax drivers, and tried to restart hoping for automatic reinstallation of my soundcard. Noluck. I tried downloading some soundmax drivers off of the web, and the installations are
 getting errors and stopping. I'm kinda slowly realizing that my computer got reallllllly effed up by this crash. On some recommendation for looking for a file for ONE of the problems i have, I opened up an explorer window and tried to open search, and the
 search bar on the side is empty except for the dog graphic :\ I tried running "sfc /scannow" to see if it would detect/repair any missing/corrupted system files, but it ran for like 15minutes and dissapeared while I wasn't looking (what with my taskbar not
 letting me keep an eye on all of my windows.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soooo I was like, I'm going to try to system restore these problems away, even if it deletes games I installed yesterday or whenever this week. I open up system restore from the start menu, and it says "System Restore is not able to protect your computer.
 Please restart your computer, and then run System Restore again." This is my third time restarting x_x I tried to open up my anti-malware program, Malwarebytes, and it gets a system error 732 or something. I googled that and it's cause I'm missing a file somewhere,
 so I just said whatever, I'll try to fix that later if all this doesn't lead to someone recommending a reformat and nothing else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a reformat in mind, I wanted to backup some important files to myself onto my flash drive. This was when I learned one of the worst problems yet, my inability to backup files. I can't drag and drop anything on windows. Be it desktop or explorer windows.
 AND I can't copy and paste anything, with cntrl+c/v or right click. Same for cutting/pasting. So now I'm like. ohshit. I'm screwed and I'm not going to be able to save anything either. I'm sooooo pissed. Now, the taker and ending of my little story is that,
 I don't have an XP disk on hand right now. And PC is life, obviously.. This is 2010 and I won't have a PC for probably a week if I have to wipe my harddrive. The ONLY advantage to all of this is that my computer needs to be clean wiped anyways, I just wish
 it wasn't being forced and violently might I add. Oh, and even if I were to get an XP disk, I'm still in deep because, I don't have any of the disks for any of my hardware anymore. Like my soundcard and video card :[ Or anything else that a disk would be necessary
 for. I've had this computer with no problems for 6 years (Yeah, I know an upgrade is in order, but honestly, I don't have a job, and I'm probably not as old as you think I may be.) without any real problems, and over time lost without real care the disks essential
 to the revival of my pc in a crisis :[</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, that's all I have to say. Lets get to the tech-specs. I'm just going to give a dxdiag report, to save on time typing out a hundred things. If you want me to type out my system info because dxdiag are too thorough and long, then just tell me. :] Thanks
 for reading up to here~</p>

            Sorry for double post, but I've got a way around copy and pasting. Oh, also, as you may have noticed, copy and pasting text onto the browser seems to be fine, just files and stuff on my pc aren't working =\ Anyways yeah, i'm going to rar and unrar files
 in order to place them onto my flashdrive (or just rar and leave them rar for a bit of compression maybe) I don't have a huge one, so I can't save much (only bout 2gb) but whatever, better then nothing x[

Okayyyyy. Lets get this topic underway. Like all good people that make their way onto these forums, I've probably done something to eff my computer up, and now I am suffering and hoping for help from Microsoft^^ However, I'd like for the moment to put all blame
 on forces outside my control. Earlier tonight, around 2am to be exact (not that time is relevant) my power went out. Frustrated, because this as it always does, screwed me over while I was doing something, I pushed the power button again and sat back annoyed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Buy a UPS ! (oops, just noticed below that you say you don't have a job, sorry), e.g. an APC Back-ups 650 or modern equivalent, with at least 2 battery backed outputs, and one non battery backed but, surge protected output
 to which you can connect a "trailing lead" with 4 or more power sockets, to which you can connect non-critical devices such as printers | modem | router | and other mains powered peripheral devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My setup includes a trailing lead from a battery backed
 output so that I can plug in several low consumption devices such as Linksyys WAG354G (adsl modem/router/wifi unit), so they'll carry on unaffected by a power cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought a APC Back-ups 650, must be 20 years ago, and across the years, particularly during
 the winter we get spells of frequent power cuts, sometimes several&nbsp;"3 in&nbsp; a row" whilst a sub-station somewhere is doing its' "auto-reset" thing.&nbsp;</strong><strong>...that's not to mention the failing heating element in an AEG fan oven, and a steam iron that
 started throwing the household RCD, ...e.g. across the years quite a few power cuts that could have upset hardware and/or software !&nbsp;&nbsp; worth it's weight in gold !&nbsp; ....and avoids major problems such as you#re describing here.</strong></div>
<div><br />
10 seconds later, the power flickers off again, while my PC is in Windows load-up thing. With the loading bar and the big windows logo, just after your PC's system screen or whatever it is~ :P I was like, Oh shi-, that is bad isn't it? Everyone always tells
 you that turning your computer off suddenly is bad, especially in the middle of important processes like updates, installs, etc. That's common sense nowadays, even if windows try's to protect against it.<br />
So, I was about to turn it on again, when the power goes on and off and on and off and on and off. Annoying, so I went and did something else for an hour. Once the power stopped pulsating for god knows what reason, I came back to my PC and turned it on. When
 it had loaded up past the welcome screen, it took a ridiculous amount of time to load up the average programs and stuff that start at first. Like, usually it takes about 5-10 seconds to load everything, upto Windows Live opening up on the desktop. However
 this time it took about a minute and a half, and the computer was still really slow in performing basic things, like rightclick-&gt;refreshing. And when it was taking forever to open the startup programs, I opened up task manager to see if the processes were
 running. They were, and like 10 svchost.exe's, which if I remember at all is sorta normal. Atleast it's normal to have a bunch of them. But like all but 2 of them were using somewhere between 5-30 CPU :S That's a crapload to use on my system. I'll post my
 info at the bottom of this post to keep things better organized.&nbsp; Oh also, none of the process usernames were showing, except the System Idle Process had SYSTEM next to it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Sounds like you started rummaging around in Windows before making sure there was no mains power surge / spike damage cuase to delicate electronics inside your system box !</strong></div>
<div><strong>Checked that bios hardware settings weren't knocked about, and gone to failsafe settings ?&nbsp; Checked that there was no mains power spike damage, was all equipment connected to quality surge protection ?</strong></div>
<div><br />
So, I tried to end some processes that weren't system (like msn, limewire, steam, etc). That actually took a few seconds each, which normally ending processes is instantaneous. Now, I've had problems with svchost being corrupted in some way or another before.
 So I have done this before, and I'm sure it's not recommended but like most people, if it works quick and easy, and brings me no ill effect to my knowledge, I'm going to do it probably :P I ended the svchost that was using the most CPU, and my PC sped up enough
 to be able to use the internet :D! (Yay, i can post on microsoft now) However, I realized then that my sound wasn't working, because of instead of a sound going to my headphones confirming the ending of processes (well I noticed before svchost obviously, but
 whatever, i'm forgetting details in chronological order) so I tried music and stuff. I tried my front and back Audio plugs on my pc (one on the little USB dock underneath my dvd drive) and neither work with headphones or my sound system :[ So i went to device
 manager to try to update/repair my sound drivers or something, and that didn't work. I tried restarting in hopes that all these problems would resolves themselves, and that didn't work. So i tried to open the internet and google myself some info.<br />
<br />
THEN i noticed another problem. My taskbar wasn't working (I didn't notice this when all I had open was taskmanager :S) I could click the start button and all, and the start button worked. AND my taskbar displayed time and icons next to that. But, no windows
 were being docked on the taskbar. Even now, with 5 windows open my taskbar is empty. And my quicklaunch bar is gone too. This makes it a pain because if I minimize or anything, I have to resort to alt tab to navigate my windows. :[ sadface.<br />
<br />
So, I tried to download some fixes. For my audio first. I uninstalled my soundmax drivers, and tried to restart hoping for automatic reinstallation of my soundcard. Noluck. I tried downloading some soundmax drivers off of the web, and the installations are
 getting errors and stopping. I'm kinda slowly realizing that my computer got reallllllly effed up by this crash. On some recommendation for looking for a file for ONE of the problems i have, I opened up an explorer window and tried to open search, and the
 search bar on the side is empty except for the dog graphic :\ I tried running "sfc /scannow" to see if it would detect/repair any missing/corrupted system files, but it ran for like 15minutes and dissapeared while I wasn't looking (what with my taskbar not
 letting me keep an eye on all of my windows.) <br />
<br />
Soooo I was like, I'm going to try to system restore these problems away, even if it deletes games I installed yesterday or whenever this week. I open up system restore from the start menu, and it says "System Restore is not able to protect your computer. Please
 restart your computer, and then run System Restore again." This is my third time restarting x_x I tried to open up my anti-malware program, Malwarebytes, and it gets a system error 732 or something. I googled that and it's cause I'm missing a file somewhere,
 so I just said whatever, I'll try to fix that later if all this doesn't lead to someone recommending a reformat and nothing else.<br />
<br />
With a reformat in mind, I wanted to backup some important files to myself onto my flash drive. This was when I learned one of the worst problems yet, my inability to backup files. I can't drag and drop anything on windows. Be it desktop or explorer windows.
 AND I can't copy and paste anything, with cntrl+c/v or right click. Same for cutting/pasting. So now I'm like. ohshit. I'm screwed and I'm not going to be able to save anything either. I'm sooooo pissed. Now, the taker and ending of my little story is that,
 I don't have an XP disk on hand right now. And PC is life, obviously.. This is 2010 and I won't have a PC for probably a week if I have to wipe my harddrive. The ONLY advantage to all of this is that my computer needs to be clean wiped anyways, I just wish
 it wasn't being forced and violently might I add. Oh, and even if I were to get an XP disk, I'm still in deep because, I don't have any of the disks for any of my hardware anymore. Like my soundcard and video card :[ Or anything else that a disk would be necessary
 for. I've had this computer with no problems for 6 years (Yeah, I know an upgrade is in order, but honestly, I don't have a job, and I'm probably not as old as you think I may be.) without any real problems, and over time lost without real care the disks essential
 to the revival of my pc in a crisis :[</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>...what have you been doing with it for 6 years ? ....obviously not learning how important it is to back up regularly.</strong></div>
<div><strong>...as for "reformatting,"&nbsp; borrow an XP disk and "repair install," if you ever get your data backed up / out onto other media first of course.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Haven't you ever heard of Norton Ghost, or Acronis True Image, it's no good waiting until something like this happens, and then wishing you'd taken precautions, e.g. Norton Ghosting everything out to an external hard-disk for example.</strong><br />
<br />
So, that's all I have to say. Lets get to the tech-specs. I'm just going to give a dxdiag report, to save on time typing out a hundred things. If you want me to type out my system info because dxdiag are too thorough and long, then just tell me. :] Thanks for
 reading up to here~<br />

<p>Hehe. I'm no technician but I can recognize easily enough when my computer is operating at less then 1/4 normal capacity for no apparent reason, and when half of my GUI features aren't working x]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, i've decided to invest in saving for a backup surge battery style thing. I've allocated my most important files to a flashdrive thanks to the handiness that is winrar, and now i'm just saying ____'kit, the reformat is needed anyways. Thanks for your
 response. :]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, for future reference, although your information is nice and helpful for your average person, an unemployed person who knows more, doesn't have more, doesn't want to know how he should have bought backups and ghost drives and a bunch of hardware and
 surge protection devices x-x The only real thing I have is a surge-bar, so that while my computer info may become corrupted, atleast the hardware will go unharmed, and with a simple reset, it's alll goooooddd ;D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice to anyone who gets a problem like me: Too bad for you, reformat that ____!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got an XP disk luckily off my friend today, so that's good. I'll be all fixed up in a few hours. And my harddrive will be empty again! I only play like 2-3 games nowadays, and somehow my computer is full. I don't use anything other then basic software
 and games x-X</p>

            We can try to install the drivers manually. It looks like whenever your machine crashed, someone reloaded Windows without installing the device drivers.
<div><br />
<div>Let's start by trying to install the sound driver first. This one we may have to do manually but the others should be automatic. Give this a try:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Go to:&nbsp;<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7z465.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7z465.exe</a>&nbsp;and download the 7zip archive manager</div>
<div>2. Download, save, and install the utility to your computer</div>
<div>3. Once the utility is installed, go ahead and re-download the sound driver package</div>
<div>4. Save the package to your desktop (or someplace easy to get to)</div>
<div>5. Once the package is downloaded, find it, right click it, and choose 'Extract Here...' or something in similar nature. Basically we are going to extract the contents of the package and manually install it</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. Once the contents are extracted, go to START</div>
<div>7. In the START menu, right click 'Computer' and choose 'Properties'</div>
<div>8. In the upper left hand corner, click 'Device Manager'</div>
<div>9. Find your Multimedia Audio Controller, right click it, and select 'Update Driver...'</div>
<div>10. Click 'Browse My Computer for Driver Software'</div>
<div>11. Click the 'Browse' button at the top</div>
<div>12. Navigate to where the extracted files from that driver package are</div>
<div>13. Browse into the extracted folder and choose the file listed. If there are multiple ones, pick one and and if it is right, the installer will continue. If not, the installer will display and error and then you would simply go back and try the alternate</div>
<div><br />
<div>14. From here, the installer should walk you through the rest of the simple steps of manually installing the driver package</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as your other drivers go, I would recommend going to Gateway's site and searching for a Modem driver for your computer's model. The sound driver should be taken care of at this point and the Ethernet driver may be an attached wireless adapter you
 have. You may have to look for a driver for it on Gateway's site OR if you purchased the adapter you would need to go to the device manufacturer's website and obtain a driver there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let us know what happens,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Slideshow backgrounds for Xbox Home - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Slideshow backgrounds for Xbox Home</h2>
                    <p>Hello all. I can represent some mass of people when I say that this has been bothering me for some time: I enjoy desktop background slideshows in Windows, so that when I get bored of a background it'll slide to a new one, but this is not on Xbox for some reason. Why can't a person set up a slideshow of achievement art, pictures and stuff for the background on the Xbox Home/Dashboardd? This needs to be a feature soon, who's with me?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Easter Egss &#47; Tips and Tricks</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all the stuff going on right now, I figured we could list any easter eggs found so far.
</p>
<p>Not sure if this is on Windows 8/8.1, but on Windows 10 by pressing control+shift and right clicking on the taskbar, you get and extra option on the menu to "Exit Explorer".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking that kills Explorer.exe and the only way back is to start Task Manager (Control + Alt + Delete &gt; Task Manager) and go File &gt; Run New Task &gt; Explorer.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things like this have been around since forever so if you guys find anything else, post it here.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>First, clean thoroughly the computers. Use Malware scanners like this free scanner.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clamwin.com/content/view/18/46/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.clamwin.com/content/view/18/46/</a></p>
<p>Then look at the system Windows (Control Panel, System) and make sure that both computers are configured to the same Group name and each one has a unique personal name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p>Routers have a Hard Reset button (read the Router’s manual), do hard Reset and the Router will be back to the way it was when you got it (and get rid of whatever the other person did).</p>
<p>Follow the rest of the instructions the way you did it when you first installed the Router.</p>

            My laptop started out with Xp, installed from the factory. Then my Hard Drive died and I bought a new one. Then I installed Win7 and a week later, that Hard Drive quit working. So, I bought another one and installed Win7 again. A couple weeks later, I
 upgraded to Win 10 and it hasn't worked since. I've updated all the drivers and I've noticed my video controller wasn't working and won't update. when I try to play a Dvd, it plays every couple of frames and then stops. Then I get an error message saying my
 driver isn't working/ installed. I've tried updating it and it won't install. Any ideas?

                    I have a new Windows 8 laptop that will be shared by three people.&nbsp; Each has their own Microsoft account.&nbsp; Is there a way to automatically logout after, say, 10 minutes of inactivity?&nbsp; Or an option to choose which user upon reboot or sleep?

            <p>There are several deframentation utilities that include a "boot time defrag" feature, which is the only way to defragment the MFT.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also suggest you create a System Image using Windows 7 "Backup and Restoe" prior to performing this type of defragmentation for safeties sake.</p>
