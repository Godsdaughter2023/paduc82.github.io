<h2>            Gamertag Taken But Not Taken&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, there's a gamertag I want right. Now, I go to change to it, it says it's taken. So I look for the profile and when I search the name it says there's no one with the name.&nbsp;So is it taken or not???&nbsp;Would it be reserved for someone else or something?</p><p><br /></p><p>Apologies if this is in the wrong section</p>

            <p>if the system says it's taken, then it's taken. The tag system is in use on other Microsoft services, so even if it's not in use on an Xbox, it may be in use somewhere else. The system also doesn't see things like spaces as making a gamertag unique. So while you might look up "gamertag" and it doesn't show up, it might actually be in use as "gamer tag".&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Error messages that I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t resolve</h2>
                    
<p>Hi..Bought my son an Xbox One 3 days ago..he used it non stop until mid game last night an error message froze the screen. We unplugged and reset but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>it said : Something went wrong &nbsp;System error E201 00(some letters - don't remember) then another 9 zeros. Couldn't find "201" error code on line anywhere. Called customer service (Philippines) and after 40 mins they said to return unit. It's 3 days old !!
 and my son spent hours setting up , linking with friends and earning levels in his NBA game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I unplugged again and this time a new error message popped up but the screen was still frozen (couldn't navigate my options) : Something went wrong&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Restart this Xbox/ Trouble shoot</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System Error: E200 0000001A 00000000</p>
<p>Unplugged again...new error message...back to the E201 code but different last 16 digits (no letters..just numbers). Cant navigate through any of the error screens.</p>
<p>Assumed it was some sort of updating issue but my son said he had it on automatic update and its been fine until last night...any ideas ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please recognize, i can barely turn this thing on...understanding tech behind it is impossible. So baby steps please :) thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>AqueousMage557&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>E200 can be caused by update issues. I would suggest following<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/errors/error-code-e200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this link</a>, and using the system update solution linked in this KB article. The same update solution listed in the e200
 link would also apply for E201 errors. That said, if your console is only 3 days old I would highly suggest taking your using back to the retailer, and exchanging it for another one. Provided you keep your Xbox connected to the internet all the saves and settings
 are backed up to the cloud. You will however need to reinstall any games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Hello won&#39;t work for a family member account</h2>
                    <p>Windows Hello worked in my administrator account but when I created a family account for my wife, it won't let her activate Windows Hello in her account. It appears to start working but when it gets to the point where it needs to scan her face to set it
 up an error message says that something went wrong and the camera isn't working. However, the camera worked for mine and it also works if she wants to take a picture of herself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on?</p>

<h2>            Error code 80070002 from Backup in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Windows Backup is giving me error 80070002 (The system cannot find the file specified.) My Toshiba Satellite L755 runs Windows 7 Home Premium. I am trying to backup to a Toshiba Canvio Slim II 500GB USB hard drive. I see in Event Viewer that each time, the
 error message refers to the same file (C:\Users\[my name]\Desktop\1 FAT32\Mein\Aircraft\Ford Tri-Motor\MVI_5222.AVI), which I can find in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried chkdsk in safe mode; checked that the "volume" I am backing up from is online and assigned a letter; entered "mountvol /r" followed by "mountvol /e" in Command Prompt; checked that the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service is disabled;
 and I tried clean booting with .NET framework disabled, then running Backup with avast! Antivirus shields disabled. I tried using SFC, but it froze my laptop during verification at 88%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is related, but last week I found that avast! got stuck during full scans, as I explained in detail here: https://forum.avast.com/?topic=211848.0 After scanning my computer overnight (Dec 22-23) and running chkdsk in safe mode yesterday,
 the Windows Backup error I mentioned there (0x81000037) was replaced by the current error (80070002).</p>

            Sorry for not including them in my list, but I have already tried checking profiles in the registry (none missing or duplicated, though some profiles that I deleted are still listed, which has not caused this problem, as their deletion did not cause this
 problem that week), found that my laptop's BCD is in the same partition as Windows (which is mounted and has "C:" as its assigned letter), and my laptop is not dual-boot. I read those threads and tried what they listed before starting my own.<br />

            Thanks for the response, I had to reinstall a fresh windows from scratch because nothing I tried work, couldn't go in the computer at all, not even safe mode, etc... My only available option was to restore with Windows 10, because I couldn't even revert
 back to windows 7.

<h2>            dll initialization failed</h2>
                    
<p>I'm running Windows XP prof SP3 on a Dell Inspiron 9300 laptop. About 70% of the time, when I shut down, I get an error message as follows - "Shellrestart.exe - dll initialization failed." Box then says, "application failed to initialize because the window
 station is shutting down." If I do nothing, shut down stalls for a few moments, then proceeds to shut down.&nbsp; What may be causing this error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            AFAIK, shellrestart.exe is not a component of Windows. Most likely, it's part of an application you installed, or it's a malware. Check out where is this shellrestart.exe located exactly, and find out what is it.

    <title>Free Xbox live&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ritzycracker0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Free Xbox live&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I I play a lot of Xbox and PlayStation, and Playstation used to be free up until a point. And now Xbox and Playstation both cost money to play online, so I was wondering if Xbox will ever make Xbox Live Gold free like PlayStation did in the past. If not I had an idea, what if they had free Xbox Live weekends every two weeks or so. This could really boost their rates and players, and also it just makes Xbox experience more fun.</p>

                    I would like to bring the attention of professionals working on Windows 10 development that I have an HP Envy 15 K102tx, officially supporting Windows 10. Now When I click shut down from the as usual Start Button--&gt;power--&gt;Shut Down, but after using the
 laptop for around 15-20 minutes, then I see that Windows shuts down properly, the screen goes pitch black, but my Power button lights and backlit keyboard lights are still on. So I have to switch off by pressing and holding the power button.
<strong>I tried to disable the hybrid boot from power options, but no avail</strong>. So currently I am doing a full shut down by 3 methods. 1---&gt;By holding shift button while clicking shut down. 2--&gt;Clicking shut down from Win+X options. 3--&gt;Assigning what
 pressing the power button does to shut down and clicking that button once. All these 3 options shut down my laptop fully. But the normal shut down option, shuts my Windows leaving my keyboard and power button lights on. But somehow if i restart my laptop or
 fresh start my laptop and shut down immediately within 3-4 minutes after start (using the as usual common shut down in power options from start menu), then my laptop shut downs completely. But shut down from Win+X or clicking shift button while shutting down
 from as usual shut down from start menu always work for me.<br />
<br />
Hence I would like to bring the attention of Windows 10 developers to such unusual issue and help in making Windows 10 better by making it a more user friendly way.

            <p>I have an HP Rove, about 1 year old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power shutdown always worked before I upgraded to Windows 10 but now I have to manually shut down my computer half the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power settings are all 1 minute but that hasn't helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking shutdown worked as before, I shut down my computer and went about my business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several hours later, when I went to turn the computer on, I found it was still on, so now I don't leave it until it either shuts down itself or I do it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an improvement?</p>

<p>For the time being, hold the shift button while clicking shut down. Or try shutting down by pressing Win+X button, shut down and sign out--&gt;shut down. If it still happens, try to do a clean format of your PC. But if the problem still persists, but only on
 Windows 10, then there is definitely some bug in windows 10, provided your system supports windows 10 officially.<br />
<br />
I hope MS fixes this bug in the next update(claimed my MS to be released supposedly, in the 1st week of August)<br />

            <p>Well, after a lot of experimentation, I figured out something:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84fbf9a6-53d6-41ae-b850-e2d2a52307b6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you <strong>just clean format your pc, </strong>for most laptops(but not for thinkpads), in DAC, type it shows "n/a" unless you install Intel HD driver. Also your dedicated graphics memory shows as 0 instead of 128 MB or 64 MB(varies). Somehow for thinkpads
 and a very few laptops, DAC type shows internal, immediately after installation, even if Intel HD drivers are not installed(either manually or via windows update), but DAC Type will&nbsp;<strong>not be n/a for them</strong> but somehow, Intel HD Graphics Control
 Panel tab will be missing unless it is installed. Now for those whose DAC type showes as n/a, dedicated memory shows 0 MB, for them, they cannot put their laptop to sleep. The Sleep settings will be missing througout their laptop, until DAC type changes to
 either Internal or it shows Nvidia/AMD or something. Your sleep setting will be missing only if DAC type is n/a. When I mean Sleep setting is missing, it should be missing in the following places.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea9564ed-6d41-4e00-91d3-ce42a27597a5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If we don't get to see Sleep anywhere in the above pic or you can't get to see Sleep in the drop down menus for&nbsp;<strong>"when i press power button" and "when i close the lid"</strong> (and the 2nd option should be missing in the above pic), only then I am
 able to do <strong>full shutdown </strong>of my laptop wherein my backlit keyboard and the lights on power button and the fans(sound) are gone. As soon as DAC type changes to internal(this will happen if you have internet connection on, as Windows will forcefully
 download updates), then the shutdown is done partially i.e. Windows shutdown is done, but our laptops are put to sleep instead of shutdown. Now when sleep is used normally, to get out of sleep, generally it asks for login password and after entering it, you
 resume from where you left. But here nothing happens, because Windows has already been turned off.<br />
<br />
From this I arrived to the the conclusion that our laptops are put to sleep, and putting a computer to sleep is handled by the OS and not the laptop. Hence I think, its a bug in Microsoft and not from our laptops.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in the other way round, we are going to face problems like glitches in screen and slow performance in our laptops if DAC Type is shown n/a. Temporarily you can set DAC type to n/a by disabling your graphics adapter under
<strong>"Device Manager". </strong>But somehow after a restart, it enables the adapter silently(and you can conclude this, when after a restart, it again asks for a restart).
<br />
<br />
But for me, when DAC Type is displayed n/a or Sleep options are missing throughout, no matter how much time I use my laptop, it shuts down completely.
<strong>But this is not a feasible solution</strong> for such a kind of issue, as it will definitely affect the performance of your system. Now as soon as DAC Type changes to internal, 99% of the time, it never shuts down completely. But somehow,
<strong>if you restart your system and then immediately do shutdown using the as usual common method of shutdown from start menu, it shuts down completely.</strong> Currently, I am using this method to shut down my laptop, as I feel forcefully shutting down
 from the power button might be unhealthy for my laptop. But no one likes to go a long way to do a proper shut down. I tried all the other solutions mentioned in different forums, like creating a shortcut with cmd commands in notepad, to disable fastboot to
 disable fastboot in registry editor to holding shift key while shutting down to sign out and then shut down, but all these methods work according to their
<strong>mood. </strong>Sometimes they shut down completely and sometimes they don't (most of the times, they
<strong>don't</strong>). MS cared for itself, i mean the OS, but not for our laptops.(I dunno why, most of the complainers are using HP laptops, including me, no idea whether other users are facing this too).<br />
<br />
I hereby request MS to fix this bug of putting laptops to sleep after shutting down the OS, ASAP in their "Update Patch" supposedly to be released in early August, as claimed by MS. I am thinking to switch back to Windows 8.1 if the August Update doesn't fix
 this issue, because, seriously, such issues are not healthy for our hard-disks(even though not as dangerous as pulling out the plug).</p>

            I have this incomplete shutdown problem on my HP Pavillion 15. Have tried every thing and am of the opinion that this something to do with Microsoft, had similar problem with getting into safe mode and that due to Microsoft seeing me as not properly signed
 in even although I could access my account ok. Fixed that by changing Password but only works for short period on this problem. Tried shutting down by going directly to lock screen but works sometimes. Probably needs a windows 10 reinstall and why this problem
 only affects some PC's and occurrs off and on is beyond me.

            Not sure that all of this is correct, I got rid of sleep option and it does not show in dropdown but still get this shutdown problem. Why there is so many variations of this shutdown problem is confusing everybody &nbsp;, nothing seems to work permanently.
 Agree whole heartedly that this is OS problem caused by Microsoft Software.&nbsp;

<h2>            Dragon Age Inquistion Info</h2>
                    
<p>Found this on another forum and thought I'd share...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>[quote]Game Informer this month has extensive details about BioWare’s Dragon Age: Inquisition. Developed by BioWare Edmonton, the RPG will release next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
<br />
.</p>
<div><b>The Story</b></div>
<p>.<br />
Dragon Age: Inquisition tells of the land of Thedas. It’s a mess. The Chandry are warring with the mages, and the the Seekers of Truth and the Templers have broken away from the former.<br />
.<br />
“Every group with the power and authoritiy to confront evil is preoccupied – and then the sky opens up and demons start pouring out,” Game Informer writes.<br />
.<br />
A tear in the sky links to the Fade, a place of magic and demons. This allows demons, who would otherwise need a host to enter the human realm, to cross freely.<br />
.</p>
<div><b>The World</b></div>
<p>.<br />
Described as “more open world,” players are able to access “significant areas” of the world map. “You’ll be going from eastern Ferelden to western Orlais,” says the executive producer of the Dragon Age franchise, Mark Darrah. “Obviously, we’re not going to
 build a million square miles of space, so that means we’re not a truly open world in the way some people think.”<br />
.<br />
Each area is larger than anything they have built previously, he added. The repetitive level design is “no where to be found” in Inquisition. A bog, a desert, and a mountain range, all described as “enormous,” were of note in the demo, according to the magazine.<br />
.<br />
Gameplay “threads” are littered throughout these areas. “You might find a mysterious pile of corpses as your reach the top of a sand dune,” they write. “Or an arcade device that lets you pinpoint the location of magic items.”<br />
.<br />
Darrah explains that he’s been trying to drive exploration, an aspect he claims BioWare “hasn’t done in a while.” He compares the exploration of the upcoming Inquisition with that of the Baldur’s Gate series, which is also a BioWare creation.<br />
.<br />
He also wants to ensure that the game taps into spontaneous exploration and discovery, and says that there is an “absolute, elemental, and primal joy” in discovering something unknown and unexpected, and discovering something others might not. Player initiative
 is where an more open design shines, he says.<br />
.<br />
Locations in Inquisition are described as “contained open world,” with items and content to collect and engage with. Day and night are also mentioned. Mounts, which are said to be “more involved than simply riding a horse around,” will also be in the game.
 “Very little” of the content is scaled to the player’s level, meaning random encounters with enemies, such as dragons, can be far more powerful and incredibly dangerous.<br />
.<br />
Whilst player freedom is important to BioWare, the team doesn’t want to sacrifice narrative as its expense. “We definitely need to make sure that we can still tell the kind of story that we want to tell,” Darrah tells Game Informer.<br />
.<br />
Balancing player-driven exploration and “organic” environmental-narrative with a emotionally engaging, character-driven story has been one of their biggest challenges, according to the BioWare vet.<br />
.</p>
<div><b>Engine</b></div>
<p>.<br />
Dragon Age: Inquisition runs on the Frostbite 3 engine—technology now used for many of EA’s internal projects, such as Battlefield and the upcoming Mirror’s Edge 2, as opposed to BioWare’s Eclipse engine, which was used for Dragon Age II.<br />
.<br />
“Frostbite is a real paradigm shift for BioWare, and even more so for Dragon Age,” says Darrah.<br />
.<br />
He describes Eclipse as “a little long in the tooth,” and goes onto say that the transition to Frostbite allows them to investigate opportunities previously denied by their old technology. Namely, large areas with lots of interactivity. The large, open areas
 in Inquisition are said to be “a direct result” of using Frostbite.<br />
.<br />
Built by DICE, the developer responsible for the Battlefield series, the team expended great effort to adapt what was traditionally a first-person shooter engine into a role-playing engine, but are “very happy” with what the technology allows them to do.<br />
.<br />
Known for its environmental interaction, the technology will be used for limited destructibility, as well as construction. Destroying the support beam under an archer-filled platform is given as an example, or magically fixing a crumbling footbridge to get
 to a new area. Restoring a ruined desert outpost will allow the player to transform it into an Inquisition stronghold.<br />
.<br />
As Inquisition is set for release on both current and next-generation platforms, as well as PC, Darrah said that the team are “striving really hard” to not let the gameplay be affected by technical differences. They want the experience to be as similar to each
 other as possible across all platforms.<br />
.<br />
The PC version will also have a control scheme customized for mouse and keyboard.<br />
.</p>
<div><b>The Inquisitor and the Inquisition</b></div>
<p>.<br />
The player controls the Inquisitor, the head of the Inquisition. Race, class—with a choice between mage, warrior, and rogue—gender, and name are chosen by the player. The Inquisitor is also “fully voiced.” Racial considerations also impact interactions with
 others in certain areas, as some races may be persecuted in a particular area.<br />
.<br />
By interacting with the world—such as collecting things, helping others or completing quests—the Inquisition grows in both strength and reputation. “It’s fundamentally about giving an organization the same kind of progression you might expect out of a character.”<br />
.<br />
It’s also noted that BioWare will not yet reveal how this progression will be communication, and “how players experience that sense of improvement.”<br />
.<br />
Game progression is also determined by the Inquisition’s level of power, as “areas of interest” on the world map aren’t accessible without a the meeting such power requirements. This is achieved, as previously explained, by interacting with the world in various
 ways, leaving the player able to purse content more suited to their tastes.<br />
.</p>
<div><b>Combat</b></div>
<p>.<br />
Game Informer writes that Inquisition‘s combat pace “rests in a place between the two previous entries.”<br />
.<br />
“I look at strategy and tactics as a natural out-growth of something that Dragon Age has delivered in spades,” said Creative Director Mike Laidlaw. He also says that “pause-and-play” is part of BioWare’s legacy, and that he wants to maintain that alongside
 the speed and crispness of response, which he believes to be part of modern gaming.<br />
.<br />
Players can switch between characters or set behaviors for each ally. Instantly-executed commands are said to lend Inquisition “the feeling of a third-person action game.” The game’s combat speed and enemy design are intended to push the player toward a more
 deliberate approach, tactics-orientated approach.<br />
.<br />
Enemies have specialized roles and work in groups. Prowlers, for example, tend to hide and sneak, avoiding face-to-face confrontations.<br />
.<br />
“Imagine trying to immobilize and take out a disruptive prowler while you’re also being shot at by archers, evading swipes from a bruiser’s two-handed axe, and worrying about the enchanter in the back who is buffing all enemies on the field. ”<br />
.<br />
Enemies are to said to make tactical considerations based on the player’s location, cool down times and their own amount of health.<br />
.<br />
Class-based skills trees and specializations make a return in Inquisition. Class abilities can be used to compliment each other. This “insists that you can approach combat with an all-action philosophy, all-tactics, or anywhere in between.”<br />
.</p>
<div><b>Other Characters</b></div>
<p>.<br />
Beyond coordination and complimentary abilities in combat, dialogue and story are said to be the player’s “primary connection” with their allies.<br />
.<br />
BioWare have yet to reveal the identity of the main antagonist, although it’s reported that players “learn early on that a single mastermind is behind the breach and all of the chaos surrounding it.”<br />
.</p>
<div><b>Style</b></div>
<p>.<br />
Equipment in Inquisition is adapted to each character to avoid tarnishing each character’s “signature style.” Through crafting, players can turns items collected from exploration and combat and transform them into new armor, or customize existing equipment.<br />
.<br />
With this focus on customization, crafting is designed to allow players to mix and match between substance and style. Players can apply the best stats to any piece of armor. In effect, it seems as though the player could have “end game” statistics on the appearance
 of “starting” gear.<br />
.<br />
“[Party members] will keep their iconic look,” claims Darrah. “If you take a character like Cassandra, for example: She has an inconic look with a trench-coat almost, with armor underneath that.” He then explains that, although new armor will make her look
 “very different.” she will retain her unique silhouette.<br />
.</p>
<div><b>Choices</b></div>
<p>.<br />
“Dragon Age has always been about hard decisions, where there’s no clear path,” says the series’ lead writer, David Gaider. “If we can successfully argue either side of an issue and not feel like a sociopath doing so, then that is a good avenue for us to explore.”<br />
.<br />
Inquisition wants players to consider the outcome of their decisions, as they will be forced to live with them for the continuation of the game. Not unlike its predecessor, Inquisition will use a dialogue wheel, although improved this time around. Clarity seems
 to be the focus, as some options in the previous game would apparently intrigue reactions that surprised players.<br />
.<br />
Consequences will “ripple” throughout the world, with some encounters and sections of the game determined by earlier decisions, according to Laidlaw.<br />
.<br />
BioWare wants a player’s actions to have an impact on the world. Levels can change and new content can be unlocked based on your actions. “It’s not just a couple of level changes; it’s something that permeates the whole game,” says Laidlaw. “You did this at
 one point in the game, and that’s going to come back and bite you in the ***.”<br />
.<br />
The development team doesn’t want players to worry about their platform of choice and bringing forward decisions made in previous Dragon Age titles. The team is “currently investigating ways to maintain consistency in choice”, according to the magazine. “But
 is not ready to reveal specifics. ”[/quote]</p>

<p>While this all sounds good... the one thing I'd like to know, is about the save import feature. How will it work for Xbox 1/PlayStation 4 users who want to import their save game info from Dragon Age II over? It's not explained above, but I'm wondering if
 it'll be something similar to what DICE are planning with Battlefield 4 on Next Gen and current gen consoles...</p>

<h2>            Email contact list download</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new desk top that came with Windows 10. Is there any way to sink Windows 10 Mail&nbsp; with my I Pad so that contacts are automatically updated on both systems like it was doing with Windows Vista and my Apple I Pad. I have over 200 contacts with
 all their information in Windows Mail (Vista Version) . How can I get this info into Windows 10 like I can on Apple devices and my Yahoo mail account with an automatic download. It looks like with windows 10 you have to manually enter all your contact info
 one at a time. I would rather have a desk top computer program with all the features that existed in Microsoft's previous versions of Windows than what now looks like a lame version of a social media platform. Windows 10 also dropped the Photo Gallery feature
 that was in previous versions. This was an app that I used extensively in my business. I would go back to Windows 7 or even Vista if they were still available. I've had nothing but problems with Windows 10.</p>

<p>You would have to sync the contacts through Apple iTunes first, then sync them with your iPad.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the contact files are in .cvs format, what you can do is import them into the Contacts personal folder.</p>

            I think this answer assumes I'm trying to get contacts from the People App in Windows 10 to my I pad. There is nothing in the Peoples App. I'm trying to find a way to move all of my contact information from my I pad to the peoples app in Windows10. I moved
 them from Vista to a file before which I can't download to Windows 10 so I downloaded it to my I pad. I trying to find a way to get my contacts file into Windows 10 Mail or Peoples app. without having to manually enter everything. Every Mail app in the world
 lets me download a contacts file except Windows 10 Mail. What was Microsoft thinking when they deleted this feature in Windows 10?<br />

<p>The problem is moving the Contacts Folder, which is now on Widows 10, to the People's App so I can get an Email address from the Peoples App through Windows 10 Mail. I don't know how to access the Contacts Folder from the Mail App. There's not much point
 in having a contacts folder if you can't access it when you are trying to send an Email.
</p>
<p>Also how do I determine what format the Contact List is in ?</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many possible reasons why you are unable to sync your contacts on your Windows 10 Mail app with your iPad. One of these is due to configuration settings on your People's app. Just to make sure we have not missed on anything, may we know if you
 already followed the procedures provided by our MVP Andre?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still need help, do not hesitate to reply.</p>

            My problem is not syncing Mail with my iPad. It's trying to find some way to get my contact list linked to the Mail app in Windows 10 so that when I need to address an email I don't have to first look up the person in Contacts to get their Email address
 and then enter it manually in Mail. All older versions on Email apps from Microsoft Windows had an address book in the email app so it was almost automatic to get and enter an Email address by looking up a persons name and a simple click did the job. I would
 like to use Windows Mail but it is so cumbersome I have been forced to use my iPad for all of my Emails. Is there any way to solve this problem?<br />

<p>I copied the file from Windows Mail in Vista to a flash drive and then downloaded the flash drive to a file folder in my new Windows 10. It;s listed under&nbsp; Folders as "Contacts this PC/ desktop". How can I make this contact list available in Mail. The file&nbsp;
 lists people's names alphabetical and contains their Email address, phone numbers and home addresses. Is there anyway to link this to Windows 10 Mail so I can highlight a name and have it automatically placed on the address line of an Email I am preparing
 like it did in Windows Mail under Vista or most every other Email system I ever worked with. Right now I have to look up a persons name from my contacts list that I placed on the desk top, copy down their Email address and then go to Windows Mail and type
 in the E mail address. This is far too cumbersome to use and as a result I've been using Apple's mail service on my iPad.
</p>
<p>Also is there any way to create Group Mailing list like I could under Windows Mail in Vista?</p>

            Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "web-mail". Do you mean like Yahoo, the mail service from my internet provider. If so, then yes I did down load the contact list to Yahoo mail without any problems. It's only Windows 10 Mail that doesn't provide for
 downloading contacts into the Mail app.<br />

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Secure Boot option is only available on computers that are using a UEFI replacement for the traditional BIOS on the motherboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(UEFI = Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Secure Boot option is disabled, by default on many of the computers that have been sold, since many of these had versions of Windows installed that did not support that component.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another issue is that there are many different menu configurations for systems with UEFI. This makes it difficult to explain how to configure the UEFI secure boot option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is recommended that you contact the PC Manufacturer for the information about how to configure the Secure Boot option on your particular computer. The manufacturer will know the version of UEFI that is installed and have the information for setting this
 option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information about UEFI;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UEFI 2.2 specification adds a protocol known as Secure boot, which can secure the boot process by preventing the loading of drivers or OS loaders that are not signed with an acceptable digital signature.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Blue Screen errors (also sometimes called black screen errors or STOP code errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says, "Windows has been shut down to prevent
 damage to your computer." </p>
<p>
</p><p>These errors can be caused by both hardware and software problems. If you added new hardware to your PC before the Blue Screen error, shut down your PC, remove the hardware, and try restarting.</p>

            <p>Was informed overnight by Microsoft tech regarding Start Screen Failure in Windows 10. He suggested I do a restore to 10 or 11 August to get me going for awhile. 1. Why is this happening ? and 2. He said if that doesn't cure the issue, to revert to 8.1.
 Seems totally counterintuitive and to access the system restore, I would need to access the functions vis the start page. Then, the alternative suggested of using the search function via a mouse to the upper right corner produces nothing and has worked before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was required to revert to 8.1, how would I do that completely ? Windows 10 was installed by a foreign based tech</p>

            No my problem is still not solved. I read about someone facing similar problem. He was advice to create a CD using Microsoft media creation tool. My question is can I do the same and repair my laptop. Can someone please reply.

<p>
</p><p>Need to book a repair but before that most of my data is in the desktop and some not backed up. What i would like to know is that if i try connecting a external display will i be able to boot in and do a back up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst of all, i dont have a store in my city and will have to ship it, so will the support guys be able to do a back up for me even for an extra amount?</p>

            Hi Thom
<br />
<br />A few users are reporting this in the last few days . . .
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop and choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Is your Resolution set to the one marked (recommended) and is that the correct resolution?
<br />
<br />Is scale set to 100%
<br />
<br />Close that settings page
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, do you see an entry for a video card control panel (Intel, Nvidia . . .etc)
<br />
<br />If so, open that control panel
<br />
<br />From there, look for an aspect ration setting and change that to see if that can fir your display to your screen . . .
<br />
<br />Are you using a laptop or a PC with a separate monitor?

<h2>            Skype for Business auto-answered an incoming voice call&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was IM'ing with a colleague and he hit the Call button. I have a headset attached to my computer but was not wearing it. The ring came in but before I could decline the call I noticed that it was already answered! He had been sitting there listening to
 me breathing and typing for ten or so seconds. I am making this assumption based on the elapsed time timer displayed on the call buttons window; I assume it does not increment in time if it's only ringing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I disable this? I looked at all the options in the options dialog tabs and saw no auto-answer option.</p>

<p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my research and tests, I cannot find such an option to let Skype for business auto-answer the incoming call. If you were communicating with IM and he made a Skype call to you, you should receive a notification as the following screenshot shown:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f24f90c4-a1d8-409f-9630-2f1808c8163d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f24f90c4-a1d8-409f-9630-2f1808c8163d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only if you click <strong>Answer the Call</strong>, the connection will be established. In this case, I’d like to confirm whether you’ve clicked this button unintentionally.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I also would like to confirm whether this issue occurs every time after receiving a call from others. If so, I suggest you try to

do an online repair</a> and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm guessing the takeaway, even if unstated, is that the timer starts during ring, because that was the evidence I went on. It was the little miniature call action window I'm referring to that had the call counter incrementing from 9 seconds by the time
 I saw it. I am too busy to repro this right now. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. To verify whether you clicked the Answer the Call option unintentionally at that time, I suggest you try to reproduce this issue and share us with the test results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’d like to confirm what’s the version of your Office 365 programs. Please make sure that the Skype for business is
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
updated to the latest version</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, you can try following the steps below to clear the cache of your Skype for business:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the %localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync folder.</li><li>Delete your sip profile folder</li><li>Go into the Tracing folder</li><li>Delete the all files, but not the folders </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, may I know whether this issue occur every time when you make a Skype call?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Initially I thought it was an issue with my graphics card drivers which I had recently updated (that's what most of the posts I've read here say) but I've tried literally every available driver for my graphics card (NVidia GTX675M). Now, when this initially
 happened and rolling back the graphics driver didn't fix things, I immediately jumped to the 'must be a virus' conclusion (stupid teenager lol) and proceeded to reinstall windows on my machine. Due to this, I am now unable to use the 'last known good configuration'
 option for startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried flashing my BIOS to a more up-to-date version, and the crashes became more frequent. Now, I'm fairly certain that this is a GPU related issue as my computer will not crash if I'm either running on battery power (which uses the built-in motherboard
 GPU) or if I start in safe mode (which also doesn't use the 675M GPU). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run all the ePSA or whatever diagnostics which returned absolutely no errors, which I found a little unusual. I've tried every solution I've come across and still don't know what's wrong. I thought maybe it was an issue with the GPU overheating, so
 I checked the GPU fan and it is still operating normally and&nbsp;I replaced the standard heat-transfer goop between the GPU and the cooling system with a diamond-based goop so I know that isn't an issue (I also monitored GPU temps and didn't see anything abnormal).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried updating my GPU drivers, also to no avail. At this point, I'm wondering if it's a complex interaction between many drivers that isn't working for my GPU and thus causing a crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers!<br />

<p>
</p><p>You need to consider whether you are adopting a position that is practical. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please upload copies of your dump files as shared files (excluding any more than one month old or before you used a system restore point) to your OneDrive with a link here.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The dump file will be created at c:\windows\minidump. You may need to change your settings in Windows to be able to see the file. To show hidden files type
<strong>Folder Options</strong> in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll
 down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please provide a copy of your System Information file. Type
<strong>System Information</strong> in the Search Box above the start Button and press the ENTER key (alternative is Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, System Information). Select File, Export and give the file a name noting where it is
 located. <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Do not place the cursor within the body of the report before exporting the file.</span></strong> The system creates a new System Information file each time system information is accessed. You need to allow a minute
 or two for the file to be fully populated before exporting a copy. Please upload the file to your OneDrive, share with everyone and post a link here. Reports in normal mode preferred. Please say if the report has been obtained in safe mode.
</span><span>The request for a copy of this file is additional to answering the question about make and model. If the report is in a language other than English, please state the language.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For help with OneDrive see paragraph 9.3:<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Do you understand what these files contain?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The files requested are technical reports about how your system works and do not relate to personal data, which you naturally wish to protect. They may contain your machine name, your user name, and
 where software is installed. The files do not contain passwords, bank pin numbers, log-ons and complete product keys. It is for you to determine if that violates your privacy. You only need to leave a file in your OneDrive for the limited time necessary for
 the other party to retrieve the file. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Having requested thousands of reports in these forums over the last 3 years, I can only say that I have never encountered a complaint that an exchange of files has contributed to a
 breach of the users security and a loss of personal data. I am not an expert in computer security but breaches of security occur when a user allows direct access to their computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Access can be granted by the user knowingly allowing direct access or access being achieved by deception or trick though a camouflaged link in an incoming email or other communication.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you look at other threads you will find many other users sharing files, notably by those seeking help with diagnosing the causes of blue of death crashes. Exchanging copies of files is an extremely
 practical way to aid and expedite the finding of a solution to the problem the user has. You no doubt are aware that these are moderated public forums. Abuse of whatever kind in these forums is rigorously dealt with and those seeking to abuse others are excluded
 from using the forum. However, I have never seen the type of abuse you fear reported.

            <p>Thanks for the reply Gerry!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the position isn't very practical but I have signed several NDAs which don't allow me to give access to my machine and unfortunately I work remotely with the data providers, so there is not an in-house tech expert I can see about my computer. Thankfully
 I have another machine as well, so this isn't a question of not being able to do things with a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Computer Make and Model: </strong>Alienware M17 xR4</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the reports requested don't give anybody access to my machine, so I don't have a problem uploading them. Thanks for the explanation!</p>

</p><p><strong>None of the reports have been compiled in safe mode.</strong></p>

    <title>NO SETUP.EXE VISIBLE IN WINDOW.ISO FILE FOR WIN 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> normc_au  say:</h3>
<h2>            NO SETUP.EXE VISIBLE IN WINDOW.ISO FILE FOR WIN 10</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded MediaCreation Tool on 28/11/2015. I ran it and chose the ISO to DVD option. It downloaded and created a file WINDOWS.ISO (size on disk: 3.04 GB (3,275,489,280 bytes)). I then attempted to boot a PC from that DVD but the PC booted in its existing
 system. Reading Microsoft webpage (https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10) it says "If you’re using a USB flash drive or a DVD, insert it into the device that you want to upgrade, then run setup.exe."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fail to find setup.exe. Help here would be great as I don't have unlimited internet download and have several PCs and laptops to upgrade and I thought I had followed instructions to provide one download to be used on several machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, Norm</p>
