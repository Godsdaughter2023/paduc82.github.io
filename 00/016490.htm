<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview Installation Error</h2>
                    <p>I am currently on Windows 10 Technical Preview build 9873. I am attempting to upgrade to the new version that was released yesterday, but it is giving me the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We ran into an installation error. This might be because your PC doesn't meet system requirements or your language isn't available."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My language is English, and all of the system requirements are met so I'm not sure what's going on exactly, especially since I'm already on an older build of the Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Restart a couple times and try again.</p>
<p>Make sure you have full administrative privileges</p>
<p>If you are connected to a domain, switch to a local account</p>
<p>Disable your Antivirus utility before attempting the upgrade</p>
<p>Do a clean boot and try again</p>
<p>Close all open programs and make sure that PC Settings is the active window while the download completes, I notice if you switch to something else, the download will time out and fail</p>
<p>If you are updating over Wi-Fi, try switching to a Wired Connection.</p>
<p>Make sure Windows 10 is activated.</p>
<p>If you have any external devices attached to the machine, disconnect them (example, USB keys, external hard disc, printers, non-essential devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try updating using the .ISO file:</p>

Assuming this was a redirect from logging off Yahoo, you could also ask them.</p>
<p>I tried a Boolean search there but it was misinterpreted:</p>
<p>logoff redirect (ISP OR ATT) site:yahoo.com</p>
<p>BING similarly misinterprets it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not even Google gets it right but somehow it does get more results than either of the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This results comes from just looking at the ATT results</p>

try leaving your phone on the charger overnight while you sleep to see if this changes. if it doesn't, then you will most likely need to take your phone to your nearest Nokia Care point for inspection.

<h2>            double-sided printing</h2>
                    I have Office for Mac 2016 and an HP Envy 5660 printer. The printer is capable of double-sided printing, but I cannot find that option in the Word print menu. What am I missing?

<h2>            envelope addresses suddenly not aligning</h2>
                    I have a number of files created and saved to print single, #10 envelopes in Word 2010 to specific addresses. All worked fine until a few weeks ago when suddenly none of these files printed envelopes correctly. Both the main and return addresses have shifted
 several inches to the left. Have followed many of the suggestions found here and created new files to try to resolve the issue but nothing works. I can not get #10 envelopes to print with correctly aligned addresses. I should also mention that the problem
 with these files appeared after about a dozen updates to Office 2010 were downloaded and installed on 8/15/2012. May be a&nbsp;coincidence&nbsp;but odd that&nbsp;files&nbsp;that had been in use for months suddenly stopped printing correctly. No other template, style, or printer
 changes have been made. Suggestions?

<p><br />
I imagine that several inches to the left would put the return address way off the envelope.&nbsp; Are you sure that it is not a problem with the feeding of the envelopes into your printer.&nbsp; A problem that has just developed with that would be more likely to explain
 the sudden onset of the problem that any update of the software.</p>
<p>Restoring your computer to the state that it was in prior to 8/15/2012 would reveal if the issue was caused by the updates (You can always undo the restore or initiate the updates again if it has no effect).</p>
<p>Use the Envelope Add-in that you can get from the following page of fellow MVP Graham Mayor's website:</p>

<h2>            Outlook folder has disappeared after a windows &#39;Ten&#39; update&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I had a trojan attack on my Windows 10 PC this a.m. which Kaspersky AV disinfected. I then had to re-boot after a Windows Ten update. After that update, my Outlook email icon is no longer there and now I can't find where all my email messages and folders
 have gone to. I presume this update has but destroyed all my email folders and messages.<br />
<br />
<em>Kasperky's report shows:-<br />

Can anyone help me to try and rescue my Outlook platform, or do I need to re-install it again from my Office 365 disk which I recently purchased and start from the beginning?&nbsp;

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Onedrive doesn't have some time out setting to force logout. You will have to logout manually every time.
<br />
<br />I would request you to post this requirement @ Uservoice for Microsoft Onedrive Engineers to consider this.

            You will not be able to use the software without activating it using the product code. The product code is necessary to install and activate it. I don't think it is possible to find the product code on mac os which is possible on a windows version.

            Outlook has no "autodialer." If you are trying to dial from Outlook, you are using&nbsp;the Windows dialer which has never had support for voice modems.

            Incoming Caller ID Not Functioning<br />
<br />
The main reasons are:<br />
<br />
1. Duplicate entries in contacts, the most common cause and unfortunately. The most awkward one to fix. If the phone finds the same number against more than one name, it doesn't know which to use so, perfectly sensibly, it defaults to showing the number. The
 only way to fix this is to remove duplicates from your contacts. Best way to do this would probably be PC Suite Contacts. When you search, use part of the number to avoid problems with formatting, searching for +600323456789 will not find +60 03 23456789,
 whereas searching for 789 would.<br />
<br />
2. Using your international dial code instead of '+'. Not sure if this applies to all phones, but if you store your number using your county's international dial code (eg: 0060323456789 - WRONG) instead of the '+' sign (+60323456789 - RIGHT), it can cause problems.<br />
<br />
3. "(0)" area code prefixes. Only a problem if you synch with MS Outlook / PC Suite. When you specify a country in MS Outlook / PC Suite, it will insert "(0)" into your phone number after the country code +60323456789 becomes +60 (03) 23456789. You need to
 remove the (0).<br />
<br />
4. 9 and 10 digit numbers. There has been one report of problems with 9 and 10 digit numbers where one size doesn't work with SMS and the other with calls. Not sure that anyone else has ever come across this.<br />

<p>benw18, if you see just "Private number" or "Call 1" instead of the number or the name of the contact, then it could be that the caller and/or your network provider has disabled sending Caller ID. This needs to be dealt with by the network provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to use either the SIM memory or the phone memory in the Contacts, as this will prevent duplicates from appearing in the list.</p>

            Actually, if you see "private number" or "unknown" it usually means that the caller is blocking the number from being displayed. This is common with doctors, psychologists and others who need to keep their number private. If this happens on all calls,
 then the provider may have the service turned off.

            Are you sure the software you're trying to install is for the right operating system? .sis files for Symbian O/S v7, for example, won't work.<br />
<br />
The N73 runs Symbian O/S v9.1 and is a S60 3rd edition device.

            it should be no problem with .sis files to be install in n73ME,<br />
you can use the Nokia PCSuite to install, or you can copy the files in your memory an then install in your phone,<br />
<br />
I´ve install app T9Nav its so great and very useful!!

<h2>            Want to submit a sample for detection-Windows defender</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.In my university<strong>,I have noticed a virus(called USB shortcut virus here)
</strong>installed in nearly every computer ~30*17.It <strong>moves all the data to a hidden folder present in the USB</strong> and creates a shortcut in the Drive Itself.The shortcut opens the folder where the files are located(just a folder with no name+Icon
 is same as that of a USB drive).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5852069e-b418-4a8e-833f-966403baf385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5852069e-b418-4a8e-833f-966403baf385" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly,<strong>Windows defender doesn't detects it as a virus in my home compute</strong>r,it shows all files are OK.L<strong>aptop has an Avast free installed,which detects and removes that.</strong></p>
<p>I want to submit the file to the analysis lab and found this page-<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/submission/submit.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/submission/submit.aspx</a></p>
<p>It <strong>asks for submitting a sample-an executable but I can't find any.</strong>All
<strong>it has an-Autorun file+The original hidden folder.</strong></p>
<p>What else can I do?Suggestions?</p>

            <p>I see no indication that it has to be submitted as an .exe. In fact, that would be a very foolish policy on their part since there are other ways to package a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the submission requirements as written on the website you provided:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)"><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is then a place where you can add additional comments. In there, you would describe the behavior you are seeing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need a way to compress the offending files, 7zip is a free file compression application that you can download
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>

            That should be all they need. You will just need to compress it into a compressed file in one of the formats that they requested.

<p>Ive added the feature and number columns in, so what I need is a macro that inserts rows under each team, then copies the feature and number details in then repeats until the full table is updated.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There might have been some system files that got corrupted. Restart your device for about three times, then interrupt each restart by powering off your device before it reaches the boot screen. It should trigger the Windows Recovery environment. Select
<strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup
</strong><strong>Repair</strong>. Also, check if there's an option to rollback to previous build or a restore point. If none, try booting to Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In cases the steps above won't work, reinstall Windows by downloading the Windows Insider ISO
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Make sure to sign in your Windows Insider Account. It will set your back to Build 17025 however as soon as its installed, run the Windows Update to get you the latest build on the channel that you were on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please advise as necessary.</p>

    <title>ESPN Fantasy Adding Players Doesn&#39;t Work in Internet Explorer 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grbu2  say:</h3>
<h2>            ESPN Fantasy Adding Players Doesn&#39;t Work in Internet Explorer 11</h2>
                    <p>There is another thread that speaks to this a bit, but I figured I'd start one&nbsp;specifically on this topic. For some reason all websites I visit seem to work for me in&nbsp;IE 11 EXCEPT for ESPN Fantasy Games. I cannot add a player/free agent to my team unless
 I hit F12 (developer tools). When hitting F12, I am able to add free agents. Why would it work with F12 selected and it not work when F12 isn't selected? I know others have had issues with IE 11 and ESPN Fantasy but it seems Microsoft and/or ESPN don't want
 to acknowledge who's error it is (or they blame the other). I've already called ESPN and their response is to get another browser.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried opening and closing IE, signing in and out of ESPN, ran troubleshooter, turned off enhanced mode&nbsp;and I've recently had to reset IE 11 in order to get Google search to display results correctly again (so I hope I shouldn't have to reset again). A
 couple other things I've noticed - when trying to add a free agent nothing happens and I can't open another webpage, but I can select another link within ESPN. Definitely seems like a bug within IE 11 (since other browsers work just fine in adding players
 in ESPN). <br />
</p>
<p>I'd be grateful for any help or acknowledgement that I'm not the only one who has this issue.</p>

            Correct, can't get it to work in "Metro" mode but I usually just use the desktop mode anyway. If you can, select "Me Too" under "Had this question" on my original post. Might gain more attention that way.

<p>
</p><p>So, using F12, Ctrl-8&nbsp; what do you see for both&nbsp; Document mode and User-Agent?&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, what is the host name in the Address bar?&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW apparently a default is to have the Developer Tools as a frame in the window.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think unpinning it into its own window
 would make these diagnostics clearer.&nbsp; E.g. otherwise you may have to scroll the DT frame to see the indicators that I'm asking about, especially the UA.</p>

            Thanks for the f12 trick.&nbsp; It has helped me.&nbsp; I just got a new Win 8.1 pc with IE 11 and have the same trouble adding players on ESPN for both fantasy football and basketball.&nbsp; F12 mode allowed me to put claims on players in both sports.

<h2>            Calendar names shows an extra &#91;1&#93;</h2>
                    I'm starting using Outlook 2013, and I'm having troubles with calendars.<br />
<br />
I have Outlook configured to use EAS with my @outlook.com account. In order to do I don't remember exactly what, I "duplicated" my account (IE I added another account with the same address and of course the same calendar).<br />
Obviuously, a lot of stuff in the duplicated account was named named[1] since it was duplicated.<br />
<br />
After that, I erased my profile and started fresh, and everything works fine, except for the calendars: if I add a calendar in my account from the web interface it names it properly, but when outlook downloads it, it shows CalendarName[1].<br />
What else do I need to cancel to bring this thing to work properly?<br />

            <p>No, you can't control the task folder names.&nbsp; Here the associated tasks use "Tasks - Calendar Name" format , which is different than in your screenshot.&nbsp; I don't know why it's different for you - unless the folder was created previously and they changed
 the naming convention. Or it's how they do it with imported calendars. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works differently for subscribed calendars because they are read-only in Outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll see what I can find out about it. You can also ask in the outlook.com calendar forum.</p>

                    <p>Dear MS, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently noticed that following an Office 365 upgrade, it seems the text within the Notes field of each Outlook Contact has disappeared from many / most of my contacts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information contained within these fields were critical so could you let me know how I can retrieve this information?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Office 365 Business. </p>

<p><span>Hi Susan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we know, we can preview or open the attachment before sending the email.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is the “Open” or “preview” attachment button missing or you can click the button but couldn’t open the attachment? Please provide the screenshot of
 the issue you are facing for us to further investigate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Actually, after October 10, 2017, Office for Mac 2011 will no longer receive bug fixes and security updates, so we recommend to upgrade to Outlook
 for Mac 2016 for better customer experience.</span></p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 and IME 2012 issue</h2>
                    <p>I've been searching about this issue (in Japanese and English version) but still didn't find any solutions yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC environment :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 Pro (Japanese) 64-bit, IE 11, IME 2012, Office 2013 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue : </p>
<p>When I open IE 11 and access to Sharepoint or Google sites, the IME bar suddenly disable. I can keep writing in Japanese in Outlook but not in Google search, or Sharepoint forms. Also when I open Notepad, i cannot write in Japanese anymore. I can see &nbsp;[J]
 icon at bottom right of my PC but the IME icon shows [X] with "IME is disable" message with it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At first i thought the issue is in IME 2012 but when i use Mozilla or Chrome, the issue not occur. So I think this must be one of IE 11 bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I disable IE 11 in my PC and use Chrome as default web browser. Just that my company systems is based on Microsoft products so whenever I view some systems with Chrome the result is disappointing. I hope someone notice this post and can give some
 opinions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Word 2013 loads extremely slow after security updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenneth goodwin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 loads extremely slow after security updates</h2>
                    I presume the Intel processor security updates are the cause of such applications as Word 2013 taking 2 - 3 times longer to load under the Windows 10 64-bit operating system where everything on the computer is up to date including the Win 10 Fall Creators
 Update which slowed things down even more.&nbsp; Norton Utilities takes over 10 times longer to scan the registry with the Windows updates over the last three weeks. I don't notice any other slowdowns but the time for Word 2013 to load is painful.&nbsp; Only workaround
 I can see is to start Word every time the computer is turned on.&nbsp; Opening and closing files in Word has not been impacted, only the loading (startup).&nbsp; Any solution?

            Try following one by one and see after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />
<br />2. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />4. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />5. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky / Avast Anti Virus  etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.
<br />
<br />6. Start your computer in Safe mode with networking and see whether the problem is solved. If yes, then some program is causing the program.

<p>Some results; confusing at best.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Starting Word 2013 in the Safe mode (hold CTRL key) loads Word in seconds.&nbsp; However, unchecking all of the Add-Ins (No Active Application Add-ins) under a nominal startup of Word shows no change in the 30 second startup of Word.</p>
<p>2. I've tried Quick repair of MS Office many times over the last few weeks - no joy.&nbsp; The Online Repair attempt was a disaster since it essentially does an online reinstall of MS Office and then requires one to go thru license validation.&nbsp; Since I get all
 of my MS products from my University (I am a Professor of Computer Engineering) under the Use at Home program, which back in 2013 provided the Office 365 which wouldn't work with my setup however Microsoft provided me with the MSI version of Office Professional
 --&gt; well try and untangle that licensing path even though I have all of the install keys was beyond my abilities so I ended up having to reimage my hard disk.&nbsp; Since I kept 5 levels of backups it only took a few hours.&nbsp; If I need to reinstall Office, I will
 use the backup disk provided by the Microsoft but that is a low probability situation seeing what came out of attempting the online reinstall.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I have yet to attempt a new user profile.</p>
<p>4. The default printer for Word hasn't changed in 4 years.&nbsp; It is a networked HP LaserJet Pro 400 that is still identified correctly in the Printer &amp; Scanners settings.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; My third party applications have yet to be examined but they are pretty standard: Norton Security, Malwarebytes Premium and Sync2 which is only used in Outlook 2016 to send contacts and calendars over to Google which is how I get them on my Android smartphone.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Starting the computer in the Safe Mode with networking, NONE of the MS Products would start (Word, Office, Excel).&nbsp; Some error message like their has been a problem. However I did notice that Norton Utilities which is another program that has significantly
 slowed down in the last month (like 10X slower) was back to running at what I remember as its normal execution speed.&nbsp; The fact that no MS Office products could start puzzles me greatly.&nbsp; As a side note, I normally run SFC /scannow on a bi-weekly basis which
 has found some major problems in my experience over the years so it is my go-to problem resolver.&nbsp; It has returned clean results for the last six months.&nbsp; The fact that no MS Office products will start in the Safe Mode with networking must be telling us something.&nbsp;
 I will try some of the other Safe Mode options to see if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the initial assistance. I will continue to dig into the problem. But in general my observations have been that the only thing that has changed on my computer in the last six months has been the Windows updates.</p>

            Seems like I am lost as usual.&nbsp; First is that I now see that I am using&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Office Professional Plus 2016 (English) (Work At Home).&nbsp; Secondly, the slow
 load problem is definitely related to my desktop computer.&nbsp; MS Word loads in 20 seconds on my desktop but takes only 8 seconds to load on Surface Pro 3 and my wife's desktop.&nbsp; I will take back my assumption that the problem is related to the Window Updates
 (please forgive me Bill) since all my computers have taken the updates sent automatically by Microsoft.&nbsp; Even though I notice that other programs like Norton Utilities have significantly slowed down, I think my best next path will be to reinstall the Office
 Professional suite.</span>

            Thanks for the insight.&nbsp; On the reinstall, which would you suggest? I have both the 64-bit and x86 setup executables provided by the HUP supplier for the University<br />
(Setup.x86-en-us_ProPlusRetail_ &nbsp; ...........product key&nbsp; ...... _act_1.exe &nbsp;&nbsp; and
<span>Setup.X64_ProPlusRetail_ &nbsp; ...........product key&nbsp; ......&nbsp; _act_1.exe) in addition to the Office Professional Plus 2016 backup Disc provided by Microsoft.&nbsp; From what I've read since I don't use any large files per se, I should install the 32-bit
 version (x86).&nbsp; I've retained the product key provided by the HUP supplier.&nbsp; Executable setup files or Backup Disc?</span>

            32 bit is always preferred over 64 bit. 64 bit should be used when you using large data sets but has few minor issues. 32 bit is issue free.

            Final attempt --&gt; reinstall Windows 10 Pro and MS Office.&nbsp; No joy, things just at slow as before.&nbsp; A few oddities with the new installs but no show stoppers.&nbsp; Restarts seemed to solve a lot of the funnies.&nbsp; What mystifies me is that all the other Win 10
 Pro computers I have don't exhibit the problem.&nbsp; All the checks of the desktop solid state disk show no problem.&nbsp; Maybe it's like Apple and the CPU slow down to save battery power.&nbsp; Intel wants me to buy a new computer.&nbsp; (Actually the desktop is the barn burner
 of all the machines.)&nbsp; Guess I will just have to slow down and live.

            In the Common Issues the following: Office documents open slower after Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.&nbsp; Not sure what they are saying with regards to a delay of up to 1 second per document but I will take this issue as my problem and await the forthcoming
 Antivirus API for Office update.&nbsp; I also found that none of the Office programs will start in the Safe Mode since I received the same error message on two other computers in the safe mode stating "Something went wrong".&nbsp; Maybe this constraint is the reason
 for the existence of the CTRL + Office application keyboard short cut you mentioned.&nbsp; The exercise wasn't a total loss since I did learn the new methods of recovering Windows 10 and the Office products.&nbsp; It actually is an improvement over the two to three
 days I would spend reinstalling an operating system back in the days of Windows 95 and subsequent.

                    <p>Old Title: whatever happened to all my old Hotmail emails when everything switched to Outlook.com
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many others, I am wondering whatever happened to all my old Hotmail emails when everything switched to Outlook.com. &nbsp;Please don't tell me to try to restore missing emails, that was pointless. &nbsp;I have yet to see a complete, helpful answer. &nbsp;If it's that
 Microsoft just deleted everything irrevocably for those who were not active in Hotmail at the time, just tell me so I can get over it and not try to get everything restored. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>
