<p>Unfortunately upon S40 device there is nothing user can do apart from "<em><strong>restore factory defaults</strong></em>" via user interface. If there are no software updates avalable, existing firmware could always be re-installed at a Nokia Care Point.</p>

    <title>sum cells ignoring &#35;N&#47;A - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnc87  say:</h3>
<h2>            sum cells ignoring &#35;N&#47;A</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to sum a range of 4 cells that sometimes will contain #N/A purposely. However to compute a meaningful total I need to be able to ignor the #N/A in the sum. I am trying the following formula however it produces the #VALUE! error.</p>
<p>=SUMIF((C10,D10,F10,G10),"&lt;&gt;#NA")</p>
<p>Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>EDIT: See JohnC87's own solution below - the AGGREGATE() function handles this extremely well. His final formula:&nbsp; =AGGREGATE(9,6,(C10,D10,F10,G10))
</p>
<p>And he notes that you can find functional description and use of parameters here:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/aggregate-function-HA010338704.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/aggregate-function-HA010338704.aspx</a></p>
<p>=====================================</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think you're doing anything wrong other than asking Excel to do something that it apparently cannot.</p>
<p>If your range to SUMIF() was contiguous from C10 through G10, it would work:<br />
=SUMIF(C10:G10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A") </p>
<p>actually works (note #N slash A, not #NA)</p>
<p>But it doesn't work for the physically separated cells.&nbsp; So I think you're going to have to rewrite it to examine the cells individually.</p>
<p>The most primitive way would be:</p>
<p>=IF(ISNA(C10),0,C10)+IF(ISNA(D10),0,D10)+IF(ISNA(F10),0,F10)+IF(ISNA(G10),0,G10)</p>
<p>a little better, as far as length goes would be:</p>
<p>=SUMIF(C10:D10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A")+SUMIF(F10:G10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A")</p>
<p>or sum the sumifs:</p>
<p>=SUM(SUMIF(C10:D10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A"),SUMIF(F10:G10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A"))</p>
<p>but I really don't see a big gain using the last one when compared to the previous SUMIF()+SUMIF() version.</p>
<p><strong>BUT!!</strong></p>
<p>If E10 is not numeric, you could include it and use:</p>
<p>=SUMIF(C10:G10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A")</p>
<p>since SUM and SUMIF() ignore text and empty entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could even think of another variation or two to deal with E10 being numeric:</p>
<p>=SUMIF(C10:G10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A")-E10</p>
<p>or if there's possibility of E10 holding some odd ball value (even #N/A), then perhaps</p>
<p>=SUMIF(C10:G10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A") - IF(ISNUMBER(E10),E10,0)</p>
<p>The variations of how to deal with E10 in this case really depends on the possible values for E10 including any error indications.&nbsp; I actually think that
<br />
=SUMIF(C10:D10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A")+SUMIF(F10:G10,"&lt;&gt;#N/A")<br />
is probably the best option of the ones I've offered.</p>

<h2>            How can I import styles into multiple documents at the same time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question was asked before (in 2012) but it won't let me ask a follow-on question. So, the first answer was, in short, "Now without using a macro." OK, so how does one implement a macro for my question? I have no experience. If I need to contact someone,
 please let me know how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>You can contact Graham through his website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three ways to import styles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have them in a template and attach that template to a document with the option of updating styles from the template.</li><li>Use the Styles <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm#Organizer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Organizer</a> to import styles from a template or document.</li><li>Use a [Quick] Styles Set.</li></ol>
<p>Any of these can be implemented using a macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, Norton is stupid. </p>
<p>Graham's file does contain macros, which is what Norton spotted. It has been used by many people (I expect thousands of people) and is safe.</p>

<h2>            Stop IE8 opening new tab every time I click a link or a favourite</h2>
                    Every time I click on&nbsp;a favourite or a link within another web page IE 8 opens it in a new tab meaning I can end up with loads of tabs open!&nbsp; I just want it to load the page I'm looking for on the tab I'm currently on, but don' want to stop the ability
 for tabbed browsing altogether - i want the option of having a 2nd or 3rd tab open but have it reload another page on that tab if that's the tab im currently active on.<br />
<br />
Never had this problem with IE 7.<br />
<br />
I've checked that I've got tabbed browsing available and in the tab secton of the tools / internet options /general tab that says "open links from other programs in:"&nbsp; I have ticked "the current tab or window"<br />
<br />
Please help it's driving me nuts!!&nbsp; Seriously considering switching to Firefox permanently but it never logs me in to hotmail properly and keeps me logged in so would prefer to fix this IE problem and use this<br />
<br />
(Running IE8 on Windows Home Vista Premium.&nbsp; AVG is my anti-virus software.)

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Do the below and then you may need to recheck the Tabs settings - set it to something else APPLY/OK and then<br />
go back and set it back as desired.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER has on this<br />
machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which causes issues). We can help you<br />
remove the remnants and these issues can also be caused by those products you are now using as well.<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security - Reset all Zones to default level - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and Restart IE and/or IE with no Addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue. (Toolbars are BHO's)<br />

<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that would be unusual with<br />
Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie (no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as<br />
a scanner. I have many scanners and they never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />
<br />

            <p>only outlook is installed&nbsp;on my PC , windows live is NOT installed on my PC ... it is held on my ISP's server ... when I log onto outlook, I notice that mail gets to me by first travelling through windows live on the&nbsp;ISP's server then to my outlook ..</p>
<p>I can &amp; do now occasionally access windows live directly on the ISP's server, but there I only see current inbound mail ..
<p>
</p><p>if I download windows live directly to my PC, will there not be a conflict with outlook, which&nbsp;also&nbsp;resides on the same PC?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;will each of the mail systems be running independently?</p>
<ol>
<li>will future incoming mail go to both mail systems now on my PC?&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;<em>I suspect it will, as it seems to originate in windows &amp; then go to outlook</em></li><li>are you suggesting that when windows live will reside on my PC, it will automatically pick-up/show in windows live all the saved folders I have in outlook?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ol>
<li><em>if not, then how do I get the outlook folders over to windows live if outlook doesn't allow copy/paste and import/export to external place?</em></li><li><em>current export from outlook only allows export of browser settings</em></li></ol>
</li><li>on an ongoing basis, when both mail systems are on my PC, if I view the mail in outlook &amp; set-up an outlook &nbsp;folder in which to file it, will that folder also be set-up automatically in windows live?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>I suspect I'll have to manage two separate systems ...</em></li></ol>
<p><em>I appreciate your help ... I just need to make sure I understand&nbsp;all the ramifications of this procedure ..</em></p>

</p><ul>
<li>Enter your Outlook.com Email Id.</li><li>Enter your password.</li><li>Click on <strong>N</strong><strong>ext</strong>.</li><li>Now you can either add another account or just click on Finish.</li><li>Windows Live Mail will synchronize this account and all your emails, folders, contacts, calendar will get synced in Windows Live Mail ( This will take few minutes ).</li></ul>
<p>As you mentioned <strong>"if I view the mail in outlook &amp; set-up an outlook &nbsp;folder in which to file it, will that folder also be set-up automatically in windows live?"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, that folder will&nbsp;be set-up automatically in windows live Mail.</p>

            <p>excuse the delay .. please advise how do I access the community directly and get back to my set of questions &amp; answers without going through your e-mail letter clink?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your procedure -- windows essentials 2012&nbsp;was downloaded; it asked for details regarding server settings, which I provided [they are the same as was provided to me by my ISP for outlook];&nbsp;&nbsp;I entered the ID/password of 'outlook in order to add
 it; &nbsp;end result --&gt;&gt; a 2nd copy of windows live appeared on my PC, with (1) beside it's name; it looked exactly like the first copy &amp; folders from outlook were not copied over ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original 'live' connection was not on my PC, but provided access to the mail on the ISP server. The 'downloaded' version seemed to have accessed the server's version and added itself there, as I now see a 2nd&nbsp;version of live that looks exactly like the
 original server version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 'outlook' has the same ID/password as does the server version of windows live ... could that be why nothing was copied over?</p>
<p>
</p><p>would the result be different if outlook has the same ID but a different password? in which case it would look different &amp; be copied down to 'live'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>bear with me while I struggle through this process.</p>

<h2>            How do I turn off Tracking under Review in Word 2010. I have removed it before but everytime I edit a document it brings up the wide gap for markup etc.</h2>
                    I want to turn off Tracking because it interferes with my ducuments whenever I revise. I have moved it out but it keeps creating that gap for Markups etc. So I want to turn it off. Thanks.

            This usually indicates that the document still contains some markup. To remove that, use Review | Changes | Accept | Accept All Changes in Document and Review | Comments | Delete | Delete All Comments in Document. If you want to preserve the markup but
 print without it, switch to Final view before printing, or remove the check beside "Print markup" under Settings: Print All Pages on the Print tab in the backstage. (Note for other versions: This checkoff is new in Word 2010; in Word 2007 and earlier, you
 would select "Document" rather than "Document showing markup" in the "Print what" dropdown in the Print dialog.)

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>itunes did an update today and after the restart it required my action center lit up with the red x. &nbsp;It said defender was not running and to start it (the real time part of defender). &nbsp;When I tried to start defender it will not start, I can do scans from
 it, I can update it, but the real time protection will not start, it says last scan was at 410a.m. today. &nbsp;Nothing new has been done to computer except the itunes update since 410. &nbsp;I have never had any anti-virus, I use MWbytes and winpatrol, have been using
 the same tools for over a decade with no issues, no viruses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the scan from command prompt and it said files were corrupt and could not be repaired, the same as the OP. &nbsp;I tried to restore, says no restore points, and I know I had them before. &nbsp;I was going to do a refresh but since moving to 8.1 was a download
 and not a physical copy I have to download the tool from microsoft to do a refresh, waiting for that now been like 3 hours it is taking forever.</p>
<p>I ran MW it said nothing found. &nbsp;I ran hitman and it found some PDFreader that it has quarantined and a bunch of trace cookies. &nbsp;I am waiting for the download to finish before I finish that and see what happens. &nbsp;I looked manually for those 2 files you mentioned
 in regedit and they are not there. I also looked in windows defender file while I was there and the disablespyware value was at 0 like another tip suggested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a real puzzle for me. Nobody was on the computer from 4:10am till I did the restart for itunes update, last scan with a working defender was at 4:10am, no idea whats going on here. I hope either hitman or running a refresh will help it, I'll keep
 you posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>So after spending 8 hours with this and running MW and hitman and getting an all clear from both I ran the windows refresh from USB flash drive. &nbsp;It went through the process, did the reboot then came up and said there was a problem with the refresh and nothing
 had been changed, it said it would find solutions but never came back with anything. &nbsp;The error code I am getting on defender is 0x8050800d says history items could not be displayed and to wait. &nbsp;I wait then try to start it again and it comes back and says
 it has timed out error code 0x800705b4. &nbsp;I can run defender, I can update defender, the real time protection will not run it times out, and I get notification of having no protection on the pc. &nbsp;No idea what is going on, please help.</p>
<p>In control panel the disk is getting pushed up to 100%, everything seems to put it under considerable load, chrome its pulling 100% disk at random times and freezing up, shows the system doing the same thing this just started also. &nbsp;It doesn't look like
 they would add up to 100% but its saying 100% disk use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I installed avast due to your recommendation, ran it and it came up all green with a few software updates, it took forever to run and it failed when trying to update software due to the disk pegged at 100%. &nbsp;The disk is pretty much stuck at 100%, its
 making everything impossible, no virus found, no threats, no malicious software, nothing. &nbsp;Just totally out of the blue after a itune update my computer will not work. &nbsp;I uninstalled itunes also, didnt matter. &nbsp;This is so disheartening, any ideas?</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay on the update. &nbsp;What a nightmare this turned out to be. &nbsp;After contacting Microsoft and spending hours on the phone with them they suggested it was a failed hard drive. &nbsp;I called the company that built my rig (Ironside Computers) and
 they agreed. &nbsp;I was out of warranty by a little less then 90 days and they took care of it for me, replaced the hard drive at no cost other than the time and stress it took me to do the labor. &nbsp;Great company, really surprised me with the free replacement,
 was over 3 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after the new hard drive shows up. &nbsp;Problems continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I digitally downloaded 8.0 and only had my PID not the product ID key and this started an entirely new nightmare. &nbsp;Microsoft was great, after getting hung up on twice, given conflicting information, the general communication problems with the language barrier
 and spending hours arguing about why they couldn't give me my 8.0 key, finally the 10th or so rep that I talked to I got one that was great and I could understand. &nbsp;She (Juliet) listened to my issue, defused the situation, made me feel like she was going to
 handle it, and then she did. &nbsp;Was amazing after being told everything from "if you don't have the email we sent you 3 years ago we cant help you", to "escalating your case for $99" (that's insane by the way, and no I didn't pay anything), to finally "no problem,
 I will take care of it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyway, hard drive replaced, windows 8.1 pro re-installed and moving on. &nbsp;Thanks for taking the time to read my problems and the advice. &nbsp;Hopefully nobody else has to go through this, it was a pretty stressful experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a side note and something that I found really shocking. &nbsp;Microsoft outsources their customer service to India, that's sad and frustrating, increased my stress level 10 fold because the struggle trying to communicate, and or understand them or them
 me. &nbsp;Made the entire situation extremely stressful, prolonged the inevitable (me getting my key back), and caused a lot of unneeded anger, if the call is placed from inside the U.S. it would be nice if it was answered in the same country, especially if you
 are one of the most profitable companies on the planet.</p>

You may be able to get the Hindi language pack added by a Nokia service point, but they are not required to do this and not all of them will.

            You cannot. Nokia software updater will always give you the updated version of your standard software, as will a Nokia service point.<br />
<br />
If you want a particular regional variation of the phone, you have to check with the retailer before buying.

<h2>            WMDC reports There is a problem with your connection - Touch Diamond</h2>
                    
<p>Ok,<br />
<br />
I have posted before on this issue but it turned out to be Bullguard causing the problem and I installed Kaspersky and it was sorted. Now I have a similar issue in that when i plug in my Touch Diamond it connects. However, there is no sync. When I click on
 Set-up Your Device I get a report back that there are connection problems, unplug and reconnect the device to resolve. However, this does not work. I have been working on this solidly for 2 days and I have done the below. Tis all started due to a hard re-boot
 of the entire phone to clear all the ____ off of it.<br />
<br />
- Flash the Rom from 1.3 to 1.9<br />
- Un-install and reinstall WMDC (also removed the registry key and removed the Windowsmobile folder from the PC<br />
- Rebooted the Phone<br />
- Rebuilt the phone<br />
- Removed and reinstalled Kaspersky (trying WMDC in each state - with/without online protection)<br />
- Changed the settings of the Windows Fire wall<br />
- Changed the settings for the advanced settings in the connection page on the phone<br />
- Looked at buying an iPhone even though I hate iTunes<br />
- Removed the instances in Device Manager<br />
- Attempted to fix the device drivers<br />
- Tried syncing using Bluetooth<br />
- ...and many combinations of the above<br />
<br />
I can connect to the ppc and I was able to flash the rom without it syncing to the device.<br />
<br />
I use Windows Vista x64, I have the device connected directly to a USB port and not through a Hub, my machine is a quad core. What is really galling is the fact that this is the second time this has happened to me and up until I did a hard reset it worked perfectly.
 This just shows me that I should get an iPhone becuase there are so many issues with WMDC and WMv6. You would think that these 2 microsoft OSs would work 100% of the time. Wouldn't you?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas of what I can try next or should I be visiting my local Apple shop?</p>

    <title>memory limitations in Access 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flor.in  say:</h3>
<h2>            memory limitations in Access 2007</h2>
                    <div>Hi everyone,</div>
<div>I have a very large front-end access application for a SQL Server back-end.</div>
<div>The front-end is an mdb/mde running on Access 2007 Runtime.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On regular basis, after running the application for a while I get the message</div>
"There isn't enough memory to perform this operation. &nbsp;Close unneeded programs and try operation again."
<div>There is plenty of physical memory but the error still comes up.</div>
<div>I've checked in Task Manager and the error seems to come up at a certain memory usage, around 128 MB on my test machine, this varies slightly depending on the machine but it's always over 100 MB and under 150 MB.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>See screenshot below:</div>
<div>http://idisk.me.com/florin.v/Public/Pictures/Skitch/fwinmac-20110725-134049.png</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The issue happens on the development machine and on multiple production machines running various configurations.</div>
<div>The issue is not limited to a certain form or context, and it usually comes up at the same memory usage on each machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already tried rebuilding and optimizing different forms, compacting and decompiling/recompiling many times.</div>
<div>I've also tried increasing the MaxLocksPerFile registry entry.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd appreciate any ideas.</div>
<div>Thank you very much!</div>

            <p>A few questions / comments I have are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>+&gt;When you say a large front-end Access application, how large is the front-end file?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>+&gt;If you have code that deals with opening record sets, are you closing each of them and setting the variable equal to nothing?</p>
<p>+&gt;Do you have forms that are making use of large combo boxes?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If so, you may want to consider finding a way to limit the number of options available in each combo box.</p>
<p>+&gt;You said you changed the MaxLocksPerFile registry entry.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What is the exact registry key you changed and what did you change it to?</p>
<p>+&gt;In addition to the MaxLocksPerFile key, you could also try changing the MaxBuffersSize key on each machine to 500,000.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If this doesn’t work you could try a few other values and if it still doesn’t work then change it back to 0 when finished.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a 64 bit machine running Access 2007, the MaxBufferSize DWORD should be under this key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a 32 bit machine running Access 2007, the MaxBufferSize DWORD should be under this key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Nathan, thanks for your thoughts.
<div><br />
<div>To answer your points:</div>
<div>1. the file is over 135MB when freshly compacted</div>
<div>2. yes, the recordsets are getting closed every time (or most of the time anyways)</div>
<div>3. large combo boxes are not an issue</div>
<div>4. the MaxLocksPerFile registry key I've changed is in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE</div>
<div>5. I'll try the MaxBufferSize registry.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Right now I'm trying to figure out why the memory is jumping through the roof.</div>
<div><b>Here's an interesting fact:</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>The first time I'm using a call of a public custom function declared in a module the memory usage jumps with 25 MB. So if in the MouseMove event property is &nbsp;"=myfunction()" where myfunction() is a public function in a module, I get this increase in memory
 usage. The second time a custom function is triggered in the same way the memory usage remains the same.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I change the control and use an event procedure instead of the direct call to the function, and inside that procedure I call the function, the memory usage remains low.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Which makes me conclude that <b>calling a public function directly from the event property loads all the modules in memory</b>. And I have over 100 modules, that can be quite a lot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you think that's a valid conclusion?</div>
<div>And if so, is there a way I can call the function directly from the property without loading all the modules? I already tried using modulename.functionname() but it doesn't work.</div>
<div>Or can I split my front-end in two files (move some of my modules in that second file) and call the functions from that second file? Something like a dll?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again!</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Unfortunately, I am not sure why you would see the increase in memory when you call the public function the first time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My recommendation would be to ensure you are always closing your record sets when finished and setting them to nothing. Then test changing the MaxBufferSize registry key on your test machine.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If this works, you will then need to change this on each machine. </p>

            I've tried to increase the MaxBufferSize to 500000 and even 5000000 and I get to use up to 165MB now but then it crashes again. This time with a slightly different message: "System Resource Exceeded". Perhaps this limit is now imposed by the physical memory
 of the testing machine?

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was installing office 365 it prompted me to install the 32-bit version, I read up on this and it seemed like the 32 bit should work better and with most add-ons, so I did install it even though I have a 64-bit system and OS. &nbsp;Now the sky drive is
 not working properly and I also recently purchased a Japanese language package for Word (64-bit, based on what my PC is) but it won't run with the 32-bit version. &nbsp;I have the university version subscription, so no install disk. &nbsp;What do I need to do to un-install
 the 32-bit and then install 64-bit version? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello, Aravinda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A different Michael here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said, "<span>Now download and install Office 365 by logging into</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.office.com/myaccount</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>with

<p>
</p><p><span>My problem is, that when I was trying to download Office 365, I was NOT prompted....or even ADVISED that I had an option of downloading EITHER the 32 or the 64 bit version. I just assumed that the software I had just purchased would be smart
 enough to detect that it was being downloaded to a 64 bit brand new machine.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, I have an error message which......all on one page, mind you, says I can't download the 64 bit version because it's incompatible with the 32 bit version already on the machine.......AND (on the same page, remember), saying I can't download
 the 32 bit version because it's incompatible with the 64 bit version ALREADY on the machine.</span></p>
<p><span>Just HOW does THAT work???</span></p>
<p><span>And, what would YOU do now?</span></p>

<h2>            Pass a value in a text box across as a criteria for a query</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a table which is accessed via the form
<strong>frmUpdateExistingItems</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span>To reduce the combo box pick list of the
<strong>EquipmentNumber</strong> field of the records in the table, I want the operator to enter a string such as "FA" (for a FAN) or "GB" (for a gearbox) in the text box
<strong>SearchString</strong>. This string is intended to be the criteria for the query qry21PrepShortListOfEqNumbers which is activated by the
<strong>On Key Up</strong> property of the <strong>SearchString</strong> text box. The property sheet of the
<strong>SearchString</strong> text box contains:</span></p>

<p><span>="[qry21PrepShortListOfEqNumbers]"</span></p>

<p><span>The query SQL code is:</span></p>

<p><span>SELECT tblMainEquipList.EquipID<br />
FROM tblMainEquipList<br />
WHERE (((tblMainEquipList.EquipID) Like "* &amp; [forms]![frmUpdateExistingItems]![SearchString] &amp; *"))<br />
ORDER BY tblMainEquipList.EquipID;</span></p>

<p><span>I have entered GB in the
<strong>SearchString</strong> text box as I know that there are records containing GB. This does not give a error message on leaving the
<strong>SearchString</strong> text box.</span></p>

<p><span>The
<strong>EquipmentNumber</strong> box has ="[qry21PrepShortListOfEqNumbers]" plastered on almost every permutation of On/Got/Lost/Key/Mouse/Up/Down etc properties. When trying to select an equipment number in the
<strong>EquipmentNumber</strong> box no items are available. </span></p>

            <p>Rather than the * wildcard, try %.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than KeyUp event, use the Change event (if you want to query after each keystroke) or the AfterUpdate event (if you want to query once when user leaves the SearchString text box.</p>

<p>Take out your plastering, and set the EquipmentNumber combobox RowSource to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add one line of code to the Change or AfterUpdate event of SearchString textbox:<br />
Me.EquipmentNumber.Requery</p>

            <p>Tom</p>
<p>Thanks indeed for your rapid advice. This has clarified a few things for me but I am not there just yet.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Further thought and code shuffling attempts has brought me to these changes to my initial code post:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Replaced the * wildcard with %.</p>
<p>2. Generated the SearchString_AfterUpdate() sub which includes:</p>
<p>DoCmd.OpenQuery "qry21PrepShortListOfEqNumbers", acViewNormal, acEd</p>
<p>Me.EquipmentNumber.Requery</p>
<p>3. Called up this routine in the SearchString text box AfterUpdate event property.</p>
<p>4. Revised the EquipmentNumber combobox RowSource to qry21repShortListOfEqNumbers without any of the =”[…….]” trimming.</p>
<p>5. Removed all Events properties from the EquipmentNumber box.</p>
<p>6. Also tried items 2 to 5 above with the * wildcard instead of with %.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This still fails to show any list of items in the EquipmentNumbers box.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As a test check, I have inserted another temporary text box that has a Data Control source of SearchString. This is updated
OK each time as I leave the SearchString text box.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can you throw any further light onto this please?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will continue the good fight.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>I am having trouble grasping what you are trying to do here.&nbsp; In some places you talk about EquipmentNumber and in others you say EquipmentID.&nbsp; Are they the same thing?&nbsp; Or is the EquipmentID FA, GB, etc. while EquipmentNumber is Fan, Gearbox, etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you aware that combo boxes have a property called AutoExpand that jumps to the item that matches the characters you type in the combo box to the beginning of the&nbsp;value in the combo box's first visible column?&nbsp; The effect would be analogous if you could
 set the combo box's row source to a query with&nbsp;a Where clause:&nbsp; EquipmentName Like Me.combobox.Text &amp; "*"</p>

            Marshall,
<div><br />
<div>I have two text boxes, One is titled <b>SearchString</b> where the user enters letters that are part of an agreed code that represents a type of equipment (Fan = FA, Gearbox = GB etc). I want to then use this input to narrow down the number of equipment
 number items in the second text box (which is actually called <b>EquipID</b>. So sorry for the confusion that I have caused here. Mia Culpa.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As the SearchString could appear in the middle of a multilevel equipment number I would need to try &nbsp;<br />
<div>a&nbsp;query with&nbsp;a Where clause:&nbsp; EquipmentName Like <b>"*"</b> &amp; Me.combobox.Text &amp;
<b>"*"</b></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>I note that my earlier attempt had only&nbsp;</span>EquipmentName Like
<b>"*</b> &amp; Me.combobox.Text &amp; <b>*"</b>, I shall try this with the extra quotes and shall report back ASAP.</div>

<h2>            error code 80048103 along with other problems</h2>
                    I have a Nokia Lumia 520 and I keep getting this error code: 80048103. The error code comes up when I try to update or download an app. I searched it up to try and get answers and I tried the things it said to do. I did a soft reset, double checked my
 personal information on my account and found that my area code was wrong so I fixed it. I thought that that was the problem so I tried to update my apps and it popped up again. Next I went to my settings and clicked on the accounts and emails and found that
 my Microsoft account wasn't up to date so I clicked on it and it said it couldn't sync and the error code popped up again. So I went on Windowsphone.com and logged onto my account and found that my phone number was wrong, it was my old number but I now have
 a new one so I deleted it off the account and I don't know how to add my new number in. So I tried logging into Microsoft and it said they didn't recognize me so I typed in my email and they said if it existed in their system they wo

            <p>Hi tahitiannn!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for writing on the Windows Phone Forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood well, it is not possible to update or download apps and games to your phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you wrote in your post, most of the times the origins of these kind of issues have to do with the Microsoft Account. The Microsoft Account has to be completed in every part.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Clicking on this link will appear a thread with all the instruction on how to do it.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS.: If you are asked to set up the app Authenticator jump that stage. You can do it in a second time if you want.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue keep persisting go to Settings&gt;Date &amp; Time and disable Automatic; check that date, time, time zone and country are correct; switch off and on the phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bye, </p>

<p>To provide a place for the user to insert the picture, insert a single cell table into your document and set the row height and width to suit the picture, setting the Table options so that it does not automatically re-size to fit the contents, remove the
 borders (Ctrl+Alt+u) if desired, and then select the table and use the Insert&gt;Bookmark facility to assign a bookmark to it.&nbsp; Then at the other locations at which you want the picture to appear, insert a cross reference to the text of the bookmark.</p>
<p>Then when a picture is inserted into the original table and the cross references are updated, the picture will appear in all of them.</p>
<p>The reason for using the table is that if the whole table is bookmarked, the insertion of the picture into the table will not result in the bookmark being destroyed.</p>
<p>You could just insert the picture into a bookmark, but if that is not done correctly, the bookmark will be destroyed in the process and then the cross-references will not work.</p>
<p>-- Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Defender Actions Recommended - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelly craven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Defender Actions Recommended</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Defender repeatedly tells me there are Actions Recommended. (yellow ! icon)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are they?<br />
<br />
Where can I find out where they are listed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are none listed in Windows Defender.&nbsp; (all green)<br />
<br />
Running scans, online and offline, finds nothing. There are no notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a repeated occurrence, and worrisome. It has become the boy who cried wolf, to the point that I have become so annoyed that if there were a real threat of some kind I won't believe Windows Defender.<br />
<br />
In other words, if there are no actual Actions Recommended then why continue to tell us there are?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bug needs fixing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Kelly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error usually happens when a new update is installed and you are using a 3rd party virus/malware program. Having said that, we recommend removing the 3rd party program using the tools from its manufacturer. After doing so, just restart your computer
 and wait for a few minutes to reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know if that worked out for you.</span></span><span>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>This is an unacceptable workaround at best. I'm not going to blindly do this every time Windows Update decides to push out an update, which can happen at any time, and has happened at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I find the Actions Recommended list?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there is a notification, there must be a list of what those notifications are, even if it tells me there was a problem because of a virus checker. We have had this issue for months (including my old laptop), and this is a new machine doing the same
 thing.<br />
<br />
What you are telling me seems to imply that we will get notified even if there are, in fact, no action items.&nbsp; This would indeed be a bug in Windows Defender Action Notifications, would it not?</p>

<p>I don't understand the comment, how it relevant.&nbsp; &nbsp;"...when you can't update definitions..."&nbsp; This is not the case. Definitions are up to date, and there's no evidence anyone has tried to hack into the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past when the definitions can't be update for whatever reason, then that is noted and I am told.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you suggesting that Defender blindly tells me that the definitions are up to date even when they can't be updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we are told there are actions needed where can we find out what those actions are?</p>

            Please go to Menu&gt;Apps&gt;Location&gt;GPS Data&gt;Postion. There will be several prompts there, the top one will be labeled Waiting for GPS. Go to Options&gt;Satellite Status. if you are getting any signals there, it would show that there is nothing wrong with the
 hardware.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, is this your first time to try to get a fix? I notice you have turned everything off except Integrated GPS? In that case you may have to wait a while. It could take as long as 40min to get the first ever fix on your phone, If you use all methods simultaneously,
 it would incur data charges but would make the initial fix much faster.<br />

            Obviously you need to be outside.

            <p>When you reset the phone, was it a soft reset or hard reset (where you have to setup the device again)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was just a soft reset, I might consider performing a hard reset, setup the device again and verify that the audio is working BEFORE you add back any programs. If it is not working then you might have to consider sending it in for repair/replacement
 (although I expect that it will work).</p>
