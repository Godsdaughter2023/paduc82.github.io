<h2>            font color problem in windows 10</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/666bb4df-bce3-4b1c-ad9c-aff3c1eedaf1" />Hey I have a lenovo g 50-70 laptop. I just upgraded from win 8.1 to 10.. The problem that i have been having with both win
 8.1 and 10 is that sometimes the fonts on certain programs, mostly on windows apps and Visual studio get blurred when i minimize them.. And now in windows 10 the font in the start menu is of a grayish color rather then the default color... I don't know why
 this happens.. i have already tried to uninstall the graphics driver, reinstalled it, updated it.. nothing changed...</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>I am using the default windows that came with the laptop</p>
<p>i upgraded the same one...</p>

<h2>            Premium content is blocked for this profile even though it is an adult profile...</h2>
                    <p>I just put in my BO2 for Xbox1 hoping to play it with my friends, but I'm having a bit of an issue.&nbsp;Before you are allowed to play online on BO2, it prompts you to download the Nuketown 2025 map, but when I try to it gives me the same thing, "premium content is blocked for this account." Most threads say it is because of the child/adult account issues, but I recently&nbsp;made a new MS account as an adult, and there are no child accounts associated with it, and I cant play it on Xbox Live because of this. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Asharaf,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option "User owned Apps and Services" will not have an influence on the whiteboard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled the option "User owned Apps and Services" Whiteboard from admin center, I can download it with my account but get the error message below when I sign in Whiteboard with my Work and School account:
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8247d7d3-d7d7-4a25-bb0a-d686395c0cee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8247d7d3-d7d7-4a25-bb0a-d686395c0cee?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>When I turn on Whiteboard, I can use Microsoft Whiteboard normally:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af95cfe9-b8b7-43c4-8020-b5b232393488?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af95cfe9-b8b7-43c4-8020-b5b232393488?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That means download Whiteboard is not related to tenant settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if this issue is account related, please let your issue related user sign out their account from Microsoft store then download Whiteboard to see the outcome. Please also let them check if they can download Whiteboard with their personal Microsoft
 account. You can also let your user check if they can download Whiteboard via this

<p>Hi Asharaf, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this issue remains when you sign in with your personal account, that means this issue is not Office 365 settings related. And it is local Microsoft Store Settings related. I have moved this thread to the right place. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>

 startup while dealing with another issue. On entering my password, which I had already used earlier, my password was no longer recognized. It is as if I had forgotten my password. Any help would be most appreciated.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Roaming&#34; 0 bytes...&#63;</h2>
                    I came across a bizarre problem with my computer yesterday(I run Vista Ultimate and have rarely ever had any problems) and I was hoping you guys could help. It's been a long, frustrating 4+ hours that I've been messing with this and I just want it fixed.<br />
<br />
Windows Update may or may not be at fault for the fact that after I told it to install updates and shut down two days ago, yesterday when I booted it up, the task bar was "classic" style-that is, grey and squared off like old Windows 98-and the gadget bar on
 the right side of the screen had a grey/white background; just for the gadget strip, mind you. Everything else seemed to be normal and my anti-virus and all other task tray items were conducting business as usual. The only thing that could point out that any
 actual error had taken place was a message in a speech bubble from a gold lock that popped up in the systray: "Failed to connect to a Windows service. Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service. This problem prevents limited
 users from logging on to the system. As an administrative user, you can review the System Event Log for details about why the service didn't respond." After&nbsp;rebooting with no change and trying to use System Recovery(I opened the program, but it never brought
 up a window. When I tried to open it again, it said it was already running. It did not appear at all in task manager the entire time.), then&nbsp;viewing the entirely unhelpful(not to mention a little hard to find) "Event Log", I searched online. Retro task bar
 aside, it seemed to be a fairly common problem. The only fix that everyone resported to be successful was to run cmd.exe and input "netsh winsock reset". Granted, I had no idea what "winsock" was, and I probably should never do things when I don't know exactly
 what they do(I know what it is now), but...it seemed to solve the problem.<br />
Or maybe it just created another one. I did nothing else after seemingly fixing this problem yesterday. Today I boot it up and everything is normal, as expected. Until I go to run a game(The Sims 2, if it matters, which has always run perfectly with no errors).
 I select "play" and instead of the game starting up, windows pops up a box that lets me know that it is attempting to delete "1 item", which it identifies as "C:/users/owner/AppData/Roaming". It also states that this "file" is 0 bytes. It won't delete a file
 that is supposedly 0 bytes(which, "Roaming" is a whole folder, so it couldn't possibly be 0 bytes, yes? It was a hidden folder until I changed my folder options to check it out.) so it just sits there, attempting but unable to delete the "file". So I end up
 having to use task manager&nbsp;to close it. I tried the game again, same result. All my anti-virus/spyware/malware detects nothing, I just finished the scans. What's going on here?<br />
<br />
If any of you have a solution or even just a wild guess, I'd be happy to hear it. I'm very open at this point. Thanks for your time.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><strong>netsh winsock reset</strong> is useful command that you can use in Microsoft Windows to reset winsock catalog back to default setting or
 clean state.</span></p>
<p><span>Running&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">disk clean up</a> or checking hard disk for errors
 could help you delete the 0 byte file.</span></p>
<p><span>Check&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Check-your-hard-disk-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hard disk for any error</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: When you run the check disk, there are chances of losing data so you can take&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">a

            Yeah, but what I'm getting at here is that there IS no 0 byte file. It says it's trying to delete "C:/users/owner/AppData/Roaming"-that's a folder, not a file. And it certainly isn't 0 bytes. What I need to know is: why is windows trying to delete something,
 without my permission no less, instead of running my game?

            <p>It's not where the fan is that's important, it's where the air intake is. Yeah, intakes on the bottom are stupid but they are a fact of life with many laptops. Block up the intake and the laptop overheats. Just plain bad design. Also, in my experience, they
 are more prone to sucking in dust (presumably from people's clothing) and consequently blocking up the cooling vents making overheating even more likley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this applies to your CPU but see section 6 of this...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.intel.co.uk/content/dam/doc/guide/2nd-gen-core-lga1155-socket-guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.co.uk/content/dam/doc/guide/2nd-gen-core-lga1155-socket-guide.pdf</a></p>
<p>...which might explain what you describe as lagging. Basically its a mechanism whereby technology reduces&nbsp;the CPU&nbsp;temperature when it reaches a critical level by downgrading its performance.</p>

<h2>            Driver Overran Stack Buffer error, unable to boot at all</h2>
                    <p>I have read several threads on this issue, but have been unable to find a solution to my specific problem.&nbsp; I now have the BSOD on my computer and am unable to get past it, even trying to get into safe mode through F8 or holding the power button down for
 5 seconds, three times as recommended.&nbsp; When I first turn the power on it gives me the BSOD stating that my PC ran into a problem and needs to restart, etc.&nbsp; It tries this for a couple of times, and then lands solidly on the blue screen.&nbsp; I understand that
 the recommendation has been to upload the DMP files, however I have no way to get to them.&nbsp; I cannot get past the blue screen.&nbsp; I am running a Dell Inspiron 3847computer and loaded Windows 10 a few months ago.&nbsp; I don't have a problem going back to a factory
 reset, if I can get to it.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated!!</p>

            <p>I had actually tried all of this prior to my posting about this issue.&nbsp; When I start the computer the Dell logo shows up and then it says "Preparing Automatic Repair", then goes briefly to a blue screen and then re-starts doing the same thing.&nbsp; On the third
 re-start it lands on a blue screen and states "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info.........(0% complete)"</p>
<p>:If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error "Driver_Overran_Stack_Buffer.&nbsp; The computer freezes on this screen.&nbsp; There is no other screen that comes up.&nbsp; If I push F8 on start up I can get to some other screens through F2 and
 F12 (I think).&nbsp; There is nothing in there that helps.&nbsp; I cannot get to the desktop so there is no way to re-boot.&nbsp; Anything else I can try???</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BSOD Error DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER indicates that a driver has overrun a stack-based buffer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Parameter. A driver overran a stack-based buffer (or local variable) in a way that would have overwritten the function's return address and jumped back to an arbitrary address when the function returned. Basically the driver overran its
 local variable.</span></p>

    <title>Updating messenger - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pandabluebaby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updating messenger</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Why does the Microsoft Store app for Messenger NOT give you the option to update? Messages are often dropped or delayed and even repeated. I see many posts about going to the App store to "update" but there is no option there to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise</p>

            Hi PBB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The Updates if available from the Store app will be in it's Settings which are accessed from the three dots at top right of the page in Microsoft Store app, then Downloads &amp; Updates.  Check there now if you've not yet.
<br />
<br />Make sure Automatic Store Updates are also turned on as shown here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/6664-turn-off-automatic-updates-apps-windows-10-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/6664-turn-o...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise review the app's page in the Store reached by searching for it from the search icon, see how Updates are handled for your messenger app, if necessary use the Support link which is usually present to ask their Support.  Most good app authors will interact with you there as they highly value the feedback.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg, </p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I checked the 3 dots. It does not even show the messenger app. The only place is shows up is under "all owned" in settings.&nbsp; Why does it not show the app in all the settings, it is obviously installed? The date on it is Feb 2019
 . It gives me the option to launch.&nbsp; I use it on my desktop PC which is windows ten and my phone which is android also facebook. My messages are also being delayed, not delivered at all or repeated once I "send them" then later go back to write another message
 the one previous is still in the box as if I had not sent it. I have to resend it ( making it repeat) before I can write an additional message. So it appears I am having 2 issues. I have even uninstalled it a and reinstalled it. One being still no option to
 update and the other with repeats. also ( I know this is another issue... I checked to see what browser I was using. It said my browser was out of date "edge" I followed all instructions and checked for and downloaded all updates. Rechecked it and it said
 I was still out of date. Although in "updates" it says I am up to date. grrrrr. I get so confused with this technology. I just want it to work. What else should I try? Since I am tech "challenged" I need really simple detailed instructions. I am embarrassed
 to admit that I do not understand a lot of the PC and tech language you all smart people use.</p>
<p>Thanks again for helping me.&nbsp;PS I checked and automatic updates is turned on in the store.</p>
<p>

            What is the messenger?  Facebook messenger?  Have you tried using it in a browser to compare?

<p>What have you tried from the suggestions already given in this thread?&nbsp; BTW, it's not "uploading"; you want to<em> transfer</em> or

<h2>            Distor&#38;&#35;231&#59;&#38;&#35;227&#59;o de letras pequenas no XBOX ONE</h2>
                    
<p>Prezados,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Estava alterando as configurações do meu video game (menu configurações - tela) e percebi que algumas letras ficam distorcidas no xbox, principalmente aquelas pequenas no menu inicial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inseri o jogo FIFA e percebi que dependendo do tamanho da fonte também da a imperfeição, uma espécia de sombreado.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gostaria de saber se isso acontece com o video game de voces também.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So consegui perceber ao aproximar bem perto da TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agradeço a todos.</p>

<p>ficou meio ruim, mas da pra ver mais ou menos a sombra envolta das letras.</p>
<p>Acredito que teria que ficar 100% nítido, uma vez q a TV é nova e portanto existe full hd nos 2 dispositivos.</p>

<p>O negocio é que isso aconteceu nesta TV, que é 47 polegadas</p>
<p>Na outra TV que tenho aqui da LG 42 nao aconteceu isso, e ja fiz teste c outro cabo hdmi...</p>
<p>Sera que o video game nao consegue atingir perfeição nas tv maiores?</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. I was working up until a few weeks ago and now nothing. Media Player sees my Windows 7 machine, but when you open it you get files not found. I've tried rebuilding the libraries and even reinstalling Media Player 12 but still
 nothing. I'm currently using Plex media server on the PC but that seems to be 50/50 as to whether is shows up at all in the Media player app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is further complicated as my 360 also shows the PC but also can't find any files. I'm 99% certain the issue is Windows media sharing related but can't nail down what or why. I've been through the usual disabling firewalls, checking allowing media streaming
 is enabled in MP12. </p>

<p>I've had some success that I thought I'd share on here just in case it's of any help to you guys. &nbsp;I noticed that the account that media player was showing was the administrator account on my PC (Administrator &lt;PC-NAME&gt;). The main account used on the PC
 is not the Administrator account. I logged on as the administrator and found that the sharing was not enabled under MP12. I turned it on added the necessary folders to the libraries and voila I could see them on the One! I returned to the normal account and
 the files were still visible. </p>
<p>Its more of a work around than a solution but I thought I'd just share in case. I hope it helps!</p>

<p>This thread came up in a search, so I thought I would share how I managed to get the xbox one to recognize media files in a Windows 8.1 computer. You need to add/share the media libraries to the homegroup. The steps are:</p>
<p>Goto Control Panel -&gt; click on 'Choose homegroup and sharing options'</p>
<p>Select 'Change what you're sharing with the homegroup'</p>
<p>Ensure Pictures, Videos, and Music have 'Shared' selected, then click next. Click finished.</p>
<p>Xbox one should see the media folders now--at least it did for me. I don't remember having to go through these steps with Windows 7.</p>

<p>Im on windows 7 so I'm not sure how this translates to 8, but I found my sharing was actually blocking my xbox one. Also did this while my xbox was on. Not 100% sure if that matters, but I imagine it will.</p>
<p>Steps to address:</p>
<p>Control panel</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;under Network and Internet click choose homegroup and sharing options</p>
<p>There's a share media with devices heading under this there's Choose media streaming options, click it.</p>
<p>Then your xbox one should be an option there to allow</p>

            <p>I have the a very similar issue but after&nbsp;copying files my laptop restarts and goes straight into "attempting automatic repairs", "diagnosing PC" and sometimes&nbsp;shows a blue screen with error 0xc000000f or 0xc0000225. None one the options in advanced startup
 are available and it seems like the c:\ drive gets formatted in the process..</p>

</p><p>Had to install win 8 and upgrade to 8.1 four times and I&nbsp;now know my windows serial key by heart. :) If only you could simply do a clean win 10 install rather than having to upgrade first...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm giving up on Win10 unless I am certain I won't have to do it again. I've spent days trying to get the upgrade.</p>

            Hi, I had the same issue&nbsp;during upgrade my Asus N71 notebook. Finally I find a solution - Disabling AHCI controller/Enabling IDE controller&nbsp;in BIOS before the upgrade starts. Reenable AHCI after W10 is installed.

    <title>Windows 10 System Files constantly taking up more space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mileshoshizaki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 System Files constantly taking up more space</h2>
                    I have recently been having storage problems despite not downloading any large files on my 128GB SSD (I have a 1TB hard drive that I download almost all of my files to). I have found that my system files have been rapidly growing in size. In the past thirty
 minutes I have seen the size of my system files increase from 68.6GB to 74.5GB without sign of stopping. My understanding is that system files should be around 20-30GB. I had to delete my older versions of Windows 10 to free up space so that isn't the problem.
 What is causing this growth in system files so rapidly without me downloading, decompressing, or installing anything?

<p>Hello Miles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why your Windows System Files is constantly increasing is due to an offline files in Sync Center. Having said that, we recommend disabling it by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Go to Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; Sync Center.<br />
</span></li><li>Look for Manage Offline files.</li><li>Click Disable offline files.</li><li><span>Do the same to any network devices also running Sync Center.</span></li><li><span>Go into services.msc, and disable "offline files"</span></li><li><span>Reboot.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know if that worked out for you.</span></span><span> <br />
</span></p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for letting us know. <span><span>If that's the case, one factor that we need to consider why the System Files is rapidly growing is
</span></span><span>due to any third party software conflict or may be due to malware. Given that, we highly encourage to perform the following methods:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1: Perform clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>clean boot</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program. You can visit this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to know more details about it.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the KB article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: Perform full PC virus scan using Windows Defender.</span></span></p>

    <title>Change location of thumbnails file and Original Images folder to a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greenje57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change location of thumbnails file and Original Images folder to a different drive than C&#58;drive</h2>
                    Windows Live Photo Gallery has nice features I'd like to use, but I have thousands and thousands of pictures, and cannot afford to use the default locations of the resource files and folders for the application. My C:drive is a small solid state drive,
 so I want ALL the application resources on a different drive.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Photo Gallery has 6GB of files in it.</div>
<div>I can't find a way to move that location elsewhere.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also the app seems to copy the Original Images folder into multiple versions for restore points. How do I stop that from happening?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And how do I configure this software so that the original images location is in a folder and drive that I specify rather than the default location on C?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really would like to keep using this software, but I will give up and dump it if I can't get the resources situated on a different drive...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any advice!</div>

<h2>            Failed to delete port    error 1722</h2>
                    
<p>I have two printers which worked perfectly for months in 64 bit windows 7 ultimate.&nbsp; Then I noticed a&nbsp; RPC server is unavailable error message (it only appeared during one windows 7 start)&nbsp;.&nbsp; The next time I turned the machine on both printers showed yellow
 exclamation marks with a result of no drivers. The&nbsp; HP deskjet 990cxi uses a driver that is already in 64 bit windows and this always fails to install.&nbsp; I download the Brother label printer driver a couple of times and when installing that driver get the Failed
 to delete port error. I checked the 3 rpc statements in services and all are automatic.&nbsp; I have looked for extra copies of spoolsv.exe and only found extra with exactly the same size as the one in system32 and when I replaced the one in system32 with it there
 was no change.&nbsp; Also spoolss.dll is present in system32. I downloaded another copy of that from the net and installed it and there was no change. The malignant software scanner reported nothing and I have AVG running all the time without any message.</p>

<p>How are the last two map packs?</p>
<p>Also, I don't care about the zombie maps, I hardly play that</p>

    <title>The relationship between My Documents and One Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackhasfriends  say:</h3>
<h2>            The relationship between My Documents and One Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently started using one drive on my new laptop because I believe its a great idea to back up all my data with minimal effort my end. Things have been going great for the most part. My only gripe with how it all works is what I will detail here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the problem is that plenty of programs and games automatically dump their files, cashes, settings and savegames in the My Documents folder. This is a problem to me only because it automatically syncs that stuff to my One Drive taking up space I've paid
 for. I'd rather have a little more control over what I back up if I'm honest, and I can't help but feel like the program developers and Microsoft don't have a good relationship as a result of blunders like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my old laptop this was solved by simply making a sub-folder called "Actually My Documents" with my actual documents in (word docs &amp; PDFs and so on), but as I look back it's silly that should be a solution to the problem. "My Documents" should mean MY
 Documents and not a dumping ground for auto generated folders and files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything Microsoft could do to resolve this? As contacting all of the developers for the various programs is unpractical for me and probably a lot of other people.</p>

            Hi Jack
<br />
<br />You can unlink your Documents folder and keep them separately from OneDrive, so only documents you choose to save to OneDrive\Documents are saved there and larger files you don't need to be synced are saved to the local documents folder. 
<br />
<br />Right click the OneDrive folder in the Taskbar
<br />Click Settings
<br />Click the Auto Save tab
<br />Click Update folders button
<br />
<br />Uncheck Documents       
        </p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t upgrade to Win 10</h2>
                    I can't upgrade to Win 10 from Win 7 due to my Nvidia Geforce GT 240M video driver not being compatible.&nbsp; I read that MS has bought Nvidia.&nbsp; It would seem proper for them to provide an upgrade to allow my computer to use Win 10.&nbsp; I have a Sony All-in-One
 desktop VPCL116FX.&nbsp; I have searched Nvidia, Sony, and MS in an attempt to get an updated video driver to no avail.

            <p>I have gone to the Nvidia website on numerous occasions and any available upgrade to my video driver will not load and says it's not compatible with my driver even though it said it was for my Nvidia Geforce GT 240M video driver &nbsp;.&nbsp; If MS has purchased Nvidia
 as I stated it would seem they would provide a suitable upgrade so I could use Win 10.&nbsp; But my daughter has Win 10 and I really don't see&nbsp;much advantage to upgrade to Win 10.&nbsp; Several of my friends upgraded to Win 10 and later went back to Win 7.

<p>Thanks for the confirmation, Boss.&nbsp; I guess I'll forget trying to upgrade to Win 10 on my machine.&nbsp; It works just fine on Win 7.&nbsp;

            As even the most casual observer will note...I still can't upgrade to Win 10 but maybe that's not a real problem.&nbsp; Several friends have upgraded and then gone back to Win 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I'll just have to suck it up and deal with Win 7.

<h2>            Power button and eject button not working &#40;Refuse to pay for repair&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>The power button and eject button just quit working on my Xbox One console.&nbsp; A quick search into the issue returned a response that I have to send the unit back for repair.&nbsp; The support site says the warranty expired and expects.me to pay $115 for the service.&nbsp;
 I need an Xbox representative to respond to me immediately and get this worked out without me paying nearly 25% off the original cost of the unit to repair some faulty buttons.&nbsp; Again, Xbox representative response is requested IMMEDIATELY.</p>

<p>If you are with in the 1 year warranty then it is a free exchange. When it exceeds the 1 year warranty there is a service fee. It is pretty reasonable considering some companies just have you buy a new product or upgrade after the warranty expires. If the
 hardware did not fail with in a year of purchase its hard to prove there was a manufacturing fault. The warranty is to prove you got a device that was meeting its designed capacity. If it failed before the year and you did not attempt to set up an exchange
 it is hard to blame the company you got it from for your in activity. </p>
<p>The exchange can be set up at myservice.xbox.com to get you going again. If with in the warranty it is free. If it has worked for a year and is now failing it was probably built correctly just some kind of force caused it to break.
</p>
<p>If a car broke down at 200,000 miles or 5 years would you blame the car? What about the company that made it? I know it would suck but things don't always work out. The Xbox exceeded the time where the hardware under normal use would show signed of issues
 if a manufacturing fault was present. The only think left is just physical damage, lots of love, and general hardware failure. I replace my computer every 2-4 years. It gets old it doesn't run well and not just because of the software it just gets warn down
 like a cars tires might.</p>
<p>You can contact support at the bottom of the page via contact us or by calling 1-800-4My-Xbox. I would not expect the service charge to be waved but making a public cry out is not a good way to go about it.</p>

            Hi Gabe.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Access the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Mouse, then Driver tab, then Roll Back if available. If not choose Uninstall button, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />
<br />To check if Windows is causing this you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m</a>...
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, Gabe,
<br />
<br />Right click on Start &gt; Select Event Viewer
<br />Click the &gt; next to Windows Logs
<br />Select Application Logs
<br />Look for Errors that coincide with the date/time the system freezes. 
<br />You will see an Event ID # and a Faulting App
<br />This helps in resolving the issue.

<br />You may have to allocate more memory to applications
<br />
<br />Change Virtual Memory Allocation

<br />
<br />How to Allocate Memory to a Process on a Server
<br />
<br />Open the program or background application you'd like to allocate memory to
<br />Right-click the Windows Taskbar and select "Task Manager" from the context menu.
<br />Open the "Processes" tab and scroll through the list to your program's process. 
<br />To confirm that it is the process you want, right-click it and select "Properties." Close the Properties dialog box when done.
<br />Right-click the process again and move your mouse cursor over the "Set Priority" option. The default option is Normal, and is already selected. Select "Above Normal" or "High" to allocate additional memory to the process.
<br />Close the Task Manager. Your memory allocation takes effect immediately.
