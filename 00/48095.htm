<h2>            MS Bingo Server Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hundreds of people continue to post about the server problems with Microsoft Bingo, both in the Bingo discussion forum and in the support forum. &nbsp;Not once has anyone answered any of the comments. &nbsp; What support?? &nbsp;Why even have the game?? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would REALLY be nice to have SOMEbody answer all of us!!!! &nbsp;We are all having the same issue. &nbsp;It's not us. &nbsp;It's the server for that game specifically. &nbsp; Is ANYONE working on it or reading these mails????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

            I honestly don't think Microsoft cares or supports it anymore, so you may as well give up trying to get in.

<p>Microsoft Representative,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read this conversation, you have a pulse on a problem with your successful tendering of a wonderful version of the game of BINGO. It has become for many of us, a source of enjoyment, distraction from the competing claims of complex living, a refreshing
 mindless diversion and/or intelligent passion for fulfilling a need we each bear. I want to congratulate you sincerely on this "free" segue. I do for its delight and meaning for me, and I belief I am say saying, for "us."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Representative(s), you market through this game along with the many others your suspend in hyper space.&nbsp; This economic highlight is to appeal to a motive of profit that might better motivate you to fix or adjust your server challenge. This, profit aim,&nbsp;
 should hold some real significance for you. You are business people. In an era where customer satisfaction is generally taken seriously, you and your staff are truly failing to reflect that you care about your customers in a practical way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Folks, how difficult can it really be for the King and Queen of computerization and master of software to limp like this leaving us with a proverbial, small, but nagging "thorn in the flesh?" Someone, somewhere in your infrastructure is responsible for this
 on-going matter. Someone is responsible for their under-functioning. Studer would rate them as a "low performer." If we, your customers, neglected our job this way, especially with current expectations for quality assurance and positive productivity, we would
 be fired.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can say, "The game is free!" Nevertheless, just because the game is, on the surface, "FREE - fails to be sufficient reason to allow this to continue. Also, honestly speaking "FREE" is not actually true. As you know,&nbsp; you are selling/marketing within
 it, many other games and products and services. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention this financial dimension in this note because I assume, above all else, you are persons who report to a Board. You are accountable. You receive funds from companies who are your customers. Literally, you are failing to honor your agreement to publicize
 for them what they pay you to deliver. I assume, you are under contract with them to accomplish marketing. Do they know that we are not seeing what you promised to deliver to us for them?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps, MS,&nbsp; this failure is too small to concern you. Perhaps it is a penny in their and your pockets. Still, there are ancient sacred stories about faithfulness. Do persons with life values about servanthood work of these issues? The ancient stories pour
 out blessings upon those who are faithful in little, who place the last first, who give with generosity from poverty, and who are servants of others found in need. Though all these teachings seemingly transcend providing BINGO - ensuring its consistency, it
 still matters. Deliver what you promise, or at least communicate regarding why that is not happening if you wish to continue to be successful. Have you reached such a heavenly financial place that you are allowing yourselves to become no earthly good? How
 about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>GABDawg27</p>

            I am also having issues with Server Connection, also with the levels and with getting the community rewards.&nbsp; The server connection just started giving me issues again.&nbsp; When I first installed system I had them and then it appeared to be fixed but now
 has started again.

<h2>            Cant view image in email__</h2>
                    when sending an email to a webtv account, they cant view image on the other end. Is this a setting problem on the webtv? And if so how is it corrected. I believe the messages are in the HTML format that cant be viewed. Any help will be appreciated.

            Is she viewing them in Outlook Express, or on the Web TV Webmail site? If OE: Tools | Options | Read. Uncheck: Read all messages in plain text. If using the Web TV Webmail site, I can't help with that.<br />
<br />
On your machine: Tools | Options | Send. Make sure your Mail Sending Format is HTML and in HTML Settings, be sure: Send pictures with messages is checked.

<p>Im sorry. &nbsp;I mean to say there is no way to sort to purchased games without all the demos, addons, videos and what not (Hundred and hundred of them) in same place as purchased games (In the Account Management, yes). &nbsp;Is there simpler way of viewing purchased
 games without all others altogether in list? &nbsp;it really is a mess and disorganzied</p>

<p>Greetings Dirf</p>
<p>If you want to see a history of items that you've purchased, go to <a href="https://live.xbox.com/download/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Purchase History</a> and sign in with your Windows Live ID (email and password). And you can sort them by categories at xbox.com just check the list on the left.</p>
<p>You can also view your Xbox LIVE purchase history on your console. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your console, sign in using your Xbox LIVE gamertag. </li><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> and then select <strong>Account</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Download History</strong>. </li><li>The items that you've downloaded are shown. </li></ol>

<p>Yeah I realized that can be done at xbox.com not at xbox console. &nbsp;Thank you for the help.</p>
<p>Althought that would be greatly appreciated among xbox live users to search for their purchased games alone at xbox console. &nbsp;A submenu to "Purchased Games" maybe? &nbsp;Easing their searches without all the hassle. &nbsp;If somehow this post can be forwarded to developer
 team or someone with developer status have a look at this would be awesome and for them to implement would be really awesome. &nbsp;Just an idea to enhance user interface.</p>
<p>But thank you all for the answers though</p>

    <title>Taskbar preview preview stops working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Taskbar preview preview stops working</h2>
                    <p>Am I the only one experiencing this issue of taskbar window previews not working when using multiple monitors? They work for a while after reboot but eventually they stop working or only work intermittently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue happens 100% of the time when using multiple monitors with the taskbar set to autohide (I&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;the issue has to do with the autohide setting)&nbsp;. It never happens otherwise. A related symptom is that when&nbsp;this happens, the "tooltip" that contains
 the window title hangs around for a lot longer than it's supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going for the entire time I've been using Windows 10 (a year). It doesn't happen in Windows 8 or prior. It is extremely frustrating as taskbar previews are an immensely helpful feature.</p>

<p>Nope, happens there too. Maybe it's the autohide feature? But, that's a feature I can't live without and don't even want to test.</p>

<h2>            Can not initialize External Drive</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to install a external Toshiba hard drive into my pc by opening it up but the hard drive didn't have the pins a regular internal hard drive has. I put it back in the Toshiba hard drive case and now when plugging it into my PC and&nbsp;initializing
 it, I get an error when trying to&nbsp;initialize it on my PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For when I tried to&nbsp;initialize Master Boot Record: "Device is not ready"<br />
For when I tried to&nbsp;initialize GUID Partition Mask: "The specific disk is not convertible because the size is less than the minimum size required for GPT disks"</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this or I'm stupid and the hard drive is now broken?</p>

<p>This hard drive does not have 40 pins, it has a regular usb input. I have not used the &nbsp;drive in a while but before it was working perfectly. There were not created partitions on it. 500GB is the size of the drive.</p>

<p>I will describe the drive as best as my 13 year old brain can. The circuit board on the hard drive does not have any pins. The input on the hard drive circuit board has a micro-b input. Under the circuit board is the just the hard drive.</p>
<p>Here's a video I made that will, hopefully, help you find a solution to my problem.:<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have actually never seen a HDD configured like your's... Is this a portable USB 3.0 drive that was removed from the case ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to read the part number and stuff off of your picture, but was not able to read it well enough to do a search for more info on the drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't think removing it from the case should cause any type of damage to the actual drive, but maybe...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any type of power connections or anything in the actual case, or are they all on the drive itself ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you might try would be to delete all of the partitions and stuff on it and reformat with something other than windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find some free bootable Disk Management\Partitioning tools can be quite useful...</p>
<p>One you might try is Partition Wizard... It is no longer free for bootable media, but there are older versions that are still available..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one of my more trustable sources for it...</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could post some part numbers of the actual drive as well as the original device I may be able to find something more useful... This has kind of got my curiosity going...</p>

<p>Try heading into Settings, Power, Turn Xbox off and unplug the power cord and HDMI cable from the back of the console for 5 minutes. Plug it back in and try again. I believe that I read that this may be an issue with a recent update, and should be fixed
 in the next one. I will try to find a link for you and post that if I can find it.</p>

<p>I have the same issue, though it only seems to happen while I am playing Forza 6. &nbsp;But that may just be that this is what I am playing most right now. &nbsp;I have reported this issue, so now we wait...</p>
<p>Thanks @KenH2k4 for your possible solution, I'm going to try that now...</p>

<h2>            Multiple &#34;Service Host&#34; processes slowing down computer</h2>
                    <p>As of the April update, my Windows computer has been running slow.&nbsp; The Disk section of the Task Manager is showing a percentage of between 98 and 100% at all times.&nbsp; Scanning through the list of running programs and processes, I noticed 77 Windows processes
 running and 65 of them were "Service Host:" and then descriptor.&nbsp; For example, I have COM + Event System, Cryptographic Services, DNS Client and Peer Networking Identity Manager running, just to name a few.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what these programs are.&nbsp; I don't know what they do.&nbsp; I want them GONE!&nbsp; They, and a program called Modern Setup Host, are severely lagging my computer and I just got it in January.&nbsp; It has gotten so bad my computer crashed two nights ago while
 I was checking my email!&nbsp; I had to reset the system, which means I lost EVERYTHING, and it STILL has these programs eating up 100% of my disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this keeps up, I'm junking this computer and buying an Macintosh.</p>

            This is an ongoing issue with the recent cumulative update. I had to uninstall the cumulative update in order to get things sorted and then block that.

<h2>            Task Scheduler won&#39;t start.</h2>
                    Hello.In a morning I wanted to defragment and optimize my drives like always, but this time I got this error "Storage optimization cannot start because the Task Scheduler service is not running.Start the task scheduler service and try again"OK.So I went
 to the windows button, searched for run, services.msc, went to task scheduler.It was set on automatically but it was not running...hmmm pretty strange.I right clicked on it, went to properties and started the service but I got another error which said "The
 Task Scheduler service on Local Computer started and then stopped.Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services".I searched on internet for many fixes, like activating RPC service and Windows event log.I had them running so no effect
 on my issue.I want to mention that this happened after Cumulative update for windows 10 version 1709 x64 based systems and security update for adobe flash player for windows 10 version 1709.I really don't know what to do.If you

    <title>Windows can&#8217;t remember my password&#47;PIN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> passakornkongrat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows can&#8217;t remember my password&#47;PIN</h2>
                    <p>I’m running Windows 10 64 bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot the PC, and I’m at the sign-in screen, and I type in my PIN to sign in, Windows tells me my PIN is incorrect even though I’m 100% sure I’m typing it correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve now changed my PIN 5 times in the last 24 hours. I’ve written it down and saved it. I can use it to sign in to my Microsoft account online on my phone and other devices. But when I try to log into my PC it says my PIN is incorrect. It even does this
<strong>right after I reset my pin</strong> to a new PIN. Again, I’m 100% sure I’m typing it correctly because I can sign in with it on other devices and to my account online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating because I now am resetting my PIN every single time I log in to Windows on my PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can’t Windows remember my PIN?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<br />

            Hi, passakornkongrat
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>I solved the problem. Apparently the "PIN" is local to the PC but the Microsoft "Password" is global. These are two different things and need to be handled separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">For future readers</span>: </p>
<p>To change the PIN, in Windows go to your profile, "Change account settings," "Sign-in options," and there you can change both the password and the PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">For Microsoft</span>:</p>
<p>When I tried to log in to my PC, I needed my <em>PIN </em>-- not my <em>Password</em>. I could not sign in with my Password. But there's no "Forgot PIN" on the sign-in page. There's only "Forgot Password." And when I click on it, it lets me change my
<em>Password</em>, but not my <em>PIN</em>. I'm sorry, but this is really dumb and makes no sense. If you need a
<em>PIN</em> to sign in and you forget the <em>PIN</em>, why make the person change their Microsoft
<em>Password</em>? At the very least give them a heads up that the two are different and they need to update their PIN once they've signed in, for heaven's sake.

            Hello.  I'm an installation specialist who will be happy to help walk you through the steps I'm summarizing below, complete with links to illustrated tutorials for each.   You may also want to take it to a shop to save time, but it will be expensive.  So if you need help with any steps, just ask back.
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />2) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began. If this fails try a Startup Repair. 
<br />
<br />3) From Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking.  If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options given here: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/how-to-enter-windows-10s-safe-mode.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/...</a>
<br /> 
<br />From Safe Mode w/Networking work through this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>  
<br />
<br />4) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC:  <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows...</a>
<br /> 
<br />5) If that fails or you want the gold standard install do the Clean Install at  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.   You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the tutorial linked. It is a better install than any amount of money can buy.  
<br /> 
<br />6) An alternative is to run Factory Recovery from it’s hotkey at boot; find yours by googling the “PC make/model + Run Factory Recovery.”   But keep in mind the Factory install is greatly inferior to a Clean Install, a Windows-only Reset or a Refresh without the crippling factory bloatware.  After Recovery mitigate the inferior factory install with the Checklist steps from earlier.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

                    In the lab where I work we need 20+ devices connected to the same computer via USB. I have 3 powered deltaco HUBs and several devices. Some USB3.0, some USB2.0, but all hubs are 3.0.<br />
I install all softwares and drivers individually for each device (each works individually).<br />
When I try to plug all of them together the computer goes blue screen and will not turn on again until I unplug all usbs.<br />
Tried with two different computers, windows 7 and windows 10, no change.<br />
Tried updating all drivers, no change.<br />
<br />
Here are some dumps files:<br />
https://dtudk-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ftnk-qlably_win_dtu_dk/EWCxUz52fGlLi7XCJPkE8S4BMHYRM7Dc6f6w4mi46qyJGQ?e=cgRPvC<br />
<br />
It looks like the problem does not come from one device but from the number. I had crashes with hub1 and no other, but also with hub2 and no other, so it is device independent.<br />
<br />
I tried to plug usb very slowly. The computer managed to see all of them. Was working fine for 1h and then crashed spontaneously. Now it turns on but sees no screen, no usb, no ethernet...nothing.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

<p>Hi Lorenzo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A computer supplies little power to every USB inserted to it. If there are too many USBs getting inserted simultaneously, it will summed up and surpassed the required power from the USB port. Hence, it will give up and trigger the blue screen error to shut
 down your computer to avoid further electrical damage to your hardware via USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For best practices, you need to insert USB devices one at a time only or select which ones that needs to be attended or must be inserted in the mean time.</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using powered hubs which are supposed to deliver all the required power to the devices and I have no device attached to the computer directly. The pc has only to send the signal to the hubs, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now it looks like i fried the motherboard...the computer wont respond to anything</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer. It seems that every time the crash is caused by a different file in a different driver. this time ftser2k.sys is from one of the devices called PiezoController. One other time it was from another device called Pixie. This time the
 pixie was not even connected. When the pixie made the crash the Piezo was not connected. So the problem seems device independent. I am starting to think I need several PCI-USB cards in the computer because now I fried the motherboard somehow. This tells me
 there is still power issues (maybe the USB&nbsp;require too much power for one card to handle?) even though every device is attached to a powered&nbsp;HUB.<br />
Maybe sending all the data through the initial cable still requires a lot of current for the PCI-USB card in the computer (probably only one).</p>

<h2>            live id not working in windows 10</h2>

<p>Live ID not working for OneDrive, my desktop sign on with my Microsoft account, Outlook.com and 3rd party that requires my msn Live ID account, Basically anything dealing with login live id. But I am able to reset password and access my msn Live ID account.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Sometimes I can get logged on using ie11, but not MS Edge. This is the first time in a week able to access my account via MS Edge but now can't access via ie11. I get two errors: the&nbsp;IE11 error is "This web page can not be displayed with logon.live.com. The
 other error I get with MS EDGE and OneDrive and MS Mail&nbsp;is "There was a problem connecting to OneDrive, Check your Internet connection, and then try again". My office outlook 2010 works just fine, Have done tons of diagnosis, reboots, router restarts, reinstalled
 router software, deleted &amp; reinstalled adaptor, reset password even added an alias to my on line account. I don't believe it is my internet connection otherwise I could not be sending you this request for help. Please Help I've run out of ideas, I truly don't
 want to start from scratch again. Just need to fix my Live ID issues. Thanks for helping.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your quick response, I spend some time checking out the Soumya Sundar Debroy reply and read several other replies, my issues are very similar but still is a no go. Did not help,&nbsp; I did a ping with www.hotmail.com and outlook.com got same error
 "Something went wrong and we can't sign you in right now. Please try again later." Verified my credentials existed they do. now I'll be moving on the clean boot and see what happens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was&nbsp;wondering &nbsp;I just found some info stating that the windows live id&nbsp;maybe a conflict&nbsp;with&nbsp;windows 10&nbsp;live id&nbsp; Could that be my problem? Could it be a dll or driver issue? How would I know. Thanks again for your help</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still face the issue after performing clean boot then, would suggest you to run
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious
 software. It works with your existing Antivirus software. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</p>

<p>First, Thank you for sending me the email asking how I was doing.&nbsp; That means a lot to me. I do apologize</p>

<p>
</p><p>I ran the <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner </strong>found no problems. my issues are strictly with live id. There is something</p>
<p>blocking my password acceptance on the internet&nbsp;apps, mail and One Drive, since they either time out or just attempt to log on for ever, or the messages just instantly came back and tell me "can not connect try again later." My Desk Top Account and Outlook
 Mail for Office 10 no problems. But I want to use the MS mail and apps that are win10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just got an email from Windows telling me an upgrade to Windows 10 is waiting for me. So I am thinking maybe this will fix my issues, but NO.... now&nbsp; I get an windows update error 0x800705b4. Now I need to spend time that I don't have to&nbsp;figure this out

    <title>Mysterious Hard Disk Partitions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david corkindale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mysterious Hard Disk Partitions</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>According to 'Disk Management' the 'basic' Hard Disk on my netbook has 4 partitions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) 'C': (primary partition; system;boot;page file;active and crash dump) - healthy (100gb - NTFS)</p>
<p>(2) 'D': (primary partition) - healthy (117.86gb - NTFS)</p>
<p>(3) No name or drive letter: (primary partition) - healthy (15gb - free space 100%)</p>
<p>(4) No name or drive letter: (EFI system partition) - healthy (20mb - free space 100%).</p>
<p>My enquiry relates to (3) and (4). Both of these seem to be completely inaccessible. I have so far not been able to find out anything else about them and when I right-click on them in 'Disk Management' none of the usual menu options are available. These
 partitions/disks do not appear at all in Windows Explorer but 'C' and 'D' do so in the normal way.</p>
<p>Can anyone enlighten me as to what they ((3) and (4 )above) <b>may possibly </b>
relate to? The underlying reason for these enquiries is because I had been thinking of installing Ubuntu on a
<b>separate</b> partition at some stage but I already appear to have the maximum number of allowable partitions anyway unless it is safe for me to try to delete (3) and (4). (I appreciate that I can probably put Ubuntu in 'C' to work alongside Windows if I
 want to, or even use a USB etc))</p>
<p>It seems particularly puzzling that the small amount of space that (3) and (4) appear to occupy on the hard disk is so small and is apparently completely free and unused anyway. Could it be that this is not actually accurate?</p>
<p>Incidentally, for your information, I have Windows 7 Starter (32-bit) which includes the Microsoft Client Virtualisation Handler for a pared-down version of Word and Excel - this appears to operate from a completely inaccessible 'Q' drive. Could the 15gb
 partition (3) really be the same as the 'Q' drive? If so, why would that partition not be listed as 'Q' in 'Disk Management' even though it appears as such in Explorer. If not, why would the inaccessible 'Q' drive not appear at all as a 'partition' in the
 'partitions' list in 'Disk Management'?</p>
<p>Alternatively, the netbook was shipped with a second Operating System called 'Express Gate Cloud'. I previously thought this was hidden somewhere on the 'C' drive but could it be this second O.S. that uses the 15gb partition, even though the partition is
 not actually marked as 'boot' or 'active' (ie. for loading up an OS)? </p>
<p>When replying it would be a great help if the terminology was kept as simple as possible as I have no real experience with this kind of thing. Thanks !</p>

<p>EFI partition:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_System_partition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_System_partition</a></p>
<p>Partition numbered as (3) might be the recovery one abut what baffles me is the 100% free space.</p>
<p>Any information in the user manual about this topic?</p>
