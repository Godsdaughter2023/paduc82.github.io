<h2>            ASUS TP500LA Fliplock Issues Windows 10 &#47; Internet pages opening when laptop is closed</h2>
                    <p><span>I have an ASUS laptop that flips over to be a tablet. It is supposed to lock the keyboard and trackpad with the ASUS fliplock but it doesn't work. I've tried installing, uninstalling, reinstalling everything nothing works.<br />
<br />
Also when the laptop is CLOSED, it opens random web pages and searches in firefox and in edge. I don't know why it does this. It's only when it is closed. I have woken up in the middle of the night to hearing it playing videos on random blogs or websites, while
 it is closed.<br />
<br />
Any solutions to either of these?</span></p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>Please share the details.</p>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>When you say " tried installing, uninstalling, reinstalling everything nothing works" what are all the troubleshooting steps you&nbsp;have performed?</li></ul>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Have you installed all pending updates and also updated all device drivers?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>
</p><p>Try searching the app on the Search bar and see if it shows up.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You might need to update your drivers in the device manager. So But first we need to find out if its a hardware or a software issue.
<div>I would suggest you go to the safe mode and see if the problem persists. To go to Safe mode follow the steps below:<br />
&nbsp;a. Click on Windows key, and in the Power Options click on Restart while pressing the shift key.<br />
&nbsp;b. A blue screen will appear with a few options.<br />
&nbsp;Click on Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart.<br />
&nbsp;c. Your system will automatically restart, press 4 or F4 key to go to the Safe Mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I would also suggest you&nbsp;Change startup settings in Windows 10:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a><br />
If it works fine in the safe mode that means the issue is with the hardware.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the results.</p>

            <p>Same laptop asus tp500la. Lots of driver problems, auto rotate is upside down in potrait, wont wake from sleep and need to hold power key till reboot, touch-pad stops working, blue screen video errors. I have sent an e-mail to Asus requesting they hurry
 up and get this mess sorted. No resposne yet. Some things are fixed by using old 8.1 video driver and updated asus touch-pad driver. I am running preview version on my laptop and regular 10 on my pc. Every time it updates I have to redo the old video drivers
 and Asus new smart gesture. &nbsp;A good place to start is the download page from asus. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the same laptop and have had similar issues. The opening programs in the middle of the night is related to the TOUCHSCREEN. Finally figured this out recently, saved me much headache (I thought someone was "hacking" into my computer...) Go to device
 manager and disable the touchscreen under "Human Interface Devices". Mine is called HID-Compliant Touch Screen. This isn't much of a fix (perhaps you use your computer like a tablet), but it will stop the random opening of programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't figured out how to fix the FlipLock either. Had to disable sleep (hibernate seems to work, and the computer will reboot in a couple of seconds).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS has not been any help at all.</p>

    <title>No sound from built-in sound bar on Inspiron 1750 running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martincahn  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound from built-in sound bar on Inspiron 1750 running pre-installed Windows 7 after automatic Windows Update</h2>
                    
<p>I will try to make this as thorough a description of my problem as possible.</p>
<p>For about a month now, following an automatic Windows 7 update, my wife's Inspiron 1750 laptop will not play any sounds from any device including the built-in sound bar. The problem has affected iTunes as well in that it will not even show that a track is
 playing despite having clicked the play button for the song.</p>
<p>Several points:</p>
<ol>
<li>My wife's laptop is running manufacturer-installed (DELL) Windows 7 Home Premium OS.</li><li>The system tray sound icon is NOT showing that it's stuck in mute (NO red "x"). Everything<em>appears</em> to be working correctly.
</li><li>Yes, we've seen the same "no driver" message when checking the properties of the system speaker under device manager a lot of other people have seen.</li><li>We've tried running Mr. Fixit to no avail. </li></ol>
<p>Finally, I wanted to mention that I contacted DELL not long after this problem started. Their only solution: restore the system to before the Windows Update that appears to be the problem. I believe it rolled it back to about early to mid June. Within days,
 of course, Windows 7 automatically updated again, recreating whatever problem has caused her to lose audio.</p>
<p>We would really like Microsoft to fix this problem via Windows Update so that everyone who has experienced this problem would get a fix. If an update caused this, then an update should fix it. In the meantime, if anyone else has any other possible solutions
 -- <em>keeping in mind that I have gone through a lot of the previously posted answers, which have not helped</em>-- I would greatly appreciate their contacting me. My wife's inability to play back sound is actually quite a problem, since she was using it
 to help with our sons' education (not to mentioning listening to music or other media while working).</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp;Which updates did you install?<br />
2.&nbsp;What troubleshooting steps have you tried?<br />
3.&nbsp;Did you try installing the driver for the sound card from manufacturer’s website?</p>
<p><br />
Please answer the above questions, especially 2nd question because we can try with the different steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>If you have not tried running Audio troubleshooter then, try it.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Uninstall the sound card driver and then try installing it.<br />
a.&nbsp;Click on start button, type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and press enter.<br />
b.&nbsp;Expand sound, video and game controllers, Right click on the sound card and select<strong>Uninstall</strong>.
<br />
c.&nbsp;Restart the computer. This should install the proper drivers for it.</p>
<p><br />
You may also download and install the latest driver for it from manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Umesh, my apologies for not getting back sooner. I don't often go out to tech "answer" forums and had expected to be notified of your answers via Hotmail.</p>
<p>In any event, I have tried both the troubleshooter and devmgmt.msc steps you mention; neither worked. I'm also not convinced that driver you linked to would be the right one, but I will give it a go when I can get at my wife's laptop again. I'm typing from
 mine, by the way, which is why this is such a mystery to us. We bought our laptops only weeks apart. Mine's a Studio with the built-in JBL premium sound system, while she has some type of built-in soundbar where my lighted touch media controls are on mine.
 We both have pre-installed versions of Windows 7. I have no problems, while she's got all kinds.</p>
<p>As for the updates, all I can tell you is that they were around mid-June because that's to the point where the DELL representative had me roll back to a restore point. Has anyone discussed the possibility that one of the June updates is affecting DELL Inspiron
 laptops' ability to produce sound and/or playback music through both iTunes and Windows Media Player (I checked; neither works now on my wife's laptop).</p>
<p>Anyway, that's as far as I've gotten. Will give another update when I can.</p>

<p>Just to add that it will say 'change' and not add, however they both factor under the same name so you should just go ahead if you're old enough for your particular region and change your region to the country you reside in.</p>

    <title>Want 2 restore to factory settings, but no disk- have seen some - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> indigoeyes203  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want 2 restore to factory settings, but no disk- have seen some helpful info about that, but add&#39;l issues and would like opinions&#47;recommendations-this is long, so thanks in advance for your time&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Have Toshiba (laptop&nbsp;&lt; 5 months old)&nbsp;- realize&nbsp;has been&nbsp;taken over and pulled into a network and I&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;regain control of settings. (Seems to be a Bot from what I have gathered.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
From what I have been able to determine, is linked into a network with&nbsp;a number of other machines, and network administration seems&nbsp;pretty sophisticated.&nbsp; &nbsp;(I have done some systems testing with IT in projects at work, so have a&nbsp;reasonable grasp of basic networking,
 but I am a total idiot with anything involving programming, etc.)<br />
<br />
I could care less about saving any personal data, just want to regain control.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 1st day I set up, I set all the recommended security settings thru Vista, activated Windows Defender, and set up Norton Internet Security 2009&nbsp;before going on line.&nbsp; I even set up an Administrator account and user account as they recommended.&nbsp; Went to check
 email -yahoo, and aol - only sites visited, and noticed same problem I had on prior laptop (Dell) - had gotten rid of it because of this issue, which is why I THOUGHT I was being very careful to set up correctly before going online.<br />
<br />
Rtnd to POS (Best Buy), explained what happened-could tell they did not have a clue what I was talking about, but they did a hard drive&nbsp;reset to factory specs for me, and assured me would resolve everything.<br />
<br />
Within 1 day, had same issue again.&nbsp;Wiped hard drive myself with overwrite with disk from a friend, but had no recovery disk,&nbsp;so took in to a computer repair shop for them to reload&nbsp;software to factory specs.&nbsp; They did so, but within 2 days, noticed same issues
 AGAIN.&nbsp; Took back in to repair shop, where they assured me that I was having an ongoing blond moment and&nbsp;imagining things, and did not understand how Vista worked. Okay, yeah right.<br />
<br />
Within the week, got worse, and because I was irritated and stubborn, was able to get into enough stuff to realize that the Norton displayed on my screen appeared active but was not updating- had been disabled, as had Defender.&nbsp; Went back to shop where once
 again, they told me I was imagining things.<br />
<br />
Left furious, tried to go online to get help, but my computer is being redirected to fake/old/compromised-no idea exactly what-&nbsp;versions of legit websites (microsoft, yahoo, symantec) -finally was able to link into symantec long enough to get a real time connection,
 and&nbsp;before it was interrupted (at approx 80% updated which confirmed what I suspected, I was able to see that they had been sending notifications, all of which were blocked from me receiving them)&nbsp;-they did send me a case/issue number and phone number for
 contact. <br />
<br />
Called in, got escalated to level 3 of symantec tech support where they confirmed what I suspected about the software being disabled (basically a shell was displaying that made it appear that it was running, but no updates were being relayed to me. )&nbsp; Exactly
 what I had tried to&nbsp;explain to prior two places I took it - Norton and Defender had been disabled -&nbsp;<br />
Symantech advised it was malware, offered to help me fix the problem for a couple of hundred bucks, but of course advised could still come back if infected again...<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I have issues with paying your company to fix a something&nbsp; that disabled&nbsp;your software that was supposed to protect my equipment.&nbsp; I may end up having to go that direction, but I would imagine that some of you will understand my lack of confidence
 in Symantec and Vista at this point, and my unwillingness to pay for this if I can avoid it.<br />
<br />
From what I have read recently, apparently&nbsp;known Windows vulnerabilities allow this to happen, and&nbsp;if I had set up a group admin policy (did not bc only me and one&nbsp;computer) I might have avoided all of this.<br />
<br />
I had assumed malware, and from what I have been able to piece together thru studying Vista Network support manuals,&nbsp;and what I've been able to have time to access on real microsoft site at work since I could not get to it on my computer, at&nbsp;home,&nbsp;it may&nbsp;involve
 a root kit.<br />
<br />
However,&nbsp;I have found that when I&nbsp;wiped harddrive, booted from safe mode, reinstalled software, etc, whoever is doing this&nbsp;seems to be manually going in and altering my permissions, clearly they are getting right back in and have my passcodes even after I reset
 them all, and now they have locked me out of even more permissions.&nbsp; They have even disabled my&nbsp;cd drive so that I could not&nbsp;do harddrive reset, and have locked me out&nbsp;of being able to remove or install&nbsp;almost anything -<br />
<br />
Lol, so now I am even more screwed and&nbsp;quite irritated.&nbsp; I assumed if I were able to get it back to factory specs, that would resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, due to the number of times I have reset things -with exception of group policy which I have never been able to access
 and have finally&nbsp;figured out probably won't, I am wondering if this is just malware.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the likelihood that&nbsp;this is someone who has actually hacked in to attack my system for personal reasons?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It's disturbing me to consider this, but would one computer really be beneficial enough&nbsp;to whatever they are&nbsp;doing for them to spend the amount of time they clearly have on just&nbsp;this one&nbsp;machine? (This has been going on since May.) Or should I&nbsp;really consider
 that this may be&nbsp;personal?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's hard to believe that someone who just wants to antagonize me&nbsp;would go to the lengths to capture all of these counterfeit images and&nbsp;redirect to all these websites for&nbsp;jollies though.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem that whoever is doing this&nbsp;must be running some sort of&nbsp;profitable
 business, though probably illegal or at least unethical.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
(Add'l notes,&nbsp;things I delete only get&nbsp;recycled, they have some sort of program that&nbsp;was reloading everything I had changed back to their settings at system launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have now&nbsp;locked me out of access to a number of system management files, I guess because
 I had&nbsp;managed to block or interfere with&nbsp;some of the things they were doing.&nbsp;Some of changes they have made thru task manager/engineer, but I have also been able to see where they have been actually using programming language on notepad to do other things.)<br />
<br />
Please share any insight you can offer based on your experience and knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Malware or intentional hacking into personal system?&nbsp; <br />
Best options&nbsp;to resolve issue and&nbsp;make my computer MINE again?<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for your time!&nbsp;<br />

            I personally prefer Microsoft Security Essentials <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;(instead of Norton or even Avast) as an anti-virus anti-malware program (though using it full time with an occasional scan with Malwarebytes is probably a good idea).&nbsp; It's free and new and has received
 rave reviews.&nbsp; It's said it has the least impact on system performance of any AV program out there and it's said to be excellent at catching and eliminating malware like viruses.&nbsp; I was using Pandasoft but I've since switched to MSE.&nbsp; Please note that you
 should only have ONE anti-virus program installed and running on your system at any one time otherwise you can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of other problems - so choose wisely.<br />
<br />
If you're concerned about rootkits (you mentioned that in your post) here <a href="http://www.antirootkit.com/software/IceSword.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.antirootkit.com/software/IceSword.htm</a>&nbsp;is a product that helps protect a system from rootkits. It doesn't eliminate them once the system is infected - it prevents the system from becoming infected in the first place.<br />
<br />
It's impossible for us to tell if it's just malware or intentional hacking - both are possible.&nbsp; You just need to protect yourself in both cases.&nbsp; Make sure the Windows Firewall is up and running
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/bb545423.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/bb545423.aspx</a>.&nbsp; Make sure you have a good AV program and a good AM backup (as recommended above).&nbsp; If you start from a clean boot then and install
 and configure these programs correctly, you should be protected.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I'm not sure how to restore your system&nbsp;if you've been locked out of your CD drive because you need that to restore the PC to factory settings (using either a Recovery Disk or a genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk) - unless the zero key procedure
 outlined by Mr. Murphy works.&nbsp; Hopefully you'll be able to gain access long enough to get the process started when the time comes.&nbsp; Be sure to select a full format of the hard drive when promped in the installation process (not just a quick format).<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck!

<br />
<p><span>Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Toshiba Recovery:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To access the Toshiba recovery partition, power off the laptop. Hold down the 0 (zero) key and turn the laptop on. Keep holding down
 the zero key until the TOSHIBA logo appears, where you should start tapping the zero key repeatedly. Stop if the unit beeps or when the TOSHIBA logo disappears. The screen should flash ** HDD RECOVERY MODE ** for a split second, then load the Toshiba recovery
 program right from the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Note that this erases all data, and reloads all factory default software. Be sure to back up all your important personal data beforehand!</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the
 disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<h2>            Log in Problem-Xbox Games on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone!!</p>
<p>I have recently downloaded the windows 8.1 update, and ever since I haven't been able to log in the Xbox games application, every time I open the app, it asks for my microsoft account password and then it says "xbox service is unavailable at the moment"
 , error code 0xc0011cd (0x80004005).
 I couldn't find a solution anywhere, do you have any suggestion on what to do?</p>
<p>Thanks:))</p>

<p>[quote]</p>
<p>Sign-in issues:</p>
<p>You might hit a sign-in error if:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;You're trying to sign in to the app in a country or region where the service is unavailable.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;You're trying to sign in on a computer that is in a different country than where your account is based.</p>
<p>Make sure that when you sign in to an app, the country or region set on your computer is the same as the country that your Xbox Live account was created in. If these do not match, you will not be able to sign in.</p>

            <p>Have you restarted your PC since doing the update to 8.1? And by that I mean switching it off properly and then back on (not just logging off, or closing the lid and putting it in hibernation). You can do this by bringing in the panel from the right-hand side, and clicking on Power. Choose either Shut Down or Restart.</p>
<p>Ignore the rest if this works.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>When you use the PC, are you logging in to Windows with a Microsoft Account (MSA) or a local user account?</p>
<p>You know you are using an MSA if Xbox-branded games automatically log you in (when they're working), whereas a local account will ask you for email/password each time.</p>

<p>Could you please log in at <a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a> and let me know what the two letters before 'Personal Account' are? You'll find this near the upper right.</p>

 game &nbsp;the log in was automatic. The letters &nbsp;near Personal Account are IT and I am logging in from Italy!what can I do now?thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi again.</p>
<p>You should still go ahead and try the router-reset but if that does not work we have another potential solution lined up.</p>
<p>I have spoken with a Support Agent who has informed me that the error code you are seeing is specific to the Windows 8.1 upgrade, meaning that your best course of action might be restoring your version of Windows back to 8.0.</p>
<p>If you need any help with this you will want to consider posting here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows">answers.microsoft.com/.../windows</a></p>
<p>They will be much better at helping you through this process than we are here.</p>

            <p>Hello again!</p>
<p>Are you still seeing these problems?</p>
<p>If so, I believe I might have a solution for you.</p>
<p>I have a PC that I used the Windows 8.1Preview on, and just booted it up now for the first time in a long time. I also realised that last time I had access to it, I was having the same issue as you. I was opening the Games Hub and it was closing on me.</p>
<p>So here's what I did, and it solved my problem immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Swipe in the Charm bar on the right-hand side, and choose Settings, then Change PC Settings.</li>
<li>On the left-hand side of this new page, choose Accounts and it should automatically take you to the first heading, 'Your Account.'</li>
<li>So on the right-hand side it will have your name, below which is the Microsoft Account (e-mail address) and then 'Disconnect'. Below that there should be a clickable link saying 'Your account needs to be verified.'</li>
<li>Click that, then it will ask you to provide your password, possibly followed by some proofs that are associated with your account.</li>
<li>Once you have entered these, the pop-up window will close.</li>
<li>Then go back to the Start Screen and you should be able to sign into the Games Hub.</li>
</ul>
<p>It worked for me; I hope it works for you too. Let us know!</p>

            Hi Valeri.&nbsp; Asghodt.exe is a component of HP ProtectTools Security Manager.&nbsp; See http://h20331.www2.hp.com/Hpsub/downloads/FINAL_HP%20ProtectTools%20Security%20Manager.pdf.&nbsp; Although the link I posted tells you how to uninstall this software, doing so
 could cause issues if you have utilised any of the features.&nbsp; In this instance, it would be advisable to contact HP Support and ask for assistance.<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The Active Desktop component that was available in XP is no longer a part of Windows.</p>
<p>To get the capability you describe, you will need to use a third party multiple monitor product. Here are some&nbsp;links.</p>

<h2>            Controller calibration</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>After 3 hours of making a controller work, i somehow made the right thumb stick not calibrated well. I'm using win 8.1 and in win 7 and 10 there is a calibrate device option. where is it in win 8? BTW the Right thumb stick acts like a mouse too, when i start
 the controller the mouse starts going in the direction where the right stick is calibrated, and it isn't calibrated well.</p>

            Hi Deana.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Trayapp.msi is installed with HP Printer software to keep connected to the printer so scans can be sent from the printer top.  More here:  <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebooks-Archive-Read-Only/How-do-I-get-rid-of-TrayApp-msi-problem/td-p/2202423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebooks-Archive...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the HP Support Downloads webpage here <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a> to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            how to turn off touchpad</h2>
                    so sorry - lost previous pg of suggestions...&nbsp; I was asking <strong>How to turn off touchpad in Windows 10, Asus laptop
</strong>- going through control panel to device settings to disable touchpad does not work for me - no device settings option under mouse properties, etc. Another suggestion - click F2 during boot-up, go into BIOS - no BIOS option shows up. I have mouse installed
 and I can only adjust the sensitivity level of touchpad, not turn it off.&nbsp;

            Thanks but this did not work. I have gone into the mouse options numerous times but it never gives me any choices&nbsp; - just says the device is working properly. Disable touchpad if mouse plugged in is not an option given. I can completely disable touchpad
 but I've heard that is not a good idea in case something happens to mouse. thanks anyway.

            do you know how to disable the touch pad in any way because i don't get the ultranav tab and i can not figure it out. If I go into settings for my mouse/touch pad there is no thing that tells me to disable it only the touch pad sensitivity

<h2>            Webcam decided to not exist</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 a while back. Today, suddenly, Skype is not detecting my camera. I'm on an Alienware m18x</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through every post regarding the same topic.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Dell software website won't allow me to download the software for webcam central 2.0.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if that is the problem as it is supposed to not need a driver just software. I can see an unknown device in my device manager but it doesn't find anything regarding the driver or software using the update tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It could be an outdated&nbsp;driver of your&nbsp;camera.
</span>While you may not think it’ll make a difference, the latest version of the driver for your particular webcam could include updates that handle some of the methods that Skype software uses to access your webcam video stream. In particular, if you’re having
 problems with Skype having no video, you’ll want to make sure that your device supports at least DirectShow 9.1 standard. Check with the manufacturer website of your webcam for the latest driver update, and of course doing a
<a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows update</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your current driver version by going into the device manager. For most versions of Windows, that’s in the Control Panel (classic), System, and Device Manager. Hopefully, there’s no yellow exclamation mark on the webcam, because if so then your issue
 is a resource conflict with another device. Fixing that is beyond our scope, but it would at least indicate your Skype no video problem. If things appear fine, then right-click on your webcam device and select “<em>properties</em>” and then click on the driver
 tab. Here, you can see the driver date, and if it’s fairly old (as mine is), you may want to click on “<em>Update Driver</em>” and search the Internet for the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You’ll also want to try downloading the latest version of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=740AC79A-5B72-447D-84F9-EE6407ED1A91&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DirectX</a> as well (you’ll need at least version 9.0 for Skype video to work). Click on
<em>Run</em> and in the command prompt type “<em>dxdiag</em>” to double check your DirectX version.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you see a screen like the one above when you&nbsp;go to the <strong>Skype menu tab
</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Video settings</strong> then you know that’s the problem - your webcam is not working properly and needs to be updated.

<h2>            Poor sound quality after upgarding to windows 10</h2>
                    I am experiencing poor sound quality after upgrading to windows 10. Before upgrading i.e. in windows 8.1 sound quality was good with perfect bass and vocals. But after upgrading the there is no bass effect even if the sounds settings are same as it was
 previously in windows 8.1. The sound is distorted too. I tried re installing the sound driver but that didn't help. Changed sound settings also but of no vain. I need help in resolving this issue.

<h2>            Alienware M14x R1 - Random BSOD - IRQL_Unexpected_Value</h2>
                    <p>I recently&nbsp;upgraded to&nbsp;Windows 10 from Windows 7 and I keep getting completely random blue screens of death indicating IRQL Unexpected Value.&nbsp;I cannot seem to replicate this issue because how random this is. Example: Open mail -&gt; BSOD, Open settings -&gt; BSOD,
 Start installing Hearthstone -&gt; BSOD, so on and so forth. And it doesn't even happen every time I perform those functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I did notice was sometimes my NVidia GPU would be visible in Device Manager and sometimes it wouldn't, and those times that it would not, BIOS wouldn't even recognize that there was a discrete graphics on the system. It seriously just comes and
 goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even tried reinstalling the updated BIOS to see if maybe that would reset something to no avail. I'm hoping maybe someone has had similar issues and knew what actions to take.</p>

            <p>Hi Jeremy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and try to run the Hardware troubleshooter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> on the keyboard.</li><li>Click on <strong>Control panel</strong>.</li><li>Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without quotes in the Control panel <strong>
search</strong> box.</li><li>Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click on <strong>View all</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to check if the driver is compatible with Windows 10. If not, then you may try to install it in compatibility mode. Right click on the downloaded driver package file and click on<strong> Troubleshoot compatibility
</strong>and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<li>What is the Make and Model of the computer?</li><li>Did you update the driver by downloading the latest driver from manufacturer’s website?</li><li>Are you using a wired or a wireless network?</li></ol>

<h2>            HP Photosmart 7660 NETWORK PRINTING&#33; via xp32</h2>
                    <span>&nbsp;
                    <span>&nbsp;
<p>
To share a network printer being hosted by a computer running a 32 bit operating system with another computer running a 32 bit operating system, Vista or XP, you would go to Control Panel &gt; ‘Printers’ &gt; ‘Add Printer’ &gt; ‘Add a network printer’.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Apologies
 if you consider that I am stating the obvious.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Sharing a printer being hosted by a computer running 32 bit Vista or XP with a computer running 64 bit Vista is not obvious, because if you use the above method, it will not work.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
So how? First, you need to know the name of the computer which hosts the printer, and the name of the printer to be shared.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Sitting at the host computer: The procedure is the same for Vista and XP</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Start &gt; My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Computer Name tab &gt; Change button. Write down the name that you see here because this is the computer name.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Start &gt; Settings &gt; Printers and Faxes &gt; Right click on the printer to be shared &gt; Properties &gt; Sharing tab. Write down the name that you see here because this is the printer name.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
OK. Now sit in front of the Vista 64 computer:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Printers &gt; Add printer &gt; Add a local printer &gt; Click on ‘Create a new port’ &gt; ‘Local Port’ &gt; ‘Next’.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The port name will look like this: \\Computer name\printer name</p>
<p>
So enter the names already retrieved, ensuring that you use the same format, then click ‘OK’.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At this point, you will be presented with the ‘Add New Hardware’ process. You can either select the make and model of your printer from the lists or insert your printer installation disk if you can’t find yours. The printer will be added, and you should be
 able to print a test page.</p>

            I have a very similar problem, except the Host computer is Vista running 32-bit and the computer I want to print from is Windows 7 with 64 (&amp;32).&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>So just for yucks, I tried your solution. When, on the Windows &amp; computer, I entered the port name using the format you suggested, I was stopped with "Access Denied".</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, I'm trying to hook up with an HP Photosmart 309a series. It is connected by ethernet to the Vista computer, which in turn, is connected to the wireless network. Eventually, I can convert the HP Photosmart to wireless connectivity to the whole
 network, but that will be quite the project, and I was hoping this avenue would be quicker.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you help me?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks-</div>

    <title>Signature Edition Lenovo yoga900 hiDPI scalling issue after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaboz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signature Edition Lenovo yoga900 hiDPI scalling issue after re-installing win. &#40;3200&#42;1800 res. makes icons and text tiny in some programs that used to work perfectly on the same res. before the reset&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just got my new Yoga 900(13.3') signature edition with windows 10 home a few days ago and was very happy with it.<br />
Then I made a clean windows installation and upgraded to windows 10 pro<br />
<strong>.....The problem.....</strong><br />
Before re-installing windows, <strong>I had no hiDPI problems, even with programs like eclipse</strong> (java programming) the icons were big and everything was perfect.<br />
After the resetting windows and upgrading to Pro edition, all sorts of hiDpi and scalling problems broke loose and programs like eclipse are practically unusable now (very small text and icons)<br />
Please don't tell me to just lower the resolution, because I know there is a way to work with the high res. (Ive seen it when I just received the laptop)<br />
<strong>....Attempted solutions.....</strong><br />
1- re-installing windows again (settings--&gt;update &amp; security--&gt;restore--&gt;reset computer)<br />
2- searching for a restore point that dates back to when i first received the laptop<br />
3- installing media tool from windows website (a suggestion by a microsoft tech support, problem persisted though)<br />
4- downloading all the drivers from lenovo website<br />
5- going to the device manager and updating all the drivers one by one (right click every device--&gt;update driver)<br />
6- downloaded io driver booster, and let it download and install all the drivers<br />
7- I downloaded all the latest windows updates until it told me there are no new updates after 2 restarts<br />
8- This thread suggests the problem is in the manufacturer (lenovo), I don't know if it's right though:<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/corel-draw-x6-compatibility-with-windows-10/3daeae5a-3113-4e2d-afc2-65c22c6e5bd0<br />
9- I searched all yoga900 forums for an answer to the problem</p>
<p>10- I tried the no-hidpi option in the compatibility properties of the program</p>
<p>11- The display size (first option in display settings) is and was always set to 250%, I also tried to play around with the other options in Advanced sizing of text, title bars, icons...etc but when I changed them everything looked wrong.</p>
<p><strong>.</strong><strong>......</strong><strong>Conclusion </strong><strong>and
</strong><strong>question</strong><strong>...........</strong><br />
Now I know for sure that there's a solution to this problem, because when i first received the laptop it was working fine, the solution now has to be one of:<br />
A) a way to revert back to the state I first received the laptop (I looked for the option to reset to factory settings but did not find it on this machine)<br />
B) The secret the techs used to make the laptop work well on hiDpi with old programs, might that be a driver, a fix, a windows update...etc</p>

<strong>Intel auto detect tool</strong>: 15.xxx (didn't attempt installation since it looks like a really old version)</p>

<p>I'm curious, how where you able to restore factory defaults? when I pressed the novo button and chose restore, it got me the windows blue troubleshoot screen, not the lenovo restore program</p>

<p>Hey there Nath thanks for keeping in touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after the reset then the next step would be to look into hardware, what is the console connected to power supply wise? Is there any external hdds attached to the console? Let us know so we can determine the best course of action towards
 a resolution.</p>

<p>Hey there Nathhack!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying fix this strange problem.
</p>
<p>I would say that if both resets on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to reset your console to factory defaults on Xbox One</a>,. didn't help, it might be some kind of hardware issue.
</p>
<p>If it doesn't bother you or affect gameplay, I wouldn't worry so much about it, but if you want to ahead and have that repaired by either visiting
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device support </a>or contact <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
customer support </a>and have an agent help you out with that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I would suggest you make sure the drivers for LAN (Ethernet/Wireless Adapters) and your video card are updated.</p>
<p>Also, you might want to make sure the components within the system unit if you are using a desktop tower are seated properly such as the memory modules and video card. Also, make sure the display adapter is connected properly.</p>
<p>You should also check the manufacturers website for updated BIOS and Chipset drivers.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</p>
