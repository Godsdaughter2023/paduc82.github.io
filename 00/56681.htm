<h2>             Urgent.. system registry file has been corrupted.. windows won&#39;t start</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is George who just encountered a problem with my Sony Vaio Laptop last night. My top priority is to find the graduate application essay which is in the&nbsp; Desktop of the computer.</p>
<p>The computer has been having problems with a google redirect virus which any of the virus scanning programs couldn't detect, and last night the computer shut itself down after a power shortage and hasn't been able to start the windows program.</p>
<p>The computer will boot, but it will directly prompt me with a message of choosing three operating systems to start which are Recovery Console,"do not select this[debugger enabled], and Windows xp home edition.</p>
<p>Nothing from the windows advanced options menu would work even the safe mode. I have been fooling around in the recovery mode, and i have reasons to believe that the system registry is corrupted for the windows.</p>
<p>i have trie the method offered at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;30754</p>
How to recover from a corrupted registry that prevents Windows XP from starting
<div>This article was previously published under Q307545</div>
<p><br />
, but I did not have a windows start up cd, so i couldn't continue.</p>
<p>I'm looking for some help from the world wide web.</p>
<p>My graduate applications are due less than a week and help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sincerely</p>

<p>Please tell us the exact message you see.</p>
<p>Many times, XP will deliver a message about some problem reading the registry or something is corrupt, when that is not really the case at all.</p>
<p>You can spend much time with KB307545, but I have never used it to fix any problem - it is usually frustrating waste of time.</p>
<p>If you are seeing message like this:</p>
<p><span>Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:</span></p>
<p><span>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM</span></p>
<p><span>...and then use something like Google to look for help, KB307545 is close to the first thing to come up in the search results, therfore it must be the right answer. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That is too bad since so many people start to try to implement KB307545 or someone will recommend it when the issue has nothing to do with a corrupted registry. &nbsp;It is the first thing to come up in a Google search
 though, but if you have ever actually successfully resolved or helped someone successfully resolve the error a few hundred times (or even once) or actually recreated the error on a system on purpose to actually see the error message and never use KB307545
 to fix it, you would know that is not the best answer.</span></p>
<p><span>If you really did corrupt your registry by hand, KB307545 might be a good idea, but it is never the first thing to do after a power interruption unless you want to waste a lot of time and end up having to reinstall
 your XP from scratch.</span></p>
<p>Since you had some power interruption that can cause some corruption in the file system and XP can't read or find the files it needs to start properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp;(this includes plug pulling, power buttons and battery removal).</p>
<p>These can cause corruption in the file system which must be fixed before you do anything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>If any of those events have occurred (or even if they have not occurred), you should verify&nbsp;the integrity of your file system before doing anything else (especially "trying" things).</p>
<p>It makes zero sense to start trying to start trying to edit or copy files around on a hard disk that has a corrupted&nbsp;file system so this must be fixed first using the XP chkdsk program, and running chkdsk on your&nbsp;drives may resolve your issue entirely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</p>
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>

<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt.</p>
<p>First verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to
 be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

<p>If you want, you could also make another kind of bootable CD and usually you will be able to just copy your important files to a USB thumb drive and then to another system.</p>
<p>Here is one idea:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Make yourself a Hiren's BootCD which you can download from here:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download.html</a></p>
<p>
On the left, click Download, scroll down to the bottom, choose the latest version&nbsp;The download link is a little hard to see and they change the location of the download link sometimes, so you may have to look around for it. &nbsp;Today, it is at the bottom of the
 page above the drop down list for older versions and&nbsp;looks something like this:</p>
<p>
<strong>Hirens.BootCD.13.0.zip</strong></p>
<p>
Watch out for other links on the page to other kinds of downloads for other kinds of CDs - be sure you end up downloading the latest version which today is a file called:</p>
<p>
<strong>Hirens.BootCD.13.0.zip</strong></p>
<p>
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete. &nbsp;Then unzip the download to extract the&nbsp;Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.</p>
<p>
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD. &nbsp;You&nbsp;have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.</p>
<p>
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it. &nbsp;The BurnToCD.cmd will use the extracted&nbsp;BurnCDCC.exe file to burn the .ISO file to a blank CD using your existing CD burner. &nbsp;You can also use your own CD burning software&nbsp;as
 long as your software is capable of creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file. &nbsp;Most modern CD burning programs can create&nbsp;bootable CDs from an .ISO image. &nbsp;Creating a bootable CD from an ISO image is not the same as just burning the file to a CD.</p>
<p>
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>

<p>
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
These adjustments are &nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.</p>
<p>
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options. &nbsp;Choose the Mini XP option. &nbsp;Then it will appear that Windows is&nbsp;being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already&nbsp;used
 to using.</p>
<p>
Using the Mini XP, you can access the Internet, maneuver around your system, search for files, copy files, replace files, run various scans&nbsp;for malicious software, edit text files (like the c:\boot.ini) etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
There are dozens of free and useful tools included in the CD that can be used to repair your system or copy your important personal files&nbsp;to another device (like a USB device or external drive) in the event that you just give up and decide to reinstall your
 XP (hopefully you&nbsp;will not make that decision).</p>

            Hi Gapsos, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I'd try signing out of your Microsoft account, rebooting, then signing back in.
<br />
<br />If it's an app that you're signed into, try restarting the app, or resetting it in the Apps &amp; features part of the Settings app.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you could post a screenshot of the page you're seeing that you're not signed in.
<br />
<br />Lastly, see if the Microsoft Accounts troubleshooter can fix the issue:

<h2>            Blurred thumbnails in Movie Maker</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Movie Maker issues

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Movie Maker are you using ? </b></div>
<div>15.4.3538.0513</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
Hi - I believe I am running the most recent version of Windows Movie Maker (no Help/About in software?). I just loaded up the latest patch, prompted by Windows Update.<br />
<br />
I am launching a new project. I have uploaded 38 photos to my project. In the work area and the preview pane, the thumbnails are all blurred at the edges and essentially corrupted (the jpg's are fine). The thumbnails sharpen temporarily when I mouse-over them,
 but blur again almost immediately. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have added a couple of credit panes, and the text is blurred to unreadable as well. It is extremely difficult to even see the photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried changing thumbnail size; same effect. The start/stop controls under the
 preview windows are similarly blurred, as is the thumbnail size control&nbsp;at the bottom the work area. Basically, text and tools button and jpgs are all corrupted below the toolbar.
<br />
<br />
I created a video in 2010, using the same techniques and photos of similar resolution, and no problem.&nbsp;When I load that video now, I get the same edge-blur effect. (I have already exported that&nbsp;file, so I don't really care.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If I had to guess (I hope I'm wrong), this looks a lot like a&nbsp;VGA driver issue. I run a Radeon HD6850, Catalyst 12.1 drivers. My desktop resolution is 1920x1080x60. Resolution is an issue? The blurred images appear to 'bleed' at the frame edges, and the text
 is corrupted.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
specs: W7 Ult 32bit SP1, Intel q9550, 4 gb RAM.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is making me crazy. Can you help? Happy to install and reinstall if that's what it takes....<br />
<br />
Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            This blurring problem may be caused by having "Morphological filtering" anti-aliasing enabled in your AMD Control Center.<br />
<br />
Can you please try unchecking the "Morphological filtering" checkbox under the 3D or Gaming options of your AMD Catalyst Control Center or AMD VISION Engine Control Center? Restart Movie Maker after unchecking and applying the changes to the AMD control center.<br />

<p><span>Hi Vincy007 – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
</span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
ERROR</span></strong><span>: An unauthorized change has been made to Windows.<br />
or An unauthorized change was made to your license. <br />
</span><span><br />
<strong>Issue:</strong> Description. <br />
You experience this since one of the core Windows® files has been damaged, <br />
corrupted or tampered. Windows® 7 (or Windows Vista®) sees this as an attack to bypass the<br />
Licensing security. <br />
<br />

<br />
<strong><span>Resolution: </span></strong><span>Steps that may work.<br />
<strong>Resolution 1.</strong> Do a System Restore; see this Windows® 7 page for<br />

<br />
<strong>*Please note:</strong> The KB articles may have steps for Windows Vista®<br />
however, please keep in mind that what fix steps applies for Windows Vista®<br />
also applies to Windows® 7. Windows Vista® and Windows® 7 are identical,<br />
some new improvements and new features have been introduced in Windows® 7. <br />

            Are you connected to the Internet? Because you need to be in order to setup a PIN.
<br />
<br />Give this a try:
<br />Delete NGC folder and add a new PIN code
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC.
<br />In NGC folder delete all the files. To do so you must be logged as Administrator.
<br />delete the temp folder within the NGC folder
<br />Now go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in Options.
<br />Click Add a PIN and add a new PIN code for your account.
<br />
<br />Now the PIN login should be working again.
<br />
<br />Switch to local account and add a PIN code
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />try to switch to local account, and the add a PIN code. Here’s how to do that:
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Accounts and locate your account.
<br />Click Sign in with a Local Account instead.
<br />Follow the instructions to set up a local account.
<br />Sign out and sign in with your local account.
<br />Now add a PIN code.
<br />After you’ve added your PIN code you need to locate your account under the Accounts section in Settings.
<br />Choose Sign in with a Microsoft Account instead.
<br />
<br />That’s it, PIN login should be working now for your account

            Jim, this part of what troubleshooting is all about. 
<br />
<br />The only other option I can recommend you try is a repair upgrade:

<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:

    <title>&#34;Product Key Blocked but MGADiag Validation Code 0&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yeah its me  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Product Key Blocked but MGADiag Validation Code 0&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; Can anyone from Microsoft or HP tell me how to fix these issues. <br />
<br />
<br />
--&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows security Updates fail over 99 % of the time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>----IE will not uninstall or reinstall or allow to revert to older versions</p>
<p>
</p><p>----In place installation was attempted by Microsoft level 2 support.&nbsp; This was attempted on several different occasions by different level 2 support&nbsp;Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;These attempts &nbsp;failed at 18%; or&nbsp;therefor wouldn't complete.&nbsp; I tend to believe Custom&nbsp;Installation
 would also fail.&nbsp; I also believe a destructive restore would also fail.&nbsp; I was told that product key was in fact Blocked by Microsoft and HP.&nbsp; Microsoft says their KIT program confirmed this.&nbsp; Also I confirmed it that is true by entering SLUI 4 in start run.&nbsp;
 Then box of ACTIVATION pops up.&nbsp; I call 800 number and enter long number on phone automated system it also says blocked.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
---&nbsp; HP and Microsoft each claim its the others responsibility as to reasons for why Product Key is blocked.&nbsp; I say each is&nbsp; equally responsible for reasons why its blocked.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
---&nbsp; The current Anti virus software is not interfering as it was turned off and removed reinstalled stalled by them remote access by Internet Security Software.&nbsp; They also purported that after reviewing their software there is no issues present.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is BS that both Microsoft and HP are refusing to acknowledge that the product key is probably off because of the WINDOWS 10 NONSENSE.&nbsp;&nbsp; That or else its something to do with past Security updates which were installed that is causing the problem.&nbsp;
 I am at a loss for a solution.&nbsp; As because if my product key is currently blocked then its safe to assume that if I did attempt DESTRUCTIVE SYSTEM RESTORE there would be an even greater problem.&nbsp; I would be asked to enter my product key at restart of&nbsp; WINDOWS
 after completion of Destructive System Restore.&nbsp; And because the said current blocked product key is the same product key.&nbsp; Its&nbsp;a reasonable assumption that I wouldn't be able to turn on Windows so I would be blocked or locked completely out of being able
 to turn on Windows.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
Please refer to a different thread that I had started here.&nbsp; Realize that this is an attempt to get answers to how to fix this NONSENSE.&nbsp; I don't believe that I caused this as if I did then I would have been able to fix it on my end.&nbsp; A product key doesn't
 just become blocked someone HP or Microsoft is AWARE of how this came to be.&nbsp; I was told that I CANT UPDATE to WIN 10 until I resolve the Windows issues currently on this computer.&nbsp; The Hidden ADM ACCOUNT doesn't even allow me to update windows security updates.&nbsp;
 Which also tells me that the whole damn computer is blocked.&nbsp; I have not changed any settings on this computer which would have resulted in this NONSENSE.&nbsp; I noticed that there are a lot of others who have experienced this MYSTERIOUS ****.&nbsp; Where their own
 computers product keys become blocked.&nbsp; Surely Microsoft and HP should know or have a better understanding of why their PRODUCTS stop functioning.&nbsp; Specifically a product key which becomes blocked.&nbsp;&nbsp; A product key does not just block itself.&nbsp;
<br />

=====================================<br />
<br />
As stated an In place installation by Microsoft Tech Support level 2 does not successfully complete.&nbsp; Start menu run SLUI 4 provides 9 groups of numbers with 6 numbers in each group.&nbsp; I call 800 number and then enter that long series of numbers for Windows
 activation.&nbsp; It says product key is blocked.&nbsp; Microsoft Tech Support indicated over the phone that Product key is blocked using KIT program.&nbsp; They will not disclose when as it the exact date or time the said product key for this operating system became known
 to be blocked.&nbsp; I find this SUSPICIOUS because how would they know its blocked if they don't know when it became blocked?&nbsp; Equally as true HP doesn't seem to acknowledge a blocked product key on this computer.&nbsp; As they stated that this is MICROSOFTS issue
 to resolve.&nbsp; I am not very appreciative of each telling me its the others fault.&nbsp; I have owned 2 other computers in my past.&nbsp; An IBM APTIVA early 2000 it never had experienced a blocked product key.&nbsp; As well an EMACHINES computer and it never had a blocked
 product key.&nbsp; Used each computer for 6 years and no issues.&nbsp; Other then the IBM APTIVA had a defective hard drive I replaced per warranty Best Buy.&nbsp; I have read a significant number of Blocked product keys per Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; Some even purported that
 there may be a product key which may have been assigned same product key to multiple devices as&nbsp;perhaps done by MANUFACTORER.&nbsp; I believe my product key should be my own and not assigned to other computers.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello, <br />

What I mean by product key is this.&nbsp; If MICROSOFT finds that a product key is being used by multiple users then blocks them.&nbsp; Why should I have to suffer because I purchased a legitimate copy preinstalled on this WIN 7 Home Premium?&nbsp; Why would then just block
 product key?&nbsp; Why wouldn't they note the time date and reasons for blocking the said product key?&nbsp; Something sounds FISHY to me when companies cant even provide information as to the 5 W's.&nbsp; Who what when where why and how?&nbsp;&nbsp; What they just randomly pulled
 some product key out of thin air and decided to block it regardless?&nbsp; I am not buying that HOCUS POCUS nonsense.&nbsp; Someone knows something about the reasons as to how this became known to be blocked.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Cant Do in place installation by way of Microsoft level 2 tech support remote access.&nbsp; Installation fails after 18 % or shortly there after.
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Unable to add/ remove install or uninstall IE 11. Or revert to older IE versions.&nbsp; Should be able to do any of the following choices regarding these said actions.
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Unable to receive and install Windows Security Updates.&nbsp; Most fail very few if any install successfully.&nbsp; There is a long lengthy list of failed updates.
<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; HP refuses to allow me to use advance tech support their end per OUT OF WARRANTY stated by them.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Microsoft Refuses to provide 5 W's Who what when where Why and how.&nbsp; This said product key became blocked in first place.
<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp; Anti Virus Security Purports that there are NO ISSUES on computer.&nbsp; As they have reviewed said logs through Scans found nothing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
7. Microsoft Security ESSENTIALS scan done by level 2 Microsoft found Zero Issues on this computer.
<br />
<br />
8. Malware Bytes Found Zero Issues on computer<br />
<br />
9. Spybot Search Destroy found ZERO issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>10.&nbsp; Check disk and SFC scannow found Zero Issues.&nbsp; <br />
<br />

            Hello,&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I thankyou for taking a look at these said concerns.&nbsp; As you should be aware that in the past I was here with some similar dicussions.&nbsp; Recently I was personally told by Microsoft and HP that my PRODUCT KEY was in fact BLOCKED.&nbsp; That I had a blocked product
 key.&nbsp; However neither elected to tell me how its blocked.&nbsp; Why it became blocked.&nbsp; Or when it was actually blocked.&nbsp; They didn't tell me who blocked it and why?&nbsp; Which got me even more suspicious to thinking that the fact of the past issues and current issues
 is all related.&nbsp; Here is how this is so.&nbsp; First off HP and Microsoft are aware or should be aware of whether or how a PRODUCT KEY is blocked.&nbsp; I don't believe this story that no ones knows that its blocked how it became blocked.&nbsp; IF the computer does not validate
 at the said URL you provided then what is preventing it from validating?&nbsp; Cant emphasize it more easier then to say its either HP or Microsoft.&nbsp; I didn't make any changes to this computer which would have resulted in PRODUCT KEY mysteriously blocking itself
 or not being validated.&nbsp; Hence if I use to get Windows Security Updates and they would install, I use to be able to uninstall and reinstall IE when it wasn't working right,&nbsp; I use to be able to do in place windows installations.&nbsp; What happened how does it
 mysteriously turn itself off?&nbsp; Specifically when all said programs related to MICROSOFT WINDOWS 7 and how it functions.&nbsp; Conclusion A blocked product key as purported by MICROSOFT will cause all of these said symptoms.&nbsp; I was unaware that I had a blocked product
 key when I had posted past concerns pertaining to Failed Windows Updates.&nbsp; Please review past postings and consider this newer posting as related.&nbsp; I truly believe that the Product Key is blocked which is the PRIMARY ISSUES which needs to resolve all of this
 HOCUS POCUS NONSENSE.&nbsp; <br />

I hear that thanks for sharing what you experienced.&nbsp; As there appears to be lots of people with PRODUCT KEYS that are mysteriously turned off or BLOCKED.&nbsp; Enough of this nonsense BS.&nbsp; They know when it was blocked, what time date etc.&nbsp; They even know how it
 was blocked.&nbsp; I do not buy the excuses people give me unless it can reasonably explain away the questions I have asked.&nbsp; That is why I am revisiting this said issues until someone talks to MICROSOFT and HP to get them to turn my product key back on.&nbsp; I didn't
 block it but they seem to know its blocked.&nbsp; Well how did it become blocked, who&nbsp; blocked it, why was it blocked.&nbsp; They should be able to answer these Questions.&nbsp;

    <title>Delete function and new emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> desertbunny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete function and new emails</h2>
                    <p>I purchased my Surface RT in January of 2014.&nbsp; It has worked great until recently.&nbsp; Shortly after deleting some 900 pieces of junk mail and trash (delete all), the delete function in email began to slow down and take an unusually long time to delete even
 a single email.&nbsp; Multiple emails marked for deletion take even longer.&nbsp; Also, when I click on a new email, I get the circling dots for a short time before I can see the new email.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have an email account with COX.net which I access on the Surface, but that
 email is working normally. The problem is with Hotmail only.&nbsp; I took my Surface to the Microsoft store and was told there was nothing they could do.&nbsp; (I had already run a scan, checked disk space, and refreshed.)&nbsp; Anyone ever have this problem?&nbsp; Any suggestions
 how to restore to its previous performance?</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition keeps freezing then exiting in game</h2>
                    Whenever I start playing Minecraft, I'm in a world and I'm playing it, then usually after a while, it freezes then exits the game by itself. I really hate when it does that because it makes me revert to the last save. Only rarely does it save before it
 freezes.

    <title>File Associations, Photoshop Elements 14 and jpg files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve scarlett  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Associations, Photoshop Elements 14 and jpg files</h2>
                    <p>I've done a cursory search through previous questions and can't find anything that specifically mentions the issue I have and more importantly, fixes it. Apologies if it's out there somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently rebuilt my laptop, reinstalling Windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Version: 1803</p>
<p>OS Build: 17134.345</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also installed Photoshop Elements 14 (PSE14) amongst other programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now cannot associate a .jpg file with PSE14 as the default application. I have been through the regular checks, going through
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Default Programs &gt; Set Your Default Programs &gt; Choose Default Apps By File Type</p>
<p>
</p><p>After finding a jpg file in the types&nbsp;list, I notice that the Windows 10 program 'Photos' is the default app, I then click on the file type which brings up a dialogue showing a list of programs I can associate jpg files with. However, when I click on PSE14,
 the dialogue closes and nothing changes. I am left with Photos as the jpg editor.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb25972a-53b3-4f6e-82c1-a8ea807fbc73?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb25972a-53b3-4f6e-82c1-a8ea807fbc73?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PSE14 is the default App for .amp&nbsp;and .ams&nbsp;files among many others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second method I've used is to right-click the file, and select, Open With. If I just select PSE14 it will open it in&nbsp;the correct program but the next time I want to edit a .jpg file and double click&nbsp;it it&nbsp;will open in Photos. Instead of opening it with
 PSE14, I select the 'Choose Another App' option which, once again, opens a dialogue. PSE14 is also on this new dialogue which I then selected, however, there is also a checkbox at the bottom&nbsp; of the dialogue with text that states, "Always Use This App to open
 .jpg Files", which I of course select and then click 'OK'. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing changes! The next time I double-click on a .jpg file it opens in Photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driving me nuts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be fixed, registry maybe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            My apologies. This is one of the bugs which has been caused by new Windows update.
<br />
<br />Microsoft is well aware of this issue and has been working to fix this issue. I think next build may have this fix in place.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, I would recommend that you submit this issue as a feedback to Windows team through Feedback Hub
<br />

<br />Submit your feedback

            Hi Steve, there is nothing you can currently do . . .
<br />
<br />Setting File Associations in Windows 10 is now impossible, a lot of users are reporting this at the moment, this seems to be a bug in Windows 10 since the last update.
<br />
<br />Microsoft are working hard to patch the bugs in the last couple of updates, hopefully this is one of the bugs they are working on
<br />
<br />Please provide feedback to the Windows Developers on this bug, press Windows Key + F to open the Feedback Hub, the more users that report this, the quicker it will be resolved . . .       
        </p>

    <title>Touchpad Driver Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariacharlotte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchpad Driver Missing</h2>
                    <p>I've recently fixed my Acer Aspire E5-511 computer by reinstalling windows 10 through a USB, the details are in this post</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/unable-to-perfrom-reset-getting-error-code-as/a15d5394-c70b-46c2-9945-a779f01be14e</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since reinstalled windows 10 and everything works fine (so far), however, the hardware for the touchpad is missing, as shown here
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a5c7025-9c75-49a3-844d-71d7a45ebead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a5c7025-9c75-49a3-844d-71d7a45ebead" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to download both drivers on the ACER website, and they both say that they have successfully run, but this hasn't changed this. I've also tried running them in compatibility mode, but no luck there either. The mouse that you can see here is one
 that I have plugged in that is working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a second issue that may potentially have something to do with it? It says that there is a missing driver for:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/105a2815-b602-40e5-9b3f-44cdcc66ede2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/105a2815-b602-40e5-9b3f-44cdcc66ede2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the new driver for the chipset, and have also run this in compatibility mode. Again, no change here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would really appreciate help as I'm a poor student that desperately needs her laptop for writing a dissertation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Photo App fails to open and JPEGs Invalid Value for egistry - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Photo App fails to open and JPEGs Invalid Value for egistry</h2>
                    <p>We are having a problem with Windows 10 Photos. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Myself and my partner share a PC. On my account the Photo's app opens fine and I can open pictures on that app without issue. When we attempt to do the same on my partner's logon:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; The app fails to open, no errors, it is just unresponsive</p>
<p>&gt; If we try to open an image we receive an error box essentially stating 'invalid value for registry'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling Photo using the Powershell function and reinstalling, but the situation remains the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know where to go now?</p>

<h2>            Windows cannot verify the digital signature for this file.</h2>
                    <p>Everytime I try launching a program that needs administrator rights (like cmd(with admin, or msconfig) I get the following error :</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This file doesn't have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the default programs control panel.</em></p>
<p>

</p><p>When <strong>I log-in with safe mode on , everything works perfectly fine.</strong> I felt like there some fishy program or some startup service causing this, so I uninstalled my antivirus and also disabled almost all startup programs except microsoft services.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We will help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does the issue persist when launching all programs or a program in particular?</span></li><li><span>Did you perform divide and conquer rule?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Divide and Conquer rule is nothing but determining which program or an application is causing the issue on your PC. This can be done by enabling and disabling some of the applications or programs to determine the cause of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot on the device </span>and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting your system in <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></span></strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to <strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong> for 8/8.1 article from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: </span>Start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</span></strong>from the link above.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write back to us with the answers to the above questions for further assistance. Your reply is important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<h3> isidoreh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype can&#39;t find my camera device</h2>
                    <p>I use a Surface Studio, so I know the hardware is new enough to support Skype (version 12.1815.210.0).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the settings under Video, it says that the device can't be found.&nbsp; I've checked in the OS settings to make sure the camera can be accessed by Skype.&nbsp; I've also gone into my anti-virus software (AVG), that Skype is allowed access through the firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I can't figure out why the program is not recognizing my camera.&nbsp; I've tried different things and have restarted several times.</p>

            Hello  ISIDOREH<br /><br />I'm a fellow Community member here to help. I'm sorry you're experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is very frustrating.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the newest version of Skype is still under development and is lacking many of the features and functionality of the classic version of Skype. The issue you describe is a known bug.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected that in the near future Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype that will add features and functionality back to the program.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to Classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br />I hope that this is helpful to you. Please let me know if I can offer any further assi

    <title>Not saving sent messages for Squirrelmail IMAP account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e_k2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not saving sent messages for Squirrelmail IMAP account</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 7 computer. &nbsp;I installed WLM on it recently. &nbsp;I have 3 email accounts on the WLM. &nbsp;One is a POP3 and the other 2 are IMAPs. &nbsp;The POP3 and one IMAP is working as it should. &nbsp;However, my other IMAP does not save the sent messages. &nbsp;This particular
 account is a squirrelmail account. &nbsp;I am receiving all mail and my emails are being sent, but they are not showing up in sent mail. &nbsp;All options are checked to save sent mail. &nbsp;The option to store special folders on the server is also checked for this account.
 &nbsp;Also, if I log into the actual squirrelmail website, messages that I have sent through WLM are not showing up in the sent folder on the squirrelmail site either. &nbsp;This is a huge inconvenience and problem. &nbsp;I have uninstalled and installed WLM several times
 with no luck in solving this problem. &nbsp;Any help in this matter would be much appreciated!!!!

            <p><strong>Sent email not showing up in Windows Live Mail.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I can add to this discussion.</p>
<p>My sent emails do not show up in the “Sent” folder</p>
<p>I’m running WLM on my two Windows 7 computers. I’m using email through Bluehost.com (I don’t know if that matters).</p>
<p>I set up my email account and (most) everything seems to work IF in don’t select a Root Folder path in the IMAP tab of the properties.</p>
<p>This setting goes against other posts saying that the word INBOX has to be there for everything to work. I tried adding INBOX but then when the folders are refreshed, I can’t see the actual Inbox, just sub folders. I have been running WLM without the INBOX
 text missing for years anyway and everything had worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after much playing around with the Special Folders section of the IMAP tab, I changed the
</p>
<p>Special folders to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Sent Items path:</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>inbox.sent</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drafts path:</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>inbox.Drafts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deleted Items path:</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>Trash</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junk path: </strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>inbox.junk</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not sure why but I believe the Trash path had always worked fine.</p>
<p>Now when I send an email, the sent copy goes to my sent folder! I can even view mail sent from my PC on my iphone!</p>
<p>I suspect there is a code error in WLM that didn’t handle this path correctly but now it does not matter to me because I have a work around!</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps someone.</p>
<p>Please comment with results.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>Yes it does! There are several different IMAP implementations, and an almost infinite variety of settings that the sysadmins can apply at the server, so what works for one will not necessarily work for another. The OP in this thread was using Squirrelmail
 - is that what Bluehost uses? </p>

<h2>            WER Windows Error Reporting&#58; Can I delete this file&#63;  Its 13 gbs&#33;</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 on a 30gb SSD and its filling up with this gargantious file (WER). &nbsp;Its 13 gbs. &nbsp;I don't need Error Reporting and will be going through Services.msc and disabling everything not needed (or setting to Manual if unsure). &nbsp;So I was wondering
 if I can delete the ReportQueue folder. &nbsp;

            <p><span><span>You can use cCleaner to manage the size of the Windows Error Reporting file. Check the box before
<strong>Windows Error Reporting</strong> in the Windows list you see when you open cCleaner.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend you leave the Service default settings as they are. Changing the defaults leads to things not working as they should.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A better programme than Disk CleanUp is cCleaner. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult
 to resolve system errors.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.ccleaner.com/download</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><span>When updating always remember to click the
<strong>No thanks</strong></span><span> option to decline the option to upgrade to Professional if you wish to remain with the freeware version.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you open cCleaner you will see four large icons to the left of the window. These are Cleaner, Registry, Tools, and Options. For routine maintenance you would normally access Cleaner
 (this is not the Registry Cleaner mentioned later). When using for the first time you can just accept the default settings.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some comments on settings. On my computer I do not have boxes before Saved Passwords selected. In a less secure environment you might check this option and set cCleaner to automatically
 run on starting the computer. You may also not want to check boxes before Start Menu Shortcuts, Desktop Shortcuts and Autocomplete Form History. You need to check the boxes to suit your requirements. Getting options wrong first time causes irritants not disasters.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The second icon you see when you open cCleaner is Registry. One reservation many experienced users have regarding cCleaner is that it comes with a Registry Cleaner. This tool should not
 be used. Using a Registry Cleaner, however good it is, provides negligible benefits and there is always the risk of creating insoluble system errors, which can only be resolved by reinstalling the operating system and all that entails. You avoid any possible
 problems by not clicking on the Registry icon.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The third icon you see when you open cCleaner is Tools. If you click on this icon it gives you access to further routine maintenance options. The first two tools are Uninstall and Startup.
 I do not use these Tools, preferring to use other software options. The third Tool is System Restore, which is covered in the next paragraph. The fourth tool is Drive Wiper and you will find comments on this Tool later</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Removing System Restore points can be important if you have limited free disk space. The ability to remove them is one of the Tools options. You can selectively remove those created at
 less important times. This makes it easier to hold restore points for longer periods without retaining large unwanted files, which the inflexible approach adopted by Disk CleanUp fails to offer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You cannot remove the latest restore point using Disk CleanUp or cCleaner. If the latest restore point contains malware you can turn off and then turn system restore back on. This has
 the disadvantage that all restore points are removed when you may wish to retain older restore points that are not infected. The way to get round this problem is to create a new restore point when you are satisfied your computer is free of malware and then
 remove the infected restore point.</span></span></p>

            <p>You've made some great suggestions. &nbsp;I wanted to second your caution to others about registry cleaners. &nbsp;I used the one from Wise. &nbsp;It was a disaster. &nbsp;I was able to use it a few times but noticed no performance changes. &nbsp;Maybe there were other issues it
 improved. &nbsp;But after a few cleans my system wouldn't boot at all. &nbsp;After fruitlessly trying many options I have to re-install. &nbsp;It was the most likely reason for this to happen. &nbsp;The odd thing is this product has gotten some very good reviews online. &nbsp;Maybe
 previous versions were less problematic or maybe it just doesn't interface well with XP. &nbsp;Now I'm trying Win7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding not changing Services.msc settings: &nbsp;I have to disagree here. &nbsp;This was my single biggest performance gain ever. &nbsp;It was night and day. &nbsp;There are so many terrible settings in there to enable others to get into your system - so insecure. &nbsp;One does
 wonder why they would put such settings in by default without a warning when you install. &nbsp;Black Viper and others have great guides. &nbsp;I would recommend for things not obvious (like Secondary Login!) make note of what you change and change maybe just one or
 a few a day to watch the results. &nbsp;Don't be impatient like most of us for anything not sure. &nbsp;And watch for Dependencies. &nbsp;As soon as a program is needed for something else.....be careful and very sure if you disable it. &nbsp;And realize that msconfig is a disaster
 when the same program is also in services.msc. &nbsp;When unchecking a program in msconfig it disables it in services.msc. &nbsp;That is probably not ideal. &nbsp;You want programs available to you when needed, just not running brainlessly in the background when not. &nbsp;Most
 people can halve the number of running programs by being judicious with services.msc. &nbsp;Once you refine your settings in services.msc, export it and back it up. &nbsp;It will be invaluable the next time you re-install. &nbsp;For most of us, checking each setting and
 making a decision individually takes about an hour or 2 if you're being careful. &nbsp;So you don't want to go through that again for each install/re-install. &nbsp;Restoring is misleading....it just restores all the problems you've accumulated. &nbsp;You want to backup
 your data and settings, then re-install fresh. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for managing the size of the WER file: &nbsp;What is a small, workable size? &nbsp;Can 1 gb work? &nbsp;Can I just look at the dates on each file in there to see how long it takes to accumulate to such an enormous size? &nbsp;And if I end up&nbsp; disabling the service is there
 any point in keeping the file? &nbsp;I would think not but please confirm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You make some good points on the advantages of restore points. &nbsp;I will read about this in the future. &nbsp;I'm on a budget with hardware and need to get a newer SSD/M.2 hard drive for the OS and programs and won't have a lot of room due to their cost, especially
 M.2 which is more likely. &nbsp;I use a 1tb for data of course so maybe I could use that for the restore points later.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Regarding not changing Services.msc settings: &nbsp;I have to disagree here.
</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may disagree but&nbsp;your approach is counter-productive. As a general rule you should not change service default settings. Doing so can easily lead to system error and this can more than cancel out the minimal benefit of any gain you think you have achieved..
 I look at many systems every day through these forums and few users now adopt the approach you prefer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way to go is to examine&nbsp;how programmes (applications) load as many are set to load when the computer boots, whereas you can find quite a few that need to load only on demand. Most users have software they only use occasionally. Support security products
 like Spybot S &amp; D and Superantispyware are software that should&nbsp;be looked at. Anything that&nbsp;continuously monitors may not really need to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avoid using software like Soluto, Advanced System Care, Glary Utilities, Conduit etc.,.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>And realize that msconfig is a disaster when the same program is also in services.msc.</strong></em></p>

</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable the item. It is
 a <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 204, 1)">much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using msconfig.</span>

            <p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule you should not change service default settings. Doing so can easily lead to system error and this can more than cancel out the minimal benefit of any gain you think you have achieved..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only wish this concurred with my experience. &nbsp;Changing all those settings was a royal pain! &nbsp;But like I said, the difference in speed was enormous. &nbsp;Keep in mind, I'm using older hardware (dual core 1.8ghz cpu with only 2gb 800mhz DDR2 ram) so someone
 using modern equipment may not notice anything like I did. &nbsp;Also, many websites recommend changing many settings there because they are very insecure by default. &nbsp;Like I said, its best to change just a few at a time or even one at a time, to see if it effects
 anything. &nbsp;If it does, just reset it. Perhaps Windows 8 and 10 have better services.msc settings? &nbsp;Don't know. &nbsp;If this is the case this is most welcomed. &nbsp;I will be trying 8 and 10 soon as official support for 7 has ended and whatever support still available
 is gone in 2020. &nbsp;I used XP for way too long. &nbsp;One does get comfortable with the familiar!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I think many people get in trouble with services.msc when they disable items carelessly, especially when a program has a dependency. &nbsp;So important to see if any other programs rely on the one you want to disable. &nbsp;Or even set to manual. &nbsp;Many guides
 are online. &nbsp;Also, another tip is to just change a few at a time to see the difference. &nbsp;Measuring performance is also good as many things may seem better or worse because of our mood or distractions. &nbsp;But the bottom line is many, many things in Windows run
 automatically when, for most of us, it would be far preferable if they didn't. &nbsp;It takes a while to go through each and every one but after you do, and qualify each one, make sure you export that list (Action, Export List). &nbsp;Also arrange the columns so the
 Name column is on the far right with the Status and Startup type being the only ones showing otherwise your exported list will be all jumbled with no formatting as its in Text format. &nbsp;Just open your exported file to see if its OK. &nbsp;You can also export the
 list sorted differently. &nbsp;Most people are primarily concerned with stuff that starts Automatically, then the stuff that hinders their security. &nbsp;Like Secondary Login and Remote Assistance, etc. &nbsp;If you don't need it, Disable it! &nbsp;They can be huge security
 risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; The way to go is to examine how programms (applications) load as many are set to load when the computer boots, whereas you can find quite a few that need to load only on demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Couldn't agree more. &nbsp;I've gotten very diligent when installing new programs and always check Services.msc and msconfig to see if they're starting automatically even if there is no option in the program. &nbsp;Many do by default. &nbsp;Its like each one wants to be
 on top of the pile. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;Anything that continuously monitors may not really need to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Absolutely. &nbsp;So many people don't realize this. &nbsp;They have it running all the time yet never actually scan their files! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;To identify what loads when you boot use Autoruns (freeware from Microsoft).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks great. &nbsp;I've always thought msconfig lacks "grip" on the system as many programs still run upon startup and may not be in msconfig. &nbsp;Hopefully Autoruns encompasses them all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;The reports are an important source of information when troubleshooting computer problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah...we tend to need things as soon as we delete them! &nbsp;So by not deleting it it may bless my machine with neverending operating bliss! &nbsp;We shall see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you once again for some very useful and informative suggestions. &nbsp;Hopefully many others can benefit &nbsp;as well as these are so foundational in nature yet many users are unaware of them. &nbsp;</p>

            Turned out is was a setting in the software I was using that needed ticking - or rather unticking. Thanks for the advice anyway.

                    Hi, I have 8.1 for a while but I noticed in my defragment box this new volume has been added and it needs defragmenting but, won't defragment. It is titled,&nbsp;\\?\Volume{8c9be4d5-4e4a-4fd7-9f3d-d21f63454b94}\. I put the period there. I searched the internet
 but found absolutely nothing anywhere. I'm thinking virus? I use McAfee. When I went to remove it in the partition control box, it's not listed. I have a PBR Image and WINRETOOLS, I remember setting up in case of a virus, a mirror but do not know exactly how
 to return to factory settings. I have no files to save. Thank you, Nina

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This could be a network drive that was created or established on a previous occasion on the computer. What happens is there is always an identifier assigned to each drive that is connected to the computer. The usual
 location for the identifiers is registry. If the metadata of the drive or the identifier does gets updated, it would notify a drive name such as this. Even when you assign a new drive letter to an unassigned drive on the computer, it would be taken up by this
 drive. This usually won’t happen as the drive would be deleted or disabled when you remove drive from the computer. As the metadata is not updated, it might create such scenarios.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to check for any unassigned drive under Disk Management. Follow the steps:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows+R</strong> to open Run. Type “<strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong>” and hit<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check if there is an unassigned drive. If yes, right click on it and select<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Navigate to <strong>Security</strong> tab and check if the<strong>Object name</strong> matches to the name of the drive<strong>\?\Volume</strong>.. under
<strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong>.</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Apart from this, I would suggest you to update the chipset driver from the manufacturer website of the computer to troubleshoot the issue.</span></span></span></p>
