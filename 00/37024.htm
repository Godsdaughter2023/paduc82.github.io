<h2>            Security update for Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2005 Redistributable Package &#40;KB2538242&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I bought a new HP Envy 15 two weeks ago. The details are given below:</p>
<p>Product Model:&nbsp;&nbsp;F2C67PA &nbsp;</p>
<p>Product Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;HP ENVY 15-j050tx Notebook PC</p>
<p>OS Version: Windows 8.1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The notebook came with Windows 8 and&nbsp;I updated to Windows 8.1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I set the Windows update to "automatically download and install updates"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I manually search for updates using windows update, I get one important update which appears, "Security update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (KB2538242)" I had installed many times and restarted my computer but still the updates
 appear again and again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of my installed updates history.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/451797cc-af80-42a2-9d65-25168c022118" /></p>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf686ad4-a1f1-49b6-a77f-064d4d2499bf" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried to uninstall the Security update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (KB2538242) but could not. The error message screenshot is displayed below.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b9be814-964c-494e-845b-92b19d8931ad" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not on any network resource. I am on my own Notebook PC at home. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I even ran the Windows Diagnostic tool from Microsoft website but that did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I even contacted HP Support Technicians but they could not help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Someone please help me to resolve this error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try running the DISM command and then check if you are able to uninstall the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Right click on Start button and select Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>- Type the following commands and press enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</li><li>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Restart the computer and then check if the update is offered once again. If yes, try to install it and check for Windows update once again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this makes any difference.</p>

</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.</p>

                    I have a seen a feature in searches where I could add a skype meeting to a new calendar event in Outlook for iOS. &nbsp;That feature doesn't show up for me. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to enable it?

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, you should check the version. The version should later than Outlook for IOS version 2.1.3. And you can check whether the button will present after you install Skype for Business App.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, you are supposed to go to in-app support by going to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Help &amp; Feedback</strong>. Out related team will support. When you using the in-app support, it is recommended to turn on notifications for Outlook
 and describe your issue fully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and appreciate for your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards ,</p>
<p>Carlos&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi ImBlue65, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
"Not valid Win32 Application" generally indicates that the file is corrupt. You may try re-downloading and then check if the issue persists.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also run an online malware/virus scan on the computer.</p>

            <p>Hi Fred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>As you have mentioned that “When will this supposedly implemented feature get activate for all accounts?” Are you referring to user accounts or all the child accounts?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once your child has been added to your family with a Microsoft account, you’ll be able to set up appropriate website and app and game restrictions for their age, set PC time limits, and review their recent activity. Their settings will apply to any Windows
 10 device that they sign in to. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information regarding this refer to the below article “Set up family features on Windows 10” and check if it helps.</p>

<p>Me too. When I restart the update it sometimes looks like it is good to go then about 1/4 of the way it stops, keeps trying to load and then the error msg comes up. This is [Mod Removed] because you can't go online unless you get the update, but it won't
 update because of the error!</p>

            <p>If your network contains computers running different versions of Windows, put all computers in the same workgroup<br />
Let's assume that you've already set up the physical network itself. If you haven’t, see
</p>
<p>What you need to set up a home network.</p>
<p>After your network is set up, the next step is to fine-tune it so that all the computers can find each other—something you'll need if you want to share files and printers.</p>
<p>If computers running Windows XP are part of your network, it’s important to use the same workgroup name for all of the computers on your network. This makes it possible for computers running different versions of Windows to detect and access each other.
 Remember that the default workgroup name is not the same in all versions of Windows.</p>
<p>To find or change the workgroup name on a computer running Windows XP<br />
Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.</p>
<p>In System Properties, click the Computer Name tab to see the workgroup name. To change the name, click Change, type the new name in Computer name, and then click OK.</p>
<p>To find the workgroup name on a computer running Windows Vista or Windows 7<br />
Click to open System.</p>
<p>The workgroup name is displayed under Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings.</p>
<p>To change the workgroup name on a computer running Windows Vista or Windows 7<br />
Click to open System.</p>
<p>Under Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings, click Change settings.</p>
<p>In System Properties, on the Computer Name tab, click Change.</p>
<p>In Computer Name/Domain Changes, in Workgroup, type the name of the workgroup you want to use, and then click OK. You will be prompted to restart your computer.</p>
<p>The workgroup name is displayed in the System window</p>
<p>Set the network location to Home or Work<br />
Next, check the network location on all computers running Windows Vista or Windows 7. The network location is a setting that allows Windows to automatically adjust security and other settings based on the type of network that the computer is connected to. For
 more information, see Choosing a network location.</p>
<p>There are four network locations:</p>
<p>Home. The computer is connected to a network that has some level of protection from the Internet (for example, a router and a firewall) and contains known or trusted computers. Most home networks fall into this category. HomeGroup is available on networks
 with the Home network location.</p>
<p>Work. The computer is connected to a network that has some level of protection from the Internet (for example, a router and a firewall) and contains known or trusted computers. Most small business networks fall into this category.</p>
<p>Public. The computer is connected to a network that's available for public use. Examples of public network types are public Internet access networks, such as those found in airports, libraries, and coffee shops.</p>
<p>Domain. The computer is connected to a network that contains an Active Directory domain controller. An example of a domain network is a network at a workplace. This network location is not available as an option and must be set by the domain administrator.</p>
<p>For your home network, make sure that the network location type is set to Home. Here's how to check:</p>
<p>Click to open Network and Sharing Center.</p>
<p>The network location type is displayed below the network name.</p>
<p>The network location type is displayed in Network and Sharing Center</p>
<p>If your network type is public, click Public network, and then select the network location you want.</p>
<p>Warning<br />
You should only change a network to Home or Work if it's a known and trusted network, such as your home or small business network. Changing a network in a public place to Home or Work can be a security risk because it allows other people on the network to see
 your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure your firewall allows file and printer sharing</strong><br />
If you're using Windows Firewall, you can skip this section, because Windows Firewall automatically opens the correct ports for file and printer sharing when you share something or turn on network discovery. (For more information about network discovery, see
What is network discovery?) If you're using another firewall, you must open these ports yourself so that your computer can find other computers and devices that have files or printers that you want to share.
</p>
<p>Turn on additional file and printer sharing options<br />
By changing your network location to Home or Work, network discovery is automatically turned on . You can also turn on these sharing options individually:</p>
<p>Network discovery</p>
<p>File sharing (in Windows 7, this is automatically turned on when you share a file or folder)</p>
<p>Public folder sharing</p>
<p>When you turn on these options, your computer can:</p>
<p>Find other computers and devices on your home network and have other computers find your computer</p>
<p>Share its files and folders</p>
<p>Share its Public folders</p>
<p>Note<br />
Password-protected sharing is a special option that's discussed below.</p>
<p>To turn on network discovery, file and printer sharing, and public folder sharing in Windows 7<br />
Click to open Advanced sharing settings.</p>
<p>Click the chevron&nbsp; to expand the Home or Work network profile.</p>
<p>Select the options to turn on network discovery and file sharing.</p>
<p>Under Public folder sharing, do one of the following:</p>
<p>To share your Public folders so that people on other computers on the network can open files in them but can't create or change files, click Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can open files.</p>
<p>To share your Public folders so that people on other computers on the network can open files in them and also create or change files, click Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can open, change, and create files.</p>
<p>Click Save changes.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>To turn on network discovery, file sharing, public folder sharing, and printer sharing in Windows Vista<br />
Open Network and Sharing Center in Control Panel.</p>
<p>Under Sharing and Discovery, click the chevron&nbsp; next to File sharing to expand the section, click Turn on file sharing, and then click Apply.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Click the chevron&nbsp; next to Public folder sharing to expand the section, and then do one of the following:</p>
<p>To share the Public folder so that people on other computers on the network can open files in it but can't create or change files, click Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can open files, and then click Apply.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator
 password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. This is the default setting.</p>
<p>To share the Public folder so that people on other computers on the network can open files in it and also create or change files, click Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can open, change, and create files, and then click Apply.&nbsp; If you are prompted
 for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Click the chevron&nbsp; next to Printer sharing to expand the section, click Turn on printer sharing, and then click Apply.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Consider using password-protected sharing<br />
Password-protected sharing is a more secure method of sharing files and folders on a network, and it is enabled by default. With password-protected sharing enabled, people on your network can't access shared folders on other computers, including the Public
 folders, unless they have a user name and password on the computer that has the shared folders. They will be prompted to type a user name and password when accessing the shared folders.</p>
<p>For quicker access, you might want to have matching user accounts on all your computers. For example, Dana wants to use password-protected sharing to more securely share files and printers between her two computers. On Computer A, she has the user account
 "Dana22" and the password "Fly43$." If she sets up that same user account and password combination on Computer B, she can more quickly access shared files on Computer B. If Dana changes the password on one of these computers, she must make the same change
 on the other computer.</p>
<p>To turn on password-protected sharing in Windows 7<br />
Click to open Advanced sharing settings.</p>
<p>Click the chevron&nbsp; to expand the Home or Work network profile.</p>
<p>Under Password protected sharing, click Turn on password protected sharing, and then click Save changes.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>To turn on password-protected sharing in Windows Vista<br />
Open Network and Sharing Center in Control Panel.</p>
<p>Under Sharing and Discovery, click the chevron&nbsp; next to Password protected sharing to expand the section, click Turn on password protected sharing, and then click Apply.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password
 or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>To share a file or folder<br />
In any version of Windows, you can right-click a file or folder, click Share, and then select the people or groups you want to share with. You can also assign permissions so that those people can or cannot make changes to the file or folder you shared. For
 more information, see Share files with someone. </p>
<p>Using the network map<br />
The network map in Network and Sharing Center is a graphical view of the computers and devices on your network, showing how they're connected and including any problem areas. This can be helpful for troubleshooting. Before a computer running Windows XP can
 be detected and appear on the network map, you might need to install the Link-Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) protocol on that computer. For more information, go to Network Map Does Not Display Computers Running Windows XP on the Microsoft website.</p>
<p>If the LLTD protocol is installed but computers running Windows XP still don't appear on the network map, firewall settings could be preventing Windows from detecting them. Check the firewall settings and make sure that file and printer sharing is enabled.
 To learn how to do this, if you're using Windows Firewall, open Help and Support and search for "Enable file and printer sharing." Open the Help topic, and then scroll to the end. If you're using another firewall, check the information that came with your
 firewall.<br />

    <title>Halo 2 on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kharrisma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo 2 on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Forum Folke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just picked up Halo 2 (PC) Live from an eBay vendor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems right away.&nbsp; First, there's no product registration sticker inside the case.&nbsp; To all appearances, it's a new, unopened copy; now I'm not so sure.&nbsp; Also, it's the Live version, and I don't really know what that means in practical terms.&nbsp; Does the
 Live version also have the single-player content as well?&nbsp; I don't do online gaming, never have and have no interest in starting now.&nbsp; And anyway, if I understand correctly, the game servers are shut down now anyway... so if there's no single-player content
 on this disc, it's completely useless to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A separate problem is that it won't install at all.&nbsp; First I get the warning box that says this game might not work correctly due to incompatibility issues, which I close.&nbsp; The install program fires up and I get to select what I want to do (play, custom
 install, install dedicated server, or install map editor.) I select customize install, get another warning message which again I close, then select "fully install but don't launch," and it starts whirring and chugging... forever.&nbsp; And ever.&nbsp; Eventually an
 error box pops up stating that "One of the installation steps failed. Do you want to retry?"&nbsp; Problem file in question is "redists\vcredist.msi." Retried, go the same error message after a few minutes&nbsp; Gave up at that point, and a final message pops up, "An
 error occurred while copying files in the background."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess what I'm asking is what is the likelihood that I've got a bogus copy; if it is legit and there's no sticker somehow, does the Live version still have the single-player game in it; and last, has anyone else run into and been able to solve this install
 issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your thoughts!</p>

            Hello I am a fellow community member here to help. This game is tough to get working on Windows 10.

<p>Thanks for the reply, Dadof 5,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my biggest question is: this is a "Live" version of the game... does this "Live" version also include the single-player game, along with online play capability, or is it strictly for online play?&nbsp; I've no use for it at all if it's online only, as
 I have no interest in online gaming, and the game servers are no longer in service anyway (or so I believe I read somewhere).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's single-player too, then I'll pursue trying to get it installed, but if it isn't, then I'm done already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Startup virus has disabled access to Regedit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ac_63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Startup virus has disabled access to Regedit</h2>
                    <p>I have a virus that brings up a webpage automatically at computer boot up. So of course I tried to go into Regedit to remove its autostart functionality. However this virus is smarter than the average bear and it has disabled access to Regedit. The Regedit
 files are still there (they are not 0K size files), but I can not run them either thru the cmd.exe prompt, Windows Run option, or by directly clicking on the files in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover this virus also seems to have disabled the method most commonly used to un-disable access to Regedit. Namely I can not access gpedit.msc. Those files also still exist on the computer (11.7k in size), but when I try to access them, I get an popup
 error dialog box stating "MMC can not open the file &lt;filename&gt;. This may be because the files does not exit, is not an MMC console, or was created by a later version of MMC. This may also be because you do not have sufficient access rights to the file." This
 despite my account having admin rights (it is the sole account on the pc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is in Win 10 btw. The webpage the virus automatically brings up is gangnamgame.net, although I think this is largely irrelevant. The main problem is lost access to gpedit.msc and regedit. At this point I may be forced to do a fresh OS install to regain
 access to those tools. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As per your description of the issue, I would suggest you to try clean boot and check which third party software's are creating this
 issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts
 that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able
 to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior
 if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.

<p>I have a virus that brings up a webpage automatically at computer boot up. So of course I tried to go into Regedit to remove its autostart functionality. However this virus is smarter than the average bear and it has disabled access to Regedit. The Regedit
 files are still there (they are not 0K size files), but I can not run them either thru the cmd.exe prompt, Windows Run option, or by directly clicking on the files in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover this virus also seems to have disabled the method most commonly used to un-disable access to Regedit. Namely I can not access gpedit.msc. Those files also still exist on the computer (11.7k in size), but when I try to access them, I get an popup
 error dialog box stating "MMC can not open the file &lt;filename&gt;. This may be because the files does not exit, is not an MMC console, or was created by a later version of MMC. This may also be because you do not have sufficient access rights to the file." This
 despite my account having admin rights (it is the sole account on the pc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is in Win 10 btw. The webpage the virus automatically brings up is gangnamgame.net, although I think this is largely irrelevant. The main problem is lost access to gpedit.msc and regedit. At this point I may be forced to do a fresh OS install to regain
 access to those tools. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will probably be more to remove than disabling a "run" entry anyway.&nbsp; What you need to do is remove the virus completely.&nbsp; Restart your computer in Safe Mode (with networking):
<strong>Start</strong> -&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Recovery</strong> -&gt; <strong>Advanced startup</strong> [Restart now]; and then
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> -&gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> -&gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong> -&gt; [Restart]; and then, when presented with the
<strong>Startup Settings</strong> menu, press [F5] to start in Safe Mode (with networking).&nbsp; Some laptops may require that you press [Fn]+[F5].<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in Safe Mode, download, install and run <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Malwarebytes Antimalware</a></span> (free; click the download link).&nbsp; If you are unable to download it with your PC, download it on another PC, transfer the Malwarebytes download to a
 USB drive and install it on your PC from there.&nbsp; Once in Malwarebytes, go to <strong>
Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Detection and Protection</strong>, and tick <strong>
Scan for rootkits</strong>.&nbsp; Then go back to the Dashboard and click [Scan Now].</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When it is done scanning, have it quarantine everything that it found.&nbsp; Then, reboot your PC and scan it with Malwarebytes again, quarantining everything it finds (if it finds anything more).&nbsp; This should remove the virus from your computer.&nbsp; If for
 some reason you can't get Malwarebytes to work, there are some other steps we can try to get ahead of the virus.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply. I suppose this post should have been categorized in the virus section of the community, but I swear that option wasn't given to me when I created the post. Oh well....</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, the instructions you linked to gave instructions for Win 7/8, and I have Win 10. However I was able to do a clean boot and sure enough this eliminated the auto-start browser redirect to the webpage. However it did not enable access to regedit
 or gpedit.msc. And doing a full reboot of course lands me back at square one. So at this point a full reinstall is indicated and will be my next objective once I can block off the time required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to one of the other replies, as I matter of policy I do not install third party malware detector/removal/defender software other than Windows Defender. My experience has shown that 50% of the time the software is ineffective, and another 50%
 of the time it is simply a shell carrier for other intrusive software. And I do not have the time or energy to install such software and determine after the fact whether it is effective. No offense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean install. Nuke 'em from orbit. Only way to be sure.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remove viruses all the time from computers, and Malwarebytes is one of the best.&nbsp; 80% of the time it will remove the viruses, and the other 20% of the time, no harm is done.&nbsp; The same cannot be said for Windows Defender.&nbsp; You should change your policy.&nbsp;
 You're going to nuke the system anyway, right?&nbsp; You've got nothing to lose!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you decide to give it a try, you don't have to use Safe Mode since we already know that a Clean Startup works too.</p>

</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.

<br />Windows\Microsoft will never call you about a subscription unless you have an enterprise volume license and even then it will be an account manager that you know that normally calls you.

<h2>            When trying to retrieve the Windows 8.1 Upgrade ISO receive the Error Message &#34;We can&#39;t connect right now&#34;</h2>
                    Ever since I upgraded to Windows 8.1 from the Store App, I can no longer start the Store App nor can I log into my Microsoft Account or log into my Microsoft Account from IE 11. Looks like I am experiencing several different errors and have been trying
 to retrieve an ISO of the 8.1 Upgrade using my Windows 8 Product K but once the download begins I am give the error "We can't connect right now" ... I know my internet connection is working as I can browse internet sites to my hearts content but I can't reach
 the download site from the setup app. Any Ideas? &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>If so, you could do it on another computer and create a bootable DVD and launch setup on the intended computer.</p>
<p>Clicking "Download Pro" installs and runs the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, which lets you know if your PC can upgrade to Windows 8 Pro, provides you with a compatibility report, and then walks you through the steps to purchase, download, and install.

I believe now that my issue may lie with SmartScreen, no matter what I do I am still told I do not have a network connection and as stated earlier I can browse the internet but still can't reach certain Microsoft sites from inside Microsoft Apps. Is anyone
 else having similar issues?<br />

            <p>I finally got my PC Upgraded to 8.1 and and no thanks to Microsoft Support ... I believe I was right and my problem stemmed around SmartScreen or lack there of. I contacted Microsoft Support on Thanksgiving feeling I had nothing left to lose seeing I had
 already decided to just go back to Windows&nbsp;8 and call my ordeal a learning experience and to never again follow Microsoft's suggestion to do a blind&nbsp;upgrade ... Anyway after several hours of trying to at least get my support agent to understand that all I
 needed was a way to download the&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Upgrade ISO so I could do a PC Refresh I was informed that I had no choice except to shell out some more money in order to recieve the DVD ... At this point it became a matter of princable ... I had already shelled
 out money for Windows&nbsp;7 and&nbsp;8 and if I had been asked up front to shell out some money for the 8.1 Upgrade ...&nbsp;I problably would have but instead I was told by Microsoft that this was the only way I could upgrade so I did it and then when it didn't work the
 only way to fix it was to shell out money? ... I think not ...&nbsp;&nbsp;so I politely ended the chat session with Microsoft and asked if the agent knew of any deals on a MacBook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily hardisks are relatively cheap these days and I had a spare 500 gig drive so I built a quick Windows 7 drive and then Upraded to Windows 8 as I had done in the past with my Windows 8 DVD and finally built my own Windows 8.1 Upgrade DVD. I plugged
 my screwed Windows 8.1 hard drive in&nbsp;and did the PC refresh and poof ...&nbsp;(okay an extended poof) ... I had a Windows 8.1 system running .... yeah I had to reinstall a ton of software and apps but at least I didn't have to pay anything ... I also learned that
 it was probaly Symantec's Norton 360 Suite that hosed me to begin with but I even have that working now too, again without help from Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess my whole rant is if you're going to put out a free upgrade ... make sure you're ready to support it ... not tell your customer ... ooops sorry my bad, now pay up!!!</p>

<p>Take a look at this link....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, you can also right click on the installer (usually SETUP), Troubleshoot Compatibility and follow the prompts of the wizard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure to REMOVE the printer and unhook it from your computer...</p>
<p>Hook it back up only when prompted by the installer.</p>

<p>Hello EnDriO95,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you signed into an account on your computer that has Administrative priveleges? If so, when you run the installation, &nbsp;are you right-clicking on the file and selecting "Run as Administrator"?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are on the Zune software download page, and click the install button, Where it asks "Dow you want to run or Save ZuneSetupPkg.exe are you selecting "Run" or "Save"? Try selecting "Save As" from the dropdown and save it to your computer's Desktop.
 Then run the installer from there once it's done downloading.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if that helps. &nbsp;We'll be here waiting to hear your results. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            <p>Are you the primary user on the computer? Do you perhaps have another account that has full Administrator privileges? As Mister Parks was referring to, this error occurs when an account without Administrator privileges attempts to install the Zune software. Can you check to see if another account on your PC has those privileges, and try installing it from that account? &nbsp;</p>

<p>i still have the same issue. it started by not recognizing my lumia 710, i removed policies, and still does not recognize it. I unistall zune, and when i tried to install it, voila!! error 0x80070005. when i check updates the system is up to date.</p>
<p>A real dissapointment, because i do like my lumia 710, and now i will be unable to pass music, podcast or upgrade my phone.</p>

<h2>            Would It Be Possible To Do A Duplicate Screen &#40;Dual Screen&#41; From My Laptop To My Desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Was wondering if it would be possible to due a duplicate screen (dual screen) from my laptop to my desktop?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The reason why i'm asking is since my laptop already has a built-in webcam i would love to try to be able to connect my laptop's built-in web cam with my desktop by doing a duplicate screen (dual screen) and connecting both my laptop and desktop together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there any way to use my laptop as a second monitor and connect both monitors together?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            Hi BRG1988
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your question about your laptop monitor.
<br />
<br />If I am undertstanding and as your last question states, you are are trying to use your laptop monitor as a secondary monitor.  The latop monitor is connected hardwired to your latop.  So there really is no way to directly connect your laptop screen with a webcam to your computer.  However, is disconnecting the computer monitor to your laptop an option?
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

    <title>Lost Cortana icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caroledenby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Cortana icon</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 and with it came Cortana as the search assistant.&nbsp; It worked wonderfully for a number of weeks.&nbsp; Then the Cortana icon disappeared from being on the far left and bottom of the desktop immediately next to the Windows icon.&nbsp; The application
 is still there in my apps and I can click on the Cortana app and it will appear and I can search from that.&nbsp; But it was much more simple having it there on my desktop, so my question is how to get the Cortana icon to appear again on my desktop?</p>
<p>Thanks for help,</p>

</p><p><span>The error may have been caused by driver issues such as incompatible drivers, corrupted or outdated drivers for any hardware.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            All actions that require administrator rights crash Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the sole user and administrator of a 2-year-old laptop running Windows 7. Since a few weeks I am having the following problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When ever I try to do anything that requires administrator rights - anything with the little blue-and-yellow shield icon or anything that triggers the User Account Control pop-up - the action fails, explorer freezes, and folders, start menu etc won't work
 again until I restart the computer. This includes for example</p>
<ul>
<li>uninstalling any programs</li><li>copying / moving files to certain folders such as Program Files</li><li>run as administrator</li><li>elevated command prompt</li><li>UAC and user account settings</li></ul>
<p>This is a particularly annoying issue because it makes a lot of the steps I would usually take to try and fix Windows problems completely unavailable to me. In fact I am afraid that a backup &amp; restore or re-install Windows type of wizard might also fail
 because I am unable to do anything that requires an UAC confirmation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the problem first appeared when I attempted to delete a folder called C:\d674b4d8ac649aa28b5935e3e33163 (I cannot even open it and I do not know what it is)</li><li>when Explorer has frozen, and I force a restart, an error message briefly appears before shut-down. ("Too many other files are currently in use by 16-bit programs. Exit one or more 16-bit programs, or increase the value of the FILES command in your config.sys
 file.")</li></ul>
<p>What can I do to fix this problem and take control of my laptop again?<br />
</p>

<p>OK, here are the next steps while running in Safe Mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rerun msconfig.exe, then do this:<br />
1. Click the Services tab.<br />
2. Tick the box that hides all Microsoft services.<br />
3. Untick all remaining tick marks.</li><li>Run this command from a Command Prompt:<br />
sfc.exe /ScanNow</li></ul>
<p>If this does not resolve the problem when booting into Normal Mode then I am unable to offer any further suggestions.</p>

    <title>Mailto For Windows Live Mail 2012 No Longer Work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mailto For Windows Live Mail 2012 No Longer Work</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">
Was using Windows Live Mail 2011, then upgraded to Windows Live Mail 2012, and now my extension that used to open WLM no longer work, nor do any mailto links on web pages.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">
I have ascertained that WLM IS the default mail program and that the mailto protocol IS WLM</p>
<p style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">
Any help appreciated.</p>

<p>... using WLM 2011 ... Windows 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many&nbsp;things have changed Windows 7, and I don't have a machine handy to test on - sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>... the mailto.txt file is empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a bit strange, I think. The first query checks for the path that most applications look for first to get instructions. The second checks for the path that would be used if Windows Live Mail were set as the default client. However, this may well be
 different for v.2011. The third will probably not be present on Windows 7, but on later OSs it overrides settings elsewhere in the registry.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If <em>mailto</em>: works properly when Internet Explorer is the browser, then I can't help but think that your problem is something weird in Opera. You'd have to do some serious troubleshooting, e.g. using
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">procmon</a> to see which registry keys are being queried when
<em>mailto</em>: is invoked.</p>

                    <p>I have a new Windows 10 computer (9 months old) and Windows &nbsp;Live &nbsp;Mail has been working ok. I now get the following message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail &nbsp;could not be started. It may not be installed correctly. Make sure that your disk is not full or out of memory. (0x80041161)</p>

<p>I have tried all the various suggested " fixes" but this has not solved the problem.</p>

<p>This error usually means that the Windows Live Sign-in Assistant service isn't running when you try to launch the program. On Windows 10, this service may be called Microsoft Account Sign-in Assistant. The error might arise if the Windows user account is
 a local one, not a Microsoft Account.</p>

<p>Once your account is switched to Outlook Mail, you will get errors in Windows Live Mail, and unless you reconfigure your account to IMAP it just won't work as it has.</p>

<p>A problem with the program not starting&nbsp;and displaying an error message can have nothing to do with any particular account. I explained in my response to John what the error code means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once your account is switched to Outlook Mail, you will get errors in Windows Live Mail,
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only if there is an Outlook.com account set up to use DeltaSync. This error has nothing to do with the change to Outlook Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Use the web browser or get the free eM Client- http://www.emclient.com/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't use either of those to access common RSS feeds or NNTP newsgroups, and you can't use a web browser to access an account via POP3 or IMAP. Apart from that, the free eM Client only allows for two mail accounts; I have 28.
