            Outlook Express won't run in Win7. XP was the last OS that used it.

            You mean you upgraded from XP and after the upgrade outlook express was gone? Try out Windows Live Mail, go to download.live.com to get it.

<h2>            MS STORE&#58; 4 Hard Drives. Only &#34;THIS PC &#40;C&#58;&#41;&#34; is available under Storage</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 fresh showing build 10586.<br />
I could select all my drives except D:\<br />
I then updated to the most current windows 10 version.&nbsp; According to windows Updater<br />
(It doesn't matter which update, I've tried multiple for quite sometime now).<br />
I am only able to see "THIS PC (C:)".&nbsp; Yet Disk Management and Explorer work just fine (for a very long time now).</p>

<p>
</p><p>How do I get Storage &gt; Local Storage to show:<br />
C:, D:, E:, F: Drives? <br />
What was taken out or disabled and how can it be fixed?&nbsp; <br />
I am not able to use MS Store until I am able to tell MS Store what hard drive to download to.&nbsp;
<br />
But I don't have this option because MS Store thinks I only have just "THIS PC (C:)"</p>

            Please post back a Screenshot of Disk management, which we read like doctors read Xrays.  Make sure to follow the guide so we see everything needed:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382

You may only need to issue those partitions letters in Disk Management to make those you want access to show up in File Explorer.

But I'm wondering why if you did a Clean Install that all partitions weren't deleted to get it cleanest.  Leaving random partitions during a Clean Install can eventually build up a disk junkyard with wasted space and other problems.   See the illustrated steps here to get the gold standard Clean install:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587

If you decided you wanted to do it over there is also a new Fall Creators Version 1709 being loaded int

            Others have had similar issue and their only solution to this problem was to perform a clean install. 

I suggest you either try upgrading to Windows 10 1703 or perform a direct clean install again:

            OK, we can see now that these are partitions on other hard drives which do have their Drive letters so should be showing up in File Explorer..  Your reinstall to C drive configuration looks correct.  

I'm not sure why the other hard drives don't show up in Local Storage settings.   You have a UEFI install so are the other drives also formatted GPT?  Even if MBR format they should still show up but only not able to boot if CSM or Legacy Boot is not enabled in Setup - and they're not needed to boot anyway.

Do the other drives show up in the menu choices for Storage&gt;Change Where New Content is Saved?  

Do the drives show up in UEFI Setup under Storage settings?  What additional Settings are there for choosing?  http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html
 

Otherwise I would wait for the new Fall Creators Update Version 1709 to be loaded into Media Creation Tool after Oct 17, install it from this link and choose Upgrade Now to manually install it to see

<p>It only shows up when I insert an usb thumb drive.&nbsp; But D:\ is missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So C:, E:, F: shows up but D: is missing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But Explorer works just fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can reboot my PC and "THIS PC (C:)" is the only thing that shows in Storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Drives are GPT as far as I know (that was the 1st clean install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC (C:) is the only thing that shows up in Change Where New Content is Saved.<br />
When I click on the arrow it just disappears. Very odd behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drives show up in UEFI. As you probably aware C: is duplicated (if I'm making sense). One for UEFI and the other for legacy.&nbsp; But yeah all of them show up.&nbsp; If I choose the legacy one it doesn't boot. I am using CSM though but I do have hard drives using
 UEFI 1st, option.&nbsp; I've tried all other options already, no dice.&nbsp; The only thing that has partially worked is inserting a usb thumb drive while in win10.&nbsp; Almost instantly E: and F: shows up.&nbsp; But no D:. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As For UEFI Bios I have it set to CSM mode as I wasn't sure if all equipment would run in UEFI mode. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just an FYI, but I think you've touched on it already.&nbsp; This is my 2nd time reinstalling win10.</p>
<p>Storage only shows 3 of my 4 hard drives from the initial install of win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; I will try 1709 when it comes out.&nbsp; I'm just scratching my head as to why&nbsp;build 10586 partially worked with storage (showed all by D:/). But after update only C:/.&nbsp; It's a real head scratcher. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only thought is to try installing from a build other then 10586. So your suggestion make sense to me. As &nbsp;build 10586 is on the original disk.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm not sure you need CSM or LegacyBoot enabled because you are only booting a UEFI drive and that setting normally only governs drives which need to boot.  So you might try turning it off to compare.  

Did the drives show up in Local Storage before your reinstall?  How did you change any UEFI firmware settings during the last install if at all?    Did you turn on CSM?  

Generally unless an MBR drive needs to boot, CSM and Legacy BIOS can be turned off, Secure and Fast boot turned on - unless you need to disable Fast Boot to get it to pause for the Boot menu interrupt key.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, the other drives didn't show up before the reinstall.&nbsp; That's why I reinstalled win10. I knew I should have just tried a more matured iso instead of the disk again.&nbsp; But I just didn't know at the time. I tried with CSM both on and off.&nbsp; But I have Secure
 boot set to "Other OS".&nbsp; I didn't think it mattered and allowed for some backwards compatibility.&nbsp; Also, not sure if I can undo the changes once Window UEFI is selected in bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand that disabling CSM is only part of it.&nbsp; I also have to enable Secure Boot to Windows UEFI mode from Other OS. Which is what I'm using now, Other OS.&nbsp; But that can't be the problem...can it??&nbsp; It was working, partially, straight from win10
 disk install. Using CSM and Other OS. &nbsp;</p>

            There's no indication you'd need "Other OS" for Secure Boot unless you have Linux or WIndows that doesn't support Secure Boot.  So I'd try it without that setting to see if it';s messing with things.  I'd also try CSM disabled.  You can easly change them back.

Do you have the latest UEFI FIrmware Update installed?  Check System Information to compare with the latest on the PC's Support Downloads webpage.

<h2>            Help scanning windows 7 fax and scan to a PDF file.</h2>
                    I am trying to scan to a PDF file using windows fax and scan. I do not see he option to save the file as a PDF. Although if I use the HP scan I even though it is the same device, and driver. I realize that I could just use the HP Scan for all of me scans,
 but I like the fact that with windows fax and scan all of my faxes and scans are in the same folder, not &nbsp;the case with HP Scan.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, the Fax and Scan feature in Windows 7 does not support the .pdf format.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have Microsoft Office program installed on the computer, you may try these steps&nbsp;a<span>s a work around.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How to convert .tif to .pdf documents using Office Professional (Word) 2007 and Windows 7 Ultimate:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open <strong>Word 2007</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the “<strong>Office button</strong>” in the upper left hand corner</span></p>

<p><span><span>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In “<strong>Insert Picture</strong>” box, select .tif document to be converted to .pdf by clicking title in

<p><span><span>r)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>See former .tif document now as a .pdf document</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t help, you may use the HP Scan program or you might have to use your favorite search engine to find a third party program/ application to do this.</span></p>

            Hi Michael.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />At Settings &gt; System &gt; Display what is the Scale set for Size of Text. Apps and other Items?    Try 100%.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't do it then try other Screen resolutions to get it to appear normal.
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update (which you can check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also a 3rd party tool to customize Text sizes in Windows 10 but you should save a System Image backup and set a System Restore point so you can go back if it messes up:  <a href="https://winaero.com/blog/change-system-font-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/change-system-font-win...</a>

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            They removed the font settings in Windows 10.  That's why I gave you the 3rd party tool which does the same thing.  
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Instead of just ignoring the steps I gave or saying you can't do them, why not ask back questions to try to make a decent effort to answer instead of just vetoiing everything.  I have been doing this for ten years and helped tens of thousands of consumers and every one who worked with me politely and cooperatively got it fixed no matter how many times they needed to ask back to perform the steps.  You just vetoed doing anything which will go nowhere.

            <p>Thankyou but I had already done that with no resolution.</p>
<p>My SSD is still full with no space at all.</p>
<p>My SSD is 120gb but only 111gb that can be used.</p>
<p>I download everything to another HD but there is no where that I can find I can go to change where it installs to.</p>
<p>I get told this SSD is big enough for what I need it for, but I'm disagreeing.</p>
<p>C: drive alone states the System &amp; reserved is 33.5GB, Apps &amp; games 60.5GB, then the next largest is the Temporary files of 17.2GB.</p>
<p>Temp file I do a delete, but doesn't do much.</p>
<p>All the Apps I use, so I don't want to uninstall and it won't let me move them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, do you think I just need to by a larger SSD? But what stops that happening again?</p>

            <p>Hi Tamara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, when you download anything from the internet, you probably should get a prompt asking you to choose the destination folder or the place where you want the data to be downloaded. If you do see it, the next time you download anything from the internet,
 choose the location where you want to save the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, before buying a new larger SSD, try doing the below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Try doing a Disk clean up.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer to the below link to run a Disk clean up and check if it helps. Doing a disk cleanup might help you to free up some space.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing this, please do follow the below step.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Changing the download location of the Downloads folder.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Windows key + E key. This will open up the File explorer Window.</p>
<p>2. In here, in the left hand panel, you will see downloads.</p>
<p>3. Right click it and select Properties.</p>
<p>4. In the Properties, select the Locations tab.</p>
<p>5. Under the<strong> "Files&nbsp;in target folder are stored in the download location below"
</strong>select the Move icon.</p>
<p>6. There, select the location of the folder or drive where you want to store the data and click on the
<strong>Select Folder </strong>Icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if the issue does get resolved, just go to the previous default download location and select all the data and right click it and select Copy. Now, go the new Download location, simply do right click any where and select the Paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if the issue is resolved or you need any further assistance.</p>

<h3> giles bill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface book 2 stuttering in everything. &#40;Solved&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently got a surface&nbsp;book 2 15". and discovered when gaming and during general tasks my surface book stutters. in a game this would look like intermittent&nbsp;lag, around every few mins the game would freeze temporarily for around half a second, it can be
 seen on GPU&nbsp;usage&nbsp;that when these stutters occur, the GPU&nbsp;usage&nbsp;goes from whatever it was to 0 until the stutter is over returning to its original&nbsp;usage. It can also be seen in regular usage with the mouse cursor&nbsp;freezing like the games for around half a second
 regularly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'm&nbsp;pretty disappointed&nbsp;with my experience with the surface book 2, with it costing so much money you would have thought they would have ironed out all the kinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, there is a fix that is software based but I would be fine getting a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks,</p>
<p>-Giles</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>to add to this, I've&nbsp;just found out from testing with a stopwatch the stutters occur&nbsp;once every minute (EVERY TIME IN GAMES ONLY). Hopefully, this can help us find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The stuttering in general windows usage seems to be more random, around 10 seconds to 4 min interval between stutters</p>

<p>Found out that when wallpapers where switching every 1 min it would cause the stuttering. Strange that just changing wallpapers would cause this kind of stutter.</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>I have 1 laptop with windows 7 and 1 desktop and 1 laptop using xp professional in my LAN. From my desktop I can connect to the other computers using remote desktop, but from the laptops I can't connect to desktop. The laptops can also connect with
 each other. All computers are in the same workgroup, with permission for remote desktop from my computers &gt; properties. I want to be able to connect from the laptops to desktop.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anther strange thing is that the result of ipconfig /all shows that my netbios over tcpip is disabled even if I doubled checked the settings from the network adaptor (I ticked the box to enable netbios over tcpip). I also disabled all firewalls and
 antivirus applications during the procedure and installed Remote Desktop 7.0 client update without any change.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can you help me, please?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks</strong></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Closed 3rd party security applications can still block local traffic.</p>
<p>If you it Not a big hassle try to uninstall it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a quick solution is TeamViewer (takes 15 min. to set up).</p>
<p>Get the portable version of <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.teamviewer.com/download/index.aspx</a> (last download on the list).</p>
<p>Open a new folder on each computer and put the files there.</p>
<p>Run it on both computer and connect.</p>

            Don't right click, try just clicking. Install should appear near bottom of screen. Just click it and your game will be back. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

            I am also locked out of my PC at the welcome screen. It keeps telling me my Microsoft password is wrong, even after changing it. I can sign into all other devices. I can't get into the recovery or even into safe mode without entering the Microsoft password.
 This latest update has ruined my computer. I have tried various password recovery and deletion apps to no avail. This is very upsetting. I used this computer to make my living. Nothing will work.

            The system restore instructions worked for me but I'm locked out again &nbsp;now. I'm going to restore again and turn off auto updates as the problem one reinstalled itself.

            I wasn't able to get into restore, or do any other admin functions. I was finally able to get in using the onscreen keyboard. That's when I discovered the number keys remapped themselves which made the special characters also not work. The update also
 trashed all of my restore points. I did a system reset, and that restored my keyboard functions. Unfortunately, I have to reinstall everything, which will waste more of my valuable time. Thanks Microsoft!

            <p>Same problem with my HP Printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to solve this by updating the driver through the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to add: I also tried Method 1 from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d6c29b45-e520-4236-addb-c2aaf20b762a" title="ThofikhAhamad">

            Updating the driver through Device Manager fixed the issue for me also. Now, when I run Windows Update, the error message no longer exists.

            <p>Not even an uninstall worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running the HP SETUP program from the OEM disk and got the UAC "This app have been blocked for your protection" error. The message says an Administrator has blocked you from running this app. Puzzling because&nbsp;my account is set as an administrator.
 Apparently, accounts with administrator privileges in Windows 10 don't have as much control as accounts with administrator privileges in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In searching for a solution to the UAC error, I found help from a "MICROSOFT Support Engineer" advising to run the&nbsp;Safety Scanner (we already know that SFC doesn't always work) and&nbsp;DISM /Cleanup-Image. These must be Microsoft's equivalent to a&nbsp;cable company's
 support advising you to unplug your cable box and&nbsp;plug it back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I enabled the real Administrator&nbsp;Account (at a command prompt &gt; net user Administrator /active:yes) and ran the uninstall program off the&nbsp;HP OEM disk. After rebooting,&nbsp;I&nbsp;still had the prompt to install the driver update for the uninstalled driver
 which was worrisome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I went ahead and reinstalled the driver using the Administrator Account and now Windows update is showing my driver up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm annoyed that an account set as an administrator doesn't appear to have the same privileges as an Administrator Account. Perhaps it's always been this way but I haven't run into this kind of restriction before.</p>

            <p>I agree with the&nbsp; folks who have uninstalled &amp; reinstalled their printer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having had this problem since upgrade to W10, and tried various things with no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally found a solution which seems to have worked for me -</p>
<ol>
<li>Go into &gt;&nbsp;Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Device Manager and check under the printer node</li><li>If you have a "Unknown Device" showing under the printer&nbsp; - first make sure that you have the driver disk which came with the printer, or have downloaded the drivers to install</li><li>Then uninstall the unknown printer device &amp; reload the HP2540 drivers </li><li>Device manager should now show the HP2540 printer under the printer node</li></ol>
<p>Now that you've got the 2540 properly installed, the windows update error seems to be fixed

<h2>            Netflix is stuttering in full mode, Surface pro &#40;5.gen&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently bought me a Surface Pro. 5th gen. (the Pro 6 is not available in Norway yet). It is working greate, except for one thing; Netflix is stuttering in full screen mode. It's not stuttering when in maximized window (Netflix app, Edge, Chrome),
 only in full screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I really can't understand why, I should have plenty enough of CPU and memory (i5 7300u, 8GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea of what the source of problem could be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In advance, Thanks :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, now I have both packages. It's still not working! :(</p>
<p>Playing around a little bit I've realized it pops up when I try to open AVG (User Interface) and the HP (MediaSmart Photo) applications.</p>
<p>I know that I've erased something, because just yesterday I did a scan and erased some duplicate files/applications. I must've done it then.</p>
<p>Anymore ideas?? Please??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I noticed when AVG updated my program it now includes a PC Tune-up scanner including the first repair for free. If you've used this utility it may have removed a necessary component. If this is the case, then hopefully the AVG scan will have created a log
 file to tell us what it actually removed. Ideally it will have created and stored everything so that you can un-do the changes made by it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting back to your original question concerning the error in the event viewer...</p>
<p>&nbsp;Go to the error in question and double-click on it to open the 'Summary Page Events' of this error. Right-click on this error, select 'Copy', then select 'Copy details as text'. Then open Notepad and Paste the details into it. Save the file and then you
 can Paste the information here so we can take a look at it.</p>

<h2>            SP4 Repair requirements and cost of repair</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a 1 year and 4 months, I noticed that my Surface Pro 4 had a yellowish tint on the lower left side of the screen.</p>
<p>A day after, I noticed that my keyboard cover was not properly aligned with the display when I close it but just ignored it.</p>
<p>Then a few days later, on the same side, the display screen opened a bit then I put adhesive tape fearing it will continue to crack open.</p>
<p>I read on this community, that this is probably a swollen battery issue.</p>
<p>This is a bit unusual. I still have a Surface Pro 2, it's 4 years old already and I never had any issues.</p>
<p>I planned on buying the new Surface Pro before this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I badly needed a computer to replace my SP4 and backup my files, so I bought a Macbook Pro w/o Touch bar and installed Windows 10 Pro in it.</p>
<p>I'm not really a Mac OS user, but I think Apple's service is a bit better. I had a Macbook Pro 2011 w/ Windows 7 that died after 3 years but because of Apple's extended repair program, it lived again for free. But I sold it and bought a SP4. Was this a mistake?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love Microsoft Surface, I have 2 and could have bought 1 more, but these issues...</p>
<p>It might be safe to wait for a few more years to convince me to buy Microsoft hardware again specially in a country where you don't have support.</p>
<p>Sorry, Microsoft. Hope you bounce back.</p>
<p>
Anyway, I still want to have this repaired since this is a premium item.
</p><p>I'm in the Philippines right now. My brother bought this for me in New York.</p>
What do I need to do to have this repaired? How much would it cost?<br />
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Thanks for your help, I tried your solution and unfortunately it didn't work.&nbsp; I went to the web site and that wasn't much of a help either.&nbsp; However, I did find the solution to my problem!&nbsp; I'm not sure if it would be the same for anyone else, but when
 I went to download the newest Java version once again&nbsp;from the site, I clicked "RUN" instead of "SAVE", after it finished I installed the download and there wasn't the nasty error that kept occuring. :D

<p>As you all probably know the issue in Neverwinter with getting to the end of a dungeon and getting kicked out so the other players have a higher chance of winning the loot, generally its two or three friends abusing this "EXPLOIT"<br />
<br />
Ive reported the three involved and just wondering what, if anything will happen about it ?<br />
<br />
As this has totally and utterely ruined my day and it probably has for a lot of players, im just wondering what microsoft would do about it, if anything....<br />
<br />
ITS AN EXPLOIT FFS, ITS PLAYERS EXPLOITING OTHER PLAYERS FOR THEIR TIME AND EFFORT, DO SOMETHING ALREADY</p>

<p>This had happened to me as well. So I'm now looking to never enter of dungeon without the majority partied up with me. Ill even be talking buddy buddy with everyone, be right at the end, and never have died and have one of the highest gear scores, with a
 cleric in the group to, and all of the sudden, im kicked?? Why??? What's wrong with you kickers? It must have been my pretty looks they got jeoulous over? I just don't know? But never again. Sometimes an hour a day might be all one has time to play this game
 and when that happens it just ruins the entire hour... </p>

<p>Technically not violating any rules? Actually I think they are based on the Code of Player conduct that PW set forth for their own game. &nbsp;In the Code it states no player shall at any time prevent another player from accessing content.
</p>
<p>This game has several dungeons that are gear score locked. So preventing players from looting items (in itself is blocking players from accessing content) but moreso prevents them from accessing Dungeons which is content. Since they cant improve their gear
 score. I know this may be an interpretation of the Code but they left it very vague and gave room for interpretation. Furthermore Microsoft has their own Code and terms of use for Xbox Live that has many points about cyber bullying and exploiting etc. Personally
 I think this is leaving a stain on Microsofts reputation if they do not force the hand of the developers to fix the issue or shut the game down all together. Just my opinion of course</p>

<p>The way I understand it, in the ToS for Neverwinter is that basically other players won't hamper anyone else's efforts to play the game. &nbsp; That indeed once you meet the requirements for some endeavor, you as a player have the same chances to rise in rank,
 level, gearscore and such according to your abilities to play the game as anyone else does. &nbsp; That you can enjoy the game with the same potential as anyone else playing, be they in a guild, buying Zen for actual money, farming for loot or whatever. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>So if another player or group of &nbsp;players is kicking you at, during or after the boss arbitrarily for no good reason so they can get loot or because they're jerks or for no reason at all, it seems given the wording that they are breaking the ToS. &nbsp; Breaking
 it because they are hampering your efforts to play, they are being poor sportspersons, they are cheating. &nbsp; &nbsp; What we should all do as players is report them to the game makers. &nbsp; Provide details including recordings or screenshots. &nbsp; &nbsp;Report and keep reporting.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>These people seem the same as the scammers in chat posting ripoff or phishing or hacking websites. &nbsp; The same as people trading with you that remove the actual item or give silver instead of gold. &nbsp;I would say they are cheating, they are unfair, they are
 ruining the game in ruining your enjoyment of it, because they are manipulating the game for their own gain at your expense. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the answer from ARC is that these other players are breaking no rules, if ARC claims they are playing fairly and not cheating, if ARC fails to answer you, if ARC "fixes" this kicking/looting problem at the boss with up-front 3 minute timing and like-class
 replacing and no more new players that doesn't end up fixing the problem once the patch comes out. &nbsp; If ARC instead ends up not stopping but encouraging these booting and looting behaviors to drive up in-game currency and sell more Zen, if that's what happens,
 &nbsp;then what is the solution? &nbsp;How do we deal with a free to play game if it is doing all it can to not be free at all by itself being either unfair or inept. &nbsp; Whatever we might think about the number of hyped up 'so and so got a legendary item' from yesterday's
 new lockboxes after the game flooded with Astral Diamonds all last week, and how much Zen they may be selling because of it, that doesn't prove anything. &nbsp; The question is, after this patch comes out, &nbsp;what if they don't fix the boot and looters ruining your
 gameplay. &nbsp; We know they have not done anything so far over the last few weeks it's been like this, we just have an AD flood event and new lockboxes. &nbsp;What if this continues as time goes on and ARC doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with how ARC is responding or failing to respond, report ARC to Microsoft. &nbsp; Here, on the console, via billing. &nbsp; If you complain to ARC with valid complaints, and they keep doing nothing that fixes what seems a clear violation of
 their own rules, then go higher. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue with loot kicking is being looked into. As was already stated, the new patch will not allow kicking for 3 minutes when a player joins an instance. If a player is kicked that player will be replaced by the same role (a dps for another dps, or a
 leader for another leader). If too many kicks are made the instance will be locked and leave the remaining players to fend for themselves. It has been brought to Cryptic's attention that this will not fix the booting once the boss is defeated or just before
 it is defeated and they have mentioned a possible lock on kicking during or after a boss fight. Check the official forums and twitter for the latest updates. If I get a confirmation or updated information I will post it here as well.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one preview request&#58; allow controller recalibration to fix trailing issues.</h2>
                    
<p>There needs to be a setting under controllers that allows you recalibrate your xbox one controller. My controller trails upwards, forcing me to always push in the opposite direction to even out the movement. I know it would be greatly appreciated by the
 xbox community to allow a simple X/Y recalibration screen to fix this issue.</p>

<p>The xbox one trailing issue seems to be an overly common occurrence with a high number of controllers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            What a Rip off this is&#58;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ya know I held back from buying another 12 month gold subscription card until a few days ago. While playing my Call of Duty black Ops combat training I notice that all the weapon scoring had stop this could only mean one thing that the game support is now
 ended for the Xbox 360 but MS still is selling its 12 month gold Subscription cards without any game support what a rip off this is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder how long before the MP game support will last before game scoring is shut down. The mistake MS just created is to allow selling any more 12 month subscription cards until the switch over then re-issue them on the open market. Really MS you taken
 my money and no I am not buying the Xbox-one either because of this type of practices you’ve shown me by Turning off game support before the switch over how rude you are to this customer and all customers. Also when I rented a game last week I notice I get
 the achievements but the game scoring is gone therefore gamer points are no longer added to my gamer score. Either you have a massive BUG or you are really cheating the public who has supported your company all these years being on live this is why I am heading
 over to the PS4 system as soon as I see how many BUGS Sony will have before I fork out my money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish you lots of luck because I don’t think Microsoft cares enough about what gamers say these days your current actions show that to me. Oh while I am at it don’t say it’s my system it’s a new 360 bought lest&nbsp;than 6 months ago. Good thing I turned in
 all my games before that ended in two weeks where no 360 gamer will be worth anything as a trade in value. My COD BO is the only game I kept to give me soothing to do until I buy my PS4 which I am looking forward to. Again, thank you very much MS and XBL you
 really shown your stuff.</p>

<p>Old games are old. &nbsp;They eventually die out. &nbsp;It's the duty of the game companies to keep their servers up for as long as they want to support them. &nbsp;Microsoft makes no guarantees that all the online features of 3rd party games, or even 1st party, will continue
 to be there forever and ever. &nbsp;Gamerscore is still be accumulated by players for their achievements. &nbsp;If the OP can't see any change to his Gamerscore, he should contact customer support and try to address the issue. &nbsp;It sounds to me like he's just trying
 to justify a decision to move over to PS4. &nbsp;He doesn't need one. &nbsp;It's a free country. &nbsp;Get either. &nbsp;Get both. &nbsp;Get none. &nbsp;Whatever you want to do. &nbsp;Best of luck, OP, in all your gaming endeavors. &nbsp;I hope it all works out for you.</p>

<p>So MS should pump money into a game that isnt theirs and that the developer has abandoned? While that woud be nice I am not sure what incentive MS has to do such a thing. But yeah, Riven stops by a few times a year to post something like this. There really
 is no need to justify not getting a xbox one. Just do it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[/quote]The paywall may be the main problem, but in actuality arent they charging for
<em>access</em> to&nbsp;ANY games' MP(or other online features), &amp; not gaurenteeing that those games actually have MP?&nbsp; Wouldnt it be up to the user to determine if the game he/she wants to play actually has a functioning MP?&nbsp; MS cant dictate to pubs which games
 have MP necessarily to begin with, so it would be hard to demand (and unfair) that they ensure that games that do choose to, have unending online features i think.</p>

<br />
Some games eventually die, you and I both know that. However it is not a surprise that some look at games shutting down as wrong when they are paying an ongoing fee to access them.<br />
<br />
If these games are on their own servers, why are we paying Microsoft to access them. Why is there no system in place for these games to migrate to Microsoft's pseudo-p2p system when the companies drop support?<br />

So yes, I can certainly understand why some are complaining. I don't completely agree with them but I do understand why they are angry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We're paying to access them on an Xbox, because that's the way Microsoft designed their business model for Xbox's online service. &nbsp;I can't find a rationalization for believing that Xbox LIVE Gold membership fee being dependent upon the availability of any
 one customer's preferred game's online features. &nbsp;If those online features were suddenly made unavailable only to Xbox users, then yeah, I might have reason to stand up and say "Hey Microsoft, what gives? &nbsp;How come we got cut out?"</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I remember paying for Sony's access pass thing. &nbsp;$25 a month, and access to a lot of their PC MMO's. &nbsp;Then suddenly The Matrix Online dropped. &nbsp;Closed down. &nbsp;I felt a little jilted, sure. &nbsp;But I had the option to keep playing the other MMO's still available
 on that plan, or drop the membership. &nbsp;I didn't really have room to complain. &nbsp;These things just happen. &nbsp;It is the lifecycle of games that possess any kind of online functionality. &nbsp;One day, the servers to which they connect will simply no longer be operational.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Is that what happened with Black Ops? &nbsp;I hadn't heard anything official about it. &nbsp;If there isn't any official word on Black Ops servers being down, then maybe you just had some server connectivity issues, which can be troubleshot. &nbsp;No sense in jumping to
 conclusions. &nbsp;As for the achievements issue... maybe that has something to do with connectivity as well. &nbsp;If you're offline, earning achievements, then suddenly you reconnect and opt to redownload your profile when Xbox detects a discrepancy, then you lose
 what progress you made online. &nbsp;And before you ever get back online, there wouldn't be any change to your Gamerscore.</p>

<p>MS should of pull all 12months off the market as I said if you can understand anything except one word. gee you people are tunnel focused. It is not right to CHARGE the PUBLIC money for something they do not receive its call robbery under the law of a America
 this is what the Rip off is. Companies have responsibility to do right to the PUBLIC and if you do not think so then you live in another country who could care less.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Trying to boot a game and it crashes... Event Viewer log shows the issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep trying to boot up Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag and it would crash the moment it opened. I check Event Viewer and saw this error. I believe it is an issue with DirectX 12. I don't want to have to reinstall Windows 10 if I can avoid it.</p>

            <p><em>"I wonder if DX11 games use DX12 drivers... Is that possible"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, it's not possible. The game selects which DX file, or files, it requires (btw - DX is not a driver).</p>
<p>COD-AW is also not a DX12 game.</p>
<p>- Apparently a COD-AW patch causes issues when using <em>Display Port</em> output or
<em>144Hz </em>refresh rate.</p>
<p>- If the games were launching into the setup screens I would suggest trying only DX9 level settings</p>
<p>(sometime these are labelled as such, but are often the High or Ultra option ) and tweaking them up</p>
<p>one by one until disaster strikes again.</p>
<p>- Ah ha!&nbsp; I see that <em>Share</em> is the new term they use since incorporating ShadowPaly into the Experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Different games implement PhysX differently, and some are restricted in which version of the PhysX driver</p>
<p>they can use. This is why I suggest disabling your dedicated card, at least while troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Well, saying <em>some</em> may be a bit of a stretch. I do know that MOH-Airborne is limited to a very early</p>
<p>version of DX, which can make installing the game a pain in the keister </p>
<p>(the current PhysX has to be uninstalled so the game can do it's thing and install it's version. To keep this game running, I have to backup the early version and paste it into the current PhysX folder when I update Nvidia drivers.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"there is no official downloads on the internet for DX10, 11 and 12?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no stand alone installer for DX12, and I believe DX12 will be getting updated via Windows Updates</p>
<p>when new files DX12 files are created. Should the couple of current DX 12 files become corrupt I expect</p>
<p>they would be repaired by <em>System File Checker</em> ( sfc \scannow ) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the results from the DX Web Installer was a message to the effect that DX is up to date you may have a</p>
<p>corrupt DX file or files.</p>
<p>In the event that DX9,10 11 are corrupt, and if sfc does not fix corrupt DX files you can reinstall DX using the full</p>
<p>DirectX installer package (June 2010) - which is the last of the DX updates before the advent of DX12 ).</p>

</p>
<p>- Note that this unpacks the files to a folder of your choice. You then need to run the DXSETUP.exe from</p>
<p>within that folder. After the install is finalised you can delete this folder</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I have MSI Afterburner doing all my overlay for games."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not so much where an overlay is done from. More that some games don't like it.</p>
<p>Afterburner has also been know to conflict with some games in the past, as do other tweaking and
</p>
<p>optimising programs. </p>
<p>First disable this overlay, and if that does not help running via <em>Clean Boot</em> will help determine</p>
<p>If&nbsp; Afterburner or another Startup program or Service is causing conflicts. Note that any programs</p>
<p>you launch manually after booting into Windows will not be detected in Clean Boot, so keep these in</p>
<p>mind as well.</p>

<p>
</p><p>- Also try disabling your Anti-virus temporarily. AV's are notorious for silently blocking games.</p>
