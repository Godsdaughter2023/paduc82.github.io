<p>Hi LordAlukard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cleared the cache and cookies, restarted my PC, and attempted to open in private mode all with no luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all happened when my email account was automatically switched to the new beta version. I am able to access in safe mode. It does not work on other browsers or PC but is working on mobile device and desktop app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another outlook account which i can access fine so it seems more specific to my email account when accessing through any browser.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />I have checked my account and I can login. So this is hard to identify if this is your network or this is on server backend. As for now all services are green <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />
<br />As for now please try to set up your account in Windows 10 Mail app <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-email-in-the-mail-app-for-windows-10-7ff79e8b-439b-4b47-8ff9-3f9a33166c60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up...</a>, at least this will give you access to your email.
<br />
<br />Also you can try to reset network settings .To run these networking commands in a command prompt window
<br />1. In the search box on the taskbar, type Command prompt, press and hold (or right-click) Command prompt, and then select Run as administrator &gt; Yes.
<br />2. At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:
<br />Type netsh winsock reset and press Enter.
<br />Type netsh int ip reset and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /release and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /renew and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.

<h2>            How to insert pictures of club members in word document</h2>
                    <p>I have a file with JPEG pictures of a large amount of club members</p>
<p>The name of the Picture is the name of the person.</p>
<p>Windows automatically puts these pictures in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to create a document with X rows and Y colums per page, where pictures of all members are inserted with their name under the picture.</p>
<p>When new members come or others leave the club, the document should be generated again from scratch with all the current members.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible in Word and how can this be achieved.</p>
<p>

<h2>            PTCL Smart TV App stopped working after auto apdates</h2>
                    <p>I have been using PTCL Smart TV Application on my PC till 30 May morning. Later on, some background updates made it stop working. The application is opened. Channel list is also loaded. But after selecting a channel, nothing is shown in output pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the latest Build 10130 hoping that it might fix the problem but in vain. I have also tried to uninstalling and reinstalling the app but result is the same. My graphic drivers are also updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any work round please?<br />

<p>Thanks for being kind to help resolve my problem. I think, there was some
 defender update that created the problem. Adding exception to firewall, as suggested in Method 1 resolved the problem and I am now able to view live TV broadcasting through PTCL Smart TV app&nbsp; :)</p>

<h2>            Printing - Booklet Finishing page grayed out</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to print a folded booklet with staples in the middle (ie: where the fold is).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go "FILE" - "PRINT" - "PRINTER PROPERTIES" - "SELECT FINISHING - BOOKLET CREATION" the "BOOKLET FINISHING - Booklet fold and staple" option is grayed out and will not let me select it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My printer does allow me to print documents with staples at the top, bottom etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have&nbsp;followed all the instructions required to create a booklet. </p>
<p>I have set the MARGINS section, with 'Multiple pages: Book fold" and "Sheets per booklet: All".
</p>
<p>I have selected LANDSCAPE. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? Thanks Aveda.</p>

            This has nothing to do with Word. Print options are determined by your printer driver. If your printer is able to staple a folded booklet at all (which I actually doubt), then it is only because it has a booklet finishing setting in the printer driver
 itself, sidestepping the feature in Word. You'll have to consult the printer documentation to find out how to use the printer's settings to print a booklet.

            There's no undelete app that works on Nokia phones. If you got the N95 4GB &amp; the pictures are in the memory card you can try a recovery software that is run on a pc with memory card reader but if you got the N95 8gb(no mem card slot) then, sorry no way.

            If it is critical, you can try to find the various types of software out there that may be able to get them off of your failed hard Drive. I'm guessing it is a P.C not a Mac, both platforms do have software available, also depending on how bad your HD
 crash really is, or was you may be able to revive it.Several sites out there may be helpful in regards to this,depending on the actual manufacturer also consider them. I know how that can feel, so I wish you luck.

<h2>            Is there a way to control the line spacing after a final bullet in Word&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a large Word document I'm working on with many bulleted lists. I was wondering if there was a fast, easy way to tell Word to insert a
<i>10pt After </i>space at the end of each list. Can Word detect the final bullet point in a list and make its
<i>After </i>spacing different from the ones preceding it? I want my bullet points close together but then I want a larger space between the list and the next paragraph. Does that make sense?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not relishing the option of locating each and every last bullet point and manually applying different formatting but I guess if there is no other option, I will have to do it. I hope someone here can save me some time!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using Word 2010.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers guys,&nbsp;</div>

            Modify or set up your bullet paragraph styles: set the space after to 10 pts. Then put a check in the box before
<i>Don't add space in between paragraphs of the same style</i>. &nbsp;

<h2>            This Feature Requires Internet Explorer 4.01 or Greater</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Outlook from Office 2007, I am using Win 7 x 64 (fully updated) and have both 32 and 64 Browsers installed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When I try to open Outlook I get a message "</p>
<p>This Feature Requires Internet Explorer 4.01 or Greater to use this feature"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched the web for an answer to this problem but none are relevant or working for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I note is that the fixes use an IE Version number but when I check my the version numbers in IE9 32 and 64 ( Help/About) I get
</p>
<p>Version: (blank)</p>
<p>Update Version: 0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this may be the cause of th problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I fix this ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Everything in my Inbox has disappeared</h2>
                    Last Friday I finally succumbed and got a Smartphone !! It runs on Android and includes G-Mail. I added my Hotmail/Outlook account to G-Mail (I also access the account through Windows Live Essentials Mail). G-Mail synchronised with my Hotmail account and
 now my Hotmail Inbox is completely empty; everything seems to have disappeared. &nbsp;What is going on ? I can't be the only person in the world to be running G-Mail on a mobile alongside Hotmail/Outlook. &nbsp;

            Hi Nick,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community. Let us help you on the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I understand that you lost your emails after setting up your Microsoft account in the Gmail app of your smartphone. Have you tried signing in to your account through https://outlook.com to check if your emails are still there?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, please check if your Microsoft account is set to reflect deleted items if you delete them from other devices. To do this, follow the steps below:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Sign in to your account in https://outlook.com</div>
<div>2. Click on the gear icon next to your account name then select <b>More mail settings.</b></div>
<div>3. Under <b>Managing your account,</b> click on <b>Connect devices and apps with POP.</b></div>
<div>4. Under <b>Deleting downloaded messages</b>, select&nbsp;<span><b>Don't let devices or apps delete messages from Outlook. If the app or device is set to delete, Outlook will move the messages to a special POP folder instead.
</b>That way, if you delete any emails from other services where your Microsoft account is synched to, it will go to the POP folder instead of permanently deleting them.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>If you could not find your emails when you access your account through the web, please try the steps from the article below:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div><br />
<div>If any of these are not helpful, please provide us the affected email account through the private message area. Sign in to Microsoft Community to see the private message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We're looking forward to your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>

            Hi Rhyan,
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks for your prompt reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am afraid that this matter is beginning to drive me up the wall and has kept me up for two nights running ! Not your fault, of course; you have been very helpful.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Needless to say, I have carried out all the steps suggested and I have recovered some of the deleted messages. I cannot be certain but I don't think all of the messages have been recovered. Fortunately, we still have G-Mail (which caused the problem in
 the first place !) and G-Mail has over 1100 of my Outlook messages in its Inbox !! I don't think Outlook has recovered anything like that number.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>What has been drivng me crazy and keeping me up all night is that the messages just won't go back into my Inbox ! I have painstakingly edited all the messages and restored them, one by one, into my Inbox and checked that they are there before closing the
 program. As soon as I close the program, back they all go to the POP folder and the Inbox is empty ! I have spent hours and hours doing this over and over again and the messages just won't stay where they are put !</div>
<div><br />
<div>Every time, Outlook tells me that "Your messages are in your POP folder" and if this is a mistake then "Change Settings." But Outlook won't let me do that either. Every time I click on "Change Settings" I get a message "Sorry, there seems to be a problem
 with Outlook right now." And there has been a problem for five days !</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know if it is relevant but I have two e-mail programmes running what used to be Hotmail: Windows Live Mail and, of course, Outlook (I much, much prefer Live Mail but that is another subject !) The same problems occur in both programs. I have transferred
 all the messages from the POP folder to the Inbox several times over, only to find that, the next time I run the program they have gone back to the POP folder or maybe the Deleted Items folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope you can help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>

            Hi Vivien,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your prompt and helpful response.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>IncrediMail has been accessing my Hotmail account for years without any problems at all. We have only had a problem with G-Mail on the new Smartphone which seemed to lose all the messages (now partially recovered.) Are you saying that I can never get my
 Inbox back again in Hotmail/Outlook ?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I confirm that, on my computer, I mostly use Windows Live Mail, which I much prefer to Outlook because of its Office Style Interface but, as I understand it, Windows Live Mail and Outlook are the same thing in different clothes! The data is the same. And
 whatever happens in Outlook (like this wretched POP folder) also happens in Live Mail. Outlook is not attractive. Sometimes I do use Outlook directly, accessing it from MSN. Obviously, the Smartphone, being an Android device, comes with G-Mail already installed
 but it has been set to use my Hotmail account and Hotmail address since everybody knows that address. I prefer Windows Live Mail to G-Mail as well. I can't understand why Microsoft did not make more of it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also confirm that I regularly use two browsers: Internet Explorer 10 and Google Chrome (always the latest version). The "There is a problem with Outlook.com" occurs with both browsers and on every occasion.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps. Anything else you need to know, please ask.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>

<div>It seems that quite a large number of messages have not been recovered and I still have no Inbox and cannot change the settings in Outlook. I use two browsers, Internet Explorer 10 and Google Chrome and it is the same with both.</div>

            Hi&nbsp;Nick O'Sullivan,
<div><br />
<div>I apologize for the delay in response.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>This is what happened when you add your account to a mail program or devices. If the protocol used is POP all inbox messages will be downloaded to the mail program or devices. After the download is done, the device will signal Outlook.com to delete all
 the messages from the server if you did not select the option to leave copy to Outlook.com server. Since you can still see most of your messages in your device, I strongly suggest that you keep the messages and don't delete them because all of it is now transferred
 to your device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you are getting an error message when changing your POP settings to avoid this from happening again in the future, we would need you to provide us a screenshot of the error message you received for us to investigate. Please upload it in the private
 message area.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>We will be waiting for your response.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

            Hello, Judith,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks once more for a helpful response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I must confess that I am still baffled !There must be millions and millions of Smartphones out there and many of them run Android and that means G-Mail. I have not counted but I am pretty certain that Outlook has not recovered all the deleted messages
 by any means - only about a third of them. Thank the Lord most of them appear to have been downloaded to G-Mail but things like drafts and Sent Items have not transferred into G-Mail.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is all rather a mess. And who asked G-Mail to delete all the messages ? Not me, that's for sure. I am perfectly happy to have my Holtmail messages on my mobile via G-Mail; seems a god idea. I have been sharing Hotmail messages with IncrediMail for many,
 many years. So why should it not work with G-Mail? I realise that Microsoft and Google are not the best of friends but I can't see why this doesn't work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, I attach a screenshot of the Outlook message - or at least I hope I do ! I have never done it before.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0ecf0d1-8b1e-47d8-aa6f-71a143147d9c" />Thanks
 once again and I hope I am helping to increase the sum of human knowledge and stop Google messing up Hotmail.</div>

            Hello, Carissa,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you once again for your prompt and helpful response.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am afraid, however, that the mystery persists !! On looking at the Outlook settings, the option "Don't let another program delete messages from Outlook" is very clearly enabled. Also, in G-Mail, the option "Leave a copy of the message on the server"
 is also enabled.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And yet over 1000 e-mails have just disappeared !! And e-mails no longer go into my Inbox which is a bit of a nuisance since other programs look in the Inbox.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a couple of thoughts: we know that there was a problem with Outlook (as per my screenshot) during the time that G-Mail and the Smartphone came into my life ! And we know that Outlook settings could not be accessed. Is it possible that this could
 have caused the problem since it is clear that all settings were correct and that G-Mail was not authorised to delete messages from Outlook but did just that !!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another thought, probably not relevant, is that, as I have mentioned previously, I don't like Outlook much and much prefer Windows Live Mail but I presume that, underneath the surface, they are the same thing. Windows Live Mail presumably accesses Outlook
 just as it used to access Hotmail - or are they different programs. It is beginning to look to me as if Outlook was not working properly for a few days, hence the error messages I was receiving. And also it is now working properly again and I have not touched
 it !!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Fortunately, it is not the end of the world since I<i> think</i> that all my e-mail messages have transferred into G-Mail - I can't be sure, of course, since I never counted them ! And they also seem to have all downloaded into IncrediMail, which I have
 used for years as a "pretty" front-end to Hotmail and which is "Microsoft Approved" which, G-Mail, of course, is not !</div>
<div><br />
<div>This problem does seem to be a bit more complex and mysterious than just not having the settings right because they are all correct at both ends !</div>
<div><br />
<div>Kind Regards and thanks,</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Merging from Excel to a Word 2010 Table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eviefisher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging from Excel to a Word 2010 Table</h2>
                    <p>I have handwritten information (answers on evaluation sheets for a program).&nbsp; I've entered this info into Excel as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column A "<strong>Participant</strong>" &nbsp;&nbsp; Column B "<strong>Eval Question No. 1 Text</strong>"&nbsp; Column C "<strong>Eval Question No. 2 Text</strong>" and so on...</p>
<p>(Note, I've actually used the entire question as the heading, as opposed to "Eval Question No. 1 Text"), then entered each Participant's answer in the appropriate column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to merge to a Word table so that all answers to question 1 are in the first table, all answers to question 2 are in the next table, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get the first table populated, but the subsequent tables don't merge.&nbsp; I've tried "Many to One", "TableStart / TableEnd."&nbsp; For TableStart/End, I'm not sure where/how to designate a name for the table, so that's probably the first roadblock.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's a better set-up for what I'm trying to accomplish I am open to suggestions (other than Access since I'm too rusty to be comfortable using it now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!EMF</p>

            <p>I'd be inclined to do this with either a separate:</p>
<p>• merge; or</p>
<p>• data base field,</p>
<p>for each question. With separate merges, you'd get an output with a separate row for each record, so you'd have to join them into a single table before copying the joined&nbsp;tables into a single document, post merge. With a database field, you can have a single
 separate table for each question in the same document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the database field approach, you could use a field coded along the lines of:<br />
{DATABASE \d "{FILENAME \p}/../Evaluations.xlsx" \s "SELECT [Participant], [Question#] FROM [Sheet1$] WHERE [Participant] &lt;&gt; '' ORDER BY [Participant] " \l 9 \b 47 \h }</p>
<p>where 'Evaluations.xlsx' is the name of the workbook and 'Sheet1' is the name of the worksheet and each question is represented by &nbsp;'Question#', where '#' is the question number and the document is saved to the same folder as the source workbook. The '\l
 9 \b 47 \h' string at the end of the field code controls the output table's formatting. The \h applies a heading, while the numbers following the \l and \b control other formatting attributes. As coded, you'll get a cream-coloured table with a maroon header
 row. For a less colourful table, you might use \l 1 or \l 2, with \b 176 to \b 191. An advantage of the database field over a mailmerge is that its table&nbsp;will automatically update to reflect any changes in the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of whether you use a mailmerge or database field, I'd recommend replacing the question text with a simple string like 'Question#', where '#' is the question number. The reasons for that&nbsp;are (a) it&nbsp;simplifies the field&nbsp;coding; and (b) mailmerges
 (and I suspect database fields) can only work with field names of up to 40 characters, including spaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The field brace pairs (i.e. '{ }') for the above example are all created in the document itself, via Ctrl-F9 (Cmd-F9 on a Mac); you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message. Nor is it practical to add them via
 any of the standard Word dialogues. The spaces represented in the field construction are all required.</p>

<h2>            SharePoint 365 Share Sub Folder but root folder not visible</h2>
                    
<p>We have the following folder structure:</p>
<pre><code>Folder A
------------Folder A.1
------------Folder A.2
------------Document A.1<br />Folder B<br />------------Folder B.1<br />------------Document B.1</code></pre>
<p>I want UserA to be able to see Folder A.2 but nothing else in that folder. UserA cannot initially see Folder A (inheritance removed) but can see Folder B. So I share Folder A.2 to UserA and using the link in the resulting email they can see the contents
 of that folder. However if they browse to the SharePoint site they can't see Folder A to then get to Folder A.2. What have I not done?!</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>It is a normal behavior that the user will not see the Folder A as he has only limited access permission on it. I would suggest the user access the folder A.2 directly via the invitation email or via the URL.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

Also later versions of Apple QuickTime should do. Possibly also newer Real Player versions.

<h2>            Text Box error when I backspace</h2>
                    <p>I have the following code that populates a text box based on the value of another text box:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Private Sub TextBoxPercentOne_Change()</p>

</p>
<p>When I enter a value in TBPercentOne, it populates correctly. But if I backspace as if I entered the wrong number, I get a code error: Runtime Error 13, Type Mismatch. This happens when I backspace enough to clear the box, so I think TBPercentTwo is trying
 to do math with no value. Question is, how do I fix it?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>We&nbsp;apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you.&nbsp; I know how important the emails that you want to recover. Hotmail will recover as many messages as possible and put them in your Deleted
 folder.&nbsp;But will not guarantee that all of&nbsp;your missing email messages will be available. If you don't see the deleted messages that you wanted, it means they are permanently lost.
<span>O</span></span><span>ur system can only restore recently deleted emails and emails that are still available on our server,</span><span>
 beyond that won't be possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p><span>Below&nbsp;are the possible reasons why emails got lost/deleted from a Hotmail account:<br />
<br />
1. Messages were manually deleted either due to accidental deletion or were moved or deleted due to your account filter settings.<br />
<br />
2. Messages were deleted due to account compromise issues where a hacker might have gained access to your account and deleted the emails.<br />
<br />
3. If you are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account. This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option “Always leave a copy of the message on the server” is not selected.<br />
<br />
4. The account was marked as “Inactive." Accounts become inactive if you don’t sign in for more than 270 days or within the first 10 days after signing up for an account.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>Also, please provide us your affected email address through the private message for investigation purposes.
</span><span>Kindly refer to the private message area or you
</span><span>need to click the notification that states “You have a private reply to this message. Click here to read it on our secure
</span><span>private messages section."</span><span>,
</span><span>be sure that you are signed in to view my message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p></span>

    <title>Outlook Calendar not syncing with Samsung BJII smartphone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattience  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Calendar not syncing with Samsung BJII smartphone</h2>
                    I have a BJII. I have been able to sync all well with Windows Vista and Wind Mobile Device Center (Activesync). All still syncs BUT the calendar. I have done nothing to the set up. The only thing I have done in the past week that is different is a battery
 pull since the phone was frozen. I am thinking this may be what is throwing the calendar off sync in Outlook. Any ideas on what I can do? I do something on the calndar and the sync starts and goes through the motions but then nothing is synced on the phone.
 Old Calendar entries are on the phone. I just cannot make adjustments etc where they sync. There is not a calendar box to check/uncheck on the activesync menu.
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Susana

Have you looked on the device under active sync as well as on the PC under WMDC?<br />

<h2>            Still &#34;fail to play test tone&#34; under 10061</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until the 10041, speakers configured in 5.1 failed to work, when set on 7.1 it's "working" with the side speakers disabled but not recognized by Razer Surround Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried to install Realtek R2.75 and R2.76 drivers which are recognized by 10061 but same problem about 5.1 and no more notification icon about Realtek (as it were in 10041 &amp; 10049)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you help me to fix that.</p>
<p>

            Thanks for your answer, unfortunatly it didn't work even when i tick in Compatility Tab : Windows 8.1 and Run as admin. Probably not because of that but now my start menu does not display (nVidia Beta for Win 10 just installed before). I read about a 10071
 / 10072 : is it deployed via Win Update or ISO download at this time ?&nbsp;

<p>To clarify... Your audio works fine in other configurations (like stereo) but with 5.1 you cannot play a test tone, right? And no other sounds works in 5.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when you play the test tone is there an error message, or just no test tone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> blc529  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing issues</h2>
                    <br />
I have an Dell 51v running Mobile 5.0 and XP SP2 on the pc.&nbsp; I have a program on the Dell that is supposed to show certain files om the ActiveSyc screen (acxtiveSync 4.5) when it syncs.&nbsp; When Activesync opens there are only 5 items listed:&nbsp; Calendar, contacts,
 tasks, notes and, files (written over a folder.) &nbsp; I have been told that partnerships are formed, however there is no indication of the word 'partnership' at any point when syncing. &nbsp; Does Activesync really indicate 'partnerships?'&nbsp;
<br />
Has anyone come across anything like I describe?&nbsp; If so, what have you done to fix the problem in Activesync?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thank you, <br />

            I don't understand your issue.&nbsp; What program are you referring to? Are your contacts, appintments, and tasks getting synced to your pocket pc? If you have achieved a successful ActiveSync partnership, your data will be synced to your pocket pc and you'll
 see the name of your pocket pc on the ActiveSync screen on your computer.<br />

<p>Prof Julie, the software I am referring to is called My Sports Training by Vitaone and puchased through Handango.&nbsp; When Activesync is open it displays&nbsp;the Outlook folders.&nbsp; The My Sports software&nbsp;has folders also
 that should display, but do not and that aspect is what I am referring to in my initial question.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope my explanation&nbsp;is clearer.

<p>The email address in question is no longer there so some key(s) I pressed must have had the desired effect although it didn't tell me so or remove the address at the time.&nbsp; [I do find updates to contacts on OWA take a time to be actioned]</p>
<p>I have checked with another contact that has 2 email addresses, and found the same problem, i.e. only the first appears to be amendable.&nbsp; This is no different when using another browser.</p>
<p>You mention clearing a data cache - which data cache were you referring to and how do I clear it?</p>

<p>Hi Lamont,</p>
<p>As the incident EX30031 is resolved, the issue you are encountering may be different.</p>
<p>To clarify the situation, I’d like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur when using any other admin account?<br />
2. Does the issue occur when using IE?<br />
3. Are you able to create a shared mailbox in the<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Exchange admin center</a>?<br />
4. Are there any duplicate contact objects in your organization?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Franky</p>

    <title>Your Mailbox Has Been Temporarily Moved On Microsoft Exchange - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vmichw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your Mailbox Has Been Temporarily Moved On Microsoft Exchange Server____</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using Outlook 2007 since 2007. Suddenly this morning, I started getting this error message saying:</p>
<p>You can connect to the temporary mailbox or work offline with all of your <br />
old data. If you choose to work with your old data, you cannot send or <br />
receive e-mail messages.<br />
[Use Temporary Mailbox] [Use Old Data] [Cancel]</p>
<p>I have searched for this issue and the most common answer(the only one) is to delete the account and re-ad it as new. I have done this and it still isnt working. I can use my email with the [Use Temportary Mailbox] and it has all of my emails in my {inbox}
 but I dont have my folders that I have created, which is many. If I chose [Use Old Data] I can see my old folders, but this is only offline with no option to place it online instead.</p>
<p>My email is a POP3 email account. No one in the office of 6 people have had this issues. We have had several issues with security with our ISP, but their tier 2 says it is a MS Outlook issue. This is driving me crazy, please, please help!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Check out this post from the forum it should help you. Basically you want to add in the old data and export it to a .pst and then create a new profile as the mailbox on the server has been recreated.&nbsp;<em>I am not sure how to give credit to the person who
 originally posted this asnwer.&nbsp; But here you go.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;just encountered the same problem, and was able to get all of my old data back to my new profile (contacts, saved e-mails, inbox folders, etc.).&nbsp; Before creating a new profile, when the error message appears,<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
 choose the option to use old data</span></strong>.&nbsp; When outlook loads (using Outlook 2010), go to File -&gt; Options and click on 'Advanced'.&nbsp; You should see an 'Export' section, click on the 'Export' button.&nbsp; An 'Import and Export Wizard' window will appear,
 click on 'Export to a File' and click next, then choose 'Outlook data file (.pst)'.&nbsp; The next screen will ask you a folder to export, in which you can choose from all your outlook folders...for a complete backup, I suggest choosing the root folder.&nbsp; It should
 be the name of your profile, for example: "username @hotmail.com".&nbsp; Make sure 'Include subfolders' is checked.&nbsp; The final screen will ask what location to store the .pst file in, and if you want to add a password to it.&nbsp; Now you've backed up all your Outlook
<p>To import the .PST to your new profile, make sure to change Outlooks default profile to the new one you've created (as Deli suggested).&nbsp; When outlook loads up, click on File -&gt; Open, and then click on 'Import'.&nbsp; Choose 'Import from another program or file'
 and click next, then choose 'Outlook data file (.pst)' and click next.&nbsp; Now you just point it to the .pst file you exported earlier, and all of your information will be imported into Outlook in its own folder.&nbsp; From there you can drag everything (emails, contacts,
 etc.) into the folders that you want.&nbsp; And that's it, hope this helps someone else.</p>
