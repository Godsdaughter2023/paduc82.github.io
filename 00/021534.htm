<h2>            Difference between exchange online plan 1 vs outlook.com free Email</h2>
                    I am an individual using windows live domains(outlook.com based) for my domain.I have 2 emails created at it.I currently use outlook 2013 to check my emails.

</div>
<div>I was thinking of shifting to Exchange online plan 1.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What are the differences between both and which one is better?</div>

</p><p>when I go to admin panel &gt; active user &gt; reset password then it tells me that I dont have the rights to reset global admin because I am only logged in as a costum admin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use your passwordreset link above, it tells me that the id (mailadress) is unknown but I can see the account in the 365 admin panel &gt; active user.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Getting an image to fade into body of flyer</h2>
                    I learned a very cool tip to make an image seem to fade into the body of a flyer.&nbsp; On top of the picture, I insert a shape or text box.&nbsp; I format it with a transparent fill effect that goes from 100% transparency to 0% transparency using the same color
 as the body of the flyer.&nbsp; It looks so professional on screen.&nbsp; However, if I try to print it - either hard copy print or print to PDF - the picture gets lost behind a completely non-transparent box.&nbsp; Does anybody have any idea why this can be happening and
 what I can do to achieve this effect?

            Mary - this was a great tip.&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; I did as you suggested and it worked for hard copy but not for PDF.&nbsp; However, I then grouped the image, transparency and background and right clicked THAT and saved it as a PNG then re-inputted it to Publisher
 and it worked!&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, I don't see resolution choices.

<p>Publisher doesn't do well with transparency or gradients.</p>
<p>A workaround: Create your shape, fill it with your transparency. Right-click the shape, save as a picture. Use the .png extension, there are resolution choices. Insert the picture into your publication.</p>

<h2>            Current Build update issues - Can I stay on present build for a while&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest builds of Win 10 seem to have problems with security software. I'm currently running build 14936 which is working ok.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I'm really busy with work and don't have time to fiddle with the builds. Is it possible to sit on this build until a later one arrives that will install with external security suites? Update wants to try again to install build 14946 but it will
 only fail and revert back to my current build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want it to continually try to install and fail every time I restart my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice appreciated</p>

<p>I am having a problem with the attachments drop down menu in Outlook. I am using Windows 10 on a Dell 2-in-one laptop. Every time I click on the Attachments when I am trying to send an e-mail with an attachment, the drop down for attachments flashes on the

<p>It also occasionally happens in other Microsoft Office applications.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? I have look everywhere and tried changing some of the settings to no avail.</p>

</p><p>I can click the button and it shows the watch momentarily, but the editor never appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can close the outlook options and continue using outlook 2013 normally</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a new profile, and it still does not show up</p>

</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled outlook 2013 and the signature editor still does not show up when I press the button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still see my previously signatures in the outlook signature folders, and I can add them to new emails manually, but I cannot set up a new signature, or change the options to have a default signature for each email account.</p>

            <p>Hello Aravinda</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestions. I have tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- sending email from Word, and attempting to access signatures from this area</p>
<p>
</p><p>- turning off Microsoft Security Essentials (it was suggested below that idea that anti-virus was the problem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Neither of these has worked. The same result: I select "Signatures..." and after a short moment of the cursor changing to a watch, it reverts to an arrow and nothing further happens</p>

<h3> siraff  say:</h3>
<h2>            30 day wait to buy a game&#63; How is this helpful because it&#39;s really annoying.</h2>
                    Why does it take 30 days to update info? I clicked update info after simply forgetting my password (like most people do since you have to swap them all the time for no real reason anyway) and now I can't buy a game for 30 days!?<br />
<br />
I can walk into a bank and get a loan in less than an hour on the same card linked to my account so what possible use is this wait?<br />
There is no other store or medium I can think of which has such a drawn out, pointless process. In almost any other case I can go on a site, put details in and buy what I like within a few minutes.
<br />
I would love to hear the excuse for it since even banks don't have extended waiting times like this.

            Hi <strong>siraff</strong>,<br />
<br />
We appreciate you for taking time in providing us the feedback about the 30-day process of
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10634/microsoft-account-replace-all-security-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">resetting the security information on your account</a></strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The waiting period is originated by <strong>Microsoft</strong> to help us prevent unauthorized people from attempting to totally take over an account that they do not own. These hackers may obtain anyone's password through phishing or shared passwords across
 third-party platforms. The waiting period will provide a sufficient amount of time for the real account owner to be notified and cancel any changes they haven't done.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
During this 30-day period, you'll still be able to access most Microsoft services. You won't, however, be able to do things that need a security code, like changing your password, viewing billing information, or buying new apps or games from
<strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Store</strong> or on <strong>Xbox</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This process of resetting can be canceled if you will get access to the security info you have changed yourself. For example, phone number. However, if there's none, the full 30 days is required for it to complete and you'll be notified that the new security
 info has been added to the account.<br />
<br />
If you have additional questions, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.&nbsp;

<p>I deleted the audio file from the presentation, then made a duplicate copy of the file.</p>
<p>"Use recorded timings and narrations" was greyed out.</p>
<p>Under that I clicked "preview timings and recordings." The presentation played with the audio throughout all slides, so I clicked "create video."</p>
<p>However when playing the created video it was absent of sound.</p>

<h2>            AND, OR, LIKE, NOT LIKE - Making A Robust Query</h2>
                    <p>I'd like to make a query that works in the fashion of a search engine on my database. I realized it would be useful to have the capability to search for criteria LIKE or not LIKE, multiple fields to further filter (AND) as well as expand (OR) results. I've
 been focused on creating a single form that will run a query based on the input for the fields on it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea how to make this happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to invoke a statement through a parameter? (ex. using a checkbox to indicate using "NOT" or "OR")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like this has been done many times by actual search engines (admittedly not on access)</p>

            <p>As I said, users can enter the same kinds of things you can enter in the query designer's Criteria row.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a form with a text box (named txtSrchA)&nbsp;where users can enter the search conditions for a Text field named FieldA and another text box (named txtSrchB) for a Currency field named FieldB, then the BuildCriteria function can be used
 in a VBA procedure like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.txtSrchA) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strWhere = strWhere&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;" AND " &amp; BuildCriteria("FieldA" , dbText, Me.txtSrchA)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.txtSrchB) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strWhere = strWhere &amp; " AND " &amp; BuildCriteria("FieldB" , dbCurrency, Me.txtSrchB)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "SearchResults", WhereCondition:= Mid(strWhere, 6)</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;and that would take care of users searching FieldA for&nbsp;criteria like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Red"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like "*ABC*"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not Like "*##/##/##*"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ="Red" Or ="Blue" Or ="Teal"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; IN("Red", "Blue")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not IN("Pink", "Purple", "Lime")</p>
<p>and things like this for FieldB:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.95<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;=15.00 And &lt;&nbsp;20.00<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 15 And 19.99<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not Null<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            paste method of worksheet class failed for simple macro</h2>
                    <p>I have a macro to create a date stamp, that has worked for the last year, and no longer works.</p>

            The version that I posted will set the <strong>value</strong> of the cell to the date and time that the macro is run. This value will not change, unless you run the macro again, or edit the cell manually.

            <p><span>Hi Adam,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per your issue, I suggest you to start Outlook in safe mode following&nbsp;steps mentioned below and then try sending emails:<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:<br />
Outlook /safe <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: There is space between Outlook and /.<br />
<br />
If Outlook works&nbsp;in&nbsp;safe&nbsp;mode as expected, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below to determine the problem causing add-in:<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above information helps. Reply with the result and I’ll be happy to assist you further.<br />

            A power bank or a new charger will not help are you just getting a message saying your phone is charging slowly or is it actually charging slowly? The message is a known bug and will go away if however it is actually charging slowly try a soft reset by
 turning your phone on then press and hold the volume down and the power buttons until it vibrates then release them and it will restart don't touch the screen until it restarts

<h3> jimrucker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Security isn&#39;t improving</h2>
                    <p>Let me start by stating that I'm a former computer security consultant. Computer security over the years has been a cat&amp;mouse game. OS'es get minor security improvements - hackers get more sophisticated tools. The problem is that the hackers are getting
 better at a faster pace than the OS.</p>
<p>I look at the posts on the forum here and I see that most of the posts are "I'm having a problem with my anti-virus" or "How do I get rid of this malware?". These are the posts I would expect for Windows 95 - this shouldn't still be a problem 20 years later!
 If you want an example of security failures with the new Windows 10, just "bing" vlc. The first link - a sponsored link noless (shame on you Bing!) - is not vlc, but malware made to look like the vlc installer. When you run the installer it infects Win10 just
 as well as any other version of windows.</p>
<p>Security is difficult- no question about that. But, there are plenty of examples of good security out there that MS can make use of. Here are some that MS should immediately adopt:</p>
<p>1. Virtualization - I usually use VmWare or Virtualbox to create environments that allow me to work in an environment without risk. I do most of my web browsing in virtual systems, and any Adobe product that I run is ALWAYS in a virtual system.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft already created Hyper-V as a virtualization environment, but so far only uses it for business. If they were to leverage this on the desktop using a system similar to Qubes they could provide a secure robust system. This would require working
 with hardware vendors to produce better virtualization (I'm looking at you Nvidia!), and would result in lower performance for hardware that doesn't provide virtualization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Sandboxie - This little program is wonderful because it allows you to install and run programs in an isolated environment. Once you're done you can see the changes that were made in the program and either allow or deny them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Docker - Similar to the sandboxie, this provides a contained environment, but with the added benefit of allowing stacking. So, you can have a base install (Adobe product), then have your sensitive container based on this, and another non-sensitive container,
 neither of which could access the other. Additionally, for some types of projects these containers are easy to ship to customers as an alternative to complicated install processes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, I just want to say to MS that you need to do better. Too many people are suffering from the ill effects or malware and while it has provided me with a stable job for years, I find myself being called upon for cleaning up the messes of friends and
 family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft created commercials years ago saying that they asked people what they wanted in their OS, and that they listened. Well, here is my wish - I want to be able to go into a Microsoft store, and download any program off the internet and run it, and
 have the store employee not have to worry for one second what that program is- because the next version of Windows is impervious to malware. I've thrown down the gauntlet, and the ball is in your court.</p>

            <p>To add another note, syncing all your devices (mobile phone, laptop, tablet, desktop pc, etc...) using one microsoft account?&nbsp; What kind of security risk does that leave all of your devices if your account gets hacked?&nbsp; Would they have access to all your
 devices and private files (photos, resumes, private letters, etc...?&nbsp; Kind of makes you wonder.&nbsp; I mean if the government and large corporations are being hacked why couldn't these hackers access your devices?</p>

            I have never heard pof a virus-laden cellphone. could these be avenues as to which now we will have to protect our mobile devices like fort knox? I have been leary of all the safety concerns with cloud services since they became popular. it bothers me
 that apps have unfettered access to location, camera, mic, hdd's, roms,files, folders, ECt by default in win10. I expect that on my cellphone and act accordingly by not doing sensitive stuff on that device, but i sure didnt expect my Pc to go to that option!
 IS THERE ANYWHERE SAFE to keep my personal info anymore besides in my head?<br />

            <p>The "bing" search engine placing ads first with maleware is not unique to MS.&nbsp; Google does the same.&nbsp; Case in point, another user of my pc&nbsp;downloaded firefox from the 1st link listed by google, a PUP was installed on my fresh w10 install.&nbsp;

<p>

 from the same maleware, Binkit or something like that, but it was after it installed).&nbsp;

            <p>What I want to see is an OS whereby I could download and install anything. If it was malware, it should be a easy to remove - not by having a malware removing toolkit, but by having an OS that is aware of changes, isolates those changes, and allows the user
 visibility and control over them.</p>
<p>The real problem with security is the lack of control on the part of the user! Can someone- anyone answer this question- if a keylogger was installed on any version of windows, where can you go to see that it exists?! The control panel has a keyboard app,
 but that doesn't tell you what programs are logging keys. You could try looking at the services that are running, but its just a long list of undecipherable names, and its not like a hacker is going to name their executable IHaxxorU.exe. The control panel
 should look like a Powerpoint slide showing every component of your system, all the software associated with each component, how they're connected, and it should allow you to examine/disable/remove/etc each of them! A keylogger would be easy to spot- it's
 connected to my keyboard, collecting all keystrokes, and to my network card, not to the display driver, it is not a built-in OS program, and it was installed on xyz date.&nbsp;</p>

            If it is a "checkbox" you can double-click it and set it to "Checked" or "Not checked"
<div><br />
<div>If it is a "Character" you need to insert a new one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the Insert&gt;Symbol&gt;All Symbols menu, the "Ballot Box with X" and "Ballot box with check" are in the eighth segment down. &nbsp;Double-click it to insert it as a character replacing the one you have.</div>

            Not contradicting John whatsoever, but if this is a properly constructed form (such as would be downloaded from a web site) you should not have to edit/replace the characters in the document. You should be able to either click the box to place a check
 in it or tab to the check box &amp; press the space bar.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that there may be something more about this application document &amp; its source that you haven't revealed :-) Are you sure this application is intended to be completed electronically?<br />

            I concur with your second paragraph, which I think is what John's&nbsp;'If it is a "character"' option is intended to deal with.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Print, fill in manually and scan/email or fax is also an option in that case, but then you have to be able to do all those things.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>If it is a Word Document built on either Windows or Mac Word with "legacy forms", it would be strange for the developer not to have protected for forms because it's not hard to do. But I suppose that could happen, and that the user would need to be able
 to enable the Developer tab via Word-&gt;Preferences then protect the form.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>It would I think be even stranger for a developer to use content control checkboxes because they are only understood by Windows Word 2010 and 2013 (not even the Word Web App, as far as I can tell). In Mac Word you would have to use John's 'If it is a "character"'
 option. Even that will not work if the controls have been marked as not deletable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Using old ActiveX controls also wouldn't work on Mac Word, but should respond to the 'If it is a "character"' option as long as the Document has not been protected for forms. You'd be deleting a graphic rather than a character in that case.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What happens to Acrobat Forms if you open them in Word these days?</div>

            First, thank you all for your feedback. I am very new to formatting MS Words objects, and I am appreciative. This is what I ended up doing. The application I am filling out belongs to MSW program at CSU Hayward, and you can check out the format for yourself
 if you like. The question I am trying to answer by typing (not printing, filling and faxing) was "Your gender". Common question for most college apps!
<div><br />
<div>I double clicked on the box, a symbol window appeared, full of different small symbols. I used the "checked" symbol for simplicity purpose. It did take away the box in front of the "Male" word, which was not my intention, but I am okay with it, and replaced
 it with a checked mark.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I really wanted to place a check in the box ( I think it would be placing one object (a box) under a another (a check mark), and making the box transparent. I did try to place a box and make it transparent, but I can't make the box to match the "Female"
 box next to it. Due t whatever reason, the box dimensions are only somewhat controllable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for the programer and not making the job easier for the person filling out the form, well.... I let you go in there and decide for yourself how a university application may look like for a Master's degree!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you again for all your feedback and help.</div>

            Ok, I see the .pdf but the gender question in there doesn't look what you described so I would also assume it's a different form. But if you have the form and can post it somewhere so we can download it, that would help. It's late here so I am not likely
 to be able to do more for 8 hours or so, but perhaps someone else will be able to look.

            Okay since CSU East Bay Hayward just changed their Graduate application, and I really want to know how to do this, I am going to have to make up a page. It is very simple:
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Please specify your gender: &nbsp; Male (a box here) &nbsp; &nbsp; Female (another box here)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The above was given to me on the application. How do I place an "x" or check mark in the boxes that was provided to me above. I could have easily printed the page and mark it, but I think MS Words should be able to do this; no?</div>

            Can you post the file online somewhere so we can download it? (I use Skydrive, but there are other options) .
<div><br />
<div>It's going to be easier to look at what the file contains that way, and without knowing that, it's going to be difficult to make good suggestions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That said, if you can't delete the existing check box using any of the suggestions so far, the only other reasonably easy ways to make it disappear are</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. to edit-copy all the text except undeletable textboxes, chunk by chunk, into a new document, then add your new textbox(es), or</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. select the check box and use format-&gt;font to mark it as hidden, and insert the checkbox you really want. The problem with that is that if the recipient has "Show hidden text" switched on, they will see two checkboxes and may not know how to interpret
 that. At the least you would probably have to add your new text box, then enclose the old text box in some explanatory text something like this</div>
<div>(Please ignore this text box: &lt;the old text box&gt;)</div>
<div>and hide the old text box and the explanatory text.</div>

            Okay, sorry it took me so long. I have placed the file on Google Docs. In all fairness, Google Docs distorted the file, and I put it back as well as I could, but lets not lose focus. The issue was placing a "x" or check mark over a square where it asks
 for gender (Pg. 1). Please let me know how it goes. I have made the file public, so everyone can access it.

    <title>Band alert when out of Bluetooth range - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Band alert when out of Bluetooth range</h2>
                    <p>It would be great if the Band could vibrate or alert when it loses Bluetooth connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a couple of occasions I've left my mobile in my car when I've parked and headed off to work. If the Band alerted me when it was out of range I could go back and retrieve it instead of getting to work (some distance away) and realising I'd forgotten my
 phone.</p>

<h2>            IE11 can&#39;t post form data to specific frame or window dialog opened via window.open&#40;&#41;</h2>
                    <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Hello,</font></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Form POST targeting to specific frame&nbsp;or dialog popped up via window.open() no longer works in IE11.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>It worked fine in IE10 and previous versions of IE.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Please see screenshot attached with simple test that reproduces this problem.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78842975-af09-4480-bfd2-2b7095b64993" /><br />
I tested this on fresh install of Windows 2012R2 while testing our web application with the new IE11.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I believe doing this on Windows 8.1 with IE11 will result in same bug/problem.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our web application uses a technique whereby it launches a popup window via call to window.open(), passing blank URL and specifying a name for the new
 window. It then does a from post targeting the name of new dialog.<br />
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In IE11 this functionality has been broken and no longer works.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Problem is that IE11, instead of posting form to the newly created dialog, it launches a new instance of IE and then loads the requested form in this
 new instance of IE, while the dialog launched via window.open() remains on screen and is empty. If user repeats launching same form post request (via button click), IE 11 keeps creating new empty dialogs and new IE instance for every form post executed. This
 totally breaks our application because we use many so called "wizards" that encapsulate specific functionality in separate web page launched in a popup window.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Another related problem is that if a dialog is launched with window.open(), the java script code in the dialog can not target the parent frame that opened
 the dialog anymore. So result is that we can't refresh the parent frame after the pop up dialog closes. Instead, IE11 launches a new instance of IE (not just a tab, but a whole new instance) and loads the parent frame in it.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;<br />
The problem seems to be caused by broken frame name targeting mechanism in IE11.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Note that we force IE to compatibility mode 5, but even without specifying any compatibility, the problem remains.<br />
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Has anyone else encountered this problem?
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our web application is massive, it is used by thousands of users in an intranet environment globally, works fine with IE11 except for this very serious
 crippling problem. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Any insight or help is appreciated.</font></p>
<font color="#000000">
<p><br />
Expected: IE11 should correctly post form to and load targeted page in the newly popped up dialog, without opening new IE instance and new tab. Repeatedly posting form to existing popup window should reuse that window, not keep on launching more popup windows
 and then more IE instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Steps to reproduce the problem (include URL if applicable):</p>
<p><br />
1) Create page1.htm: &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;display "I'm in a popup window now ..."&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>2) Create page2.htm with a button and onclick() event calling function to open dialog, and do form POST targeting new dialog calling page1.htm, like below.</p>
<p>&lt;input type="button" onClick="Popup(this.form);" name="btn2" value="Popup Dialog"&gt; function Popup(f){</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window.open("","MyNewDialogName","width=200,height=150");</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.action = "page1.asp"; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.target = "MyNewDialogName"; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.submit();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>3) Open IE11, navigate to page2.htm, click the "Popup Dialog" dialog button. IE 11 will popup the new dialog, but then it will also launch new instance of IE11 and display the page1.htm in it, instead of in the popup dialog.<br />

<h3> christopher nieves  say:</h3>
<h2>            O365 and access to OneDrive, what permission&#40;s&#41; are required to access other users OneDrives&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been having trouble tracking down any documentation from Microsoft that outlines what level of access a user requires to access another's OneDrive site outside of being a global admin. If only SharePoint global admins (and not regular SharePoint admins)
 can access other user's OneDrive sites that is fine but I need documentation that explains this so that I can properly request Global Admin to conduct my scans of OneDrive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software I'm using is purposed to scan SharePoint Online and OneDrive, to scan OneDrive/personal sites for permissions and sensitive data. We provide an option to add our account as an admin to personal sites or the company administrators so that we
 can scan them but since today we only require SharePoint admin to scan sites in SharePoint Online we get push back for asking for Global Admin just for the OneDrive sites. To our customers Global Admin permission seems excessive for our purposes (and it is)
 but so far this is the only approach that seems to enable our account to scan those sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any documentation that explains that OneDrive sites are private by default and are inaccessible to even SharePoint admins but require global admin permission is what I am looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p><span>Hi Christopher,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that you are a SharePoint administrator in your company and want to add yourself as the second administrator to all users’ OneDrive for Business libraries
 via SharePoint Online Management Shell. If yes, you shouldn’t need to do that via SharePoint CSOM and you should be able to do that via the following steps &nbsp;in SharePoint Online Management Shell.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Connect to SharePoint Online with your account (SharePoint administrator) in SharePoint Online Management Shell via the following commands.</span></p>
<p><span>$adminUPN="&lt;the full email address of a SharePoint administrator account, example: jdoe@contosotoycompany.onmicrosoft.com&gt;"</span></p>
<p><span>$orgName="&lt;name of your Office 365 organization, example: contosotoycompany&gt;"</span></p>
<p><span>$userCredential = Get-Credential -UserName $adminUPN -Message "Type the password."</span></p>
<p><span>Connect-SPOService -Url https://$orgName-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential $userCredential</span></p>
<p><span>2. Copy the following script to Notepad and save the file as a xx.ps1 file.</span></p>
<p><span>Function Add-OnedriveSecondaryAdmin($AdminURL,$SecondaryAdmin)</span></p>
<p><span>{</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #connect Spo service.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect-SPOService -Url $AdminURL</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #Get all Onedrive URL's.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $OneDriveURLs = Get-SPOSite -IncludePersonalSite $true -Limit All -Filter "Url -like '-my.sharepoint.com/personal/'"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach($OneDriveURL in $OneDriveURLs)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #Add Secondary administrator to Onedrive Site.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set-SPOUser -Site $OneDriveURL.URL -LoginName $SecondaryAdmin -IsSiteCollectionAdmin $True -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write-Host "Added secondary admin to the site $($OneDriveURL.URL)"
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</span></p>
<p><span>}</span></p>
<p><span>Add-OnedriveSecondaryAdmin -SecondaryAdmin "xx@xx " -AdminURL "https://xx-admin.sharepoint.com"</span></p>
<p><span>3. Run ./xx.ps1 in SharePoint Online Management Shell to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3811b02-5c9e-4475-a7e1-192a5ca41228?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3811b02-5c9e-4475-a7e1-192a5ca41228?upload=true" /></a>
<p><span>Meanwhile, about “</span><span>&nbsp;I can't log into the site and add myself as a site
 collection admin for our scans.&nbsp;</span>“, could you upload some related screenshots for our clarification?</p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>

    <title>Reopen previously closed windows in Outlook 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bibifit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reopen previously closed windows in Outlook 2007</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Before SP3 of Outlook 2007, it was possible to automatically reopen windows <br />
previously closed through File-&gt;Exit. (Typically a mail , a calendar <br />
a contact windows, opened with a right click,...)<br />
<br />
Since SP3, this nice facility does not work anymore: when launched Outlook 2007 does not remember windows open in a previous session, and opens ONE
<br />
window only, and you need to manually open extra windows, as well as manually set their display parameters.<br />
<br />
Any solution ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
<br />

<h3> stevebelford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yammer Merge and O365 sign-in for Yammer</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, wonder if someone can assist kindly</p>
<p>2 questions really:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>When you merge Yammer networks, for example we currently have contosonew.com as our Yammer enterprise network and we would merge contosoold.com into the master. Both domains would be verified in the O365 tenant associated to the contosonew.com network.<br />
<br />
I understand that the content on contosoold.com would be lost but the users accounts would remain unchanged?<br />
<br />
They would still be able to logon to yammer with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. If, in the future the user was migrated from an email account on contosoold.com to contosonew.com then the user would simply need to go to the profile page in Yammer and edit the logon address
 to a valid contosonew.com email address.<br />
<br />
Is this correct?<br />
<br />
</li><li>We currently use O365 sign-in for Yammer to allow our users from with contosonew.com domain to sign on to Yammer, using their O365 credentials seamlessly. After the above merge will this be affected and will O365 sign-in for Yammer be available for all
 users on the O365 tenant irrespective of which email address they have (contosonew.com or contosoold.com) ?
</li></ol>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Yammer.&nbsp;I understand that you have some verification with regard to Yammer merge and Office 365 sign-in for Yammer. Do not worry, I am here to help you.</span></p>
<p>These are the answers to your questions, after the network merger process:</p>
<p>1. Yes, it is correct. The users in the "merged" network will lose access to their pre-created content and be re-directed the primary/parent network.&nbsp;&nbsp;All data from the merged network will be deprecated. Only the users profile will be retained.</p>
<p>2. The Office 365 Sign-in for Yammer will be available to users from the merged network provided that the domain is verified under the same tenant as the primary network.<br />
</p>
<p>If you have other clarifications about your concern, please let me know.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Jonathan</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer, very much appreciated.</p>
<p>The only area that i still need confirmation around is that of migration of users between merged networks. If after the above scenario we merge additional validated domains into the master Yammer network, is it possible for users to migrate themselves to
 another merged domain (effectively changing their username) by simply editing their email address in their profile?</p>
<p>We have a highly mobile workforce that regularly move around the organisation and want to ensure users can associate their accounts with the right domain to stop duplicate accounts in Yammer being created.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Steve</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply. And I understand that you wanted to confirm this to us and i would be glad to help you.</p>
<p>To answer your question if the users can migrate to another merged domain, the answer is yes. However, they can not do it per user level, only the admin can change it by using the Bulk Update feature in Yammer. The Verified admin can update their email address
 with the new domain that you have.</p>
<p>I hope I was able to answer your question. Please don't hesitate to reply to this email.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if anyone experience this problem.. I lost all my map data after I update the Taiwan map when I was in Taiwan. The reason is I was forced to update the Taiwan map again when I was in Taiwan.&nbsp;:smileymad:&nbsp; Before I travel to Taiwan, I have updated
 several maps, included Taiwan map in local.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I used GPS in Taiwan( I use Taiwan paid card to make call), no map was displayed and I was very puzzle and annoy because I thought I installed the Taiwan. I tried whole day, and tried to get it worked but failed.&nbsp;:smileymad: I used hotel's wifi to check
 the map and was prompted to update the Taiwan map again. Puzzle.. but update anyway. It worked when I traveled around Taipei.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the problem come... When I back home here and no maps were shown, except the Taiwan map!! Again, I went online to download the maps. It wasted my efforts and time to download the maps' data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is I want to know;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Do maps' data store inside my phone when downloaded?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) If so, why I traveled aboard and the maps will not display except the local(singapore) map?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Even though the maps are free for download, but I have to buy data plan from other countries when travel. I though the maps can use globally?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Will 3rd party GPS works in my C6-00? For example Garmin, if nokia maps are not reliable..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look forward to share some advises, thanks.&nbsp; :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>1) Assuming here that you have a microSD card in your C6-01as not enough free space in phone memory for storing map data.</p>
<p>2) If you fly to another destination all stored GPS ephemeris data is outdated and can take a considerable while to lock on to new location.</p>
<p>3) Both Ovi Maps needs to be "Offline" and Assisted GPS postional method needs to be disabled to not incur data cost and it can take considerably longer to establish location using only Integral GPS in device.</p>
<p>4) Garmin Mobile Xt would work with C6-00.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As 0.2.45.109 map series only recently released, this may have been reason why you were prompted to update your stored map data.</p>
