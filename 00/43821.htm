            Hi there, thanks for your question. Hopefully I can help!
<br />
<br />You can try these troubleshooting steps to see if the problem persists:
<br />
<br />Perform a clean boot:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135...</a>
<br />Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />Run the System File Checker tool:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />DISM:

<br />
<br />I would also recommend updating your graphics drivers to see if it fixes your issue. Depending on the brand of your graphics card, you can find the drivers here:
<br />
<br />AMD Radeon:
<br /><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amd.com/en/support</a>
<br />NVIDIA GeForce:

<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />Also, it might help to run a malware scan using the below apps:

    <title>Win 10 Background setting changes from &#39;slideshow&#39; to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lyleyork  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10  Background setting changes from &#39;slideshow&#39; to &#39;picture&#39; every time I reboot PC</h2>
                    I do not know when this started happening but I am on the latest version of Win 10 Version 1809 and my sync settings appear to be set correctly.&nbsp; I can set the background setting to 'slideshow' and select Webshots Wallpaper and everything works fine until
 I reboot and then the background setting resets to 'Picture'.&nbsp; I see there is a workaround using the Group Policy Editor and enabling "Prevent changing desktop background" but would prefer not doing that if there is another fix instead.

            Good day ! I am an independent adviser here to help you!
<br />
<br />For this, it may be as simple as doing this: 
<br />
<br />Click windows key + A &gt; Accounts &gt; click "sync your settings" and under individual sync settings find theme and turn the syncing off. 
<br />
<br />Change back to slideshow then restart your PC to see if it sticks.

            Hi there, thanks for your question.

<p>Dear Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Powershell solution had no effect.</p>
<p>Either typing the command or cut-and-paste there was no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in using the troubleshooter I had it solve a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, after attempting to go to Settings it still quickly flashed away and running the troubleshooter still shows the same prompt for damaged cache.</p>

<h2>            Critical Structure Corruption In Windows 10</h2>
                    I have recently installed win10 and on the 2nd day of using I m facing a problem, randomly a blue screen appear with the message "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you" and
 below this message its written as "Search online for error CRITICAL STRUCTURE CORRUPTION". According to me what I found while searching the solution of this problem is that this problem start once the system went under the sleep mode after coming out from
 sleep mode this problem start. Earlier, I was using win7 and I have installed a fresh copy of win10 and I don't have any back up left from which I can go back to win7. Please provide the effective solution of this problem as soon as possible.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION bug indicates that the kernel has detected critical kernel code or data corruption.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to try the below methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Download and install the latest drivers and chipset drivers from the manufactures’ website and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Perform Clean boot.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>A
<strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.</span></span></p>

            Hi Creedmonce 
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Microphone 
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your microphone' is turned on and make sure the Skype app is also set to On
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you, open the Settings App, go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Recording Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter

<p>Your reply is for people running on Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is occurring on iOS, both the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Premium on Windows 10 and thought it would carry over to iOS, but after the free month of Premium I stopped getting double points for my Daily Challenge completions and also now have ads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting the app and redownloading from the iOS App Store but still cannot subscribe to Premium on my iPad or iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running on iOS 10.2</p>

</p><p>I also tried subscribing over cellular instead of Wi-Fi, but still no joy.</p>

<h2>            How do i do a &#34;destructive recovery&#34;</h2>
                    So this all started with my question, Why wont my service pack 1 install.<br />
<br />
A awesome person by the name of <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c6c9a069-9cc9-4641-af8c-2d68ddfe1132">
PA Bear MS MVP</a> helped me out a lot and told me i have a ongoing&nbsp;hijackware infection, possibly compounded by a rootkit (or bootkit) infection.<br />
<br />
He said i need to refomat my drive.<br />
<br />
I called around and everyone wants 125$ to reformat and install windows 7 fresh.<br />
<br />
Seeing as how im only 14 i cant afford that.<br />
<br />
So he also suggested doing a "destructive recovery" in a hidden partation.<br />
<br />
How do i get to that Hidden partatiion and how do i do a "destructive recovery"?<br />

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span>Note that unless you save all important stuff, it will be lost after the reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your laptop has been supplied with a recovery partition in place of disks</p>
<p>. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes</span></p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p><span>For Advent, r</span><span>estart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to try more than once to get any of the above to work. If after repeated attempts, you have no luck or the machine reports that there is no recovery partition, your only option is to contact
 the computer manufacturer and ask for recovery disks for the model.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the reset, you should get<span style="font-weight: bold"> all</span> updates from Windows Update EXCEPT for hardware devices. Next, you should install a good anti-virus solution. ONLY AFTER you have
 done this should you replace stuff from backups or install anything else.</p>

<h2>            File Complaint- Router Hacked through XBox Live account</h2>
                    
<p>My son was playing COD Black-ops II and got into a disagreement with one of the players. That player, ( Gamer Tag"&nbsp;
<strong>[GT Removed by Moderator]</strong> " hacked our internet&nbsp; through the XBox live connection and shut down our router and internet access.&nbsp; I was home working and left to try and resolve the situation, by reconfiguring and changing teh passwords and security
 level on all of our connected devices.&nbsp; It is my understanding that it is illegal to hack someones account, not to mention their hardware.&nbsp; This same person told my son's friends, that if they didn't friend him, he would hack them as well. I have talked with
 my son as well as his friends and warned them, again, not to play with someone they don't know.</p>
<p>I hope that XBox Enforcement will take some form of action to resolve this as well as ensure that it doesn't happen to anyone else.</p>

<p>Shut off your router for a few days to change your IP. That should stop you from getting booted offline.</p>

<p>Sounds like you are being DDos'ed, &nbsp;DDoS means denial of service attack, and what that does is flood up your hardware/modem with thousends of gigabytes eating up and flooding your connection to the internet. DDoSing is illegal, i suggest posting your problem
 in the accounts and suspensions forum, call up microsoft directly via phone to make them aware of this issue imediately, and then report it to your local law agency (police station).
</p>
<p>Not only is DDoSing against xbox lives terms of use but its also against the law and can be punishable with real life consequences, after making microsoft xbox live and your local police aware of the issue mictosoft will be willing to help give out information
 to police after investigation. With this information it will hopefully be enough to trace the vicitm and arrest him along with the porputraiter and legal law breaker</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Contacting MS in regards to a DDoS attack is like calling the Coast Guard in regards to a mugging on Wall Street. A DDoS attack should be reported to your local authorities since it is against the law. Currently it carries a ten
 year sentence in the USA. Once you file the report with your local authorities THEY will contact MS for any relevant information to the case.

<p>I am sorry that you got hacked! But I was very happy to come across your post! My son's console was hacked as well as his account. This hacker was able to pull up a CC that was used one time to purchase a game and then all the info was removed he then used
 that CC to purchase over 300.00 worth of games and packs. Now here is where it gets odd- all of this was downloaded to my sons console. But at the time this was being done my son was not even at home and his console was turned off. I even told the people at
 Xbox I could provide them with video proof that he was at a Walmart when 3 of the purchases were being made. Their response was he did this. So now it is left up to me to find the person who did this.

<p>Hi, just to let you know that microsoft and xbox live, wont do nothing and they never will. I was also DDOSed and told xbox via phone call. They stated, they wouldn't be able to do anything, so I reported them to the police, as my router was hacked by one
 of the subscript The police took my statement and told me to contact my provider to change my IP, and also speak to a solicitor to take action against microsoft for its failings in your security.</p>

<p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We acknowledge that you would like to remove an application from your computer. However, MS Paint is one of the built-in applications of Windows 10 and cannot be removed. As for the issue regarding your email, kindly provide us the information we need below
 for us to effectively assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages when opening your emails?</li><li>If yes, tell us the exact error message.</li><li>When you stated that "No matter what I try to download paint pops up" are you meaning that the Paint application is the one opening your image files?</li><li>Which version of Windows 10 are you using?</li><li>Have you made any significant changes to your computer that may have triggered the issue?</li><li>To remove the possibility of your programs being blocked, are you using any third-party antivirus programs?</li><li>If yes, have you tried to disable them and check for any pending updates and see if it helps?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
</p>
<p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            windows phone update error 0x8000ffff.</h2>
                    <p>Lumia550. Repeated problems in updating windows 10. Phone is always hot to touch and battery drains very quickly although not in use. Very basic usage, deactivated most apps. Would appreciate some advice.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>To assist you better, I request you to answer the following question:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Did the computer come with Win10 64-bit preinstalled or did you upgrade a Win7 or Win8.1 computer to Win10?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>As an initial step, I suggest you to follow the below instruction to fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>As an initial troubleshooting steps, I would suggest you to do soft reset. The soft reset is the same thing as pulling your battery (on devices where that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your
 phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>You can perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then press and hold the volume down + power buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during the process
 (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Example of situations where the soft reset should solve the problem:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>•An app that usually starts won't start<br />
•The camera won't open<br />
•The device starts using too much battery<br />
•The device starts behaving oddly</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I suggest you to visit the link below, select the Battery and charge section and try the troubleshooting steps provided to fix the issue.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Skype 12</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have just purchased a touch screen laptop (in pad mode) for my father who has Dementia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The intention was to setup Skype for him so he can touch select the names listed down left side of screen, which he can do and loves the fact he can dial people.&nbsp; Unfortunately the sort order changes and I want to fix the Sort Order in place. Hopefully many
 of you will have a friend or relative with dementia and understand the need for simplicity, the confusion it causes if things change.&nbsp; Just getting him to touch the name and video call button has been challenging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot seem to figure out how to Sort these names.&nbsp; I inserted a number in front of the names as follows thinking it would sort automatically for example -</p>
<p>
</p><p>001 Joe Brown (Son)</p>
<p>002 Harry Brown (Brother)</p>
<p>003&nbsp;</p>
<p>004</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it remains in the order it was inserted.&nbsp; The favorites is not an option and again I hope many of you understand why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciated if anyone can help and direct me to a solution.&nbsp; This should be a very simple settings option and maybe I am looking in the wrong place, some guidance would be great</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>

<p>I'm sorry to say but, no version of Skype has a sort order. Some have filters such as Unread, Online, Best Friends, and Family (those are available in Skype Classis but it's not touch friendly). The standard list shows contacts in order last used so, yes,
 that's going to change all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of health to your wonderful father.</p>

<p>Thanks Roy&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is really disappointing, i saw the sort order changing while i was setting everything up for him, and then sat with him repeating the two steps (a) touch the name your dialing and (b) touch the video call. &nbsp;Practiced this over and over until he finally
 the penny dropped but we were practicing with one phone number (my brothers). Then i asked him to dial his sister but you could see his confusion when names swapped around. The difficulty with Dementia is they do not tell you they are confused as they do not
 want to look silly, they simply give up......i stopped immediately and said “i will fix sort order for you” believing it would be a simply setting option.</p>
<p>If you know of any upgrade or disability settings or alternative would be greatly appreciated if you could let me know.</p>
<p>Thank you for reply</p>

<p>Hi Julie</p>
<p>The OS is Windows 10 Home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just purchased the laptop to solve a problem for dad. He does have a very basic mobile phone (not smart phone) which luckily he used to wear around his neck and so he continues to remember to do this.
</p>
<p>He can answer a phone call but if he needs to call someone it is beyond him. I often see him try, he looks at the phone, but basically stares at the keypad :-(</p>
<p>The laptop is sitting on a table very visible right next to his chair and figure he can dial family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would certainly upgrade or perhaps there is a disability selection or feature that you could suggest.</p>
<p>Thanks Julie for reply</p>

<p>I work with someone who's 90 and lost a leg so they're bed ridden. They've been never very interested in tech but, now that they're limited on what they do, they're in love with a laptop given to them by family. They're learning quick but their mind is very
 sharp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking of your dad and calling. Maybe getting an Invoke (on sale at the moment for 1/2 price at this time) so they can call someone by just asking it. You could even make entries to his reminders by logging into a PC somewhere using his credentials
 and add stuff to his calendar and phonebook. They may have a lot of fun with it. Who knows. Check it out here.&nbsp;https://youtu.be/evXJvKkLOM8</p>

<p>Hi Roy</p>
<p>Apologies for delay in reply, just arrived at dads place for xmas and back to training on Skype. Dad lives Adelaide Australia by the way and I myself live in Brisbane Australia. My brother and his family live close by dad in Adelaide.&nbsp; Dad just rang his
 grand daughter in Brisbane so it works ok but he was certainly confused as the names moved around..........but he did look down each name and spotted her (as I have the relationship along side the name) he saw his new great grandson for the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roy, thanks for your suggestion, greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I am not 100% sure it will work for dad but good suggestion and worth investigating.&nbsp; I am now trying to get cortana working first (got a problem with it, I turn the 'Hey Cortana' setting to on and it
 auto switches itself to off??).&nbsp; Figure I will try him with Cortana first, just in case. He is currently looking at me weird wondering why I am talking and saying 'hey cortana' to a flat screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I have a small Lenovo Yoga 310 I have setup Sykpe - it folds all the way around so he cannot see the keyboard. The keyboard becomes the base and this is great, all dad sees is the touch screen.&nbsp; Truly if he saw the keyboard he would become so confused
 so with it in PAD mode is a great option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a great xmas</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Thanks Julie</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just letting you know,&nbsp; I have a small Lenovo Yoga 310 I have setup Sykpe - it folds all the way around so dad cannot see the keyboard. The keyboard becomes the base and this is great, all dad sees is the touch screen.&nbsp; Truly if he saw the keyboard he would
 become so confused so with it in PAD mode is a great option.&nbsp; Just wanted to mention this as likely the developers may not always understand the difficulty involved. I myself did not understand until you actually watch and seeing the anxiety when something
 is not in the exact place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He lives alone but is perfectly fine in his own home, he gets up each morning showers and dresses himself, and although we have discussed moving him and it can be quite traumatic moving hem to a different place. Carers do come in daily to check on him (health
 system in OZ provides an excellent assistance for home care, not sure about USA).&nbsp; So right now he is comfortable but this terrible disease will get worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To provide an example of a simple issue he had, may assist with understanding of the problem faced with dementia.&nbsp; My brother and I watched him daily many times turning the pages of his diary, which we would write things in to remind him, he always became
 frustrated. Did not take long to figure out, he was not reading every page, he simply had absolutely no idea what day it was.........so we purchased a $70 clock that displayed the DAY in large letters, the TIME even larger, and then the date in full (24 December
 2017) at the bottom.......the transformation was amazing and frustration disappeared. They do not like telling you they have lost their memory they are sort of semi aware.........and outward appearances he is physically not bad for 84 years old, even talking
 to him at times you would not think anything was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow sorry about the 'war and peace' but figure a wider explanation could be useful to help with the developers understanding.&nbsp; Perhaps a 'Disability' type option could be considered.&nbsp; This disease is going to eventually swamp our health systems already
 struggling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is slowly getting the knack of touching screen but the second the names move around he doe become confused. Even when the person he calls and does NOT answer the 'keypad' pops up and assumes you will text.......nope this short circuits his old brain.......so
 perhaps consider this as well would be so good.&nbsp; Clear the screen of every possible 'noise' unwanted icons.......larger video call button perhaps located in middle........have the text discussion completely clear.........ALL the family know never to text him
 only call or video call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks Julie, I am going to research Roys suggestion and see how he goes with Cortana first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have a wonderful xmas</p>

<h2>            Error file&#58;&#92;windowes&#92;system32&#92;boot&#92;winload.exe  0xc000000e missing or corrupt. I tried to repair but failed please help</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>To the Microsoft Community, thank you for your assistance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It all started when I tried to boot my Acer Extenza 5620 6266 and got the error code " File:\windows\system32\boot\winload.exe&nbsp; 0xc000000e missing or corrupt". Not sure what caused this. I searched for this error on&nbsp;Microsoft site and found your posts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your suggestions, tried all of the restore options and could not get into any recovery options, then I bought the suggested software (Easy recovery essentials for Vista, $20 seems to be waisted!), I read all of the info. about downloading and
 creating a&nbsp;bootable disc, all of the other info about loading the disc and all instruction thoroughly. I ran the disc, It seemed to be a good utility program because it ran well, although It would not connect to the internet with the internet feature. I tried
 to get into the windows recovery but could not so I ran the Easy Recovery Essentials&nbsp;auto recovery, and restarted the laptop.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It did start my laptop in windows. The log in screen showed the 3 users as they should be. When I logged in, it had two errors, could not find "C:\windows\systen32\mscories.dll"&nbsp;or "C:\wndows\system32\iedkcs32.dll". I said ok to both then it gave me a "temperary
 profile" with a desk top that has a few program icons for windows and a couple that I had installed but most were not there, What is this? I opened "Start", all programs, and it seems that everything installed is there but when I click on anything that is
 not on the desktop it can not find them. I opened the windows explorer and could not find anything in the user profiles I had (it says that they were created the day I ran the discand all files were empty.) I did find all of my photos, files, program files,
 favorites, etc. in the "owner" profile so everything appears to be still there but the computer can't find anything and therefore can't run/open them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to use the Windows recovery system but it said that there were no restore points prior to the date I used the disc (&nbsp;I create restore points often, just three days prior by chance, as well as have them set to auto save). When I ran the Disc again
 and opened the "partition&nbsp;edit" feature on the disc&nbsp;it showed what I believe is a new partition called "PQSERVICE" of 10 gb. It may or may not have been there, I just don't know. It apears that it reassigned the patition ACER(C:)&nbsp;to PQSERVICE(C:)fat32, DATA(D:)
 to DATA(F:)ntfs, and when I plug in my flash drive in the usb port that&nbsp;I always use (normally (F:) it is now (G:). However the DVD drive is still (E:)ntfs? So it seems that it has&nbsp;shifted all of the partitions/ports. I do not have the factory recovery disc
 because Acer dose'nt feel it is important enough to supply them or keep them available for older laptops (2009)!</p>
<p>With all of this said, it is more messed up than ever. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what now Microsoft Community? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Do you know if the PQSERVICE partition is part of the Easy Recovery Essentials program? Dose Easy Ess. install ANYTHING on my hard drive or just run from the disc? If so dose&nbsp;the data, files, or any info.&nbsp;need to be removed or uninstalled?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Can, or should I, remove/change PQSERVICE(C:) partition and reassign the others back to what they were? If so, How? If not what what can I do? I tried to get a "E-recovery" disc from Acer but&nbsp;it tells me that there is not a factory recovery disc/media
 for my snid# or sn#. Will a Windows recovery disc work or cause me more pain? I still have the windows key on the bottom of the laptop. reinstall or reformat is my last option please!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: are the restore points still there but can't be found in DATA(F:) because of the change?&nbsp;&nbsp;If so is there a way to get the restore in Windows to work with them, with or without changing the partitions and how can I accomplish this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Will the laptop find my user profile by replacing the two missing dll. files? I beleive that they are the ones with my settings,etc. so it probably won't help. what do you think?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really need your help to fix this! I do not want to reformat, reinstall, or otherwise abandon my data and professional programs if there is any other hope! I trusted the Windows Community advice and am now in a worse position than before. I am now trusting
 you all to help me out of this mess. Your attention to this matter will be most appreciated! Please reply asap!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>mscories.dll</strong> is a module associated with Microsoft® .NET Framework.</p>
<p><strong>iedkcs32.dll</strong> is used by Microsoft Internet Explorer during user personalization processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If u r getting the winload.exe 0xc000000e missing u should probably do a repair install of Windows Vista using the installation DVD but since u don't have the DVD the best u can do is restore the computer to factory settings, but doing so will delete all
 of ur personal data.</p>

<p><strong>So try this and check if it helps</strong>:</p>

<p>To fix this issue next time, boot to Vista RE, select Command Prompt, type the following (anything inside the parens is a comment):</p>

<p>CD Boot</p>
<p>Dir </p>
<p>(look to see if the BCD file is missing - it probably is.)</p>
<p>Bootrec /rebuildbcd</p>

    <title>Creating a Playlist from a Music Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lvcabbie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a Playlist from a Music Folder</h2>
                    
<p>I've figured out how to rip music from CDs to my hard disc. I get them organized in my Windows Music folder and want to create a playlist from there to Media Player.</p>
<p>How do I do it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that I had a series of homemade CDs from my previous computer. When I transferred files, I didn't transfer the music. So, I ripped from my CDs and have spent some time editting and organizing. Now, I want to select music from various Windows
 folders to create playlists on my media library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, part of the problem dowloading from homemade disks is that they aren't identified and get sorted in the Media Luibrary wierdly. Do I have to go back and edit each and every item on the Lbrary to get this done?</p>

<p>I've figured out how to rip music from CDs to my hard disc. I get them organized in my Windows Music folder and want to create a playlist from there to Media Player.</p>
<p>How do I do it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that I had a series of homemade CDs from my previous computer. When I transferred files, I didn't transfer the music. So, I ripped from my CDs and have spent some time editting and organizing. Now, I want to select music from various Windows
 folders to create playlists on my media library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, part of the problem dowloading from homemade disks is that they aren't identified and get sorted in the Media Luibrary wierdly. Do I have to go back and edit each and every item on the Lbrary to get this done?</p>

    <title>Parental Controls&#58; Child PC Screen Time limits reset to &#34;Max - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skogginsk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Parental Controls&#58; Child PC Screen Time limits reset to &#34;Max Scheduled&#34; &#38; allowed window resets to 24 hours&#47;day</h2>
                    <p>My son has Windows 10 home on his PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we set his screen time limits (e.g. 1 hour/day under "Hours allowed") and restrict the window in which he can use that screen time (e.g. 9am-5pm), within about 10 minutes it ALWAYS resets back to no controls at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hours allowed for each day return to "Max scheduled"</li><li>The window in which the computer can be used switches back to 24 hours/day</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security-winpc/troubleshooting-family-safety-features-in-windows/29533738-5766-4ba5-881c-c588e45201dc">
listed on this page</a>, but no change - still the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found things in other forums and tried those too. For example, removing my son's Microsoft account from the family account and then adding him back. No improvement. I also tried doing adjusting teh setting using different browsers - Chrome on a PC,
 Chrome on a Mac, Firefox on a Mac - but not change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>His Windows is fully up to date and this has been going on for at least the last 4 months. Would be grateful for any help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi @minangkabu, thanks - I followed the steps. It's now been about 15 minutes since my son turned on his PC and and the restrictions I set are still in place. I'll check again in a few hours and let you know if things have changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this continues to work, does that mean I have to follow all of the steps each time I want to adjust the settings? For example, for now I've given him 1 hour of screen time each day. If I want to change to 2 hours for Saturdays and Sundays, must I follow
 all those steps again to ensure the changes lock in place properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>ok i think i may have figured this problem out, at least it has worked for me so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Dont set the daily allowance first.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Click on the small tab labelled set and add the time limits first.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Then set and add the&nbsp;daily allowances.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing once you you click on the&nbsp;small tab labelled set and add the time limits the program resets, &nbsp;i would be really interested to know if this works for anyone else or if its just coincidence.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Also, if you click on each line which shows the daily timings you will see the default entry displayed and a remove option next to it. I went through each day and removed the default first and then set the daily timings using the bottom
 link. Once this was done and the allowed timings were shaded and displaying correctly I updated each time limit. This then remained in place when navigating away from the site and then back again.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
You are a genius! I tried changing the time limits and the time window allowed for each day about ten times on three different browsers with no changes "staying". They kept resetting to unlimited... until I tried your solution! Thank you so much! I wasted so
 much time on this!<br />
<br />
So definitely 1. Delete the preset time windows. Add your own time window and "Add and Save" for each day. 2. Set the total time limit for each day.<br />
<br />
I hope these changes save past today but I literally couldn't even refresh the page without them all resetting to default unlimited so this is a huge step. Thanks again!</div>

<p>HI thanks for this suggestion. Sadly, I found that one a few months ago. Tried it at the time and it didn't work either :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your other question about access to my son's PC:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the test you suggested above (the 15 minutes etc.) I was away from the PC and he was using it. So it's possible he's somehow resetting the limits, BUT ..</li><li>A few days ago I sat at his PC and did the following test:
<ul>
<li>Logged into his account - checked and no limits</li><li>Switched to my account, set the limits there</li><li>Switched to his account - checked and limits working</li><li>Switched to my account, and after about 10-15 minutes the limits had reset</li><li>Switched to his account - no limits</li><li>The whole time I was at the PC and he was nearby but not at the PC so couldn't have adjusted the limits</li></ul>

    <title>Fortnite Xbox One S redemption code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> now_is_for_real  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fortnite Xbox One S redemption code</h2>
                    <p><span>I bought the special edition Fortnite Xbox One S this week for my son's birthday.
 He redeemed the code in the box for 'Dark Vertex' Cosmetic Set and 2000 V-Bucks which duly appeared. However, when he came back to the game they had disappeared and have still not reappeared in his 'locker'.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried to enter the code again but am just told that it has already
 been redeemed. Hes really upset, understandably, as he should have a special edition skin to show off. I have contacted Epic Games, who directed me back to Xbox as it is a problem with your redemption code.</span></p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated, thank you!</p>

            It sounds like you were able to redeem the code correctly and were able to use the content before. I would suggest a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a> and load the game back up to see if it came back. Also, double check to make sure the correct gamertag/account is signed in.

<h2>            I am kind of stuck in &#34;loading screen&#34; and constantly getting BSoD.&#47;Problem with Drivers.</h2>
                    <p>I was running Windows 8 (Not 8.1) for quiet sometime and I had nothing wrong with it..Howere I also had Windows 10 on another DVD,I had tried installing it in the past,but there was apparently something old with my old GPU (AMD Radeon HD 5450) that didn't
 allow it to install the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In device manager,I could not find the GPU under the Display Adopter list,Instead there was the "Microsoft Standar Display Adopter" or something like that,and there was no sign of AMD Radeon HD 5450..There was either a problem with recognizing it or the
 drivers were missing...Idk.I re-installed Windows 8 and everything was fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, so, recently I was tempted to try my luck again.But this time somewhere in the middle of the setup (before getting into copying files and stuff,still was choosing the setup setting I think)the screen started to give me red pixel lines like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4fc6438-8181-4ef0-ab53-100a72db34f4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4fc6438-8181-4ef0-ab53-100a72db34f4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(And there were a few othe graphical glitches on black screens when the computer was loading up later/on boot screen.)</p>
<p>So after the installation was completed,the red lines were much stronger,and the rest was the samelink as in the past.The GPU was not recognized.</p>
<p>However this time I had much more searching on the web,somewhere it was said that updating windows would fix that,but due to my country/internet speed,the update was stucked at 17% even though it had taken a long time already.</p>
<p>Rather than that I tried installing the driver from several sites including AMD itself,and everytime I was getting the same results:</p>
<p>The screen would start flickering in the midst of the installation,showimg me red dots,blank screen,etc. Forever.Sometimes I had to restart the PC myself,and sometimes the &nbsp;TDR_Failure_atikmpag.sys error showed up automatically.In anycase,I had to go in
 safe mode and uninstall the drivers using DDU everytime so I could start Windows normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this wasn't my only try,I also downloaded the ISO of Windows 8.1 this time,hoping this one will work like 8 did.(Everytime I installed a version of Windows,I formatted C Drive completely.)But surprisingly,the red lines were still there when the installation
 was over,and the GPU was not recognized again..besude it was probably the latest version of 8.1 so I don't think updating it would help it install my drivers.</p>
<p>Again I did the same thing I did with Win10:</p>
<p>Installing different drivers and deleting them again as they didn't work/made the blue screen showup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But,the last time I was trying toinstall the driver,like usual the blank screen keeped happening,so I gave up and decided to install Win8 again..but sadly this time I didn't delete the drivers,so that means the BSoD wasn't fixed,and I started installing
 Win8 and didn't go to safe mode to deletemake the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the problem is</p>
<p>I have Win8 half installed,the computer restarted for the first time,and I still keep getting the BSoD with TDR_Failure,even though I formatted Drive C....Also the red lines weren't fixed until now.</p>
<p>So I wanted to start safe mode using advanced setting,but it's giving me an error saying :Windows Can't complete installation in safe mode.etc(It's not a blue screen error.)</p>
<p>So now I'm stuck with the blue screen every time I start the PC.Can't either fix it because of the incomplete installation of windows.I tried resetting PC using the advanced settings of blue screen..and no results.The same thing is happening no matter what
 I do.</p>
<p>I don't know why there is a problem with this GPU in win8.1 or 10. It's said to be suppprted by them.</p>
<p>But that's not thea real problem now,I'm stuck with a half installed Windows and there seems to be no way.........</p>
<p>So anyone can help me?Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I hope you won't find it funny,but my Windows is a cracked version.Simply buying original softwares is a rare occasion that would happen in my country(Iran) and it's not so easy to get one</p>
<p>So thankfully the installation is complete,but again it crashes when trying to install GPU driver using Driverpack Solution or any other software and no,the red line won't be going anymore I guess.But I don't understand why did the hardware failure happen
 when Windows 10 was being installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway,I think it's too 'rude' to not buy the software and ask the manufacturer fo help&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Dell Inspiron 1520 Touch Pad Disable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kansas_clay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Inspiron 1520 Touch Pad Disable</h2>
                    <p>I just "upgraded" from Windows 7 to 10. &nbsp;The upgrade reinstalled the touch pad driver and now I cannot turn off the touch pad. &nbsp;I tried removing the driver but when I restarted Windows, the driver was reinstalled. &nbsp;I have found no controls in the control
 panel for disabling the touch pad. &nbsp;I have noted that others have the same problem but have not found an answer that works for me. &nbsp;I may tape a shield over the touch pad so that it will not detect my finger movements but am hoping to find a better solution.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail Login problems</h2>
                    I currently use Windows Live Mail 2012 on Windows 7 Home Premium and in the last couple of days I have started to have real problems with it. Whenever I try and log in to read my emails the software tells me my username or password are incorrect, when
 I know for a fact they are okay because I've only just used them on Outlook.com. Any suggestions?

            <p>Well, I figured out what my problem was. Thought I would post here in case it helps anyone else.</p>
<p>I had recently changed my password because my account had been hacked. I had also set up two-step authentification in order to make any changes to my account in the future. Apparently this process applies to everywhere you sign in to your account so any
 apps that can't confirm the two step process password will time out. </p>
<p>I read about it here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">App Passwords &amp; Two-Step Verification</a></p>
<p>www.windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to make separate passwords for each of my email account that I had set up two-step verification for, using the password generator on my account settings. Voila, I can check my email again!</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>
