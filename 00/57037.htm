<h2>            Pincode not available due to change in security settings. Laptop locked.</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new surface laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have logged with my office account and password.</p>
<p>The systems requiered a Pin code which I created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the window update after restart I have the mentioned error (translated from dutch).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And&nbsp; "You can change the PIN via settings &gt; Accounts&gt; etc"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However. As I can not logon and the systems does not provide any option then restart I have no clue how to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already did reset the windows back to factory standards but on the second try I have the same effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

<p>Thanks for you effort but it will not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>A - after safe mode and 4 or 5 no logon screen. Just a picture and three button on the right corner. wifi, accesibility and power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bootable USB also gave error whilst creating the USB :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>B- No restore point available (new laptop) and no repair activity possible</p>
<p>
</p><p>C-&nbsp; Done that and same issue after restart for Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>D&nbsp; Did not do that.&nbsp; I will send the laptop back to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the strange thing is that I bought an identical laptop four weeks ago and no problem at all.</p>

<h2>            Is my GPU broken or what&#63; TDR and nvlddmkm.sys related problem&#33;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
Ok,&nbsp;so guys, this all&nbsp;started after re-installing my Os (window 8.1). Same drivers,&nbsp;same computer, not hardware change, I don't understand. So let's get&nbsp;started with the&nbsp;specs. Msi gt70 laptop, with Intel HD 400 and a NVIDIA GTX 675M, CPU is i7 3610qm and RAM
 is 12gb. Ok&nbsp;so basically what is going on is like if the driver&nbsp;stop responding or I don't know what but I know it cause the windows TDR function to kick in,TDR ---&gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff570087%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="External link">read
 here</a>&nbsp;. &nbsp;It&nbsp;started with getting blue&nbsp;screens on Win 8.1&nbsp;showing TDR timeout failure,&nbsp;so I&nbsp;somehow thought windows 8.1 was the problem even though I had it long beofre reinstalling the Os&nbsp;so I went on and installed win 7. With win7 I was getting blue&nbsp;screens
 to after 5 to 30 minutes ingame&nbsp;saying "nvlddmkm.sys'. Searched that up and came up with info&nbsp;saying it was about the TDR. So I deactivated it in regedit but the game freezes after 5 to 30 minute instead of blue&nbsp;screening because TDR is now deactivated. When
 I close the process of the game, the game close but the game process reopen immediately but there is no window of the game and my fan (GPU I think)&nbsp;spins to 100%. After that, I went and open Msi afterburner and no info of my GPU, it can't find, like if it
 was not there. Very very weird. So I went back in regedit and instead of removing TDR I increased it's delay, before getting a blue&nbsp;screen. Went back in game, after 5 to 30 minute game freezes for the time of the delay I&nbsp;set and does a blue&nbsp;screen. So what
 the hell is going on? My temp are ok to. Is my GPU broken? How could a Os install break a GPU???&nbsp;</p>

Thanks for all the help you can give me, I really need it,</p>

</p>
<p>If the fan is running at 100% all the time the gpu, and cpu may be overheating.
</p>
<p>Run a temperature monitor, if possible, to verify if this is so.<br />
</p>
<p>It may be the gpu has been running too hot for sometime now, particularly if the fan has been<br />
</p>
<p>running maxed out. </p>
<p>Laptops ( 'gaming' laptops too), even with a cooling pad, don't cool well when running under

<p>full load.<br />

<p>
</p><p>While the TDR error always points toward the gpu drivers, it can come from many things,<br />
</p>
<p>including software.<br />
</p>
<p>- Disabling TRD errors altogether is not advisable as TDR is meant to protect the system from damage (as well as reflect damage that has already happened).<br />
</p>
<p>- The better option, if you want to avoid 'random' TDR errors happening is to use the time change option.
<br />
</p>
<p>I find&nbsp; TdrDelay of 5-8 seconds is plenty long for preventing seemingly random TDR errors. However, if the gpu is borked even the default 2 sec will cause TDR or BSOD.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Some other examples of causes of TDR -<br />
</p>
<p>Hardware:<br />
- RAM. Run&nbsp; memtest to verify the RAM is not producing errors<br />
- HDD. Run&nbsp; chkdsk to test the HDD for errors<br />
</p>

<p>Software:<br />
</p>
<p>Did you download the drivers from Nvidia or MSI ? With laptops it is best to download the<br />
</p>
<p>drivers from the mfg of the laptop, not Nvidia.<br />
</p>
<p>- When TDR occurs when using the internet it is sometimes due to browser add-ons, or the<br />
version of the browser you are using.<br />
- Anti-Virus software, particularly AV suites that run a number of programs in the background, or<br />
running more than one AV program in resident (always on), are another possibility.<br />
- Malware, Spyware or Virus are possible. Run a full boot-time scan with your AV.</p>
<p>A virus called <em>iehighutil.dll</em>&nbsp; that come as an added bonus from some torrent downloads is one example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- System 'optimising' software is another possibility.<br />
- Games often cause TDR.&nbsp; In some cases this is due to using too high graphics settings, which may<br />
</p>
<p>seem OK, but which can overwhelm the system at various times and cause a processing lag which<br />
</p>
<p>leads to TDR.<br />
- Did you install anything around the time the crashes started ?<br />
- Conflicts with other drivers can also cause TDR. One such driver comes with Daemon Tools.
<br />
</p>
<p>Sometimes there can be conflicts with integrated audio eg. - Realtek, and the Nvidia HD Audio<br />
</p>
<p>drivers. Install only the main driver and physics if you don't use HDMI for audio or Nvidia 3D.<br />

</p><p>Ok. I ran a Furmark test to see if heat was the problem, the answer is no. After around 3 to 4 minute, I hit a max temp of 83 degrees celcius. After 10 to 11 minute I get blue screen. I will run Memtest and chkdiskt and come back with an answer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I believe 83C is fairly common for a laptop under load. With PC mid 70's is more common because</p>
<p>of better cooling. Long sessions over 80C will shorten the life of a gpu though.
</p>
<p>With a&nbsp; laptop the cpu may also be suffering from high temps if the gpu is. </p>
<p>More so if they share the same cooler, as is common with laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You said 83C max. So, the temp was still at 83C a minute (seconds would be a better judge)</p>
<p>before the BSOD ? </p>
<p>If so, the temps should not be the source of the BSOD or TDR.</p>
<p>-If not, the BSOD may be from a 'thermal shut-down', which is suppose to protect the gpu (or cpu) from damage&nbsp;(as does a&nbsp; TDR when hardware is faulting) . Not much benefit if the gpu&nbsp; has been running at high temps for a long period of time though, as the
 damage may already be done. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The thermal shut-down is commonly around 100C +\-&nbsp; on PC, but I don't know if&nbsp; laptops shut down
</p>
<p>that late. It may be more around the 95C +\- mark ?</p>
<p>[EDIT: Your i7 3610qm has a similar thermal threashold ]</p>
<p>Many Cpu's have a much lower threshold, eg.- my AMD Phenom965 has a threshold around 62-65C.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do avoid running Furmark again. Furmark forces too much stress on the system. </p>
<p>Far more than any game. Furmark has killed many a card (I killed a gpu in '05 running Furmark),
</p>
<p>particularly if used more than a few times.</p>
<p>Safer to stick with simple diagnostic tools that just measure the temps, fps, etc. while playing a game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- mini-dump files from the BSOD , and &nbsp;Windows Error reports may reveal something other than</p>
<p>temp to those on the forums who a better at interpreting them than I .</p>
<p>.</p>

<p><em>"I ran a Furmark test to see if heat was the problem, the answer is no. After around 3 to 4 minute, I hit a max temp of 83 degrees celcius. After 10 to 11 minute I get blue screen. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe 83C is fairly common for a laptop under load. With PC mid 70's is more common because</p>
<p>of better cooling. Long sessions over 80C will shorten the life of a gpu though.
</p>
<p>With a&nbsp; laptop the cpu may also be suffering from high temps if the gpu is. </p>
<p>More so if they share the same cooler, as is common with laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You said 83C max. So, the temp was still at 83C a minute (seconds would be a better judge)</p>
<p>before the BSOD ? </p>
<p>If so, the temps should not be the source of the BSOD or TDR.</p>
<p>-If not, the BSOD may be from a 'thermal shut-down', which is suppose to protect the gpu (or cpu) from damage&nbsp;(as does a&nbsp; TDR when hardware is faulting) . Not much benefit if the gpu&nbsp; has been running at high temps for a long period of time though, as the
 damage may already be done. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The thermal shut-down is commonly around 100C +\-&nbsp; on PC, but I don't know if&nbsp; laptops shut down
</p>
<p>that late. It may be more around the 95C +\- mark ?</p>
<p>[EDIT: Your i7 3610qm has a similar thermal threashold ]</p>
<p>Many Cpu's have a much lower threshold, eg.- my AMD Phenom965 has a threshold around 62-65C.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do avoid running Furmark again. Furmark forces too much stress on the system. </p>
<p>Far more than any game. Furmark has killed many a card (I killed a gpu in '05 running Furmark),
</p>
<p>particularly if used more than a few times.</p>
<p>Safer to stick with simple diagnostic tools that just measure the temps, fps, etc. while playing a game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- mini-dump files from the BSOD , and &nbsp;Windows Error reports may reveal something other than</p>
<p>temp to those on the forums who a better at interpreting them than I .</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Little update, confirmation on those temps, 63 degrees before crash(verified each second) in game, so yeah. And if the CPU were overheating I don't believe it would be a TDR error. Will upload mini-dump files in a &nbsp;day or 2.</p>

            <p>63C - No worries there.<em>... </em>yeah ;)<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><em>"And if the CPU were overheating I don't believe it would be a TDR error."</em><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Going on the gpu temps, the cpu probably is not the problem, but all temps should be verified.</p>
<p>It's those steps we skip over that can come back to haunt....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- TDR is a faulty system.&nbsp; It's really no better than BSOD regarding ease of troubleshooting, imo.
</p>
<p>The reason is, there are a lot of things that can cause lag, but the graphics drivers are very often the
</p>
<p>last thing in the chain of events, so they cop the blame.<br />
</p>
<p>- My best personal example (XP BSOD, not TDR) comes from a few years ago when I was trying to run
</p>
<p>my RAM at the speed on the label, but this was a overclock speed for the memory controller on my system, and not stable in some high spec games (Oblivion was the worst).<br />
</p>
<p>Result 'random' BSOD with an&nbsp;&nbsp; <span><em>Nvlddmkm</em>.<em>sys</em>&nbsp; error. Mis-leading ? Oh yeah!
</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Which brings us back to mini-dump and Windows error reports.&nbsp; Make them available on OneDrive<br />
</p>
<p>or similar file sharing site - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

</p><p>If you post a link to these reports, and no one comes by to help analyse them you may want to start

<h2>            Windows update after Recovery&#47;Refresh - end of tether</h2>
                    <p><span>Windows 8.1 RT</span></p>
<strong><em><span>Carried out this exercise TWICE each time taking several hours</span></em></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span>
<p><span>Recovery/Refresh</span></p>

<p><span>Tried Windows Update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Error 8024A008</span></p>

<p><span>Ran sfc /scannow</span></p>

<p><span>No errors</span></p>

<p><span>Tried Windows update again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Didn’t work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rebooted. </span></p>

<p><span>Tried Windows update again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This time started downloading.</span></p>

<p><span>Downloaded 72 updates.</span></p>

<p><span>Checked with Control Panel.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Saw there were 4 more important updates.</span></p>

<p><span>Only two installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Error codes 80200056 and 802000E trying to install (together and separately)</span></p>

<p><span>Rebooted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Found 24 more updates to install.<span>&nbsp; </span>Installed.</span></p>

<p>Rebooted.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Checked Windows Update again.<span>&nbsp; </span>KB2903939 and KB2911106 (same numbers as before) ready to install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Tried and failed again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Errors 80200010 and 80246005.<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>Now hidden the two updates.</span>KB2903939 and KB2911106

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We suggest that you to scan the image to check for corruption. This operation will take several minutes. At a command prompt, type the following command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Check the image to see whether any corruption has been detected. For example, at a command prompt, type:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When you use the /CheckHealth argument, the DISM tool will report whether the image is healthy, repairable, or non-repairable. If the image is non-repairable, you should discard the image and start again. If the image is repairable, you can use the /RestoreHealth
 argument to repair the image.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you very much for this helpful reply.</p>
<p>As instructed, I carried out </p>
<p>
</p><p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth and was informed that there were no problems with my image.</p>
<p>I then "unhid" the two updates which were giving me difficulties.&nbsp; &nbsp;KB2903939 and KB2911106 and tried to update again.&nbsp; No joy.&nbsp; Rebooted and could then see the two updates.&nbsp; Tried to updates but again - no joy.&nbsp; Still got the same error messages 80200010
 and 80246005.&nbsp; So I have hidden the darn things again!&nbsp; It is ironic that both of these updates&nbsp;are meant&nbsp;to "improve" the user experience from what I can understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether I will now received Windows Updates automatically again, time will tell.</p>
<p>I am getting increasingly frustrated with Windows Update.&nbsp; On RT tablets you cannot stop them coming, and nor would you want to because you cannot install your own virus software.&nbsp; Therefore you rely on the Updates to keep your tablet secure and safe.&nbsp; However,
 when (and now if) updates do arrive, they don't seem to tidy up after them and the hard disc gets fuller and fuller until such time as you can't use the machine.&nbsp; I am now wise to this and always do a disc and system clean up after each update in an effort
 to remove updates which are old and should be removed as they seem to be with my main computer.</p>
<p>I don't "faff about" with my tablet and have no apps or anything unapproved by Microsoft.&nbsp; The RT tablet won't allow it anyway.&nbsp; I should not be having these difficulties.&nbsp; It takes time to re-establish Outlook and other settings each time I Refresh the
 tablet or re-install Windows.&nbsp; I am seriously considering getting a Mac to protect my elevated blood pressure!&nbsp; Rant over!&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp;

</p><p>I don't think that is actually what happens.&nbsp; I agree it looks like it but you can use PowerShell (or wmic) to find out what you have.&nbsp; I prefer PowerShell because it is easier to type and filter and sort.</p>

</p><p>What really matters is whether you have&nbsp; KB2919355 and not just whether it is "installed" but whether it is applied properly too.&nbsp; E.g. it sounds like some are continually getting KB2919355 re-offered.&nbsp; That is typically a sign that the update is not getting
 applied for reasons which are hinted at by the error codes.&nbsp; But to really see what the error codes are saying you would need to dig into the logs,&nbsp; CBS.log being the main one, but you can get clues for timestamp context in it from other logs such as ReportingEvents.log
 or other Events logs (e.g. via Win-x v).</p>

            <p>Robert: thank you very much for your reply.&nbsp; I did try to follow your instructions and found that I did not appear to have KB2919355 which I then downloaded along with its associated downloads, but as feared, I could not install.&nbsp; One of the quirky things
 about Windows RT is that you cannot install any .exe on it unless it is downloaded&nbsp;via the Windows "shop" and the upgrade to 8.1 and all its associated "bits" cannot be done manually.&nbsp;
<em>"<span>Note </span>The update for Windows RT 8.1 can be obtained only from Windows Update."</em> Yet I was already running 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I retired defeated again but last night, I left Windows Update running for a couple of hours and lo!&nbsp; It gathered some updates from the ether.&nbsp; Seven of them would not install because they were already there, so I have hidden them.&nbsp; I am praying now that
 whatever was wrong is now resolved.&nbsp; Thank you again for trying to help me.&nbsp; </p>

            Thank you Joseph for your reply.&nbsp; I did follow up the links you suggested and find them informative.&nbsp; I remain puzzled how to update Windows on RT as I can see that I do not have KB2919355.&nbsp; However at the moment I am getting Windows Update for security
 updates so I have left well alone.&nbsp; I will follow your suggestions should that cease again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I think originally we had to do something at the Store to get this (or get something which allowed this to be offered).&nbsp; If you are not seeing it offered as an optional update then, no, you would not be able to download it and install it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you may be better&nbsp;doing what others have been doing and that is a Reset (which supposedly keeps your data files but I would back them up anyway) and then doing a special download which apparently is allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely the Related Content button gets "There is no related content".&nbsp; That's false.</p>

            <p>Thank you Robert.&nbsp; I have done a Refresh twice and although WU downloaded many updates 2919355 wasn't amongst them and of course for RT the only way to install is if WU offers it. I had a WU on the 6th and hope they continue coming otherwise I will do a
 Reset even though I did this a couple of months ago - why?&nbsp; because WU was not working!</p>
<p>I really should not be having these problems as I don't 'fiddle' with the tablet and use it mainly for internet and minor office functions when away.</p>
<p>Meantime I will continue to hide any which won't install and pray.&nbsp; As long as I get security updates I am reasonably relaxed.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who have tried to help.</p>

<p>The issue seems to be by design. If you type something wrong in the address bar in Windows Explorer, it will automatically open Web browser and serach it online.<br />

                    <p>&nbsp;Recentemente eu instalei o aplicativo do xbox game pass no meu gamlular, para baixar alguns jogos enquanto eu estava fora. Eu estava esperando ansiosamente por Life is Strange 2 Episodio 2, para ser lançado game pass e quando foi lançado, eu baixei pelo
 aplicativo. Comecei a baixá-lo e quando cheguei em casa já estava "instalado", mas quando o selecionei para jogar ele não abriu, então cliquei no botão start para desinstalar e instalar novamente, mas as únicas opções que tinha para selecionar eram a de suporte
 ir para a loja da Microsoft não posso instalar ou desinstalar o jogo. Meu xbox diz que já está instalado. Eu realmente queria jogar este jogo :(</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;Recently I installed the Xbox Game Pass app on my gamlular, to download some games while I was out. I was eagerly waiting for Life is Strange 2 Episodio 2, to be released game pass and when it was released, I downloaded the application. I started to download
 it and when I got home it was already&nbsp; "installed ", but when I selected it to play it did not open, then clicked the Start button to uninstall and install again, but the only options it had to select were to support go to the store Microsoft can't install
 or uninstall the game. My Xbox says it's already installed. I really wanted to play this game:(</p>

<h3> shadydaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Really struggling to get a good picture and HDR looks terrible on KD-49XD8088. Can any one help&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(47, 53, 61, 1)">Hi guys. I've had my TV, a Sony Bravia KD55XD8005 for over a year now and I can't for the life of me get a picture I'm happy with on my Xbox One X. The
 colours just don't seem right and HDR games look grey and washed out. Despite me having all green ticks in the settings section.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 53, 61, 1)">I'm constantly resetting the TV settings and trying to configure it again. I'm not normally
 bothered too much, in fact I normally just leave a TV on its default settings so I know somethings not right.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 53, 61, 1)">When I reset the TVs video settings to default the picture looks dull, so if I switch the
 picture mode to vivid all non-hdr content looks ok on the Xbox. However as soon as I load something like FIFA, Forza Horizon 3 or PUBG the picture looks terrible and dull again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 53, 61, 1)">I know its not the best TV but I can’t understand how enabling HDR makes the picture much
 worse. I’ve tried various setting guides and tips but nothing seems to work. So I’ve disabled HDR at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 53, 61, 1)">I have enabled ‘Enhanced HMDI’ on the TV, I’ve tried swapping HMDI inputs, firmware is up
 to date, I’m using the original cable that came with the Xbox. I’ve just run out of things to try.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 53, 61, 1)">So this is my last hope, can anyone help or provide any settings that have worked for them.
 Thanks guys.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> mandimae26  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gears of War&#58; Ultimate Edition did not come with all four games.</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a new 1tb xbox one from gamestop, and it came with a bundle of games. One of them is Gears of War: Ultimate Edition. The young man who sold it to me said that the Ultimate Edition included all four games. So i get home and start playing it and
 see no sign of 2, 3, or judgement. So I brought the game back to gamestop and they said that they cant give me the games and that I couldn't just return it and get my money back because it was in a bundle with a console. I really do not want to have to turn
 my console back in. They also said that I could trade it in but I would get less money than it would take to buy the game again. I just spent over $400 on the xbox and do not want to get cheated out of some money on top of that. The young man at gamestop told
 me to contact xbox support and she directed me to this forum. Please help!</p>

<p>The 4 games was part of a promotion that ended on December 31, 2015. In order to receive the 4 games you had to purchase and play the game before that date. If you did not play it before then, you would not be eligible.</p>

<br />Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them. 
<br />Press Windows key + X, click Command Prompt (Admin).
<br />In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: 
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />Or you can also follow these other steps:
<br />To diagnose whether this issue occurs in “Safe Mode”, let’s reboot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well.
<br />Safe mode is a diagnostic mode for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. This helps us in identifying whether the issue is due to some third party programs conflict. The word Safe mode appear in the concern of your monitor to identify which windows mode you are using.
<br />Follow the steps given below and check if that helps.
<br />Type settings in search and click on Settings.
<br />Click Update and recovery, and then tap or click Recovery.
<br />Under Advanced startup, tap or click Restart now.
<br />Once your PC restarts, on the Choose an option screen, tap or click Troubleshoot.
<br />If you don't see the Startup Settings option, tap or click advanced options.
<br />Tap or click Startup Settings.
<br />Tap or click Restart.
<br />On the Startup Settings screen, choose the Safe Mode.
<br />Sign in to your PC with a user account that has administrator rights.
<br />If issue do not persists in safe mode try clean boot.
<br />Check this link, I hope it helps.

            Hi Mike4D, this is most likely caused by a device driver, not a system file, , to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>Your dump file does not appear to have a symbols path so it can't find the modules to compare.&nbsp; Although, I would get messages about not being able to download the symbols when my path was messed up so perhaps it will work that way or you have removed that
 info.</p>

    <title>How can Microsoft make networking any more difficult&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thekartz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can Microsoft make networking any more difficult&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why does every new gen of windows make this worse? Seriously? Forcing passwords on everyone, some people don't like them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All i want to do is put a file from this computer to the computer in the next room, and the easiest way currently is to go via the internet. I have checked no password sharing on both computers and still this piece of
<em>junk </em>refuses to let me access the other computer without <em>BS&nbsp;</em>credentials? I don't need or want ANY passwords within windows ever, the way windows forces all this
<em>fecal matter </em>on you is intrusive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the network working fine on windows 8 / 7 but now that i've upgraded both to windows 10 its turned into a
<em>dookie nugget</em>. I re-did all the sharing settings on the folders so anyone could read or write.</p>
<p>I have run all the diagnostics and they can't find any problems and i can't seem to setup a home network as its not detecting
<em>Jack Shizen.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is there not a much simpler set of menus in the network settings everything is so hidden. Could someone write an app for an off button for all passwords in windows. Security be damned, i don't need them, I'm sure i'm not the only one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that microsoft has no common sense, could someone just give me the run down on how to connect my computers to share folders and files. And if you look at your reply and it's over a page long then have a good
<strong>think about that,</strong>&nbsp;why is it so long and how could we make this alot simpler? It doesn't take a
<em>rat infested monkey butt</em> to work out that home networks are common and shouldn't be so difficult to setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kartz</p>

<p>Interesting that Microsoft has removed simple networking from windows 10. I was not aware of that, probably wouldn't have upgraded as I use a media centre PC in my lounge and keep all my media files on that so copying files in and out of that PC is something
 I used to do alot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately since upgrading to windows 10 it won't let me do it anymore and since there is about 10 TB of data on it portable HDD and OneDrive are not very practical... Especially when i have it all networked through a Gigabit switch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh well... :(&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>Hello, I am having trouble whether purchasing a Windows 7 Home Premium under OEM license or a Retail one. I have been thinking in buying an OEM because it save me a big amount of money when upgrading from Windows Vista Home Premium(I don't mind custom
 installing my PC because I will really do that in the 1st place). But the real question is, Is it legal for an end user to do so in the first place? So what should I really buy? an OEM or retail? and Why?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>note: there are no windows anytime upgrade nor upgrade discs available in my country.</strong></p>

<p>Answer is easy: Retail</p>
<p>OEM will work but there is no upgrade version. OEM is worthless should your computer fail (more specifically the motherboard) as the OEM product key is tied to the first computer it is installed on and can not be moved to another computer whatever the reason.</p>

<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 is reported?
<br />
<br />If it is version 1803, Microsoft removed the Homegroup functionality in that version from Windows 10, without any warning

 card games. &nbsp;But Chrome Apps has all the games she wants, so she switched to them. &nbsp;</p>

 site and downloaded the latest driver, and installed it. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;So, I uninstalled the driver (I did not rollback to the previous driver.), and did a full power down, not just a Restart. On reboot, Airplane Mode was gone, and the WiFi Mode was working. &nbsp;I
 had to re-enter my WiFi password, but it all works again. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the problem recurs every few weeks, but I just repeat the process to get it to work. &nbsp;The alternative is to restore the image copy of Windows 7, which I would rather not do. &nbsp;Hope this
 helps others who have encountered this problem. &nbsp;I also hope Microsoft will fix this problem.</p>
