<h2>            Can&#39;t run the apps on D&#58; and E&#58; drives on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: running apps from internal storage drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus ROG G750 with a 120GB SSD and a 1TB internal storage drive that I use for gaming and scientific research. I do not have space on my SSD for all the apps I have, so many of them are installed on my D: or E: drives. Since upgrading to Windows
 10, the permissions on these drives are set such that I can no longer execute anything. Running as administrator does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know of a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Skype Audio Issues with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Audio Issues with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span>After a recent update of Windows 10 (early May 2017), I experienced a major audio issue on Skype.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The issue is that after 1-2 minutes of a call, the sound “drops out” from my microphone. If the Skype Options page is pulled up, it’s possible to watch the “Audio Settings” and see the volume drop from high to low.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My Microsoft Webcam was 6-7 years old so I purchased a newer version called Microsoft LifeCam Cinema HD which is shown on the box as being compatible with Windows 10, designed for Skype and not requiring any drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After setting it up, I am experiencing exactly the same problem as before.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can keep the sound volume at “High” only by holding it with my mouse, but this is not practical for any normal length of conversation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have no problem with video or receiving sound through my speaker system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have a Dell Desktop, Model XPS 8900 and Logitech X-230 speaker system. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried many of the suggestions shown on the Internet and spent many hours working to solve the problem but have been unsuccessful.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would welcome any suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Action Center &#40;Windows 10&#41; is useless, doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    When I see that I have a new notification, I click on the icon and it opens the Action Center. I see a line or two of whatever the issue is. I click on it to see what it is about and the notification goes away but nothing else happens. This is very frustrating.
 Help!

            <p>I have the same problem with the Action Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I insert a disk, thumb drive, whatever I get an action center notification that says "Tap to choose what happens with removable drives". I click, and the message just disappears and I never get to choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find the Action Center completely useless. It would be nice if it did something besides remind me the printer is out of paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really expected more from Windows 10. Like an email program without bugs that I had to abandon in favor of a third party app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and now Edge reminds you to click the star icon to save favorites, but you can't get rid of the message which overlaps the screen and hides menus or content on many websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Windows 10 looks nice and has a better start menu for desktop users, but that's about it. It should not be this difficult to use.</p>

 Microsoft personnel failed to acknowledge the problem at hand. &nbsp;The point IS, when you click on an ACTION CENTER NOTIFICATION NOTHING HAPPENS!!!. &nbsp;The messages are worthless. &nbsp;I got one today that says "Finish installing device driver software". &nbsp;When I clicked
 on it, the message disappeared and nothing happened. &nbsp;So lets walk through why this Action Center "Feature" is worthless.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. It gives an ambiguous message.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. I fails to give any details about, in this case, what device needs the drivers installed for</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. You click on the message and it just goes away.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. You have no idea what to do, where to go, what to look for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. You are left in a worse state of mind about your computer than you were before the Action Center Message was provided.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Don't get hung up on the details of this post, this happens for EVERY ACTION CENTER MESSAGE I get. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another example. &nbsp;I get message all the time that say "Software Updates Were Installed". &nbsp;It doesn't say what updates, if they were windows, drivers, or what. &nbsp;When you click on the message, it disappears
 and you are once again left scratching your head. &nbsp;A NORMAL person would think if they are provided with a "Action" message that clicking on the message would provide SOME KIND of information in response to the click. &nbsp;Obviously Microsoft quit hiring NORMAL
 people a long time ago because these are the same kinds of responses I get EVERY TIME I post a problem on your site. &nbsp;The consistent theme of these responses are:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. The answer automatically walks the questioner through enabling the feature that is already enabled.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. The person answering the question obviously has NOT read the entire message&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Does not in any way come even close to answering the question</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. All future posts are ignored.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I truly think live people are not answering these questions, I think these responses are triggered by key words in a person's post and an automated response is provided. &nbsp;Hopefully someone will read this
 and get the MESSAGE that people spending money on your products are getting very frustrated by the support they are getting.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The problem I have with the Windows 10 task manager is that it only has the option for processes. Windows 7 had both processes and applications. In Windows 7 if you killed an app under the applications tab and the app refused to die, you could go to the
 processes tab and find it there and kill it.</p>
<p>Windows 10's processes tabs acts like Windows 7 applications tab. If the app refuses to die, well your just SOL. Then you are forced to log out and log back in to kill the app.</p>
<p>Stupid, stupid, stupid.</p>

<p>Hello Sneyder,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. I have split your post into its own thread. Unfortunately, there has not been any news regarding fortnite becoming available to play without Gold. The gold subscription is needed for any online multiplayer game,
 including free games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The price helps keep servers up and running, and secure. Also, think of all the other great things you get with gold. You get the ability to play online,
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/live/deals-with-gold?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
deals with gold</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/live/games-with-gold?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free games with gold </a>every month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>how to disable password at startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annejon  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to disable password at startup</h2>
                    Last night I thought I disabled the Login password from the Start menu. When I restarted my computer I didn't have to login. But this morning when I start my computer the Login password box is there again. If anyone knows a way where the Login password
 is disabled I'd appreciate the help. The way things are now, the Login password box pops up in a minute or 2 if I've left the computer for a couple minutes--sometimes even when I sit here taking notes. Thanks for the help.

            Hi Anne, to boot your PC straight to the Desktop without the need for a password, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!

            Hello Anne
<br />
<br />The problem is that you have only deactivated it for a login, but if for example you want to access your PC after a suspension it will still ask for an identification or password.
<br />
<br />
<br />To prevent Windows 10 from asking us for the user password after a system suspension, we will have to access the Configuration options available in the Start menu.
<br />
<br /> From here click on the Accounts category, and from the options you will see on the left, select "login options".
<br />
<br />It only remains to select the option "never" in the first drop-down that can be seen in the attached image, and our preference will be automatically saved. 
<br />
<br />However, if you have a Microsoft account instead of a local account, this preference will not help and you will still be prompted for the password after a suspension.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need further assistance.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

    <title>Mouse locks up when I use the keyboard&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> holliem.s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse locks up when I use the keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    I'm pretty technologically impaired, so I don't know how to go about fixing this. Whenever I try to use the keyboard and mouse at the same time, the mouse locks up until I stop using the keyboard. It makes playing PC games pretty difficult, because I'm
 using controls like W A S D and the mouse at the same time. This only just started happening today and I haven't changed any settings. I'm sorry if this is under the wrong section.

<h2>            win 10 upgrade - wont go past &#34;Hi there, Welcome back&#34;</h2>
                    <p>This is the THIRD time I have tried to upgrade to win 10 on same machine. First was Win7 home and did all updates and got upgrade icon on tray. ran upgrade and would not get past my local account password.</p>
<p>I called microsoft and they suggested I reset my live account. Yeah, that should have a dramatic effect on a local account.</p>
<p>I installed a new SSD and installed win 7 pro. ran updates until I got my upgrade icon on tray. Ran upgrade and stops at welcome back..and my local account wont let me in.</p>
<p>I installed another new SSD and installed win7 home again and waited 3 weeks and ignored the win10 upgrade icon on tray. I removed the password on the local account and thought...I'll TRY a third time.</p>
<p>Nope - stuck on "Hi there, welcome back to Hell". If I select NEXT the machine will reboot &nbsp;back to this screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my time back!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            WIndows 10 - Windows Explorer - This File Does Not have a Program Associated With It - OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I've seen similar issues posted, but I don't know if this is the exact same thing or not.&nbsp; I converted from Win 7 to Win 10 this week.&nbsp; To be honest, I wish I hadn't.&nbsp; I've got a bunch of little things not working that really slow down my productivity:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When I click on the Windows icon, I get a critical error that tells me signing out will fix it.&nbsp; It does not.&nbsp; I've signed out and rebooted at least a dozen times since the error started.&nbsp; Only one time has the Start menu returned.</li><li>I clicked on the Microsoft Edge icon in the task bar.&nbsp; Edge never started and the icon has gone away.</li><li>IE 11 randomly hangs when I am scrolling through Facebook.&nbsp; I have to open task manager to close it.</li><li>Task manager does not always open on my first attempt (right click on the task bar and select task manager).</li><li>When I initially installed Win10 I was able to click on the store icon and open the store one time.&nbsp; Now clicking on the icon does nothing.</li><li><strong>This is the reason for my post:&nbsp;</strong> I can open Windows Explorer and see all of my drives, as well as the OneDrive icon under Quick Access.&nbsp; When I click on the OneDrive icon I receive the error message below:</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>Why am I receiving this?<br />
<br />
I think Win10 shows some good promise, but I'm really close to backing it out (and not installing on 2 other computers) until it gets shaken down more.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>

            <p>I fixed this by downloading and installing OneDrive for Windows 8 on my Windows 10 computer. Before that, I logged into the OneDrive website and removed the Windows 10 PC's that I saw listed because the wording up there said that if you have Windows 8.1,
 you can't fetch files. I never wanted to FETCH files, I just wanted them to Sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should update the OneDrive messages to direct what to do on Windows 10. Also, there are a lot of web posts saying silly things like "OneDrive is built into Windows 10, so Microsoft retired the app". I got this when I bing'd "OneDrive Windows 10".
 If I could not install OneDrive for Windows 8 on my Windows 10 system, I'd be hosed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps all the "install" actually did is recreate a file association that had a problem. I do know that I didn't have "OneDrive" in my File Explorer left pane as a "peer" of "This PC" but after the install, I do. Please don't retire the app; this is at
 least one Windows 10 user who needed it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I did run SFC as suggested above and it found no errors.</p>

            <p>I just want to add that there could be a lot more people having this problem than reported. The reason is that the link to OneDrive is sort of silently broken. Most of my files were still there, it was only&nbsp;changes in my OneDrive folder AFTER I installed
 Windows 10 (or by other computers connected to OneDrive) that weren't being sync'd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have another file-syncing app on my computer from a totally different company, and that always maintained a "peer" to "This PC" and continued to sync files even after the Windows 10 upgrade. Whatever caused the problem it seemed to only affect OneDrive.</p>

    <title>File Corrupted Error in Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> desktopuser  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Corrupted Error in Win7</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks, i will go straight to the point.</p>
<p>Few days back, i installed an application which was built around for Win XP (x32bit).</p>
<p>There is no mention of it being compatible with Win Vista or Win7/8/10.</p>
<p>Before getting this error, i had opened the program and registered it. Added few notes and text on it.</p>
<p>It seemed to do the job. After playing with it, it seemed to work fine in Win7(x32bit).</p>
<p>Until the next restart of the PC, i get this error every time when i try to open the program.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fc98890-a0bb-4036-bef7-33980eb687eb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fc98890-a0bb-4036-bef7-33980eb687eb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the actual problem with this program, i tried to change the compatibility mode by ticking it from the properties button.</p>
<p>It still doesn't work. I am really getting annoyed by this Win 7 OS. My pc actually came with Win XP and it was working fine.</p>
<p>Just for the purpose of updating i installed Win 7, but it seems to show a lot of problems. Few i mentioned in this website but</p>
<p>without any solution. This is one of those problem, i can still use my PC with all these bells and whistles.</p>
<p>It makes a lot of noise too. I wouldn't ever install Win 10 or Win 8 in this PC. The hardware too is a little old; i suppose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But anyways can anyone fix this problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Eagerly waiting for your reply.</p>

<p><span>-&gt; Since Windows 7 works fine otherwise, you should direct your question to the suppliers of My Notes Center. It's their responsibility to make their application compatible with Windows 7, same as the dog wags its tail

<p>hmmm......In one mail that they sent me with the Reg Key.</p>
<p>The author of the program had mentioned; <strong>"My Notes Center is no longer in active development and support".</strong></p>
<p>So i wouldn't get much help from them, in this regard. I suppose. Yah</p>
<p>But this problem i see when i play RPG games, like Ashes of Immortality - Bad Blood. Which can run on Windows XP/Windows Vista/Windows 7/8.</p>
<p>Then when i re-install the game, there is no error. However on next restart it shows the above problem again. So i am presuming its the Win OS that i making some kind of change to the file.</p>
<p>Re-installing again and again just to play the game and run a program doesn't make sense or at least</p>
<p>that is not the way how program is started. Its a one time installation job.Win XP never had such kind of errors, it was nice and stable. Win 7 is giving a lot of head-ache, some</p>
<p>programs run but it also show's a lot of error.</p>

<p>I did all those things man! It doesn't work.</p>
<p>Maybe if i'll get some time, i'll install Win XP in the secondary partition and make my pc a dual boot system.</p>
<p>Use all those old progrmas again without the need for Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the steps u mentioned, i tried it. :(</p>

 me! Hope it works for you too!!</p>

<h2>            ERROR&#58; &#34;Terminal Server session creation failed&#34; after enabling &#34;allow users to connect remotely to this computer&#34; for RDP.</h2>
                    After reimaging my PC and installing all relevant Windows Updates (including SP3 and other updates), I now notice that I cannot get the terminal-server "allow users to connect remotely to this computer" functionality to work.&nbsp; I checked and do not see
 port 3389 listening (so terminal server service cannot start and nothing else is using its port).&nbsp; I noticed the following error in event viewer:<br />

<br />
The only info I see in web searches pertains to Windows Server (not XP), where Term Svc can be modified, but not on XP.&nbsp; I removed my desktop firewall, thinking it was perhaps blocking ports, and this did not help.&nbsp; I've also disabled Windows Firewall, which
 also did not help.&nbsp; Even though the port 3389 was not in use, I attempted to change that RDP port to 3390, but that also made no difference.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what's preventing the Term Server Svc from working properly?&nbsp; Remote access to this PC is critical, and I really don't have to have to use VNC if I can avoid it.

<h2>            Highlighting text in pdf in Windows 10</h2>
                    Is anybody else having trouble highlighting text in pdf files?&nbsp; I just downloaded the new Windows 10 OS and I seem to have lost the ability to highlight text and save the highlight when working in pdf documents.&nbsp; This version only allows me to highlight,
 but not save the&nbsp; highlight while working through the document.&nbsp; Would like some comment on how to highlight and save the most important text in a pdf file.

            I, too, have the same issue. I tried downloading Adobe Acrobat Reader and that seemed to help. My guess is that when you switched to Windows 10, it did away with whatever reader you had installed on your system. Mark

<h2>            File Encryption - is it just the password that is encrypted or do the contents get encrypted as well&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Please, if you are not 100% sure of the answer to my question do not reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see many posting and Microsoft articles on how to encrypt a file (docx, xlsx, etc.) or even a folder, but I want to make sure the contents are encrypted as well so someone cannot view the contents thru some method.&nbsp; For example, I have an old document
 that is password protected, no I did not select the encryption option on this particular document because it was created under Word-1975 (joking, it was an old version is what I'm saying).&nbsp; I figured for this document it was good enough, date not highly classified,
 just wanted to keep peering eyes out.&nbsp;I then discover that while searching files in Explorer the preview option would actually show the contents of my file. SO... what I'm saying it that I don't want
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">something</span> like this to happen when using the encryption option. I can hear it now, hackers have a hard time hacking the passwords in Office 2010 with the AES 128-bit key blah blah blah but there is a program on
 the market that allows you view the contents with a few quick hack tricks - open the Word document in a text editor, select all, copy, then paste in Hack-It to view the contents because the contents are not encrypted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, will the contents get encrypted?</p>
<p>

            Thanks, it would make sense that the contents are encrypted but I don't see this spelled out in any MS documentation and my true concern is that our security team is looking to use some sort 3rd party software to lock down key files and encrypt them whereas
 I'm thinking why can't we do this using the inherent feature within Office but too many people say it is not safe, it can be hacked easily.&nbsp; I need rock solid proof it works very well and wish someone from MS would key on this.

<p>Maybe if you lodge a paid service call with Microsoft you can get a written confirmation. It's worth a try but there is likely to be a steep bill. An Internet search would be more reliable anyway. If asked then Microsoft would probably tell you that its
 Windows passwords are uncrackable. Some web pages disagree.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried that (I had already tried that before posting), but it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that as per my initial post, windows itself does recognise the devices, suggesting they are being enumerated. Regardless, setting the service to automatic and restarting made no difference.</p>

            <p>I have also tried to remove and reinstall Windows Media Player. That didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that when the MTP devices were last working, I was using them in another application. In order to clean up the list of devices (many of which had the same devices repeated), I removed a number of the devices. It was after this point that the devices
 no longer appeared - so I wonder if somewhere there is effectively a list of disabled devices. I don't really believe it's that as I tried doing the same thing on another machine and it wasn't able to reproduce the problem (after removing the devices, unplugging

                    <p>Even though I only have 1 or 2 (or NO other) applications open, I will be working on something when the hourglass decides to keep spinning and it freezes up.&nbsp; It won't allow me to close or click on anything else.&nbsp; I've done my updates, system scans and checks,
 defrag, troubleshoot, etc. &nbsp; I have a thumb drive for power boost, although it shows I have 362GB free of 443GB.&nbsp; This has happened when I was working on a photo editing website and on Microsoft Word.&nbsp; I'm working on a Samsung laptop with Windows 7 Home 64

            Hi Eyngel, <br />
<br />
If&nbsp;I understand you correctly, you would like to turn off or remove &nbsp;User Access Control (UAC)&nbsp;from your computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You may disable the UAC but not remove it totally out of your computer. <br />
<br />
You might want to leave it on as it is one of the security features of Windows Vista.
<br />
<br />
To turn off UAC: <br />
<br />
Go to Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Manage Another Account &gt; at the bottom of the page remove the Check on use User Access Control.
<br />
It should ask you to reboot the computer to complete the process. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<br />Microsoft Edge for Android is available in the United States (English), Australia (English) Canada (English and French), China (Simplified-Chinese), France (French), India (English) and the UK (English). We look forward to bringing MS Edge for iOS and Android to additional markets and languages over time!
<br />The best way is to use APK mirror to download and install:

    <title>Problems with Microsoft Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janiceclough  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Microsoft Updates</h2>
                    <p>I have been busy, so hadn't had time to install updates for several days. But evidently something did install yesterday. I show one update for MSE as indicated below under "Updates were installed."
</p>
<p>I can't allow&nbsp;my computer&nbsp;to update automatically where I live because there is a cap on internet usage. So I went, this evening to visit my brother and attempted to update everything where he lives and has&nbsp;unlimited usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that time my&nbsp;computer said it was downloading updates, but my display continued to say 0% of the total amount had been downloaded. I finally shut the control panel down, reopened it, and tried again. It still showed me a continual display of 0% downloaded.
 I stopped the&nbsp;process, and went in and unchecked part of the updates, and asked to download only part of them. Finally the display began to show a percentage of updates downloaded. Then it showed that the updates&nbsp;were installing. Then the update notification
 came back up and told me that the updates had not&nbsp;installed successfully. </p>
<p>At the moment my update window looks like&nbsp;the image below. The difficulty is that I checked, and all of those updates&nbsp;show as having been installed tonight in my list of update history. Chances are that the reason the partial list of updates failed to install
 was that they had already been installed during the time it was telling me that I had zero progress. Now I am stuck with a window telling me I have updates to install, which update history tells me I have already&nbsp;installed. What is my best course of action?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have just checked into uninstalling and reinstalling these updates.&nbsp;Part of the problem is that when I go to "Installed Updates" rather than to Update History, I can find none of the updates listed which the history list claims were installed today. The
 most recent things&nbsp;it shows as&nbsp;installed was installed&nbsp;on September 10, 2014. That was six weeks ago. And&nbsp;I have installed multiple&nbsp;updates for&nbsp;MSE and other things since that time which show in the update history list.
</p>
<p>So, are the updates actually&nbsp;installing, or are they not? And how do I get the update window to either&nbsp;properly install the updates that&nbsp;it claims needs to be installed. Or else how do I get the update window to clear and show there are no updates? Odd problem,
 I know. But I can't just let it go or it may mess me up on future updates. I will go somewhere tomorrow and try again to download and install updates. But I don't know what I may accomplish. I will keep you abreast of my progress. In the meantime, if someone
 knows the way to resolve this, I would appreciate&nbsp;some input,&nbsp;so that I can take care of it in the morning.
</p>
<p>I will utilize the built in Windows Update troubleshooter in the morning and let you know if I succeed in clearing the problem. I have never had to use that before and wasn't aware of it, but did just discovered it. That's a good place to start.
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>Thanks for you reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It dawned on me at about 1:30 this morning that I needed to run a full scan on my computer just to see if anything was going on there. I ran an MSE update and it seemed to update. However, although there were several of those updates listed in Windows update,
 nothing had changed in the status of the picture that I have included in my original question.&nbsp; This morning I&nbsp;found that I had one severe virus. The information read like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exploit:Java/Dotcaf.A</p>
<p>Alert Level: Severe</p>
<p>Status: Active</p>
<p>Action: Quarantine</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did as MSE suggested and asked MSE to remove the virus from my computer, which it said it did.
</p>
<p>This morning I came to a location where I had the available resources, and tried to again update my computer. For&nbsp;several minutes&nbsp;it again showed as attempting to update but&nbsp;0% of 51 MB had been downloaded.&nbsp; This was odd since it had said there were 69 MB.
 Suddenly it jumped to 83% complete and very quickly on to 100%.&nbsp;Updates began to install,&nbsp;and then the updates hung up for quite some time when it reached update 9 of 19. This was the attempted installation of Microsoft Malicious Software Tool, which shows
 as having been successful. I&nbsp; just left&nbsp;the computer&nbsp;alone to see what it would do. After awhile the update notification window showed that 9 updates had been installed and that 10 had been cancelled. Then it asked me to restart the computer to finish installing
 updates. I restarted it and as it was shutting down it was configuring updates, then it restarted and was again configuring updates. Then it began shutting down again and was configuring updates. Finally it restarted and allowed me to sign in to my computer.
 I went to Windows Updates in the Control Panel and found that 10 updates show in history as installed, but only one shows under "Installed Updates." The "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 11 for Windows had been cancelled, despite the fact that
 it is listed as important. Also 16 updates from yesterday had also been cancelled. That&nbsp;was very likely during one of the occasions when I manually cancelled updates because the update was not moving forward. When I completed the updates and again checked
 Windows update it told me that I had no updates to install. Half an hour later, when I checked again for updates, it showed me that I had 10 important updates at 44.4 MB that were available. Since 10 failed to install previously, that made sense to me, so
 I am going to try to install those and see what happens. I will keep you updated on the progress. One of the listed updates that is available is the "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 11. I checked the number on it and it is the same, not a
 different update. So I'm off to install updates again. I will get back to you shortly.
</p>
<p>Janice</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, to continue on. I again went to Windows Update. I checked all&nbsp;10 of the available updates, then told Windows&nbsp;Update to install them. All updates installed without problem. &nbsp;I&nbsp;was then again asked to restart my computer. I did so, and Windows Update
 configured updates as it was shutting down and as it was restarting. Afterwards I was able to log in normally to my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I went again to Windows Update and was told there were no updates available. I then checked the update history and saw that all 10 updates showed as having been successful, including the "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 11." &nbsp;I then
 went into "Installed Updates" and scanned through the list and found that 50, yes 50,&nbsp;updates showed as having been installed today. I wonder if the Exploit virus had hung things up so that&nbsp;some updates&nbsp;showed as installed, but were only downloaded and not
 able to&nbsp;actually install until now.&nbsp; Windows Update now seems normal and everything seems to have resolved.&nbsp; So I think we have this problem licked hopefully for good.
</span></p>
<p><span>I will bookmark this page in case I should need to return to it. Thank you for your time and help. One more victory to mark down for today for all of us. Yea!</span></p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>I have finally had time to check into sending the system and application logs. I have located them. But when I selected "Action" I was not given the option of "Save All Events." It instead gave me the following options "Event Properties," "Attach task to
 this event," "Copy," "Save Selected Events," "Refresh," and "Help." If you can tell me how to proceed from here, I'll be glad to upload and share. It may be the files will give further insights in to what occurred.

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>Okay, what you showed in the picture was exactly what I was looking at, but the listings were not, at that time,&nbsp;the same.</p>
<p>In the meantime I've had other problems with the computer. I clicked on a Yahoo news article titled something like, "Microsoft Warns of New Zero Day Virus, IE Explorer 11." That may not have been the exact title but it was close. Immediately when I clicked
 on that article my menu and favorites bars disappeared as did any navigational&nbsp;controls at the top or bottom of my screen. Where those should have been, my screen&nbsp;was black, or else the text simply ran to the bottom of the screen and I was unable to navigate.
 I had to shut down the computer manually and work for&nbsp;almost an hour&nbsp;before I got those restored. I went back&nbsp;to Yahoo&nbsp;looking for the article so I could post a link and make Microsoft aware of it, and, of course, the article has disappeared. I looked several
 times and cannot locate it.&nbsp; I did type in a search in Yahoo and found similar articles by PC Magazine, ZDnet, and others, but the article I was looking at is not among the listings. I would recognize&nbsp;the webpage&nbsp;if I saw it, but it wasn't from one of the
 sources I normally would read. I may look further when I have the time.</p>
<p>Anyway, having solved that I am now back to the other problem. I went back in to the event viewer, clicked on Actions, and this time the listings displayed as the photo you included indicated. I saved, and uploaded the logs to One Drive. Now my problem is
 how to share them so that you can see them here on the forum. </p>
<p>Okay, maybe I have figured it out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is for the application log:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=226D91CE64E0FFCC!644&amp;authkey=!ADZzKo5gH5LS2vA&amp;ithint=file%2cevtx</p>

<p>
</p><p>I hope I have done this correctly, since I've never done this before. I await your feedback. Thanks very much for your patience and help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just went into Bing and found the link for the news article. It is:</p>
<p>http://www.csoonline.com/article/2837252/vulnerabilities/microsoft-warns-of-new-zero-day-attack.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;time my toolbars stayed put and everything ran smoothly. I don't know if the article itself is a problem, but I would like Microsoft to be aware of&nbsp;the issues I had in reference to it,&nbsp;just in case it is. Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm sorry to be so long in replying. It's been a busy&nbsp;few days.&nbsp;I will try to get some of this done sometime tonight. It may take me a day or two, depending on how long it takes these programs to run. If they aren't hours long like my full scan on MSE then
 I can probably do them both tonight. I will post the results as soon as possible. Thanks again for your assistance.

            <p>Hi Gerry, </p>
<p>Sorry for another delay. I tried and&nbsp;was unable to employ the&nbsp;command prompt as you requested.&nbsp; When I got to chkdsk c: /r it told me that I did not have the privileges to do that.
</p>
<p>This&nbsp;computer was gifted to me by my brother. He has a few things on another account still on here. But he has both his account and mine set up as "Administrator."&nbsp; But, when I go into the drop down menu at the prompt, no listing for "Run as Administrator
 is there." </p>
<p>So I will have to see whether or not he&nbsp;even remembers his password or if he can turn privileges over to me.&nbsp; He is sick right now, so I'll have to get with him as soon as he is able. Perhaps&nbsp;running the command prompt&nbsp;is going to totally take his intervention.
 Hopefully, once I have a chance to talk with him, we can go ahead and get this solved.
</p>
<p>I do appreciate your patience and help. We'll eventually get there. I will be back in touch with any progress as soon as possible. Thanks again.
</p>

<h2>            Game goes on sale 2 days after I buy it on Microsoft store.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I had been holding off on buy Monster Hunter World because I didn't want to pay 60 dollars for it, I seen it go on sale on Newegg but passed because I figured the XBOX store would have that weekend. Well Saturday rolled around and it was still 60 dollars so I went ahead and bit the bullet at 60 dollars, 2 days later it drops to around 45 on XBOX store. I contacted support and they said sorry sale was final. I usually get most of my games from the XBOX store. I figured I could get a refund for the 15 dollars since I didn't have 2-3 hours in the game by the time it went on sale. I was told sorry pretty quickly. </p>
