    <title>My internet connection download speed has dropped considerably - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dhatch01  say:</h3>
<h2>            My internet connection download speed has dropped considerably recently, while my upload speed has stayed the same.</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;Slow download but Fast upload</div>
For the last month my computer's download speed has dropped to about 1-2mbps (it is usually 12-13mbps).&nbsp; All other computers connected through the same cable modem/router are getting full speed on both.&nbsp; Here is what I have tried:<br />
<br />
Alienware Aurora<br />
18GB RAM<br />
Windows 7 64-bit with SP1 installed and auto update, so everything should be current<br />
Broadcom GB Ethernet on the Intel motherboard<br />
<br />
I use Norton 360, AdAware and Spybot Search and Destroy and all are up to date and I have run full scans and the system comes up clean of viruses and malware.<br />
<br />
Of course, I have rebooted everything countless times.<br />
<br />
I have tried bypassing the router and plug my ethernet cable directly into the Zoom 5341 cablemodem and get the same issue.<br />
<br />
I have disconnected the ethernet cable completely and connected through a Netgear N300 Wireless USB adapter and get the same issue.<br />
<br />
I have connected a laptop to the router using the same cable that I pulled out of the problem desktop, and the laptop's connection is perfect.<br />
<br />
Both another Alienware desktop (my son's) and my wife's Apple MacBook Pro, both on wireless, have perfect connections.<br />
<br />
I have booted the system into Safe Mode with Networking Enabled, and get the same issue.<br />
<br />
I have uninstalled and re-installed the Broadcom device and get the same issue.<br />
<br />
Now, here is where the issue gets even stranger....<br />
<br />
If I run the speedtest.knology.net test, I get 1mbps down and 2.5mbps up.<br />
<br />
If I go to speedtest.net and run the test, it depends on which server I connect to.&nbsp; Atlanta is always bad.&nbsp; Memphis is sometimes bad, sometimes good.&nbsp; Arab, AL is always great.<br />
<br />
These same tests on my son's desktop ALL respond with 12-13mbps down and 2.5 up.&nbsp; My wife's laptop is the same.&nbsp; Only MY computer has download speed issues with SOME servers, but always reports 1mbps with Knology.<br />
<br />
I am running out of ideas.&nbsp; I would appreciate any help.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

<h2>            Surface pro won&#39;t display to TV&#39;s with HDMI</h2>
                    <p>It seems the latest Surface Pro's won't display to a TV when using HDMI converters to plug into a TV via HDMI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this to a variety of TV's and cables but none work with the latest Surface Pro. That being said older Surface Pros can display through the same setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on whats up or when this might get resolved?<br />
I have updated to the latest firmware and drivers hoping that might help fix it.</p>
<p>Thank you!<br />

<p><strong><em>updated to the latest firmware and drivers </em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I'm wondering if the "latest drivers" are the problem.&nbsp; The ones that MS seem to be distributing came in June.&nbsp; My Surface 2 Pro gets older ones than that presumably because MS have decided to stop supporting it.&nbsp; I updated to the latest Intel generic
 drivers because I was having the problem of getting HDMI going after Sleep.&nbsp; The newest drivers that I can get for my old processor are dated in Oct and have the flickering to black that Surface 4 Pro users are complaining about and those threads seem to have
 started in June.&nbsp; Currently I can use VGA instead of HDMI but that was a potential workaround for the waking from Sleep symptom anyway.&nbsp; Also, MWDA is still better than HDMI support but not as good as it had been.&nbsp; The main problem with MWDA for a second screen
 is its usability, especially if you want Second Screen Only, same as ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were you I would be trying some older drivers or give up on HDMI and try a different attachment.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I connect to my work network but I can connect to my home netwrok</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;A few weeks ago I went into work, connected to the network.&nbsp; After doing some other work I went back to my computer typed up a document and went to print it only to notice I was no longer on the network.&nbsp; There was no power interruption, the computer did
 not shut off - it was just sitting on my desk.&nbsp; At that point the network would not let me back on.&nbsp; I would get a message saying it can't connect because it timed out or due to user action.&nbsp; I rent space in a small office - there is no IT staff.&nbsp; The landlord
 got someone in and got it connected again.&nbsp; I was able to log in the next time I was in the office with no trouble.&nbsp; A week after I got back on the same thing happened and again I still can't get on.&nbsp; There is someone else coming into the office during this
 time ( I am with a patient when she comes in so it is&nbsp;within the same 30 min timeframe each week, same day)&nbsp;and I am wondering if when she connects could she be kicking me off?&nbsp; The other day I work I am the only one in the office and when it was corrected
 the first time I could get in that day without incident; no one else is having this problem - but they are working on days when this other individual is not in or she is already there and connected when they get in.&nbsp; What can I do to fis this.&nbsp; As of now they
 are telling me it is my problem and that it must be my computer but I am able to connect to my home network without a problem.&nbsp; I am getting very frustrated as I need to go home to print any documents or really work on anything outside of seeing my patients.&nbsp;
 What could the problem be?&nbsp; I think the last time it was fixed they reset the router but they don't want me touching any equipment.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely try and help you in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How many users are configured on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you logged in as the administrator?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you connected on a domain?</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is it a wired or a wireless connection?</p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any anti-virus program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you aware of any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may temporary disable your security software and check.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How can I turn on or turn off the firewall</a> in Windows XP Service Pack
 2 or later versions?</p>
<p>Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software.
 If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try the steps and check if it helps. (You have to be logged in as the administrator to perform the steps)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Click Start.</p>
<p>b. Click Run</p>
<p>c. Type cmd.exe and press ENTER.</p>
<p>d. Type the following commands and press ENTER.</p>
<p>ipconfig /flushdns</p>
<p>ipconfig /registerdns</p>
<p>ipconfig /release</p>
<p>ipconfig /renew</p>

<h3> myphone_htc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to restore an image to a system with a new RAID controller&#63;</h2>
                    I had backup my system - image, apps, and files - when the system had a PCI RAID controller.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My RAID controller and one of the hard drives failed</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The system was rebuilt with the RAID controller on the motherboard and the OS was&nbsp;re-installed&nbsp;on this array...however, instead of installing all the apps, settings, and data; I wanted to restore my old image.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What happens is that after the full restore, the old drivers are in the image and not the driver for the new controller...when the computer boots, it instantly goes into system repair.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Questions:</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;Is my problem that I have to find a way to inject the new driver into the image?</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Is there some other boot record repair work I have to do? Note that when I restored, the windows image is on "D:" and "C:" appears to be the recovery partition</div>
<div>3. &nbsp;Am I out of luck and should just restore to the prior Win7 image that was re-installed and hand install all the applications - will my data files remain if I do this?</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Mouse clicking on its own</h2>
                    So, i have a huge issue and i can't figure how to solve it for a month or so now. My computer running windows 10 64 bit started to click everywhere i hover the mouse for some reason. I tried to switch up batteries for my pointing device, i tried to switch
 to another mouse, i tried to disable touchpad (By the way i dont have touchscreen - it seems a lot of people had problems with it) I even tried to switch operating systems. I went to windows 7 and now i'm currently on windows 8, but it won't stop clicking
 and i can't do my work because of it. Maybe someone had this problem too and can help? I would really appreciate it. :)

<h2>            Windows 10 Samsung Monitor not detected</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using a samsung monitor(Model:&nbsp;LS20CMZKF/XL) with my laptop. However, the monitor is not being detected by the laptop after upgrading to windows 10. Earlier, in windows 8, I was shown that the display resolution is too low to connect. Is there a way
 to resolve this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Naitik,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform the below troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span></p>
<p><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
<br />
To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, Display Port to VGA, or any other combination.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Follow the steps mentioned in the following article:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
<br />
Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer’s site for an updated driver.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please note Windows 10 requires a minimum screen resolution of 1024x600 to run.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope the information helps. Please keep us posted on the issue. We will be happy to assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<h2>            keyboard unresponsive upon resume from sleep</h2>
                    <p>Every other time my notebook resumes from sleep, the keyboard is unresponsive; that is, no letter, number, function key, etc. has any effect. This behavior is perfectly repeatable; it happens on exactly alternating wakeup attempts. The keyboard always works
 after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter whether I require a password upon resuming or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Device Manager lists two keyboards: Microsoft USB Dual Receiver Wireless Keyboard and Standard PS/2 Keyboard. I don't know which my notebook uses.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth isn&#39;t working</h2>
                    So, for a while my Bluetooth has not been working. I've tried almost everything to fix it and when I tried the troubleshooter it told me that my device did not support Bluetooth. This would have made since if I had not been able to use it when I got it.
 But in reality I was able to use Bluetooth (I use a PS4 controller for gaming and I was able to connect via Bluetooth without a dongle or cord). I would really like to know whether or not this can be fixed because I really enjoyed having wireless gaming without
 a sometimes expensive Bluetooth Dongle.

            Hello Zach, i'm wondering if there have been any hardware changes? Maybe you had  USB inserted that the controller was connecting to? Bluetooth has to have it's signal received by some form of hardware.
<br />
<br />I look forward to helping you fix this issue.

<h2>            xbox failing to update, tried all possibilities posted</h2>
                    
<p>Hello I've got an xbox 360 Slim, with a 250-gb hard drive. I keep getting an update error, and I've tried any and all ways to update it (through USB/CD, cleaing the cache and updates on the system, etc.) I don't need to be told to power cycle the system,
 and unplug everything and replug everything, or doing the "LB-RB-X-LB-RB-X" trick, or clearing the cache, etc. because I've done that multiple times, trust me I'm very thorough. Any suggestion to do these things are pointless since I obviously attempt the
 easiest solutions first and have often repeated them.</p>

<p>Here's the error code I'm getting:</p>
<p>3F4A - 4174 - 1600 - 267F - C000 - 0185</p>

<p>I've deduced the problem to a few possibilities, but have also ruled out the following:</p>
<p>its NOT my internet connection</p>
<p>its NOT to do with the EXTERNAL hard drive (the 250GB one that you can remove)</p>

<p>I've noticed while tinkering around with the dang thing (haven't even really gotten to play it) that the INTERNAL memory of the xbox (the flash memory that I'm guessing is attached to the motherboard) is most probably corrupted. It has a handful of items
 on the memory, most of which are corrupted, and can't be deleted. If you try formatting and clearing the system cache, nothing. If you go to them and delete the files manually, they seem to delete but on a restart of the system they're there again.</p>

<p>So what I've found: I'm guessing when attempting to update the system, it wants to put the update onto the flash memory instead of my 250GB hard drive or any other USB flash drive I put into the xbox. Because of that, the update obviously won't load because
 the hard drive is completely incapable of reading, writing or even deleting anything.</p>

<p>So my question: Is there a way to bypass the internal memory? and update it onto the 250GB harddrive, which is PLENTY for me since I'm only into a few xbox games anyways. I thought there might be something possible after watching this video:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKenrxMnh8U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKenrxMnh8U</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/lKenrxMnh8U?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/lKenrxMnh8U?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>The only difference between our problems is his internal hard drive says "unformatted" while mine says "1.2GB free" and looks like its about half-used. also, he's using the 4GB xbox 360, I'm using the one with the 250GB hard drive included. Finally, his
 way of fixing the xbox worked, whereas obviously it didn't work for me. I wish I could do what this guy did:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpN_7PnRcrg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpN_7PnRcrg</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/HpN_7PnRcrg?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/HpN_7PnRcrg?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>&nbsp;but its not that easy for me :(</p>
<p>I really need some help with this, please.</p>

<h2>            Unable to boot&#58; Blue screen&#58; 7f  ndis.sys  </h2>
                    
<p>original title:&nbsp;Blue screen of death ndis.sys on bootup, cannot boot in any safe mode at all either!</p>
<p>My computer problem has escalated very quickly.&nbsp; Within the past day, I was able to boot Windows 7 (64) normally and, after an average of 3 minutes after bootup, only receive a BSoD indicating the following error log:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem Signature<br />
Problem Event Name: BlueScreen<br />
OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.768.3<br />
Locale ID: 1033<br />
<br />
Additional info:<br />
BCCode: 7f<br />
BCP1: 0000000000000008 <br />
BCP2: 0000000080050031<br />
BCP3: 00000000000006F8<br />
BCP4: FFFFF80002E95CC0<br />
OS Version: 6_1_7600<br />
Service Pack:&nbsp; 0_0<br />
Product:&nbsp; 768_1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the same exact BSoD error code on this forum post: http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7repair/thread/ad132c35-bedf-4910-90e4-60f661c52049.&nbsp; Coincidentally enough, I had ZoneAlarm installed on my computer.&nbsp; I booted into Safe Mode and
 uninstalled the program and was prompted to restart in order for the changes to take effect.&nbsp; Now, after I did this, I am completely unable to get Windows 7 to start in either safe mode or normal mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to see the Welcome Screen for an average of 2 seconds before the BSoD occurs.&nbsp; The BSoD error I receive when I start normally rolls by too fast for me to copy in its entirety, but it indicates a problem with ndis.sys, DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
 and a STOP 0x000000D1 error code.&nbsp; Now, whenever I try to boot into safe mode, it starts loading files and stops at Classpnp.sys, and hangs for 5 or 6 minutes before giving up and rebooting.</p>
<p>I cannot provide any more information because I simply cannot get the OS to boot properly in any way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is exactly the one shown in this BestBuy page: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Dell+-+Inspiron+Desktop+with+Intel%26%23174%3B+Core%26%23153%3B+i5+Processor/9697521.p?id=1218153428223&amp;skuId=9697521&amp;st=dell%20inspiron%20580&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No hardware has been modified inside the machine.&nbsp; Virus scan was conducted earlier when Win7 was loaded and there was nothing malicious found.&nbsp; I do (or rather, did) have a persistent problem with the computer being unable to return from sleep mode, but
 I feel this is unrelated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Win7 reinstallation disc from Dell, but before I go through using it I want to know whether it will be able to simply reinstall/repair system files without reformatting my HD and/or losing my personal data.&nbsp; If not, is there a way to get some of
 my personal files to safely transfer to an external HD or USB thumbdrive before I am forced to reformat?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hi Moonwho78,</span></p>
<p><span><span>•</span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> First you may try to&nbsp;<strong>disconnect all the external devices</strong>
 (printers, scanner, USB drives, etc...) except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this corrects the issue then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue. Then get any updated
 drivers\software for the device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: Since you have a Windows 7 reinstallation
 disc<strong>, </strong>you may also<strong>&nbsp; try a Startup Repair. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To do Startup Repair, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Insert the&nbsp;<strong>installation disc</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.&nbsp;<strong>Restart&nbsp;</strong>your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.&nbsp;Click the&nbsp;<strong>Start button</strong>, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>.
 If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If your computer is not configured to start from a
 CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.&nbsp;Choose your&nbsp;<strong>language settings</strong>, and then click<strong>&nbsp; Next</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;<strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f.&nbsp;Select the&nbsp;<strong>operating system</strong> you want to repair, and then click<strong>&nbsp; Next</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>g. On the&nbsp;<strong>System Recovery Options</strong> menu, click&nbsp;<strong>Startup Repair</strong>. Startup Repair might prompt
 you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information you may refer the following links:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Startup repair:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><strong><span>If startup
 repair doesn’t help, then</span></strong><span>you may also try a&nbsp;<strong>System Restore booting from a Windows 7 disc.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) to run System Restore</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Insert the&nbsp;<strong>Windows 7 installation disc</strong> into the disc drive, and then
 start the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …” appears.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click
 Next.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Click&nbsp;<strong>Repair your computer</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. In the&nbsp;<strong>System Recovery Options</strong> dialog box,&nbsp;<strong>choose the drive
</strong>of your Windows installation and click&nbsp; <strong>Next.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. At the System Recovery Options Dialog Box, click on&nbsp;<strong>System Restore.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>g. Follow the System Restore Wizard instruction as usual and&nbsp;<strong>choose the restore
 point prior to this issue.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are trying a custom installation, then you may refer these links and follow the steps mentioned in the link to perform Custom installation:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/install-reinstall-uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/install-reinstall-uninstall</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> This process of installation
 removes everything stored on the computer. Make sure that you have a good backup of all the information stored on your computer. You have to also reinstall the applications which were on the system after performing the custom installation.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

    <title>Surface pro &#39;no signal&#39; on Cintiq 22hd - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> velanoble  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pro &#39;no signal&#39; on Cintiq 22hd</h2>
                    <p>Ok my setup is fairly complex (for me at least)I have a i7 Surface pro and have used with a Cintiq 12wx in the past, I have a surface dock, but usually use a adapter (cable matters,active) to go from the cintiqs DVI to mini display port on the Surface. Things
 worked fine in past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a new Cintiq 22hd only about a week ago and it worked fine, until I unplugged It and used Surface with an Wacom Intuos (just via USB) at a local cafe. Now it suddenly wont notice this external display, I get 'no signal'.</p>
<p>It is picking up the driver and pen as I move it around, but not getting screen display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent way too long trying to fix it and the thing is, I re-tested the DVI to mini display cable on my old cintiq (which worked fine a week ago) AND on a Cintiq in my office (exact same as mine).....and it didn't respond to either of these!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why I think its a surface issue. I've had so much problems with the surface and other products, this is actually my SECOND surface on same warranty because old one died of battery issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>

            Dear VelaNoble 
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear you're having problems with your Surface Pro.
<br />
<br />I used a Surface Pro 3 with a Cintiq 22HD via Surface Dock, and now a Surface book 2 with a 13HD also via the Dock. No issues there.
<br />
<br />I don't switch between an Intuos and Cintiq, but I understand both should use the same driver... Is the latest driver from Wacom installed (<a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-support/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-sup...</a>)? Have you tried reinstalling the driver?

<p>Yes, i wiped all the drivers, and reinstalled only the one for the cintiq.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't reacting to the mini displayport cable being plugged in, and because I've tested the cable to my Surface on 2 other Cintiqs, I guess it must be a cable problem or my surface has 'video card issues' or something</p>

            Dear VelaNoble 
<br />
<br />Yes, I'd like to rule out the above two as well.
<br />- can you go into Start Menu &gt; Device Manager and see if there are any yellow exclamation marks on top of any icons representing the drivers there? 
<br />- have you tried another DVI-mDP cable?

<p>There are no yellow exclamation points in my Device Manager. I just did a surface 'kernel restart&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/surface-pro-two-button-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/surface-pro-two-button-shutdown</a>&nbsp;which
 I wont know if it really work till I go home and test with my cintiq.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have another adapter I can use, I will buy a new one as a last resort. Perhaps the cable matters one has suddenly broken, but it seems unlikely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be worth mentioning my surface doc works fine with a BenQ monitor, so its getting HDMI fine. Just the dock and computer aren't react to Mini display port....</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I think that there is some problem with your Java Virtual Machine.
<br />To solve your issue, I suggest you to uninstall Java from your system, reboot and then reinstall Java VM. 
<br />You can get  Java on <a href="https://www.java.com/it/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.java.com/it/download/</a>

<br />
<br />Please let me know if that solves your issue.

            Hi Ritik
<br />
<br />Open the old Control Panel (click your Start Button, then just type control and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Go to System - Advanced System Settings
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, choose the Advanced tab - Environment Variables 
<br />
<br />Then highlight the Path variable in the 'System variables' section and click Edit
<br />
<br />Add the path lines with the path : 'C:\Program files\Java\jre1.8.0_60\bin' 
<br />(Check this is the correct path in your Program Files\Java directory)
<br />
<br /> Relaunch the installer again . . .

<h2>            Some Fonts not displaying correctly or at all after 5&#47;13 Windows 7 Updates</h2>
                    I have two computers each with Windows 7 Pro. &nbsp;Both received the updates provided by Microsoft on Tuesday, May 13, 2015. &nbsp;One one, the fonts are fine. &nbsp;On the other, all notification windows, such as the Outlook Send/Receive Process window - and especially
 the Outlook Calendar window - and fonts on certain web sites in Firefox, look large, fuzzy and much more 'complicated' than the fonts looked the previous evening, which were simple sans serif system fonts. &nbsp;I did not add or delete any fonts recently, or made
 any other adjustment to any font folder. &nbsp;The Outlook process windows are so large, they are unusable. &nbsp; I went into Control Panel and restored the Font settings by clicking Restore default font settings. &nbsp;Nothing happened. &nbsp;The OK button never lit up for
 use. &nbsp;I then downloaded a complete list of all Windows 7 system Fonts and made sure each Font was installed. &nbsp;They are. &nbsp;Re-booted the computer a few times. &nbsp;Nothing. &n

            Thank you - I really appreciate the response! &nbsp;But I figured it out. &nbsp;For some reason, 32 fonts became corrupted from the updates. &nbsp;I say from the updates because I had a very slow day on Mon-Tues - and only used Outlook. &nbsp;So no other program could have
 corrupted the Fonts as I see it by the time I turned on my computer on Wednesday and noticed the difference. &nbsp;The 32 fonts were in the main Windows 7 Font Folder. &nbsp;They stopped 'working' for some reason. &nbsp;So I deleted them, copied them from another computer,
 re-installed them, and now the notification windows look small and normal and workable again.

                    <p>I have a new computer windows 8.1 and have been using lotus 123 SmartSuite for 15+ years. I have created a "special worksheet" and use it for building proposals for my potential customers. This spreadsheet has "custom" icons that I have created and named
 for easy access to pricing and quoting. I would like to try and "import" the entire program so I can try to function as before.</p>
<p>I have tried to copy the files using a thumb drive and can see the files, but I cannot open them. Seems like it directs me to explorer and wants me to "download" them. Any simple way to import or transfer this program, complete, to my new laptop?</p>

                    I am stuck in a nefarious blue screen loop and i cant seem to get a straight answer. I performed a computer “refresh” (HP Pavilion 510-a010 running Windows 10 Home). Upon restarting I got the stop code:&nbsp;ATTEMPTED EXECUTE OF NOEXECUTE MEMORY. And it just
 continuously keeps rebooting. What muddies the water in my case is that I also have a “power-on password” that I have to type in before Windows loads. So when I try to access the UEFI the power-on password screen disrupts the entire flow and it tries to boot
 normally! Help!

<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/attempted-execute-noexecute-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/attempted-execut...</a>
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then also go through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

    <title>New DELL XPS laptop with Windows 10 will not duplicate screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amy mke  say:</h3>
<h2>            New DELL XPS laptop with Windows 10 will not duplicate screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug my new laptop to a projector, it will not duplicate the screen.&nbsp; If I use Powerpoint in presenter mode, it will project the slides on the screen.&nbsp; but if I toggle to a pdf file or a word doc - the screen goes blank.&nbsp; it will not project it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hit the windows logo key and P and select the duplicate screen - but the screen stays blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp; it is pretty frustrating for someone who does frequent presentations!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,&nbsp; Amy</p>

<p><span>Hi Amy,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you updated the display driver on the PC?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you make any changes to the laptop prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, let us try these steps one by one and check if that makes any difference.</span></p>
<p><span>Step1: Let us try to update the display driver on the PC to check if that makes any difference.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the steps from this article.</span></p>
<p><span>Update drivers in Windows 10:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>Step2: You may also want to enable the multiple display option from the Settings screen.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Open the Settings screen, click on System.</span></p>

<span>Click the "Multiple displays" drop-down box.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select a display option. In most cases, you'll want to click Extend these displays to use the second monitor as an extension of your computer's main display, thus adding more room
 to the right side of your desktop.</span></p>

<span>Save your changes. Click Apply, then click Keep changes when prompted. Doing so will prompt your computer to begin using the second display as indicated.</span></p>

<p>Hello Srimadhwa:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the reply.&nbsp; However, I am not trying to extend to a second monitor.&nbsp; I am giving presentations and only have this issue when connecting to a projector to project the files on my laptop on a big screen for an audience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions - yes everything is updated - for both windows and dell.&nbsp; this is a brand new laptop and I ran all the updates when setting it up and have checked to see if there are any new updates - so this does not apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent a large amount of time googling this issue and reading message boards before posting - many people tried these driver fixes and it did not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After spending time with the laptop plugged into the projector, and looking at settings, I determined that it was actually a resolution issue!&nbsp; When I changed the resolution on the display settings, it must have made it compatible with the projector
 and I was able to duplicate my screen and project powerpoint, excel, word and pdfs on the big screen.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So my best estimate is that newer laptops are having issues with older projectors.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <title>SfB DPI scalling on 4k TVs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshm89  say:</h3>
<h2>            SfB DPI scalling on 4k TVs</h2>
                    <p>In our meeting rooms, we have 4k TVs used for Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Win10 Default recommendations of 4k resolution with DPI scaling set at 300% this makes all apps, text etc easy to read on the TV's.</p>
<p>Every app is fine but Skype for Business when in a video call with more then 2 people. Their video tiles become extremely small.</p>
<p>Setting the DPI to 100% makes Skype video much bigger, how ever every single other app in windows becomes smaller. Its like DPI scaling for Skype is reversed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now we find setting the resolution to 1080p with 150% DPI a work around, though this defeats the purpose of having 4k. And needs to be manually set(we have around 30 meeting rooms)</p>
