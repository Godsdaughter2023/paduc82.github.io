<h2>            &#34;Format not supported&#34; cannot connect the computer to TV.</h2>
                    Original title: "format not supported"<br />
<br />
I have my PC connected to a 19" Phillips HDTV and it worked find for the past year. I recently attempted to split the PCs image to two TVs with a VGA Y-splitter. Not only did it not work, now I my Phillips TV is now saying "format not supported" and won't show
 my PCs image on the screen even without the Y-splitter. In other words I connected it like previously had it and it still gives me the "format not supported" message. Do I have to change the resolution settings or what?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Either the screen resolution or the refresh rate you have set in your computer's display properties are too high for the TV. If you can't change the TV to match (because it doesn't have a match for your computer's display settings) you will need to use your
 pc to fix it.<br />
<br />
To use your computer, keep hitting the F8 button as it starts up (like you would do to get to safe mode) but instead of safe mode choose 'Enable VGA Mode' - this will allow your computer to start up normally but with a low resolution/refresh rate that the TV
 will recognize OK.<br />
<br />
Once you have logged into Windows, go into Display Properties and lower the refresh rate (usually 50 or 60 for a tv) and change the screen resolution to something that matches your tTV, It depends the size your TV, but 1360x768 should work for a widescreen
 TV.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company has around 80 Windows 7 licenses (Open License) and these were used to the old machines that was decommissioned already and the licenses were not extracted before the machines were disposed. How do we recover these licenses to be used on other

<p>All FPP products come with the Product Key in the packaging, usually on a sticker attached to a card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Open License products are Volume License - you should be able to contact your vendor, who will probably have a record of the Keys applicable.</p>

<p>If these licenses are FPP, then it's simply a case of activation on the new machine - you may need to do Operator activation to clear it with&nbsp; MS.</p>

<h3> starryomen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Bar audio is fuzzy&#47;hard to hear</h2>
                    <p>So when I'm recording games using Game Bar, I am perfectly able to hear the audio inside the game. But when my microphone is enabled, things become static and I can hardly hear my own voice unless I'm really loud. Here's a short video of what I mean: https://youtu.be/jeuazm_S_MI</p>
<p>When people hear me inside the game (and on Discord, Skype, etc), my audio is perfectly fine. But for some reason when I try to record my own audio, it sounds awful.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate some help on how to fix this, and I am open to trying new screen recording apps that are simple to use, can record my internal sounds as well as my own voice.</p>

            Hi Omen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See GameBar troubleshooting steps here:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028582/windows-10-fix-problems-with-game-bar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402858...</a>

<br />
<br />Next troubleshoot PC audio:
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems.  If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1) First try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 Boot &#47; Repair Disc freezes at blue &#34;Keyboard Layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cowboy48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Boot &#47; Repair Disc freezes at blue &#34;Keyboard Layout Screen&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Just finished making the Windows 10 64 bit repair disc.&nbsp; Made it through windows control panel option ... and the disc can not boot up the PC.&nbsp; It always freezes at the blue "keyboard layout scree" where I have no keyboard or mouse to change the layout or
 move on to the next screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to do a hard shut down and everything is fine... but if the computer ever fails I won't have a disc to boot it up.&nbsp; I also tried it using a usb flash drive and also copied the ISO files etc.&nbsp; and the all do the same thing ... when I get to the blue
 screen I can't move on because I have no keyboard or mouse to pick a selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a Windows 10 problem?&nbsp; Just to test out the BIOS I used my old Windows 7 boot disc and that works fine (I do abort it though to avoid any problems using an old boot up disc.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone experience this before?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <title>disable bluetooth Secure Simple Pairing &#40;ssp&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marius78  say:</h3>
<h2>            disable bluetooth Secure Simple Pairing &#40;ssp&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have an old Bluetooth headset (Z-W88), which cannot be paired in Windows 7 - it shows a code and it asks me to compare it to the one on the headset. No matter how I respond to the question (yes or no), the pairing fails.<br />
I figured it out that my headset does not implement / miss-implement other authentication than PIN authentication.<br />
In Windows XP, which does not provide support for Bluetooth 2.1+EDR and Secure Simple Pairing, I was able to use the headset without any problem.<br />
<br />
In Ubuntu 12.04, initially I had the same authentication problem. But after I executed the command "hciconfig hci0 sspmode 0", I was able to connect the headset.<br />
My question is how can I do the same thing in Windows? How can I disable the Secure Simple Pairing Mode? I couldn't find any option in the Bluetooth settings. I searched in the registry, but still nothing. I wrote a C++ program in which, in the Bluetooth authentication
 callback, I set/force the authMethod member of the BLUETOOTH_AUTHENTICATE_RESPONSE structure to BLUETOOTH_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD_LEGACY and pass it to BluetoothSendAuthenticationResponseEx function. Still nothing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

    <title>Restoring missing program to All Programs list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonnielg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restoring missing program to All Programs list</h2>
                    I unintentionally removed the Microsoft Word program from my All Programs list that is accessible from the Start button.&nbsp; I can't figure out how to restore it. &nbsp; (Restoring Start Menu defaults did not resolve the problem.). The Microsoft Word program got
 removed from the All Programs list when I dragged it to the desktop to make a shortcut there (I realize now that that was the wrong thing to do).&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me how to restore my Microsoft Word program to the All Programs list.
<br />
<br />
Also, the MS Word icon is no longer associated with the shortcut on the desktop (instead a default Windows icon is showing for that shortcut). Please tell me how to get the MS Word icon to show for the desktop shortcut, if possible.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<h2>            View settings in Windows 10 folders not being saved</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows 10 for a few months now, and am just now encountering a problem. &nbsp;When I open any File Explorer window, the View settings (Extra large icons, Large icons, etc) for the files in that folder are not the same as they were the last
 time I had this folder open. &nbsp;If I change this and go to a sub-folder and then go back to the original folder, the new View settings I just changed it to is no longer in effect - it has reverted to the original View settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens with EVERY File Explorer window I open, for any folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what is causing this, why it is happening, and how to fix it?</p>

<br />
Most laptops have the Product Key on a label affixed to the bottom of the machine. If yours is not readable, you'll need to contact Compaq support:

<br />
You will not need to reregister your software.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 does not get installed</h2>
                    


I have been using Windows 8 Pro in my desktop assembled PC having GIGABYTE motherboard GA-H61M-S2P Rev 3 with Intel Core i3 processor and 4 GB RAM. After having satisfied with upgrading W8 to W8.1 through Windows Store (free upgrading), I purchased Windows 8.1 from Microsoft Store. I was provided with a download link along with a product key. But unfortunately, while trying to clean install W8.1 with the DVD I burnt from the .iso image from the download, it is not getting installed with a message stating that winload.exe file in Win32 is either missing or corrupted. It also shows an error code 0x0000001. 



I contacted MIcrosoft customer support group (India) for resolving the problem. after few days of discussions, they have informed me that my motherboard may not support W8.1. Currently I am using W8 pro as my OS and I fail to understand as to why the same motherboard which can support W8, cannot support W8.1. As you will be aware that I have already purchased W8.1. Please help me re

            <p>Hi Rajib,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have Windows 8 installed on the PC currently? If yes, are you able to boot to the Windows 8 desktop?<br />
<br />
Please refer to this article for <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 8.1 system requirements</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you already have Windows 8 with a valid product key, then you can upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows Store itself.</p>

<p>(You can go through the step by step instructions)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if you are able to boot to Windows 8, then run the Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assistant.<br />

Windowsload.exe, this is a problem with the BCD. The database gets corrupted and Windows reports the problem is winload.exe.

            <p>Hi RajithR,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased Win 8.1 from Microsoft store with a download link and a product key. Having failed in many attempts to install Win8.1, I then redownload the OS from Microsoft site and made one boot flash drive and also burn one boot DVD. Whilst, the windows
 still could not be loaded with the DVD, I was this time successsful with the flash drive. Additionally, I have been also successful in installing Win 8.1 (rather upgrading windows 7 home premium) directly from the desktop download (not using either the DVD
 or the flash drive). Prior to my second time downloading, all attempts to install Win 8.1 were unsuccessful for which I sought Microsoft community help. But I am still surprised why my DVD (created from the .iso image of the download) fails to load the OS
 when the flash drive is a success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Maybe. A thumb drive is like any other kind of drive in this respect.</div>
<div>Here's my standard message on the subject:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Deleting" a file doesn't actually delete it; it just marks the space</div>
<div>as available to be used. There are third-party programs that can</div>
<div>sometimes recover deleted files. The problem is that the space used by</div>
<div>the file is likely to become overwritten very quickly, and this makes</div>
<div>the file unrecoverable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So your chances of successfully recovering this file are decent if you</div>
<div>try recovering it immediately after deleting it, and rapidly go</div>
<div>downhill from there if you continue to write on the drive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Download an undelete program (here's one good one:</div>
<div>http://www3.telus.net/mikebike/RESTORATION.html but there are several</div>
<div>others to choose from; do a search).</div>

            <p>Hello Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt Windows media center files or settings. This may also happen due to software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>uninstall and reinstall Windows media center from Windows features
</strong>and check. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + X keys </strong>together and click <strong>programs and features.</strong><br />
b. Click "<strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong>".<br />
c. Click to expand <strong>media features</strong>, click to <strong>uncheck Windows media center box
</strong>and click <strong>ok</strong>.<br />
d. To <strong>reinstall </strong>it, you may click to <strong>check Windows media center box
</strong>and click <strong>ok</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check the issue.<br />
Refer this article:<br />

<h2>            My DVD drive is not working and all the information I can find is &#39;this device is not working properly&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have Windows Vista and I'm using a Dell studio laptop. When I insert a disc into my CD/DVD drive, the disc spins and it sounds like it is&nbsp;about to start up&nbsp;and&nbsp;makes the same start-up noise a few times then&nbsp;just stops. My computer doesn't register
 that there is a disc there. If I double click the DVD drive in 'My Computer' it ejects my disc and says 'please insert disc into drive E'.</p>
<p>I went onto the Microsoft 'fix it' scanner online and it told me that there is a problem but it can't fix it. In Device Manager, under DVD/CD-ROM Drives I have Optiarc DVD+-RW AD-7640S. Under properties - general - device status, it says 'This device is
 not working properly'. It also says that I have the most up-to-date driver.</p>
<p>I even uninstalled the driver as a last resort and then restarted my computer. It reinstalled the driver for me but there was no change. Please help me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total
<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -
<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -
<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue
<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose
<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
The CD drive or the DVD drive does not work as expected on a computer that you upgraded
<br />
to Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461</span></a><br />
<br />
When you insert a CD or a DVD, Windows Vista may not recognize the disc<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD
<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others
<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some registry
<br />
entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause. <br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the
<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course as
<br />
there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as the
<br />
settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD
<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed response. From the description of your post, it appears that you are unable to use Office applications after upgrading to Windows 8. Also, you cannot uninstall the same as you are unable to open Control Panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could probably happen if the installation was not proper.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you recieve any error when launching Control Panel or does it simply crash?</li><li>Do other applications open fine?</li></ul>
<p>I suggest that you run SFC scan on the computer to see if fixes the issue. SFC (System File Checker) checks for any corrupt system files and tries to repair them. To do so, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>At the <strong>Start screen</strong>, type <strong>cmd</strong>.</li><li>You will find <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, <strong>right click</strong> on it and select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the <strong>bottom of the screen.</strong></li><li>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press enter: <span>
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span> </li></ol>
<p>The <b>sfc /scannow</b> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions. Once done, try accessing Control Panel and see if you can uninstall the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do reply if you still face the issue. Thank you.</p>

    <title>Forza Horizon just keeps updating&#47;installing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spitfirex007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza Horizon just keeps updating&#47;installing</h2>
                    <p>I went out and bought a new Xbox today. I grabbed the system and Horizon 4. This was at noon. I come home, install the game and download the update. The game allows me to play when it was close to complete. I do a few races, the game freezes. I restart the
 game and do the same race. It freezes a second time. I figured maybe the game needed to finish the update. So I run to the store and do a few things. Come back and go to fire it up once the update was done. Then it tells me the game needs installed from the
 disk. Ok, so I do that. Install finished I fire up the game. It crashes and goes back to dash. Says I need to download the 23.64GB update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why the hell is going on with this system? I bought it brand new today. I have a 3 day weekend and am dying to play Forza. But he it is 6:30pm and I can't play the damn thing. Any suggestions on what is going on or how to fix it? I'm downloading this update
 again. If it doesn't work, the system and game are both going back and I'll stick to my Playstation 4.

<p>Hi friend</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I explain you can be several things, in my experience sometimes:</p>
<p>- A bad network connection can be the detail, I recommend connecting the xbox for ethernet so that the installation is appropriate, (it is downloaded faster)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Another option is to cancel the game and download it again, by ethernet</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Another option may be the sauracion of the hard drive but I don't think because you don't have many games installed</p>

            One it's all done and you try to play it and it crashes, also make sure to completely shut the game down by going to the dashboard, going over the game tile and pressing Start and then selecting Quit. This will completely shut it down, so you can try to
 relaunch it. I hope you've got it working now, keep us updated if you are still having issues.

            I finally got it to work. Had to download the update twice. Which is kinda annoying because I share the net with a few roommates and we don't have the best speed. At least it works now.

    <title>Should I create pagefile on ramdisk with my new SSD&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Should I create pagefile on ramdisk with my new SSD&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Got my new SSD which is the only disk in my system now. To avoid heavy writing on this drive I have purchased Superspeed Ramdisk plus (IE temp files etc). I have Windows Vista Business 32 bit with 4Gb ram. The Ramdisk software is able to use the 512-1024 ram
 that Vista cant use. Also, this software can serialize ramdisk content so that it IS possible to run the pagefile here.<br />
<br />
I only use this laptop for office applications so I'm never near to max out the virtual memory.<br />
<br />
So, should I create my pagefile on a Ramdisk? And if yes, would it be enough with 512Mb pagefile? Will Vista let me define this setting or create pagefile on my boot drive regardless of my settings?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just for the clarification and the difference from this thread and 1000 others, my concern here is the constant writing in the pagefile on my SSD. Not the small (if any) gain the pagefile in Ram would produce...<br />
<br />

            SSD? Nice.<br />
<br />
I would try and run the pagefile from the Ramdisk to test it out, depending on your needs you might have to go to the SSD.&nbsp; However, you should have the system manage that anyways.&nbsp; You&nbsp;might want to modify it, but for now, since the system is new with plenty
 of RAM, test out how the Ramdisk pagefile works if it doesn't work for you.&nbsp; You can always use the standard configuration in having the pagefile managed by the system on the drive.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly I am not too familiar with the Ramdisk software and of course:<br />

    <title>How do I move C&#58;&#92;Users to an existing partition and mount it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> impinball  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I move C&#58;&#92;Users to an existing partition and mount it to that directory&#63;</h2>
                    I am dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows 7, and I was wanting to have both of them using the same drive for their user data (i.e. C:\Users and /home for Windows and Ubuntu, respectively). I was also going to toy with shortcuts as well if necessary, and I am
 not afraid of the registry if that gets involved. I have looked all over this forum to no avail, and I couldn't find anything remotely helpful on Google after trying to find an answer for multiple days.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here was what I was wanting to do:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Move all my user data to a drive already containing some stuff from my Linux installation. I know that since NT kernel calls are case insensitive and the profiles are going to be stored in a similar pattern, I wouldn't have to make a lot of use of shortcuts,
 and it would be easier to set up most of them in Linux.</li><li>Mount that partition to C:\Users. I know that <i>that</i>&nbsp;one will be easier to accomplish through a temporary admin set up outside both the C: drive and F: drive (the one that I was wanting to mount) to take care of what is needed, but I also don't want
 to risk too much in tearing things up (I have had a back-up recovery DVD for a while that I made, but I don't have anything with enough storage to do a full System Backup on).</li></ul>
<div>There are a few things I need to know how to do, though, to do some of the things I referenced here:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>How would I create a profile outside of the C:\Users default directory?</li><li>How would I accomplish the migration itself (a.k.a. copy everything, including protected system files, and clear the directory before doing the mounting process...)</li><li>If the mounting process isn't done in a really similar manner to assigning a drive letter (which I thought it was), how would that be done? (I do know how to assign and change drive letters at will, whether through the shell or through diskmgmt.exe..I wish
 it could work in its own boot mode, which I haven't heard otherwise about 7 or 8)</li></ol>
<div>I have changed the registry before (added/deleted keys, added/deleted values), but I don't know the inner workings of how it plays out with Windows itself, so I would have to know the exact key or value to add/remove/edit (or a really narrow place to look...not
 like HKLM).</div>

            Even with a recovery disc, is it even possible? (I was talking about C:\Users, not C:\Windows\Users.) I was going to copy everything to it (via robocopy), and the easiest solution I could find/work out was to make a user (admin, obviously) on a different
 path from that folder, and then mount said partition to that directory (in which Windows would treat it exactly like that folder in every way barring partition management). Using the approach of an admin not in that directory, then it should alleviate the
 problem (there shouldn't be anything using the directory, and the Default User, etc. folders are symlinked). I would be copying everything (i.e. robocopy /copyall), up to and inxluding timestamps and permissions. My last step would be to clear the directory
 and perform the mount.
<div><br />
<div>My main question here is how to make a user and have it completely off of the C:\Users directory (it would be fresh, and if I need to make adjustments before getting on it in the first place, I could). Whether it is an admin or not, the process should
 be fairly similar (other than the choice of account type). Once I have that account created, I have found enough info to do it myself. (I already know how to copy and mount both, but most accomplished this by a mass of symlinks, which isn't useful as a long
 term remedy IMO.</div>

<p>First calm down, don't use profanity (even if it is star-ed out)....the wait time is so that people don't just license transfer when ever a new DLC comes out, money has to be made, also if you do it every 4 months, you could possibly get your account suspended...</p>

 month wait....is.....EXTREMELY UNACCEPTABLE!....to play a sodding game....on top of that Microsoft has robbed us in a way cause we don't have access when they have our money for it....."Microsoft you have dishonoured me I don't think your rep with me shall

<p>Reason I have this issue is because some idiot on xbox live support chat said it was ok to transfer my license to my friends console to get my DLC's work.....what the idiot didn't tell me though is I wouldn't be able to transfer license back to my xbox for
 4 months....Ok...Microsoft...(question) riddle me this....how am I suppose to use my....MY content which I paid for with my own money which you still have....no my friends xbox?......see what you've done Microsoft you destroyed the means of using my game/data/saves....on
 my friends xbox!</p>
<p>not everyone is a lazy git and only plays online with friends....people still go out and visit there friends and play games on who's ever xbox and its nice to take my saves/content/progress on my hard drive/memory unit and play them on there console which
 you have now made impossible and very very very annoying/stressful which now id say I hate you for taking that opition away!</p>

<h2>            The arrows on the task bar on the bottom of the screen do not move to allow one to view all the applications running.  How can I &#34;fix&#34; this problem</h2>
                    I have been unable to find out how to make the arrows move side to side on the task bar.&nbsp; I have not had this problem before, it is as if they are stuck.

<br />
What arrows ??<br />
Task bar is the one usually at the bottom of the screen, and usally in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;a black strip across from one end to the other. Is that the one you were talking about ?<br />
