<h2>            It looks like someone else may be using your account.</h2>
                    <div>
<div>Now when I try to log on to my other (original) Hotmail account, I get the message
<strong><em>"It looks like someone else may be using your account"</em></strong> When I try and change the password, my original security details have been altered so I cannot access the account to change my details or even close the account (not that I want
 to, but needs must)&nbsp;Even the facility to send a recovery code to my mobile is bringing up a number which isn't even my phone.<br />
In the modern day of paperless billing, I have a lot of personal info in my Hotmail account which could (and is probably already)&nbsp;in the wrong hands.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have not gone through the "give us more of your personal data" as I am certainly not going to give out info like Credit Card details when I've never disclosed it in the first place.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have had to&nbsp;set up a new Hotmail account using fictitious details just to get this question on the forum - plus if the same breach of security happens,&nbsp;I haven't lost anything.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Looking through the forum, there are loads of people who are having the same problems, and even though "you take security very seriously" your methods are obviously not working for the right people. We're being locked out of what is rightfully ours, and whoever
 is doing the "breaking and entering" seems to be being&nbsp;protected?!?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Putting it as simply as I can, what can I do to re-access <strong>my</strong> account without giving confidential information out? What little info you had on me when I set the account up all those years ago has been changed by A. N. Other&nbsp;anyway, so I doubt
 I would clear security. I can confirm the names of folders used, subjects of email and people who have sent them.</div>

            <p>Hello, Silvera1510!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query on the community.<br />
<br />
Lumia 950 and your external device need to support technology. Make sure that your TV and Lumia phone are connected on the same WiFi connection.<br />
<br />
Do have a "Microsoft Continuum"? Please check this link: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/continuum-for-phones-faq-mobile.
<br />
Have you downloaded "Playcast for Windows 10" from the Windows Store? You can learn more information from this link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/playcast/9nblggh6d77x.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if that helps you.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>:( Thanks for your answer! </p>
<p>Lumia 950 and MWDA v2 are latest devices of Microsoft. They are supported the technology and they can be connected without wifi router. The wifi router is just for internet when casting.</p>
<p>I think if they are set-up wrong, they would not be connected or cast anything while my Lumia and MWDA were connected and casted video. picture, game,... (without audio).</p>
<p>P/S: Playcast for Windows 10&nbsp; - We are sorry, the page you requested cannot be found.

 keyboard?</p>

            Maybe it's not made for game. With casting movie, there is a little lag. It's unlike&nbsp;what I imaged.

            <p>Silvera, normally you should hear audio via Miracast, without any additional app. However, you cannot change much on your phone. Therefore, you face an interoperability issue with that TV. I guess, you tried several television sets already. Anyway, your
 experience is not normal. Please, state which sets you used (brand and model) in&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/cccaa5da-f471-4595-85b8-6eb0d8701d67">this thread…</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sin-Lee, this depends a bit on your Miracast receiver and the Wi-Fi saturation in your vicinity.&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/5e7a41f5-7679-4d0d-b32e-9498c4ad7d91">More about this…</a></p>

            <p>Yes I still have the parallels file and it reports Window is activated - as expected.</p>
<p>No options to transfer or add a machine there as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the VMWare VM checking activation says it isn't and when you choose that option that you have recently changed hardware it tries to 'phone home' but just advised that it can't find anything &nbsp;and to try again later.... &nbsp;On all occasions I am signed into
 the same MS (Live) account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Support won't help. When I spoke to them they said they only help with retail copies and 'insider' licence meant you had to go to the forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas on how to move a licence from a parallels VM to a VMWare VM?</p>
<p>

            <p>I have several Hyper-V VM's with digital Licenses for Windows 10 Pro. When I fire up a new VM (that has no license, since it's new)&nbsp;the troubleshooter asks if the device I am on is one of the ones it suggests to me (which represent other VM's or even Desktop
 installs that I have done). I have never actually tried to accept, but it looks like it would transfer that license to my new VM if I let it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What will not work is between 2 different types (eg. you can't transfer a Desktop PC to a Laptop or vice versa).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you could fire up your Parallels VM but <em>use a new virtual hard disk file</em>&nbsp;and install the public build 14393 Pro. (Your existing virtual hard disk file can remain unchanged for future use on that VM). Then it no longer has an "Insiders" license,
 since it has the public build. Would Microsoft Support help you to transfer that public build digital license to the new VM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Software License Terms for Windows says this in section 4 b:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs
 to you.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">...</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not
 transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem is how technically to do the transfer with no Product Key. I thought that perhaps the Activation Troubleshooter was one way to make such a transfer work.</p>

    <title>E63 Freezing Issue &#47; Firmware Update Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ougadas  say:</h3>
<h2>            E63 Freezing Issue &#47; Firmware Update Issue</h2>
                    
<p>I have an E63-2 Factory Unlocked (GSM) that I've been pleased with except for one nagging issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I receive an incoming call about 2 in 5 attempts to answer the call will freeze the phone, and the only way I can get it to work again is to remove the battery and re-insert it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've performed a reset to factory settings before with no change to the problem, and even a hard reset of the phone but the issue still remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally thought that perhaps I needed to update my firmware .. when I checked the firmware version I'm still on 100.21.110, which I believe is the factory firmware for this model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet Ovi Suite tells me that this is up to date, even though the Nokia website says that the newest firmware is already up to version 500.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something isn't quite right here. Anyone know what is going on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The firmware anomaly you mention apparently isn't weird at all.&nbsp; Nokia may sell 10 or more variants of a particular phone worldwide, and while a version 500 firmware is available for
<em>somebody's</em> E63, is isn't ready yet for yours.&nbsp; But it should be available soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: when you factory reset your phone (programs and settings returned to an out-of-box state), did you then restore anything?&nbsp; I have never had a problem like yours, but would like to think it's caused by one or more corrupt Contacts, or by a program
 that ties into the the phone or contacts apps.&nbsp; If you haven't already, reset the phone again and run it in a 100% factory state until you are certain the problem is either fixed or still remains.&nbsp; If fixed, restore or reinstall just one thing at a time until
 you decide where the problem lies.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

<p>This may very well be the reason and I think I will take your advice and run stock for a while without importing contacts, I'll just re-enter the ones I need by hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firmware issue does concern me though. I would assume (maybe wrongly?) that at the very least the 200 version should be available for my unit. I mean, we're talking releases from 2+ years ago that haven't been pushed yet. If that is the case I have no
 faith that any firmware will ever be pushed to this phone before it's obsolete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yep, according to both Ovi Suite and the Updater tool the correct software version for my phone is the one it left the factory with in 2008. I haven't contacted Nokia customer support.. generally I try to avoid phone drones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I'll try, but it seems like the best thing they could tell me to do would be to visit a care center or send my phone in -- neither of which are solutions given my location and dependence on my device compared to the cost of just buying a different
 phone.</p>

<p>Further, some security researchers have advised not to to use multiple anti-exploit applications because using more than one of them at the same time can hamper the effectiveness of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

is a computer security technique involved in protection from buffer overflow attacks. These security technologies are intended to mitigate (reduce) the effectiveness of exploit attempts. Many advanced exploits relay on
<strong>ROP</strong> and <strong>ASLR as attack vectors</strong> used to defeat security defenses and execute malicious code on the system. For example, they can be used to bypass DEP (data execution prevention) which is used to stop buffer overflows and memory
 corruption exploits. Tools with ROP and ASLR protection such as <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/190590/quickly-secure-your-computer-with-microsofts-enhanced-mitigation-experience-toolkit-emet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<em>"EMET, HMP.Alert and MBAE can all be useful under certain circumstances. The most effective step to fending of exploits is to reduce your attack surface. Keep the software you use up-to-date and try to get rid of Java and Adobe plugins. If you can't get
 rid of them completely, at least turn them on only for the sites that you know won't work without them. All browsers that I have used in the past year have features which makes it very easy to limit plugins to just a few sites. If for some reason you can't
 do either of that, then adding exploit protection can be somewhat useful."</em></p>

<h2>            how to synchronize Outlook data correctly with ActiveSync after Windows XP reinstall</h2>

<p><br />
PC: Windows XP SP2, Office XP (Outlook), ActiveSync 4.1 <br />

I recently had to repair my Windows XP installation and now need to resynchronize the data on my PDA with

<span>Outlook</span></a>.
 I had been succesfully able to synchronize my Outlook data via ActiveSync prior to reinstall, however it has been a long time since the last synchronization, and since then the PC has not been in use until this recent reinstall.
<br />
<br />
I performed a repair-style reinstall, that is I installed Windows XP over the existing installation, therefore it simply overwrote the C:\WINDOWS system directory and left all other data (e.g. Documents and Settings, Program Files, etc.) untouched. I also had
 backed up and copied back over the user profile data for each account from the old installation to the new (C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\*.*).&nbsp; Both the device and Outlook data have been backed up to an external hard drive (using Spb Backup on the
 device). Since presumably the registry data has been reset, I will need to reinstall programs such as

 in order to reintroduce them to the OS. <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">My question in general </span>is how to correctly go about this so as to resynchronize my data without losing it. More specifically:
<br />
<br />
1) where is the ActiveSync partnership stored? what data is actually contained in this file?
<br />
<br />
2) Now that XP has been reset, should I install the latest version of ActiveSync, or will that pose any problems when I try to reconnect my device?
<br />
<br />
3) My Outlook pst files have been preserved. They contain older data (e.g. Calendar entries) that does not exist on the device and that will need to be preserved after the sync. However the PDA also contains changes to the newest data (e.g. Contacts, Calendar,
 Notes, etc.) that also needs to be preserved after the sync. <br />
<br />
4) what is the correct way to perform the synchronization such that all my data is preserved?
<br />
</p>
<p>Greatly appreciate any help/advice and thanks in advance!</p></span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have performed the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>installed MS Office 2003</div>
</li><li>
<div>performed all Office Updates</div>
</li><li>
<div>downloaded and installed ActiveSync 4.5 and upgraded to Windows Media Player 10 (for compatibility with ActiveSync 4.5 as suggested by the program documentation).</div>
</li><li>
<div>Opened Outlook 2003&nbsp;with the user account that I want to be able to sync my handheld data with</div>
</li><li>
<div>Outlook correctly migrated all my previous&nbsp;settings and data&nbsp;automatically</div>
</li><li>
<div>I connected the device via USB</div>
</li><li>
<div>ActiveSync detected the device's previous partnership: "Your&nbsp;PocketPC is already set up to synchronize with another computer. Items you select will be synchronized with all computers."&nbsp; In actuality,&nbsp;this is&nbsp;the only&nbsp;computer I sync with,&nbsp;however&nbsp;I
 previously sync'd with&nbsp;another user account on the same computer prior to Windows reinstall</div>
</li><li>
<div>I selected the Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, and Favorites data to be synchronized</div>
</li><li>
<div>A&nbsp;Notes dialog popped up&nbsp;indicating that the device contains items that have not been synchronized with&nbsp;this computer before.&nbsp; This is strange because&nbsp;prior to reinstall,&nbsp;I had synchronized all data types with the computer (using the pre-reinstall
 user account however).&nbsp; I did not receive a similar dialog or selection&nbsp;option&nbsp;for any of the other data types&nbsp;(Contacts,&nbsp;Calendar, Tasks, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;The only options I was prompted to select between are to&nbsp;1) Combine data from the device and&nbsp;PC, 2) Overwrite
 the device with data&nbsp;on the PC, and 3) skip the synchronization for the time being.&nbsp; I selected the option to Combine the Notes data</div>
</li><li>
<div>While synchronizing, the&nbsp;PIM data file on the device grew to 14MB (I had selected to synchronize ALL Calendar data, which perhaps I shouldn't have) and&nbsp;subsequently all my devices storage memory was used up.&nbsp; The device then complained of
 critically low memory.</div>
</li><li>
<div>ActiveSync completed, but was not able to transfer all Notes data over due to low memory space on the device</div>
</li><li>
<div>ActiveSync hangs</div>
</li><li>
<div>The data on the device is not synchronized correctly.&nbsp; e.g. the device had the most current Tasks and Contacts&nbsp;data before sync, yet the data after sync includes current Tasks, as well as old Tasks that resided on the PC which have not been
 modified since the last successful pre-reinstall sync.&nbsp; Since the device contains both new Task data, and old Task data that has been either modified, completed, or deleted, I would have expected the sync operation to update the PC Task list to reflect the
 current correct status on the device.&nbsp; The same should apply to Contacts, Notes and Favorites.&nbsp; My intent with Calendar data was to preserve Calendar entries over a year old that existed on the PC, and update both platforms with changes that have been made
 to Calendar items on the device (since the device only stores Calendar data less than a year old).&nbsp; Notes data now has duplicate entries for Notes that were modified on the device since the pre-reinstall sync and that have the same name as existing Notes on
 the PC.</div>
</li><li>
<div>To resolve the low memory issue on the device, I restored it to the Spb Backup point I made prior to sync and tried to run ActiveSync again</div>
</li><li>
<div>The ActiveSync operation completed, however the synchronized data is still incorrect as described in step 13</div>
</li><li>
<div>Now, Outlook contains a mix of the previously sync'd data with some new (albeit incorrectly sync'd) data from the device</div>
</li></ol>
<p>Is there anyone with extensive knowledge of ActiveSync and Outlook that can lend me a hand with some step-by-step instructions on how to resolve this? It will be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>I think (I have done it before) you should now ,just when you are connected with active sync, open your outlook and go there and fix everything manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By trying new syncs and more syncs you will be get multiple duplications.&nbsp; The good thing is that you did not lose anything (I Hope)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will give you a fresh new start. (then run a new back up for yourself again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The combine the items is a very good solutions in the sync because it will recognize that some changes were made on either side which need to be combined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents on it before you get into more problems</p>

<p>Thanks, if it were just a matter of deleting and fixing a few Contacts or Notes items I would do it manually.&nbsp; And I agree that I do not want to simply try additional syncs in the current state.&nbsp; However, I have made
<strong>many</strong> changes to Tasks items, and there are far too many duplicate Calendar entries for me to make the repairs manually.&nbsp; Since I have both the Outlook .pst file and the PPC PIM data backed up, I am looking for a sequence that will allow me
 to perform the sync correctly even if I have to revert to those backed up states.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Task items, even though ActiveSync updated the PC with new items created on the PPC, I do not understand why it reverted back to the PC version of existing items that were modified on the PPC.&nbsp; My understanding is that it should have
 used the updated timestamp of the items modified on the PPC, recognized that the PPC items were the latest version and then updated the PC Task list accordingly.&nbsp; Any insight into why this might have happened? I have a feeling it has something to do with the
 order in which the Outlook date was restored, whether or not the existing partnership information on the device should be deleted prior to sync, and how the sync should be set up.</p>

<p>If your partnerships have been deleted before and you start from the beginning again it could have been that with your selction combine the both that it can create those duplicates.</p>

<p>Ok, I can see how it might create duplicate entries.&nbsp; However, my major issue here is the accurate syncing of the Task, Note, Contact&nbsp;and Calendar items that have been updated on the PPC.&nbsp; Why are these changes not reflected on the PC after
 sync? It seems to revert these items to the version on the PC.</p>

<p>Hi Jamel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm bummed that it did not work.&nbsp; I really don't understand why but it may well be a variety is issues combined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<tr>
<td><span>There are tools available to get rid of duplicates here:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last one in the list, Outlook Duplicates Remover is pretty good.&nbsp; Just set it up using small values so it will work fast.&nbsp; If the checking parameters are set high, it takes forever.</p>
<p>I have no question that it will help and most likely will get rid of many duplicates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be time to consider a "fresh start" and do a hard reset as long as most (if not all) of the information you have is on your PC.</p>

<h3> captain stack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannont send&#47;recieve MMS on unlocked LG E900 &#40;Optimus 7&#41; using T-Mobile. No data plan.</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a new unlocked LG Optimus 7 E900. I live in the US and T-Mobile is my carrier. I have no data plan but I do get texting and on my old T-Mobile phone I could send and recieve MMS like pictures. I've swapped the SIM into my new Windows Phone
 and everything seems to work as planned. I get internet while in a Wi-Fi zone, I can send and recieve calls and texts but MMS messages don't work. When I send one it immediately says that there was an error and gives me a button to try again, but trying again
 just does the same thing. I've read that this may be because ADC is disabled by default. Well LG has an MFG secret menu that you can acces by doing this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Dial: ##634#<br />
-Press the "call" button<br />
-On the MFG screen input this password: 277634#*# and press enter. Now the MFG icon is listed on the "programs list".<br />
-Enter the menu and go to "Engineer Menu" -&gt; "Other Setting" -&gt; "Set ADC" and then switch "Current ADC Value" from "Disable" to "Enable"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did this and then hard rebooted the phone once without the SIM and then once again with the SIM. However, this did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also heard that you must have "Data Connection" under the "Cellular" settings turned on. I had this off since I didn't want to be charged for data, not having a data plan. For the sake of getting MMS to work, I turned it on and tried again and I got the
 same error message, but it took much longer before it gave me the error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also heard that you have to set your network profile to one that matches your cell provider. This requires the MFG menu again:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the "Other Setting" page, choose "Set network profile" </li><li>You should now be on the "Set network profile" page and in the bottom half of the window you should see a list of *.xml files. These appear to be the network configuration files.
</li><li>Look at the filenames for the config files and take your best guess at which one to choose for your provider.
</li><li>The person who posted this solution said, "I'm on AT&amp;T and I fixed the MMS problem by choosing "_PROV_ATT_US_310_410.xml"</li></ol>
<p>Well I went down this menu too but when I got to the Set Network Profile page my phone didn't list any *.xml files so I couldn't change anything. Is there a way to get it to list/find some of the configuration files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, I heard that doing a factory reset of my phone with the SIM in could solve the problem. I'll do this, but not if there is a better solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically, to sum it up, I want to get MMS working, I don't want a data plan, and if possible, I don't want to factory reset my phone. I have the MFG menu so I can tweak quite bit, but so far I've been unsuccessful. Help?</p>

            The phone needs data service to send and receive MMS.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>For some phones if the subscriber does not wish to have data service then it is not unusual for a cellular provider to have a different connection configuration that will allow the transmission of data needed for MMS without providing access to the rest
 of the Internet. The data for an MMS is only transmitted over a wireless connection. A Wi-Fi connection can't be used to get the MMS download. &nbsp;It sounds like your phone isn't configured to communicate with any of T-Mobiles data services. Phones are usually
 sold preconfigured for this, though some have applications that can be used to configure a phone for a specific network.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't have an LG phone to check this for you, but see if there is any type of connection of configuration application in the LG section of the App store on your phone. It may contain a solution for your problem.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Mat,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your reply does not speak to the question posed.</p>
<p>Try creating a two vertical columns&nbsp;</p>
<p>A with date B with data for the date.</p>
<p>Sort the columns with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>newest date at the top</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Create a chart with dot of date and data points.</p>
<p>Apply a moving average.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See that the moving average does not go to the latest date.</p>
<p>Sort the columns with oldest date at the top.</p>
<p>Now the moving average goes to the latest date.</p>
<p>Please <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">fix so that moving average line goes to the latest date by default</span> no matter how it is sorted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>PS The charting in windows 365 is inferior to windows 2003 (15 years ago). </p>
<p>Data dots and moving average look pale and take more clicks to customize.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Search within sharepoint library is different than default sharepoint search</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am looking into search box within library and I noticed it works almost in the same way as default sharepoint search but there is one difference. Search within library sorts results based on title in ascending/descending order while actual sharepoint
 search displays those results on top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>see below, search performed within library</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0af8f6f0-0392-4c84-899b-9eb1f00e176e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0af8f6f0-0392-4c84-899b-9eb1f00e176e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see "license suspension guide" search term within library search box showed results but the actual document is showed at the bottom sorted by name in ascending order. While putting same search term in default share point search you get following.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c22a9ec-683c-417d-beee-378ef4fa72d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c22a9ec-683c-417d-beee-378ef4fa72d1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see how default sharepoint search displays the document on very top when searched for same search term. My question is : is there a way I can show similar thing within library search as well rather than showing library search sorted in ascending
 order ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also how can I set up sharepoint search to default to current contextual scope as you can do in sharepoint 2010 (if default search is used from site it returns content within that site, if default search -- (sharepoint search on top right not the one within
 list/library) is used from library list) -- is used from list or library search only shows results from that list/library</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The search results in a library are sorted by ascending by default. We are not able to change that. As a workaround, you can search the file by entering more specific title.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have replied to this question in your another thread that SharePoint Online has already configured this setting. If you have more questions about this, you can reply to me in that thread.</span></p>

                    <p>I've been struggling with reading my emails as they're showing up in one word per line. I used 2007 and now I've upgraded to 2016, but I'm still facing this same problem. I've already changed the mail format to HTML, however this problem still exists.</p>
<p>It usually happens from forwarded emails. </p>

<br />That usually happens because someone set a right margin in the message. Editing the message to convert to plain text should fix it.

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response, I tried this and my mails are still unchanged. I went to file&gt;&gt;options&gt;&gt;mail&gt;&gt;and hanged the Compose messages in this format to "Plain Text". Then I forwarded the mail I had the problem with to my gmail account, then I reforwarded
 to my outlook account. However the mails are still appearing in the same arrangement, i.e one word per line.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce745135-776a-470a-a3b2-7a49b9df05d9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce745135-776a-470a-a3b2-7a49b9df05d9?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e990d1a8-d8a3-4747-b155-30e55439498c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e990d1a8-d8a3-4747-b155-30e55439498c?upload=true" /></a></p>

            &gt;&gt; It usually happens from forwarded emails. 
<br />Are the mails being forwarded to you or are you forwarding the mail? Do you have the messages set to full screen? 
<br />
<br />If they are forwarded to you, open the message, go to  Actions &gt; Edit message. Change the format to plain text. Does this fix the problem? 
<br />
<br />If you add the Ruler to the open message form - where is the right margin marker?  To do this,  go to File, options, quick access toolbar and select All commands. Find ruler and add it to the Quick access toolbar.  In the attached screenshot, its at about 2 1/4 inches when the message is about 1000 pixels wide but 14 1/2 inches maxed on my big screen monitor (3440 pixels wide).

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>Thank you for following through with this so far. :)</p>
<p>I've done both of your suggestions and it still won't work though. </p>
<p>Also the problem mainly occurs when someone has forwarded me a message. However, I've noticed that it still happens even if they direct message me. Please have a look at this screenshot. For some reason, the body of the text remains normal, but below the
 we get the one word per line error again. These two are from the same mail.</p>

            Hi Diane sorry for the late reply, I've sent you an email as an attachment. I've noticed that some of the emails directed to my gmail account come in the right format, however if sent to my outlook email come in the same one word per line format.

            Thanks. It looks like the message is plain text format. When its converted from HTML to plain text, the table is removed and the table to text conversion puts everything on separate lines. 
<br />
<br />So the issues is what is causing it to be converted to plain text.

            Is there anything I can do about this? The tables are the most important part of the emails, hence why I upgraded from 07 to 16 in the first place, thinking that would actually solve my problem.<br />

            We need to figure outlook why they are being converted to plain text, then we might be able to solve it

<h2>            Outlook Mail Sync Issue</h2>
                    <p>Don't know if any one have issue similar to me in the last few days, but since 30th of Nov, none of Mail (windows store app), Outlook Mail (on WM10) or Mail on iOS will sync to my Outlook.com email account (with custom domain).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On windows store app (UWP), click on Sync button and nothing happened for a while until the error message came up:</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Something went wrong</strong></div>
<div>We can't sync eas.outlook.com at the moment. Wait a little while, then try again.</div>
<div>Error code: <strong>0x85010017</strong></div>
<p>
</p><p>On iOS I'm getting</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Cannot Get Mail</strong></p>
<p>The connection to the server failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going to Outlook.com -&gt; Options -&gt; General -&gt; Mobile Devices and removed all mobile devices and setup account again, doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed server from eas.outlook.com to m.outlook.com, keep getting the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed outlook account from my WM10 and iOS devices and setup again, it did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not just emails, but contracts and calendar are also not syncing on various devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 AU on desktop and Lumia 640 and iOS 10 on iPhone. Afaik, Outlook Mail app is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope if any MS support tech see this and help me out here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Ming,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems MS no longer support custom domains as a primary alias. This thread led me to fixing my issues!</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oapps/outlook-stopped-supporting-custom-domain-primary/b7a0bcba-4a3d-420c-b348-24a7028e136b</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I did was </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Logged into Outlook.com using </p>
<p>2. Went into options | Accounts - Connected Accounts</p>
<p>3. Clicked 'Manage or choose primary alias' under 'Email aliases'</p>
<p>
</p><p>(You can get to the same spot by going to accounts.live.com and logging in)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Add a new alias</p>
<p>5. Set it to be primary</p>
<p>
</p><p>Super fast access to emails now and mobile is syncing! Will try laptop and Surface when I get home, but I'm hopeful!</p>

            <p>The best I can work out is when the Email is about to be sent the mailitem To becomes a read only property. Any changes to the To generates an email that has a blank recipient list on the sent email.<br />
.......&nbsp; Here is the basic version on how to change the email address .....&nbsp; Simple create a new recipient then delete the current.&nbsp; How the code reacts maybe a result of outlook security or third party security.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2003, not responding and very slow</h2>
                    Excel 2003, not responding and very slow. No one can open up more than one excel spreadsheet at a time.&nbsp;I did an update yesterday and this problem began. Now all of the work stations in the office are affected by it after the updated.&nbsp;What can I do to
 fix it?

    <title>OneNote and Excel distortion - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneNote and Excel distortion</h2>
                    <p>I have spreadsheets in OneNote that continually become more distorted every time I save them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll insert a new spreadsheet and then edit it. Once I save it, the preview part displayed in OneNote becomes larger and larger with each edit and save. While editing I do nothing to increase the size or change the viewing size (I don't zoom in.) After editing,
 in OneNote I do not manually increase the size of the viewing area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to keep this from happening?<br />

<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about this concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did this concern started happening?</li><li>Were there any changes on the PC or on the application settings before this happened?</li><li>Are you accesing OneNote and Excel using the desktop app or the web app?</li><li>Any troubleshooting steps or workaround that you have already performed?</li></ul>

            <p>This has been ongoing since I moved to office 365 - about two years ago. I didn't modify any application settings (that I know of). I use both on my desktop. - which runs Windows 7 Home - I've got both programs located as shortcuts on my taskbar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In OneNote I can zoom out to find the entirety of the spreadsheet and shrink it by dragging it to a smaller size. However, after a few edits and saves it's just as large again and I have to repeat the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just trying to figure out if I'm inadvertently doing something to trigger this.</p>
