            <p>Hi Shafiek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an option called <strong>Recovery drive</strong>. A recovery drive can help you troubleshoot and fix problems with your PC, even if it won’t start. To create one, all you need is a USB drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>From the taskbar, search for <strong><span>Create a recovery drive</span></strong> and then select it. You might be asked to enter an admin password or confirm your choice.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the tool opens, make sure <strong><span>Back up system files to the recovery drive</span></strong> is selected and then select
<span><strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Connect a USB drive to your PC, select it, and then select <span><strong>Next &gt; Create</strong>.</span> A lot of files need to be copied to the recovery drive, so this might take a while.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When it’s done, you might see a <strong><span>Delete the recovery partition from your PC</span></strong> link on the final screen. If you want to free up drive space on your PC, select the link and then select
<span><strong>Delete</strong>.</span> If not, select <span><strong>Finish</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
Moreover, It's always a good idea to have a backup. Keep copies of your files on another drive in case something happens to the originals. Set up your backup
<p>
</p><p>* Go to Start <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2f851aefc6-d9e7-41b6-a160-2a5e45499b33_17.png" />,
</p>
<p>* Then Navigate, <strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt;
<strong>Backup</strong> &gt; <strong>Add a drive</strong> </p>
<p>*&nbsp;Choose an external drive or network location for your backups as per your requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2fa2c68d48-827b-4641-a415-6d07babf724d_27.png" width="520" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>* Every hour, we’ll back up everything in your user folder (C:\Users\username).
</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Click <strong>More options, </strong>to change which files get backed up or how often backups happen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will address your query.</p>

                    <p>I have been trying to get my broken Xbox warrantied for a couple weeks now. After 2 months with terrible online service while my PS4 has been working flawlessly I finally got a warranty replacement sent to me. I allowed a hold of over $350 dollars on my account so they would send me a new one, this is still under warranty mind you, and a week later I get my new xbox one s and it is even more broken than the one I am sending back. It can't even pretend to connect to services that the last one could access but only in an unplayable fashion. Today I spent over an hour on the phone going over this and was promised that my issue had been escalated to a higher office but after four hours of checking into it I find that there is no record that my phone call even occurred. When confronted with this even their online chat support hung up on me once before promising once again that that same thing that I was told on the phone.

<h2>            Hackers in Call of duty</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing WaW recently because im an achievement hunter (although you can probably tell from my GS that im not a very good one).</p>
<p>I have also been been playing MP and i get these messages from people i dont even know that say "send me a message for 15th prestige lobby". Does that mean i have to be 15th to play with them?</p>
<p>Finally i was looking up the modded lobbys thing on the forums and i read this thing from somebody who i assume is a moderator which said "</p>
<p>Up until this point when a user was found to be exploiting infections in a game they were issued a temporary cheating suspension.</p>
<p>However, after discussing how infections are obtained and weighing just how disruptive these modifications are to gameplay , this policy has now been changed.</p>
<p>Intentionally activating and exploiting infections in multiplayer matchmaking is a blatant violation of the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct, and users who purposefully engage in such activity will be suspended appropriately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this moment on, any user account found exploiting infections will be subject to<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">immediate permanent suspension</span></strong></span>."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>We know exactly what is required to be infected, which means we also know that it cannot be done accidentally.&nbsp; Suspensions will not be lifted simply because you make a false
 claim that you did not know what was going on.</span></span></strong>"</p>
<p>Well i think i may be in trouble because i was playing matchmaking in WaW and these words started coming up on the side which flashed in all different colours and said things like "i got god mode from (youtube link here)" or "i got unlimited ammo from (youtube
 link here)" i reported the people whoose names came up but at the time i was not aware of this policy that anyone found inside an infected game will be banned. It wasnt even a private lobby it was public matchmaking and i had no idea that they were modders
 until i was in game. I also didnt know that you are supposed to shut down your xbox if you find yourself in a modded lobby.</p>
<p>So does that mean that ive been infected and am at the risk of being banned? Because if so than it can happen accidentally and that final statement is false.</p>
<p>PS: What does being infected mean? sorry if i sound like a noob for asking that.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">As you can see there is no such thing as an 'accident'. Everyone has a choice, leave the match or stay and accept the consequences. Now I do understand that you did not know about

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">-Hit the back button on the controller (the one to the left of the Guide button) and find out who the host of the match is (this person will be the only one with FOUR full bars) or
 you could just read the GT off any messages scrolling on the screen. Do not stay for more than 30 seconds, if you can't figure out who the host is by then just leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">-Leave the match within the first few seconds. (the longer you stay the greater the risk of participating you are at)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">-Restart your console. (to clear out any infections)</span></p>

<p>To answer your first question. No i never got the chance to fire a round i was always killed before that happened.</p>
<p>Also i did not stay in the game very long because as soon as i started the game the enemy got dogs then when they expired they got dogs again. At this point i rage quit.</p>
<p>3rd as soon as they got dogs i knew something was wrong and the flashing text only reassured me of that however i simply figured that the players in the game (myself included) would report him which i did both in game and on their profile and that he would
 suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Finally i looked up what it means to be infected and well apparently 10th prestige lobbys are "infections" and apparently it has nothing to do with what rank you are its what rank they can hack you to. This normally happens by invite and is done in a private
 lobby. Therefore as the moderator (i assume) stated since you need to accept the invite it does require a fair bit of input from the player therefore there really can be no accidents. Even if you accept a random invite not knowing what an infected lobby is
 according to these forums as soon as you realise the scores or whatever are wrong and that you are geting unfair points you can undo this by instantly resetting your console.</p>
<p>In summary i was not in an infected lobby (i was in PUBLIC MATCHMAKING), i did not kill, i did not stay and i reported so the way i see it ive done nothing wrong but thats for XBL PET to determine but from what i can tell i have broken no rules.</p>

<p>[quote user="haloshooterpro"]</p>
<p>&nbsp;i was not aware of this<strong> policy that anyone found inside an infected game will be banned</strong>. It wasnt even a private lobby it was public matchmaking and i had no idea that they were modders until i was in game. I also didnt know that you are
 supposed to shut down your xbox if you find yourself in a modded lobby.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>That is not the policy. You posted the policy.</p>
<p>[quote user="haloshooterpro"]</p>
<p>From this moment on, any user account found exploiting infections will be subject to<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>We know exactly what is required to be infected, which means we also know that it cannot be done accidentally.&nbsp; Suspensions will not be lifted simply because you make a false
 claim that you did not know what was going on.</span></span></strong>"</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>They can tell difference between the ones who know what they are doing and the ones that don't. XBLPET does not just ban everyone in COD W@W. If you really did nothing wrong then you will be OK. However if there is any proof you did, then that is up to them
 and only them.</p>

<p>The reason "Infections" lobbies are made is for effortless levels, I am a complete CoD boffin, 10th on MW2 and 15 on Black Ops, I get the messages all the time for them, you did the right thing, and it's good Microsoft are being strict with these things,
 as it doesn't seem fair we spend hours grinding, and they get what they want in seconds, even worse, I get accused of hacking myself because i'm 15th! I'm a true gamer who hasn't used hacks, hell, I hate using cheats on Saints Row! The reason IW sort out Infection
 lobbies is because they're still incredibly popular games, Treyarch's WaW isn't as popular online, just like CoD4. Just to sort it out,

<p>I totally agree. my friends use cheats on Saints Row and thats why they got 0G's on it and really it disgusts me.</p>
<p>I love saints row and if you put the effort in it becomes a really epic game even without cheats.</p>
<p>I remember asking my friends "why do you have 0G's on SR2"</p>
<p>"Oh because without cheats you run outa ammo and cash and you die to easily and it sucks so i just play with cheats and so i cant get them achievements"</p>
<p>have you ever tried the activities they give you health bonuses and infinate ammo and stuff. so if you put the effort in its awesome.</p>
<p>Sorry for that got a little carried away but yes i know infected lobbies are so people get to like top prestige in seconds and they think they're cool and powerful when in fact they just cant play.</p>
<p>As for the Cod boffin sorry i cant relate. Im first prestige im happy with that. I dont see any point in continuing and thats fine thats just me. Other people have different opinions and others go further i just dont wanna.</p>

<p>that is totally unreasonable does that mean you will ban me for accidently joining a lobby on mw2 where i shot someone once and went to rank 70 6th prestige (i was that prestige at the time ) at that time there was no visibe warning before i got the kill
 and i also got the first blood , would this be classed as a ban ?</p>

            My machine is doing the same thing. It is an SP3 i7 8GB 256GB purchased just prior to SP4 release, which came with Win10 preinstalled. Something happened in the past month and now Photos, TV, and Maps, all just say TWINUI under settings in Default Apps.
 I cannot open a .jpg attached to an email anymore. This is ridiculous.

            <p>Christopher you are better off downloading an iso of windows 10 to a usb ( bootable ) then reinstall Windows it can be done just like the upgrade and it will leave all your info and apps where you left them.</p>
<p>Do a search for media creation tool Windows 10 ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10 ) Australian link!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download tool.</p>
<p>Insert a empty usb stick with more than 4gb.</p>
<p>Run tool.</p>
<p>Select create installation media for another device.</p>
<p>Select the options that match your version of Windows.</p>
<p>Once completed you can look at the usb folder and run setup.exe and follow the instructions to suit your choices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your version of Windows needs to be registered before proceeding and only choose the same version in the media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was the only way I could fix the problems&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope this helped&nbsp;</p>

            I to have all these ms app problems that the first person SM-151 has written about.&nbsp;Even my pictures get a "remote procedure call failed". Have tried all the different&nbsp;scenerios mentioned but&nbsp;not a thing has worked. Do you think ms is going to come out
 with an update that will fix all of this as for a regular pc user all this trying to fix errors is&nbsp;just going to make something else corrupt. I bought a new pc and upgraded from windows 8.1.&nbsp; Is this a problem for the people that bought computers with windows
 10 already loaded? Hoping this is fixed soon.

            I have similar problems, so you aren't alone- in fact the web is full of complaints. &nbsp;I upgraded to windows 10 and everything worked fine for months, but I have suddenly found that I can't open jpg files by right-click, nor by using 'open with'. &nbsp;I can
 open Photo Gallery, and upload files individually, but not Photos, which seems to have disappeared. Nor can I view a jpg file from an email unless I save it first. &nbsp;I have checked the default app commands, and everything is in place there. &nbsp;Is this problem
 due to a malfunctioning upgrade? There sure are a lot of us having the same difficulty.

<p>When I signin on my MS Surface, MP4 videos play fine. When my wife signs in I get a message "Invalid value for registry" instead of playing. I found one solution on the internet was to change the default video player to Windows Media Player. This fixes the
 problem but I noticed that the option recommended for Windows 10 when I sign on is "Movie &amp; TV." But my wife's said "twinui." This must be the problem so I searched and found this article and tried the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what should happen with the Windows Store step. When I ran it the store opened ok. But the video player was still "twinui" and produced the registry message instead of playing the MP4 video.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I proceeded with the four command prompt steps. Step 2 "sfc /scannow" took about 5 minutes to complete. As I write this I'm not sure I ran the powershell step. &nbsp;But when I copied and pasted step 4 it failed to run saying it was an unrecognized command.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video player option still said "twinui" and the MP4 wouldn't play. However, when I rebooted, it then said "Movie &amp; TV" and played MP4 videos.</p>

            Hi, Kommander&amp; 
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />- DISM / Online / cleanup-image / CheckHealth
<br />- DISM / online / cleanup-image / scanHealth
<br />- DISM / online / cleanup-image / RestoreHealth
<br />- sfc / scannow
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            <p>THANK YOU! I looked into the issues you said-and Microsoft Support helped me install OUTLOOK 2013 ,</p>
<p>OFFICE 365 ,PLUS my Kaspersky antivirus/password 3.0 was not working for a while and I did not now since it showed enabled etc. so I bought a new brand&nbsp;suggested by support.</p>
<p>The error codes were coming up when I sent emails only.I did not know that Yahoo was not good enough to "stand alone" on my laptop as my only email program! Thank you for replying-I'm a grandma and a first grade teacher! Luckily ,I CAN follow directions
 ,instructions ,and ask for </p>
<p>help.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also ,just to mention ,I am not sure if I deleted files but its kind of easier now for me to make sure I know what I am deleting and I never saw anything in recycle bin for a long, long time&nbsp;but my "favorites" websites- when I'm not using them much-I delete
 them and they always go to recycle bin.</p>
<p>The large red X and its sound upon an error get my attention!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so glad I tried this forum to find answers.Thank you again.</p>

    <title>Laplink PCmover Win 7 upgrade assistant, upgrade from XP to Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaari j  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laplink PCmover Win 7 upgrade assistant, upgrade from XP to Win7</h2>
                    Just FYI. I just tried to use Laplink PCMover Windows 7 upgrade assistant in following situation:<br />
I had an ailing HD with XP, so I purchased a new HD as well as Laplink PC mover in hope of being able to move my applications as well as my files from one HD to another without having to reinstall them all. Alas, not working.
<br />
1) Installed PCmover according to the manual on the old one, and ran the program to create a&nbsp;"moving van" which supposedly contained all my old apps as well as files.&nbsp;This was very easy and fast. 75GB files&nbsp;got compressed to just over 10GB which was rather
 impressive.<br />
2) Installed the new HD, Formatted, added XP, and then Windows 7<br />
3) Installed PCMover on the new HD, and ran it. <br />
4) No luck, files didn't get moved, neither did the apps. The manual states that you have to install the applications which may require reactivation like Antivirus and obviously all Microsoft, and also a lot of others. My files didn't show up either. Folders
 got created but no files showed up under the folders. The same applied to applications.
<br />
5) Since I didn't want to give up that easily I reinstalled Norton and Microsoft apps, reran the PCMover again, you can "Undo Upgrade" which I did, a few times.<br />
6) Gave up on that, used a Windows 7&nbsp;system restore (which very cleverly creates restore points automatically before it&nbsp;new apps are installed) to get my PC back to&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;install of PCMover.<br />
7)&nbsp;Installed applications manually, downloaded the files I had saved with MS EasyTransfer and hey presto, everything&nbsp;works just fine.<br />
Conclusion: While PCMover can most likely be used&nbsp;when installing Windows 7 on XP&nbsp;PC,&nbsp;it's not a good solution if you are planning to replace your harddrive.<br />

Click Start, then Run, entering the following...<br />
<br />
msiexec /x {299CF645-48C7-4FA1-8BCD-5CE200CF180D}<br />
<br />
....and click OK.<br />

If the above doesn't work try...<br />

Click Start, then Run, entering the following...<br />

msiexec /x {9C9CEB9D-53FD-49A7-85D2-FE674F72F24E}<br />

<br />
If neither of those work, let us know!<br />

<h2>            Search Indexer high CPU &#37; seems to interrupt track pad on laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo T440s with Windows 8.1 and sometimes the trackpad seems to stop working for short periods of time -- e..g I can no longer move the mouse with the trackpad or use two-scroll; yet at the same time I am still able to use the left/right click
 features of the track pad or move the mouse with the thumb button between the G/H/B keys. I'm able to use the keyboard to bring up Task Manager and in these situations the CPU % in use will be around 50% or more and the process using the most CPU % is Search
 Indexer. If I kill that process, the track pad immediately starts working again.</p>
<p>This is extremely annoying -- enough so that I am willing to post here about it. Is there any way to configure Search Indexer to only run when my computer is idle, or to use less CPU %? FYI I do have all the latest Windows Updates and driver updates from
 Lenovo and other relevant driver publishers.</p>

<h2>            How do i remove linux and reinstall windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there. I recently installed a linux distro (elementary OS Luna) on my HP Pavilion g6. My pc came preinstalled with Windows 8. I decided to evaluate linux and installed it on my computer. I wasn't paying attention during the installation, and apparently
 replaced Windows 8. My question is, how do i get it back? I'm a person without any repair disks and don't have anyways of getting one (since I'm just a 15 year old computer nerd). I've heard that HP pcs have a recovery bios console, but if that's true how
 do i reach it?</p>

</span></p><p>With Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Because of this, you won't be able to use retail Windows 8 disc&nbsp;to activate the embedded license, it won't recognize. That's why you will need to request recovery media from HP or else you will end up having to purchase a&nbsp;new
 license.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"We don't really see the point of offline. Did you ever play&nbsp;</span><em>World of Warcraft</em><span>? So&nbsp;</span><em>World of Warcraft</em><span>, you don't play offline. It doesn't mean you can't play by yourself—when I played&nbsp;</span><em>World of Warcraft</em><span>,
 I played it for about twelve months, single-player only, without talking to anyone. That's our approach."</span></p>

<p>This is the game world you are looking at buying an always on console. What should happen to the single player experience should your internet go out while playing only the single player portion of the game? &nbsp;</p>
<p>"<span>All our saves are server-based, it's one of those things that this new generation… it's just like&nbsp;</span><em>World of Warcraft.&nbsp;</em><span>If the internet connection goes on&nbsp;</span><em>World of Warcraft</em><span>, that's it, your saved game goes.
 It's one of the unfortunate side-effects, but I think [we're] going to a world where the experiences demand that."</span></p>

<p><span>Well don't that beat all... no way to store local saves...spend 4 hours getting all those parts for your new car and didn't save...thunderstorm, brown out,....your progress is lost...sure it'll have incremental autosaves...but why all the hassle? Why
 can't I simply store my saves offline like I have before...what's the hard drive for if for not gamesaves. These new always on games will destroy the single player experience. It over complicates what used to be a simplistic streamlined user controlled environment.
 This is why always online is bad....and it's just the beginning.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which version of Windows operating system are you using?</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the link below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running</span></a></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How did you perform a Factory restore on your computer?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Who is your computer manufacturer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>If you had performed a Factory restore using the System Recovery discs provided by the computer manufacturer or by using the Recovery partition installed on your computer. You will not be able
 to retrieve any of the user files and folders from your computer. Performing Factory restore on a computer will format the entire hard drive and re-install a fresh copy of Windows. This process is not reversible unless like System restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Difference between System restore and Factory restore:</b></p>
<p><b>System Restore</b> is a Windows system rollback. It resets Windows and a majority of programs back to previous saved states, undoing any updates, new installations, and settings
 changes that have happened after the restore point was set. It doesn't, however, recover deleted data files or get rid of infection. Your data will be unaffected by a Windows System Restore.<br />
<br />
<b><span>System Recovery or Factory restore</span></b> is usually what the manufacturer calls their built-in tool to reset the entire computer to factory default. If your computer came with restore or recovery disks then they accomplish
 the same thing. All data on the system is wiped and only what came on the system originally is reinstalled, courtesy of the recovery disks. All your data, added programs, and ideally virus infections are removed, and the system is just like it was when you
 bought it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use any third party data recovery software and check if you can retrieve lost data or pictures from your hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Disclaimer:</span></b><span>
 Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party
 Software is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>Provide us with additional information, if any. So that we can help you fix the problem on your computer.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Two points:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. You can *not* do an upgrade from XP to Windows 7. You can use the</div>
<div>Upgrade version, but you must do a clean installation with it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Even if you could do an upgrade, the *worst* time to do an upgrade</div>
<div>is when you are having problems. Such an upgrade is more likely to</div>
<div>worsen problems than to solve them.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I know nothing about that particular program, but you should run the</div>
<div>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to find out if it's compatible.</div>

<p>Hello Dave H.,</p>
<p>Just an additional note to what ITknowledge24 and Ken Blake have contributed. <br />
If you have Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate you can use Windows XP Mode and Virtual PC to run older programs.<br />
You can review the information at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have Windows 7 Home Premium, you will have to search out 3rd party virtualization programs as XP Mode doesn't run on the Home Premium version. There are many virtualization programs that are free of charge that works on Home Premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps so you will get the version of Windows 7 that meets your requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
