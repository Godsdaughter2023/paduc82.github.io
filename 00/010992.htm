    <title>Outlook web app not friendly to Microsoft Word pasted text. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook web app not friendly to Microsoft Word pasted text.</h2>
                    <p>This is astonishing and disappointing, what am I overlooking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cutting and pasting text from a Microsoft Word document to an Outlook.com Web App email body is a bit of a disaster with incompatible unrecognized formatting by the OWA.&nbsp; The Remove formatting eraser does not solve this (maybe fix it Microsoft).&nbsp; &nbsp;Large
 line spaces Cannot be selected, removed, or deleted from the pasted MS Word text.&nbsp; A large blinking cursor line to the left of the pasted text is very odd, as if it were a pasted image.&nbsp; RTF text from Wordpad does paste much better into the OWA, and is fully
 editable and usable with only slight spacing tweaks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice appreciated.</p>

            Hi <strong>Stephan</strong>,<br />
<br />
We’ve noticed that this post has been idle for quite some time now. I’d like to know if you’re still having issues with pasting texts from Microsoft Word to the Outlook web app . If so, can you confirm if it happens on
<strong>all web browsers</strong>?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I’d recommend that you check the status of your account <strong>
<a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">here</a></strong>. This will help us isolate if there’s an on-going issue while you work on the Outlook web app.<br />
<br />
<br />
We’ll wait for your response.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To resolve the issue let us follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to check by opening Outlook 2016 in the Safe Mode and see if it works normally and does not hang/crash while doing a search or checking emails in Inbox folder/other folders.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps as suggested in the following Microsoft Article to open Outlook 2016 in the Safe Mode.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The above article lists steps for all Microsoft Office 2016 applications, however, follow the steps to open the application/program in the Safe Mode for which you are experiencing an issue – in your case Outlook 2016.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Outlook opens and works fine in the Safe Mode, then follow the next set of steps in the article mentioned above to troubleshoot Add-Ins in Outlook 2016.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above step does not work and Outlook 2016 still hangs/crashes, try creating a new Outlook Profile.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Create a new Outlook Profile <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">following the steps from the article below:</span></span></span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After creating the new Outlook Profile create your email account in the new Outlook Profile and check if the issue resolves.

            Both are not part of the Office 365 suite, so you need to find separate installers (DVD, digital) and install. You also need to buy separate licence keys.

<p>I guess the wording of your original post said "New TP Windows Ultimate".</p>
<p>TP means Technical Preview, now you are saying 8.1.</p>

<h2>            emails stuck in &#39;outbox&#39; on android app</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have just noticed that I have over 80 emails stuck in the outbox on my android tablet (nexus 7) &amp; would really appreciate help on how to finally send them please.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There isn't an option to 'send' or 'move' to draft or even to 'try again'. &nbsp;There doesn't look like you can even delete them, (but don't wish to do this anyway).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
There isn't an 'outbox' folder on the desktop version of outlook, so cannot even view them here. &nbsp;There's no option to move/send/delete them, they are a permanent fixture on my tablet it would seem. This is synced with my pc, but as previously stated, you cannot
 even locate the outbox folder on a pc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 80+ emails that haven't sent have been over a period of weeks (maybe more, but the app only stores emails for a set amount of time). &nbsp;It isn't because of having no connection as I keep my tablet at home and use on wifi, so would have always had a connection.
 &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I really need to send these, so please can anyone help me?</span></p>

            <p>This worked on my Moto X Android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn on "Airplane Mode".</p>
<p>Go back to Outlook Outbox.</p>
<p>Check all emails with attachments.</p>
<p>Delete. (you can try one and check if it goes to the delete folder, mine did).</p>
<p>Turn airplane mode back on.'</p>
<p>Go back to Outlook: all outbox mail should be gone.</p>
<p>Go to the delete folder.</p>
<p>Resend small attachments then larger ones to figure out what size gets them stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that when you're on a cell tower large attachments get stuck and then so does everything after them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont think they get stuck if you wait to send large attachments from wifi connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, it looks like an edited picture did it - over 2MB size (shouldn't be bad these days but I'm not sure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>

 mode that was suggested on a couple sites I have checked but there is no info link under the drop down menu for file. Is there any way that I can recover my 9 page essay?!</p>

    <title>Problems migrating large Excel 2003 workbook to Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gerrymaccrae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems migrating large Excel 2003 workbook to Excel 2010</h2>
                    I have just bought a new computer, moving from Windows XP to Windows 7.&nbsp; I also had installed Microsoft Office Home and Student, 2010 at the same time. &nbsp; I have over 10 years of data, including many scatter charts showing some of this data in different
 ways, in a workbook created in Excel 2003.&nbsp; Its size is about 6,400K.&nbsp; (I use Excel 2010 at work and can create charts, show the data I want, and format it the way I want.&nbsp; No problems.)&nbsp; I find now, when I open this 2003 workbook using the new Excel 2010
 (Excel says in Compatibility mode) and click on any of the charts, I find that I cannot operate on them in any way.&nbsp; The three choices under Chart Tools (Design, Layout, Format) are all greyed out and inoperative.&nbsp; If I save this 2003 workbook in the 2010
 Excel using the "Save as type": Excel Workbook, I notice that the file size drops to 2,040K.&nbsp; Opening this file still results in the charts being unable to be changed, reformatted etc.&nbsp; What have I done wrong?&nbsp; How do I fix this?&nbsp; What do I not understand?&nbsp;
 Thank you.<br />

            Thank you for taking the time to read and reply.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I must be more ignorant of Excel than I thought I was.&nbsp; The XP (Excel 2003) machine I created the file on, offers only .xls under "Save As".&nbsp; After looking around the Microsoft website, I
 came across a note about saving an earlier version in Excel 2007 format.&nbsp; I have a Vista/Excel 2007 laptop, and opened the Excel 2003 file using that.&nbsp; It opened in Compatibility mode.&nbsp; I could not see a .xlsx option under the 2007 Excel Office Button&gt; Excel
 Options&gt; Save&gt; "Save files in this format", as suggested in the note.&nbsp; I could not edit the charts in that version either.&nbsp; The layout/style, etc&nbsp; of the Options/Save section of Excel 2010 is virtually identical to the Excel 2007 version, and does not include
 .xlsx.&nbsp; Am I missing something very fundamental here?&nbsp; Is there something I do not understand or recognise about the versions of Excel I am working with?&nbsp; Is some of this problem due to the large size of the original Excel 2003 file- 6400K?&nbsp; Is there an Add-In
 that is required?&nbsp; Thank you again.<br />

            <p>You are correct in saying that 2007/2010 user interfaces are almost identical.&nbsp; The biggest difference may be that 2007 uses the "Office Button", while in 2010 they wised up and created the [File] tab in the ribbon.&nbsp; Now, if you have a ribbon at all, you
 are not in a version of Excel older than 2007.&nbsp; 2003 was the last version with the older style menus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that it says it opened the file in compatibility mode also says "2007" or "2010" (or 2013).&nbsp; That is simply not part of 2003 or earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can further identify your version by going to the [File] tab or Office Button and clicking the Help link in it, and as part of the display it should show you the version of Office/Excel that you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In either case, be it 2007 or 2010, you should have an option to save as .xlsx file, even if it is in compatibility mode.&nbsp; I can understand 2003 only offering the .xls option -- no later formats available unless you add in the compatibility pack that allows
 you to work with 2007/2010 files in it (as long as all your data fits inside of the 16k rows x 256 columns space of an Excel 2003 worksheet).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now - a little quick testing:&nbsp; open up Excel and just make a couple of entries into one or two cells.&nbsp; Now go to File --&gt; Save As and see if the list of options includes .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlsb and others (including 97-2003 compatible .xls format).&nbsp; I wanted
 to upload a graphic of an example of what you should see, but&nbsp;the site&nbsp;is giving me fits and won't upload pictures this evening, so I've uploaded it to my MediaFire storage and you can view it here:</p>

</p>
<p>Do you, or do you not, see those kinds of options in your File Save As dialog next to the
<strong>Save as type:</strong> caption?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see it with the minimal test file (you can cancel out of the save, it was just to get a look at the list), then try again with the problem file and see if the list is there or has gone with the wind, so to speak.</p>

            JLLanthan- Thank you very much for your considered reply (and the efforts you went to).&nbsp; Three observations in reply.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Looking at your MediaFire storage, my Save As list of options shows Excel Workbook, Excel Macro -Enabled Workbook, etc.&nbsp; Your MediaFire
 shows Excel Workbook(*.xlsx), Excel Macro -Enabled Workbook(*.xlsx), etc.&nbsp; The difference is that your copy has the file extension included against each option, mine does not.&nbsp; Here is what I see:<br />
<br />
I have been through the File&gt;Options (Excel Options), and I can see nothing in any of the boxes, checked or unchecked, which may enable/disable this information.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The information under Help says this version of Excel is part of Microsoft Office Home Student
 2010.&nbsp; (My supplier has assured me that this is a full version of Excel.&nbsp; Is it really?)&nbsp; It is Version 14.0.7106.5003 (32 bit).&nbsp; The Windows 7 version is 64 bit.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; When I did your simple test saving test, (and knowing that saving as an Excel Workbook does
 in fact save it as *.xlsx), the file did save as Book1.xlsx. <br />
I had a look at my original Excel 2003 file.&nbsp; There are&nbsp; two worksheets (plus the problem charts)- each of less than 1000 rows.&nbsp; 256 columns is 9.84 aphabets- so column A to to column GA (at least).&nbsp; The larger worksheet goes to column EM, so should be OK there.<br />
I have opened the problem file using Excel 2010 (yes- it came up in Compatibility Mode), and Save As using the Excel Workbook choice.&nbsp; Checking with the now saved file, it is *.xlsx.&nbsp; I opened this .xlsx version, and the charts still cannot be worked on.<br />
Thank you again for your assistance.&nbsp; I am still puzzled.&nbsp; GerryMacCrae<br />

            <p>I would not worry so much about the missing (*.xlsx) and (*.xlsm) entries.&nbsp; That's just added information.&nbsp; I suspect now that if you took another test workbook and saved it as Macro Enabled, that it would save as .xlsm type (they don't
<u>have</u> to have macros in them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, Office Home and Student does contain full versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint.&nbsp; Unless you need Outlook, it's one of the best pricings for the basics of Office around if you qualify for it.&nbsp; Your&nbsp;data should all be there - remember, in going from
 2003 to 2007, worksheet space increased, not decreased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question becomes: What's with the charts?&nbsp; Microsoft made major changes in the shared-across-office-apps graphics engine&nbsp;in 2007.&nbsp; In 2007, charting was incredibly botched up.&nbsp; Example: it could take many minutes just to get 2007 respond to a request
 to change the color of a line in a simple line chart, and the data points counter was screwed up - instead of resetting for a chart on the same sheet, it was cumulative, so if you were creating charts with 800 data points (I was), by the time you created the
 4th chart, it thought you were starting off with 3200 data points instead of zero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They managed to patch things up and 2010 isn't so bad, but the entire model that charts were based on in 97-2003 has changed (macro code that once worked to deal with charts in 97-2003 often does not work with charts created in 2007/2010).&nbsp; I simply do not
 have a definitive answer for you as to why they are not working - so I won't try to blow smoke up your skirt saying that I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried taking a copy of the (.xlsx) workbook and rebuilding one or two of the charts to see if you can work with them if they are created using 2010 instead of trying to manipulate the older charts?</p>
<p>You might also check out this discussion (on-going, unresolved at this time) that seems to be similar to yours: working with large files in 2010.</p>

            Jllantham- thank you again for your considered reply.&nbsp; I wrote my reply about midday yesterday.&nbsp; Last night, I tried exactly what you suggested.&nbsp; I opened the 2003 file in Compatible mode, and was able to copy both of the data worksheets and paste them
 into a new Excel 2010 workbook.&nbsp; As far as I can see, all the formulas etc copied over successfully.&nbsp; I was then able to recreate the first of what will be many charts&nbsp; with the original data.&nbsp; This new workbook was saved in .xlsx format, and does open properly.&nbsp;
 At least now I can get what I want, but will continue to be annoyed with the number of steps 2010 requires to define and change&nbsp; axes and scales, change the worksheet locations of the range of data to be plotted, change the formatting of the chart etc., compared
 with 2003.&nbsp; Thank you very, very much for your assistance and patience with my problem.&nbsp; I will now read the discussion you pointed to, out of interest. GerryMacCrae

<p>This is occurring in Powerpoint 2007 on Microsoft 7 OS.&nbsp; I'm thinking it has something to do with converting a 2003 compatible ppt. to a 2007 although other computers in the office which are running with the same thing do not have this problem and they can

<p>Charts are embedded or linked, not both.&nbsp; But I don't think that's germane so let it slide for now.</p>
<p>Are you certain they're Excel charts and not MSGraph charts (ie, charts original inserted directly in PowerPoint 2003 or earlier)?</p>
<p>You can include MSGraph as part of the 2007 install but ISTR that it's an option.&nbsp; You have to choose to install it or it won't be installed.</p>
<p>Try this:&nbsp; Choose Insert Tab | Text group | OBJECT and see if Microsoft Graph Chart is on the list of objects you're shown.</p>

<p>You might try this:</p>
<p>Click Start, click Run, type the following command, and then click OK:<br />
regsvr32 %systemroot%\system32\ole32.dll<br />
2. In the RegSvr32 dialog box, click OK.<br />
3. Restart the computer.</p>
<p>Also, if you use Norton, update it.</p>

<h2>            Yet another vote to fix Automatic Repair</h2>
                    <p>Step 1- Do something trivial in Programs, like uninstall a minor Windows feature that is not essential.</p>
<p>Step 2- Reboot.</p>
<p>Step 3- Automatic Repair appears to fix a problem.</p>
<p>Step 4- Try to use Automatic Repair.</p>
<p>Step 5- Automatic Repair totally fails.</p>
<p>Step 6- Try Safe Mode</p>
<p>Step 7- Cannot enter Safe Mode.</p>
<p>Step 8- Eventually give up in frustration and completely reinstall Windows 10 TP Build 9926 from ISO. By the way,</p>
<p>thanks Microsoft for allowing me to now install W10 from ISO for my RAID array, which I complained about earlier!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point of all the above is,&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">AUTOMATIC REPAIR IS STILL BROKEN.</span></em></strong></p>

<div>There is nothing wrong with your formula , although it returns <i>2</i>&nbsp;for the above sample data set. I'm assuming that you expected
<i>3</i>&nbsp;before you changed Q11 to <i>Completed</i>&nbsp;from <i>NA</i>. I would guess that you have leading and/or trailing
<i>spaces</i>&nbsp;or <i>non-breaking spaces</i>&nbsp;that are fouling up the returns. <i>Non-breaking spaces</i>&nbsp;are common if data has been copied from a web page and they do not respond to TRIM(). I recommend you manually check for extraneous&nbsp;characters&nbsp;prefixing
 or suffixing the data in the formulas bar. Likewise, =LEN(Q5) or =LEN(Q8) will tell you if there is more than meets the eye.</div>

I too have a new Windows 8 laptop, running Office/Word 2007. The f7 should initiate spell check, it does nothing in either Word or Outlook, composing e-mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed the above instructions, but did not get past the 'Quick Access Toolbar'---&gt;Customize button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you post step by step instructions for:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Checking the f7 assignment and</p>
<p>2. How to assign the proofing/spell checker to f7 if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've called HP technical support to no avail, trolled the Internet for instructions and/or information and nothing/no one seems to understand what I am asking nor what I want to accomplish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Office 7 for writing and find it ridiculous to have to move my hands to the mouse/touchpad to Spell Check a document, when a keystroke did the job for over 10 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your input is appreciated.</p>

            The problem is likely with your laptop, not with Word. It could also be that some other program is snatching the function key. Does the F7 key work in other programs where it is supposed to?<br />
<br />
In Word, try selecting a word and pressing Shift+F3. What happens?<br />

            In what way doesn't the customizing work? What happens when you click the Office button | Word Options | Quick Access Toolbar | Customize? You should see the Customize Keyboard dialog box. Click in the "Press new shortcut key" and press F7. See what it
 says at "Currently assigned to." You should see "ToolsProofing" listed. If it says something else, you can reassign the command.

<h2>            Nokia 5610 XpressMusic - memory card was not detected</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I just bought my new 5610 around last 2 weeks, and now I'm facing a problem where after 1 week, my phone can't detect the memory card anymore. Even after I tried to reinsert the memory card into my phone, the same problem still occured. I'm sure the problem
 is from the phone itself coz when I inserted it into the memory card's slot in my laptop, it still can be detected and the files in it can be viewed. If anyone of you had experienced the same problem before or have any recommendation, please let me know.

<h2>            How do I report an incorrect phone number for a business on Bing</h2>
                    <p>I just went to call our daycare and realized the phone number shown in the search results for them is incorrect. The poor guy who answered the phone said "You must've gotten this phone number doing a Bing search" and then gave me the correct number from
 memory -- I'm sure because he gets calls every day incorrectly directed to him by Bing. Sure enough, I looked up the number on Google and it is correct there. So I went to "Help" on the footer nav to try and find a link to easily report the problem and couldn't
 find one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how I should go about getting the correct number to Bing?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
Bing doesn’t control the content that websites publish or that appears in Bing search results. To make sure content is removed from search results, your best option is to contact the webmaster for the website that published the content and request that it be
 deleted or removed. Until the webmaster removes the content from their website, it will continue to exist and can be discovered by going directly to the web address or by search engines like Bing.
</p><p>If the website has removed the content but it still appears on Bing, you can remove broken links or cached content from search results with the

            <p>Hi -- thanks for responding. I am having a little trouble understanding a few things. When I look at the website of the listing in question
<a href="http://www.goddardschool.com/seattle/bellevue-20th-street-wa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.goddardschool.com/seattle/bellevue-20th-street-wa</a> -- they have their phone number published and I know that number to be correct. Bing shows a different number for that specific
 business in their results. But when I look it up on Google, the number is correct.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I didn't try the Bing Content Removal Tool yet because&nbsp;it was the first time I had looked up the website &nbsp;and don't have any reason to think they updated/changed their phone number, and like I said, Google had it correct. But I just went in and
 tried the Bing Content Removal Tool and entered the exact URL of the search results displaying the wrong phone number for the business and get this response:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa310e2a-d58b-4997-9001-991d0a9078cc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am not sure what to do with this since there is no 'word that appears in the cached version of the page but no longer appears on the web page." -- it is just an incorrect phone number. But just in case, I did go ahead and enter the phone number Bing
 is showing in the search results in the 'Cached page text' box, and this is what I got:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d64883e-f18b-4599-a217-84a10d7e6306" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am not sure what to do from here. OK, I just tested it out on my wife's iPad mini -- verified same behavior. Google results same/correct and reflects what their website says. Bing results provide the incorrect number not shown on their web site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the best case scenario here is that Bing somehow got the wrong number somehow but they haven't re-indexed the page for a long time?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Odd. </p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>My excel has been crashing regularly, sometimes 10-15 times per day. There is a possibility that it is linked to powerpoint. If I start powerpoint while my excel is running, it crashes. I have tried un-installing and re-installing add-ins but nothing seems
 to help. All windows/office updates are installed.</p>

<p>Anyone has any suggestions?</p>

<p>thanks,</p>

    <title>Why do some webpages not load completely or sometimes loads blank&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> graphtrix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do some webpages not load completely or sometimes loads blank&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The symptoms that occurr: </p>
<p>1. The webpage takes time to load and will sometimes load blank and be either black or white.</p>
<p>2. Of the webpages that&nbsp;do load,&nbsp;there will only be a partial page displayed(usually the top part), and even then that part is incomplete.</p>
<p>3. Of the webpages that do load partially, where there is a location on the webpage that requires a text to be typed into( for a user name etc.), that text box is not accessible by mouse click or tab key and text can't be typed at all. Nothing on the page
 works!</p>
<p>The&nbsp;first&nbsp;thing i notice is when the webpages in question first tries to load, IE9 immediately tries to make it work in compatibility mode, but fails.</p>
<p>When the webpages are attempting to load they never end or stop with an error message, they just stop in their incomplete state.</p>
<p>I have tried all the usuals, turning add-ons off, compatibilty mode and&nbsp;all suggestions I have read online and none that fixed the problem.</p>
<p>The work around I use to gain access to the webpage&nbsp;is by changing the &nbsp;'default page style' to 'no page style', but&nbsp;by doing this&nbsp;the webpage is in a text only display, with no graphics or their place holders, so there are only text and lines displayed,
 but i then can type in test as well as click on links. But when I do click a link and the page changes then i am back where i started, unable to do anything again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Hope i am not the only one that has noticed this problem!?</p>

Try to understand your symptom better.&nbsp; Sounds like it could be a DNS issue with content files.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. the content comes from a different host and addressability is deficient (not available or too slow).&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you have&nbsp; IE9&nbsp; you could use its&nbsp; Developer Tools,
 Network Capture tool to try to figure out what is missing and why.&nbsp;&nbsp; Post some details for a publicly accessible scenario if you want help with it.</p>
<p>Also, assuming your router is acting as a DNS server you could try using the workaround devised by wbundrick for a related symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.f.</p>

            By the way I have the same problem you do. When you click on a link that gives you the problem go to the 'pages' tab and then scroll own to the 'style' text and change it to 'none' instead of 'default' and then your web page will &nbsp;work, in a text kind
 of mode anyway, but at least you can then get access, remember that every time you click another link within the problem page you would need to keep changing the style to none. Seems there is no way to turn the style type on and off

            <p>No,</p>
<p>Open your browser, make sure that the 'command bar' option is check marked so that part is available. (The Command Bar has a 'Print' button to the left and a 'safety' button to the right of the 'Page' button). then click the button labeled 'Page', then on
 the drop down list, near the bottom(4th from the bottom) click 'style', then another box opens to the right and then choose 'no style' instead of 'default style'. Like I said earlier this choice only works for the current web page you are on, the very next
 link you go to will change it back to 'default style' (bad design)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I couldn't paste a captured image of what i explained in the paragraph above??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway i hope you understood my explanation and&nbsp; this is only a temp work around to gain access to the web page that won't display correctly because of this major flaw in IE9.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Google chrome, firefox, Opera... are just a few browsers that have figured it out, so as big as Microsoft is how come they have made it this difficult for website designers to try and be compatible with IE9</p>

<p>looking at the Image you posted, lead me to go to that setting and by check marking the "ignoring the font styles' I now can access at least 3 websites' pages that I haven't been able to access somewhat normally in over a year. So for now this has fixed
 my web page access problem, I am going to test this theory to make sure though. Seems that coincidences can lead to answers sometimes, Thanks for the reply!!</p>

<h2>            Most efficient way to manage email in Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>Is it more efficient to manage email for a single account using one .pst file and many folders OR multiple .pst files that contain less folders.</p>
<p>Right now I use multiple .pst files ( about 15 ) and I'm concerned that this method slows MS Outlook down.</p>

            I don't think Outlook 2007's performance with multiple PSTs will be significantly different than its performance with a single PST.&nbsp; There is some evidence that a single larger PST will not behave as well as a smaller PST, but I've never seen any definitive
 studies for Outlook 2007.

            We may have a solution to the problem. My global admin needed to enable app integrations. Once he did that everything seemed to work. My district is on Spring break through this week; I will be testing this out with some of teachers, and will let you know
 if this is resolved.

    <title>Office 2016 and the language of the menus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scion1969  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 and the language of the menus</h2>
                    <p>First off, I am in Korea. &nbsp;I work in a school and I use PowerPoint for some of my material.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on a computer that uses Windows 7, and that cannot change due to some server issue that makes it not work correctly with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They recently changed my computer, which was old and slow, to a less old and less slow one. &nbsp;Windows 7 on both computers is in English. &nbsp;I had Office 2007 on the other computer, and it was a copy that was in English. &nbsp;They installed Office 2016 on this new
 computer. &nbsp;The menu interfaces are all in Korean. &nbsp;Suddenly I cannot do my stuff in the way that I want because the menus are all different, in different places, with different symbols and I don't know what any of them are now that they are all in Korean.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6062b58-31cc-478d-b885-cfe9acf62d6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6062b58-31cc-478d-b885-cfe9acf62d6a" /></a>I
 want to be able to read everything in English, so that I can create the presentations in the manner that I want to them to work. &nbsp;From what I can gather in the support pages, this is a matter of display language. &nbsp;I have looked up the display language information
 in the support pages and followed directions, but I cannot get the display language to change to the computer's language, despite it apparently saying in the language options in the Office options sets that it will be using the display language of the computer,
 English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded a language pack for Windows 7, but when I run it, it simply says that there is nothing for it to do on the computer. &nbsp;And still the language doesn't change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tech people that I have contacted at Microsoft say that the language files are all supposed to be part of Office 2016 and that it is supposed to be easy to change the language to whatever I want, and yet it has stymied all my efforts to make this change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps I can add in a picture of the language preference dialog box for Office, as compared to the dialog box I found in the support pages, if someone has the ability to read it in Korean, or at least wishes to compare how they seem to be the same or
 different. &nbsp;I didn't do that here as it probably takes up quite a bit of space to have lots of pictures in this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really wish to be able to do my work at work on this computer, but if I can't make this language change, I will not be able to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me?</p>

            <p>Thank you Sushma.&nbsp; I appreciate your attempt to offer a solution.&nbsp; I gave it a whirl.&nbsp; Here's what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first went into the control panel and attempted to uninstall the Korean language pack.&nbsp; I was a little confused as what I was supposed to find following your instructions differed from what was actually there.&nbsp; I suspect that your instructions are for
 a different version of Windows.&nbsp; The computer at work uses Windows 7, and the control panel has only a button for "Programs and Features."&nbsp; I believe that is the same thing as the Add/Delete Programs of other Windows versions.&nbsp; When I went in there, I couldn't
 find any Korean language pack.&nbsp; I searched in the program list, as well as in the updates list.&nbsp; I don't know why this would be so.&nbsp; I assume there has to be, since there is a little icon down on the task bar for changing the language of use for the computer
 between English and Korean.&nbsp; That language pack however, remained unseen.&nbsp; I was unable to uninstall and then reinstall it to find out what effect it would have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved on to the next step, removing Office and then reinstalling it.&nbsp; I uninstalled the program and then, for good measure in case it was some remnant of an earlier version of Office causing the problem, used the fix it program to completely remove Office
 from the computer.&nbsp; I reinstalled Office 2016, fired it up, and found that nothing had changed.&nbsp; It is still a Korean version of Office, with Korean menus and commands.&nbsp; The language preferences page, still lists useable languages within the program as Korean
 and American English.&nbsp; This of course was never the problem.&nbsp; I can,&nbsp;as always, type content in English, but that is not my goal.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f0a0be0-5f84-467e-b962-ab0dd985940b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f0a0be0-5f84-467e-b962-ab0dd985940b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And under that, it lists (I think; it is all in Korean, so I can't be sure) the interface languages for the program.&nbsp; And the default one looks to be the default language of the computer, which is English.&nbsp; As far as I can understand from what I have read
 in these forums, from my chats with help desk people and from suggestions like yours that I have read, this should mean that I have all my menus in English.&nbsp; And yet I don't.&nbsp; Or perhaps I am mistaken and the language of Office cannot be changed, even I have
 asked point blank if it can, and seemingly have been answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am at a loss as to what to try next.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need install English Language Accessory Pack and set it as default in Office to change the display language. Refer to the article below for more information.

            <p>Thank you for your help Vardhaman. &nbsp;No worries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I didn't fully explain all that we tried. &nbsp;We tried downloading the language pack. &nbsp;I can't remember exactly if it just wasn't available for download, or if we did download it and then it still wasn't available in the display language list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the computer uses an English version of Windows, and from the screenshot I posted above it does say that Office uses the display language of the computer, which is supposedly English, from everything I could find at any rate. &nbsp;Yet Office 2016
 still showed only Korean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the issue is not at an end, from our point of view. &nbsp;We located a licensed copy of an earlier version of Office that has been installed on the computer, so we don't need to worry about whether Office 2016 truly has some kind of customizability
 for operating language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have to honestly say that I don't believe it does. &nbsp;Everything Microsoft has put out says it should be, but nothing that anyone, from those in this community to the help desk at Microsoft, says has made any difference in the situation at all. &nbsp;It really
 seems that this is not currently a function of Office. &nbsp;So if Microsoft really means it, if they really everyone everywhere to be able to use Office comfortably and in a language that is useful to them, then Microsoft really should address the matter. &nbsp;If
 it's this much trouble for someone who is reasonably familiar with how to modify options in programming, the options that are actually available, and still can't do it, and if it's really there in the program somewhere, then it's too hard. &nbsp;If Microsoft is
 really attempting to get to a new level of connectedness in the world, Microsoft needs to make this easier to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This matter can be considered resolved from my point of view, albeit unsatisfactorily as the solution I wanted does not seem to be available.</p>

            <p>Hi Vardhaman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your wish to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working at a public school in Korea. &nbsp;The copy of Office is the school's copy and has the school's licence and key, which I guess must be some kind of multiple computer license, as it has been installed, successfully on many computers at the school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Korean language version of Office Professional Plus 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried to install it onto my computer at school, which has an English version of Windows 2007. &nbsp;The Windows program on the computer I use has whatever is necessary to switch back and forth between English and Korean language inputs. &nbsp;However, the display
 language and default language of the computer is English (from everything I have been able to learn about this from people, troubleshooting databases and the like).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the Office 2016 program was installed, it would open up in Korean. &nbsp;We checked the default for language in the program which is the screen capture I have inserted above. &nbsp;It appears to say that the default language for Office 2016 was to be the default
 and display language for the computer, which ought to have been English. &nbsp;The second language listed for Office 2016 was Hangeul, the Korean written language. &nbsp;Nevertheless, the program continued to operate in Korean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We attempted to download the language file from Microsoft that would change the display language into English. &nbsp;When run, it simply said there was nothing for it to add or modify. &nbsp;And still Office 2016 ran in Korean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing we did had any effect, and we followed all instructions from anywhere we could find them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is not my copy of Office, I did not associate it with my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, so that I can use Office in an effective manner, we uninstalled Office 2016, found an older version of Office that was in English, and installed that instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it has been resolved, albeit unsatisfactorily, as I had to inconvenience a number of people in order to get a copy of Office I could use. &nbsp;And I have reached the conclusion that Microsoft has not managed to produce Office 2016 with that capability. &nbsp;It
 is something Microsoft should address and correct if the company is going to continue to say that the program will change languages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would certainly be interested in knowing if it is indeed possible to change the language in the program, as I was very frustrated and I don't like leaving such a question unanswered. &nbsp;But I understand if you have better ways to use your time. &nbsp;The current
 setup on the computer works now and I have a copy of Office that is in English. &nbsp;It is simply an older version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have provided this information in case you can provide an answer, but mostly so that Microsoft can perhaps learn of a failing in their Office program, that contradicts what the company says it can do, and then make some kind of fix for it in the future,
 if that is indeed what they want the program to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you very much for your reply.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forum is for support on installing and working with Office applications on desktop clients/consumer level.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However based on my research it seems that for volume licensing there is different method to change language.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the section <strong>Use the Language Preferences tool to change language settings
</strong>and check if it helps.</p>
