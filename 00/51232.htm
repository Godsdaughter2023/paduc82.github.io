<h2>            Windows Explorer crash when enter Movies folder</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly my movie folders (has many mp4, avi and mkv files) has been weird. I cannot access the folder, the windows explorer would crash. Any apps attempt to open would crash as well. I tried some methods available online (the DivX handler extension) but
 no helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help? Thanks.</p>

    <title>Windows Monitor Auto Detection issue &#40;again&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Monitor Auto Detection issue &#40;again&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been searching for a solution to this problem for about a month and everything (Yes, everything I have found) is a useless solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work with 2 monitors, both connected via Display Port. I have applications open on both. Then I leave the room for 10 minutes and the monitors go to sleep, or I turn the monitors off to watch TV for a while, and when the monitors are back on, all my application
 windows have been moved to one screen, all smooshed togeher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, so I would like to be able to turn the monitor off without the computer thinking it's been disconnected completely. Simple, eh? When I go to Display Settings, I can see the monitor disappearing when I turn it off, so I am certain this is the issue.
 I also hear the 'device disconnection' sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an AMD Radeon RX 480, but the problem was still there with the IG from the I7-6700.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is; How can I disable Monitor Auto Detection?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">And before we start, I have done a Clean Install, I have tried changing the Registry for 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\TMM', I have changed the OSD settings on the monitor, I have reinstalled the drivers, I have clean installed
 the reinstalled the drivers, there is no DMMEnablePolling in my registry, changing the USB detection in 'Power Settings' doesn't work, a different cable doesn't work, ANY solution given by Microsoft support so far doesn't work.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I want to turn my monitor off, without having the computer regard it as a disconnected device.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">It seems this has been a problem since Vista, but no one has bothered to fix it. In the feedback forums, this has been a requested fix for a decade.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">To summarise; I don't need new drivers, I don't need to clean install, there's no registry solution (so far) that works. So please, PLEASE give me a solution.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" />

<p>
</p><p>Hello Dizzy</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience and at the same time we appreciate the effort you have put in to resolve the issue. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed any further, let us know a few more detaisl on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using an extended display when you say 'I have applications open on both'?</li><li>Is it an abrupt issue since the windows 10 Clean installation you performed? Did you make any changes to the PC prior to the issue?</li><li>Does the issue occur intermittently or consistently in Windows? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I&nbsp;suggest you to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;the&nbsp;Power Saver option is not enabled under&nbsp;the Power Option settings in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftr4.cbsistatic.com%2fhub%2fi%2fr%2f2015%2f11%2f19%2f6afea94b-817b-47e9-9156-1d48f7e9bf8b%2fresize%2f620x%2f10f09b7c9733f1a76a791b34edc6173c%2ffig-c-11-16.png" height="403" width="598" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it still does not help, I suggest you to adjust Power Management settings for&nbsp;the&nbsp;video adapter&nbsp;device and check if it helps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Type <span>device manager</span> to open the Search bar, and then select <span>
Device Manager</span> from the results list.</li><li>Expand the <strong>Video Adapters</strong>, right click on the&nbsp;Video adapter device&nbsp;and select
<span>Properties</span>.</li><li>Under the Power Management tab, uncheck <span>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</span>, and then click
<span>OK</span>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Write to us with the updated status and the required information, related to display in Windows, for us to be able to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>Hello Sayan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off I would like to thank you for suggesting a solution I haven't seen on any other issue similar to this so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I am using extended display</li><li>This is an issue persistent through all versions of the OS to date. I finished building my PC 2 weeks ago, installing Windows 7 initially. I saw the problem in Windows 7, then clean installed to 10 thinking it would be fixed, it still remained. I then clean
 installed as others had suggested and that did not solve the issue. As I said before, it seems this issue has been around since Vista, so although I (and many others) beg for a solution, having confirmation that there is no solution could just be comfort enough
 at this point.</li><li>It is a consistent problem. From what I've read, it seems to be an issue with the was Display Ports are handled by Windows and the way Display Ports work in general.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the Power Management as you suggested and it is set to Balanced, so no issues there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a Video Adapters set in my Device Manager. I have Display Adapters which shows my Radeon RX 480, but no Video Adapters. Nonetheless, just to check, I opened every single driver in the dropdown menu starting from Audio Inputs and Outputs to Universal
 Serial Bus Controllers and nothing that seemed to link to a Monitor/Video/Graphics/Power setting had any mention of a Power Management property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, upon further testing, if I switch one of my Display Ports to an HDMI port on the GPU, it still remains active when the monitor is turned off. This
<strong>is no</strong><strong>t</strong> the case with the Display port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use a DP to HDMI Adapter, this does not fix the issue. From testing, it is definitely a Display Port issue. Is there anything at all in the registry, in hidden files etc that relate to DP power management?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your reply, I do appreciate your help and original answers to this problem.</p>

            <p>I think this just might be the golden ticket (as a workaround)....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this little app.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://github.com/gurrhack/RestoreWindows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RestoreWindows app</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just run the exe in the bin directory. When run, it looks like it just exits, but it continues to run in the background. It apparently remembers the windows locations and restores them when the monitors reconnect. I'm not sure what will happen if both (all)
 monitors are connected via Display port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one caveat, it doesn't restore the desktop icons. (enhancement anyone?)</p>
<p>I'm using DVI-D and Displayport.</p>

<p>SOLUTION (easy, simple and.. working)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comming from a 4 days internet search for a solution, i though... problem is DP/HDMI connection, not DVI... and I try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the 2 monitors setup (extended desktop) I have I connected:</p>
<p>Monitor 1 with Displayport to my GTX970.</p>
<p>Monitor 2 with Displayport to my GTX970+ SAME MONITOR with a DVI cable to GTX970 too, YES ! 2 cables on same monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows, I just have to say "dont display" 3rd monitor (the DVI signal), but the hot plug is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can turn off monitors without losing my Illustrator panels, windows etc.. on 2nd screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about my english and hope this works for you guys!</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lately, my Nextbook has been getting very hot whenever I do pretty much anything (even though I've had Windows 10 for some time now) , and I would like to know what might happen if it does overheat, and how much it can.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some necessary specs:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. I use the Flexx 10 model.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. I have a folio case over my tablet (It overheats even if I take it off)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. The area where it overheats is uncomfortably close to the 64GB Micro SB card I have on my tablet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. Some of my drivers may or may not be outdated (It tells me to find Device Manager, but I can't find it).</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yea, that's about it. Somebody please give me advice about this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>sick of getting this error when its actually the update what is the problem!</p>
<p>not my laptop or hard drive but the update what windows give us, constant errors.</p>
<p>saying things are corrupt files etc, I never had corrupt files till I install the bloody updates that windows insist we have.</p>
<p>done all the scan now rubbish so its Microsoft windows causing all the problems and do nothing about it.</p>
<p>I have better things to do that keep flattening my hard drive with new install for it to start again once you send us updates!!</p>

<p>Hi Gilberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 operating system requires specific hardware components to support the platform. We'd recommend checking this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/windows/windows-10-specifications#system-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to know about the minimum system requirements of the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: We'd also recommend engaging the support team of the manufacturer of your device for other compatibility considerations and installation information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know should you need further assistance.</p>

            <b>Notepad Tutorial</b>
<p>Notepad is a handy program that a user can type in text quickly and easily. It is not for publishing a book but more of a scratchpad. This is a tutorial on how to use Notepad.</p>
<p><br />
What will be taught</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening Notepad</li><li>Saving a document</li><li>Printing a document</li><li>Opening an existing document</li></ul>
<b>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
Open Notepad </b>
<p><br />
To open Notepad click on <b>Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Notepad</b><br />
<br />
Click here for a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smartlabsoftware.com/images/notepad-screen.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot</a>&nbsp;of Notepad</p>
<p>To enter text, just start typing in Notepad.<br />
If you make a mistake typing you can backspace over it.</p>
<div><br />
<b>Save</b>
<p>To save your work click on <b>File &gt; Save</b> and if you have not saved it before a screen will appear.<br />
<br />
Click here for a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smartlabsoftware.com/images/notepad-open.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot</a>&nbsp;of Save dialog</p>
<p>For now, make sure the Encoding is set to ANSI.<br />
</p>
<div><br />
<b>Print </b>
<p>To print <b>File &gt; Print.</b>..&nbsp; The three dots after the word Print means there will be another screen that pops up. This is a Windows standard.</p>
<p>Click here for a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smartlabsoftware.com/images/notepad-print.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot</a>&nbsp;of the Print dialog</p>
<p>&nbsp;Select the printer you wish to print to then click the 'Print' button.</p>
<div><br />
<b>Open </b>
<p>To open an existing notepad document click on <b>File &gt; Open</b>...</p>
<p>Click here for a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smartlabsoftware.com/images/notepad-open.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot</a>&nbsp;of Open dialog</p>
<p>If you have not saved a document you are working on, Notepad will ask you if you want to save it or discard it. The Open window appears (note the word 'open' in the title bar) which allows you to browse to your existing document.</p>
<p>Note the File name has a *.txt which means when you browse for your already created document only notepad type documents (those ending with .txt) will show up in the Open window.</p>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>
<div><b>Word Wrap </b>
<p>Normally selecting word wrap is the best thing. What this does is when enabled, when typing in Notepad comes to the right side of the page, the words will wrap and start on the next line without having to hit the Enter key.<br />
<br />
Note this does not affect printing. If there is a several line paragraph in which Enter was never hit then the paragraph will take up the entire width of the printed paper's margins.<br />
<br />
To turn word wrap ON click on Format then Word Wrap. A checkmark will appear next to Word Wrap.<br />
<br />
Click here for a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smartlabsoftware.com/images/notepad-wordwrap.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot</a>&nbsp;showing Word Wrap is on.<br />
<br />
To turn word wrap OFF click on Format then Word Wrap. The checkmark next to word wrap will disappear, indicating word wrap is off.&nbsp;<br />
</p>

            Is everything on the desktop (icons, taskbar, open windows, etc) sideways?&nbsp; If so, pressing CTRL+ALT+Left Arrow or CTRL+ALT+Right Arrow should fix it.

<h3> gray leslie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft update 9&#47;25&#47;16</h2>
                    <p>I first replied to inability to log on to my laptop with my password that no one knows but me, and no changed it.</p>
<p>I called my computer maker, and they said, take it to Bestbuy where I bought it. Microsoft was a 90-minute wait, then a&nbsp;70 minute. I went to Bestbuy, and the&nbsp;Geek Squad helped me to create a new login password. I had a new grey circle with the letter f as
 a new login user. I could log in to that, but that did not allow me to get to my documents or downloads. I did see 9-25-16 at 6:33 am Microsoft and at 6:37 Intell had made updates. Bestbuy said it was the largest upgrade Microsoft had ever&nbsp;performed. So if
 you freaked out because you lost you picture of your login and lost your password that is why. Thanks, MICROSOFT not! It would have been great to be notified that this was to occur. My Windows 10 computer is six months old. Why did I need an update? And every
 other Microsoft user did not have the same issue? USE YOUR PASSWORD with MICROSOFT EMAIL. lady at Microsoft &nbsp;could had mentioned "Microsoft did have an update today and that is why"!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have had Windows 10 on desktop since earlier this spring. Since 9-25-16 I can no longer sign into my desktop computer using the pin or my password. It says it is wrong, even though I have triple checked and had them written down. Same pin and passwords
 that have worked just fine for months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something with its the new win10 update is believed to be the cause of my problem. So....I am trying to run a business and cannot do any work because this stupid update has locked me out of my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am so fed up with bugs and issues with automatic updates. I had no clue they were going to do a big update either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft. You caused this issue, so please list a fix or free support help contact number so I can get back to work. Your buggy update is costing me thousands of dollars per day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I log onto my computer??? HELP NEEDED NOW!!!!!</p>

            After this update it has done this to everyone. &nbsp;Now peoples pin will not work. &nbsp;You have to click the button under the login screen and switch to the password. The password for your email you used. &nbsp;Your pin was created just as a shortcut into your pc,
 the real password is the password you used for email. &nbsp;Hotmail or whatever. &nbsp;They f*cked up again at micrsoft. &nbsp;You are not alone. &nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>Sink it....I could seriously kiss you!! I tried my pin, then my computer password. Then my ms online account password. Because I sign into my desktop offline with my user name I never even thought about trying my email password here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried it it and it worked!!!! Everyone with same issue. Try using your EMAIL PASSWORD if you can't open your computer offline as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI....when it signed in it completed the upgrade that Windows 10 just did that completely screwed up my life for 3 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will ill be saving all my files and getting rid of Windows 10 altogether. I lost 3 days of business/work. Spent 3 hours with Microsoft answer desk tech guy on chat last night and their own idiot couldn't tell me I needed to use my email password! WOW!
 Way to go Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No warning and info about how this update was going to affect your users. No knowledge from your own techs. Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if it wasn't for sinking......I would have lost another week and several hundreds of dollars to pay a tech to save my data and reload a new operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have had so much grief over this...literally crying last night. You guys are ****!</p>

            <p>Gray Leslie, Cherikur, SinKiy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for your insights - they got me over the hump for trying out options. &nbsp;Below this paragraph is what I was able to use to "unlock" 3 of my business PCs running Win10. &nbsp;Apparently, I also joined the crowds of folks who also have the Windows Update
 setting set to "automatic updates", <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><em>which Microsoft recommends</em></strong></span> since it makes it "faster and safer". &nbsp;(Right?!) &nbsp;Then, it also auto restarts your PC to ensure the installation is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't work this time, Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Microsoft Engineers, Staff, Managers and high paid executives:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this "Anniversary Edition" update was the biggest roll out to date, maybe you should have ensured it didn't do what it has done to so many users - it deleted our Lock-screen sign-in credential registers and/or our PIN codes - forcing us
 if it didn't work. &nbsp;Not that there was any risk, from past history, of your updates not working, right? &nbsp;Nope - no risks there....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this your new level of Customer Service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Steve Ballmer still there, running things? &nbsp;We all thought that thug left. &nbsp;We all must be wrong....</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is interesting is how consistent this error is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 6 of my rigs are ASUS ROG 15" gamer rigs, all less than 2 years old, some are only 1 month old; 3 had the Windows update setting set to "auto" with the associated re-start to ensure the laptops are updated, complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three (3) of my other rigs are also ASUS ROG 15" gamer rigs, same vintage range. &nbsp;The Windows update settings were under "Advanced Settings", then the pull down menu is set to "Notify to Schedule Restart" for when updates were available, giving me the option
 of when I would then update and do my own restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 3 with the auto update settings were crashed; all 3 responded to the Microsoft Account password used as the log-in credential for the lockscreen password fields, using that specific credential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error if you do not do this right is this: "Your device is offline. &nbsp;Please sign in with the last password used on this device"; even though when you set-up your laptop or desktop with the lock-screen password and/or the new PIN, and the field in "Settings"
 accepts the change and even though the WiFi icon shows the laptops are indeed connected (in my case, to our FiOS WiFi) and it is fully functional, if you use that old password and NOT the Microsoft Account password, you will get this error. &nbsp;The update erases
 those fields in the Settings screens, for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn your WiFi off and it works sometimes too, although the "Connection" can mean turning the WiFi setting to "Off" if you are already "inside" Windows looking at the settings screen, or the icon at the screenlock level to "Off" there as well, then re-try
 the Microsoft Account log-in credentials. &nbsp;It seems that if you are NOT connected, then the machine can only "see" the local on-machine credentials without any online interferences from Microsoft's online system overriding the local settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one colossal ****-up from Microsoft....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft folks also added in a "Local Account" option, that is recent &nbsp;-I have not noticed that before, it could be new with this latest update, don't really know. &nbsp;I am not sure though, what "local" account they want - that is left undefined and really
 confusing since the User name field stopped accepting characters when I started typing in my Microsoft account user name in that field - I do use that same user name in other applications.</p>

            <p>I agree. The Anniversary Update was a huge mess for MANY people, without warning when exactly it would occur and that my local account would be changed to the online Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now went in and turned OFF automatic updates. No download and no install until I approve it. I get more problems with my computer from Microsoft updates than I ever have with malware or viruses........so bye bye auto updates!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also changed my computer back to local account. My next computer operating system will be Apple. I am completely fed up and done with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when this occurred their stupid techs couldn't figure it out after I spent over 3 hours on the phone with them! They kept telling me it was my internet, then it was my ethernet cable. Idiots. Really. What a waste of my time. I lost 3 days plus of work.
 I should backcharge Microsoft for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like Microsoft just puts out these updates and I seriously wonder if they test them at all given all the trouble people have.</p>

            <p>Cherikur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad my post helped you, though I think you led the way and also exposed the wide gaps that Microsoft has with its infrastructure and unfortunate Customer Support. &nbsp;I do not understand how, at a random call you made for help, that at that random point, a
 customer support person put you on the "mouse wheel" of incompetence and exposed themselves and their organization. &nbsp;Since it is a random event, and that is what you found, it says a lot about how rampant the incompetence might be for any other caller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know how accountable Microsoft is going to be on this - their history does not speak well to that, nor would I try to use it as a marketing ploy, especially now. &nbsp;That they started off with good intentions and there are folks there who do care,
 this last exercise also exposes a large-scale systemic break-down, from the highest levels to the QA folks. &nbsp;We all, I think, want Microsoft to be better than they have been. &nbsp;Their opening efforts for Win10 indicated towards that direction. &nbsp;This last deployment
 has ruined their reputation, and that is all you really have as a service provider. &nbsp;This failure could become a boon for Apple, no?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Apple - we have several of those rigs as well - all MacBook Pros, 15" Retina, SSD, i7. &nbsp;Since the poor roll-out of Mountain Lion OS where people's "burn-in" phases of the usual 3-5 days resulted in rigs'cooling fans going full tilt for days on
 end WHILE their personal photos, etc. were all fried, Apple has been more reliable. &nbsp;We have the MacOS with i7 equipped rigs to power our own software and data analytics done via web-based platforms that are pretty involved. &nbsp;Either the MacOS or the WinOS
 using a decent browser like Chrome works, but a smaller rig won't handle that load of data analytics very well, especially during a demonstration or a sales event. &nbsp;We have to have the horse-power to enable real-time "What-If" scenario play. &nbsp;So far, so good
 it seems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, we MUST have both Windows and MacOS in our shop since so many engineering programs in universities and financial models require Windows OS for that type of original content development; the Macs are reserved mostly for our Powerpoint presentation
 development and tasks that are outside of engineering and financial modeling. &nbsp;This is how undergraduate and graduate programs are structured at Drexel University (Philadelphia) and Washington University, St. Louis's Biomedical Engineering and Computer Systems
 Engineering undergraduate programs, along with the post-graduate level/Ph.D. medical research programs there. &nbsp;I would imagine, given these 2 solid schools, that most others have a similar requirement for the Windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outside of the more technical fields, the Macs would be best for that. &nbsp;But for the foreseeable future, how we have our shop structured reflects how others are as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You face a difficult decision for what system to use to not get burned. &nbsp;Hope is not a strategy, yet I know many are "hoping" Microsoft does better next time....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best to you and maybe getting some drinks tonight with some friends will help shake it off...</p>

<p>original title:&nbsp;STOP 0x00000050, Video Card causes BSoD on Boot.</p>
<p>I've constructed a PC fairly recently and installed Windows 7 Professional on it. Initially everything worked fine, but after a week or two if now blue screens on bootup.</p>
<br />
The STOP error is 0x00000050, and I've already looked at the support solution for it. I cannot boot into normal Windows or into Safe Mode to modify the installed drivers, the system still gives me a BSoD and restarts. I've tried using both integrated VGA and
 the installed graphics card, an ATI HD 5750, but both still cause the blue screen.

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />The screenshot which you have posted, that is how web search in Cortana is supposed to behave. 
<br />Just wanted to understand the disconnect.

            Hi Mega
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />From the look of your screenshot, you don't seem to be running Windows 10 1903. I just tried this in Windows 10 1903 and it work.
<br />
<br />Click Start
<br />Scroll down to Cortana
<br />Right click Cortana
<br />Click More &gt; App Settings
<br />
<br />Click Terminate
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />See if Cortana starts working.... 
<br />
<br />Method 3: Restart the Cortana Process in Task Manager
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list of processes, select Cortana then click End Task.
<br />
<br />Restart Windows 10 then see if it starts working.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 4: Reinstall Cortana
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />At the command Prompt, type then following the hit Enter.
<br />Exit Powershell the restart
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.Windows.Cortana | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc214b5a-41f8-4d0b-8ec2-9b7067fb1bb8?upload=true" />

            Yes. But Cortana is not the problem. Because search is the problem. The other person showed how it is supposed to look, but mine looks different. I am on May update 1903, on a Surface laptop. The problem started before the update, and is becoming a major
 pain. I do not have any external drives I can format for space. I am OK with editing the registry, deleting files, editing system32 and replacing all windows apps. Powershell does not work no matter what.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb548cd4-fab7-4418-bfae-54cd5d1cc19f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb548cd4-fab7-4418-bfae-54cd5d1cc19f?upload=true" /></a>

            If you had a power cut, your NT File System (NTFS) is probably corrupted and needs repair.<br />
<br />
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must manually invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>

<h2>            Network Sharing Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see by searching in here and by Googling that the entire planet is experiencing one form of a problem or another with file/folder sharing, so I won't hold my breath waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I forget, let me say, yes, I've run both the Network and Homegroup troubleshooters. They, like all the other MS troubleshooters I've used in the last quarter century find nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Homegroup is enabled, the various file types are listed as shared.</li><li>Allowed Access in Media Streaming is allowed.</li><li>Network Discovery is turned on, and auto setup ticked..</li><li>Allow Windows to manage Homegroups ticked.</li><li>All Networks- Password Protection turned <strong>OFF</strong>.</li><li>I've tried sharing with Antivirus on &amp; off.</li><li>I've tried with the Firewall on &amp; off.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>One thing interesting- when I first started this adventure, I couldn't get my other device to see my computer at all. I went into Devices and shared the entire computer, then the other device would see my computer, and my computer would see the other device
 but; the other device sees the shared Library folders and nestled folders, but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>no</strong></span> files that they contain. I'm sooo not going to add 15,000 MP3s as individual shares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Date and Time -&nbsp; Make sure the date and time are correct and are synchronized on all computers or devices connected to the network.<br />
</li><li>Internet Protocol Version 6 - Make sure all devices are running <em>Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)</em>. To do that, right-click the network adapter you use to connect to the internet and select
<strong>Properties</strong>. Tick <em>Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)</em>, then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to sharing your MP3s, we suggest that you adjust the media streaming settings for other devices to access your media files. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In <em>Control Panel &gt; HomeGroup</em>, click the <strong>Allow all devices on this network such as TVs and game console to play my shared content</strong> link.</li><li>Set a name for your media library, then click <strong>Choose default settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Default media streaming settings</em>, choose what files can be streamed by default to all computers and devices on the network, then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>You're right. if you enter "file sharing problems on windows 10" into Google, you only get 23,600,000 returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added the whole system (again?) to devices, yet I see 'Base System' is already there. Should I need to if I share individual folders?</p>

<p>Thank you Marc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a solution for what I was attempting to do. Since I was trying to share folders which were media files, I installed Universal Media Server which is Open Source - free.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.universalmediaserver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.universalmediaserver.com/</a>&nbsp;I
 did try the Windows Media Player first, which should &nbsp;have worked since it too is a server, but it didn't. This program worked flawlessly streaming it to my other device after pointing it to my User Account Library(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft really needs to make sharing your own computers folders/files with only yourself easier.</p>

<h2>            2625 failure condition&#58;mutex-&#62;mLockFile &#40;null&#41;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;On 1/26/2016 I started my PC (Win 7) in the morning and it took a very long time to boot up. &nbsp;(Normally, it gets to the user login screen with the 5 users.) &nbsp;It stalled on the splash screen for the motherboard (something that usually takes seconds, not
 minutes). &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, &nbsp;I received this message:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;"\\\\common\classlib\runtimethread.ccp:2625 failure condition:mutex-&gt;mLockFile (null)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on guidance from another thread on this site, I ran the Clean Boot procedure and looked at the Windows Logs for the day it happened. &nbsp;There is nothing I can see from the logs that helps - although I am not sure I know what I am looking for. &nbsp;I looked
 in the following logs: &nbsp;Application, Security, Setup, and System.<br />
<br />
Even though I'm starting from a clean boot, it still boots up with the following message: &nbsp;"USER PROFILE SERVICE: &nbsp;You have been logged on with the default profile for the system. &nbsp;Please see the event log for details or contact your administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to figure out what type of issue I'm dealing with - a driver problem? an operating system problem? a registry problem? a malware problem? . . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide some guidance? &nbsp;Hopefully, there is a simpler fix rather than wiping the drive and reloading the operating system and software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help. &nbsp; -Tim</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt user profile. You may notice that a temporary profile has been loaded instead of
</p>
<p>the profile that corresponds to the current user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to use steps provided in this article and check if it helps.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>A temporary profile is loaded after you log on to a Windows Vista-based system</strong><br />

(Also holds good for Windows 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

            <p>VIDEO_TS is a folder from a DVD. Inside that folder you have found an information (.ifo) file and a video object (.vob) file. The .vob file is the one that contains video but it is encoded in the MPEG-2 format. Your Windows 7 computer must have had the appropriate
 codec to play MPEG-2 video but that codec is not included in Windows 10 anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only want to playback, then you can look to another media player like VLC to play the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you want to make edits to the file, you should convert the .vob file to a supported format like .wmv or .mp4 and then you can edit it in Movie Maker under Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            How to force microsoft wireless display adapter to use 5GHz</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have&nbsp;microsoft wireless display adapter but I have some issues with lags.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According WiFi analyzer is adapter using channel 1 on 2,4GHz range. Problem is, that in my location is this range quite full. Is there a way to force wireless adapter to use 5Ghz? This range is clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
