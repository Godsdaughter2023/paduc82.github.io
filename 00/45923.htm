    <title>Windows 7 does not install programs from CD&#47;DVD disc drive, cannot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ravingponies  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 does not install programs from CD&#47;DVD disc drive, cannot see .exe files in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    
<p>I attempted to load the software for a game I purchased. When I loaded the CD into the drive, the install program didn't start up. When I looked at the contents of the CD, the window came up with no files and only a prompt to "drag files to folder and add
 to disc" as if it were a burnable disc. Tonight I attempted to load software for a new blu ray drive I bought, but neither my old disc drive or my new blu ray drive can play the software disc. I tried to put in discs for games and other programs but all just
 come up as a blank disc (the only discs that work are music cds and DVD movies). I tried all of the program discs on another Windows 7 computer and they ALL work. The only way for me to install programs is through the internet (EA Games, Steam, Microsoft).
 I don't even get an option to run or install program when I insert the discs. The latest device I installed on my computer was a wireless printer from HP, the C4795. I have no idea what to do from here, PLEASE HELP!!! Thanks!</p>

            I just figured out how to fix it on my computer.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>When you attempt to download the file, at the bottom of the page does the download show at all?</div>
<div>If it does, you need to open another window and paste in this address:&nbsp;chrome://extensions/ &nbsp;</div>
<div>This brings you to your extension page for Google Chrome. You can also get there by clicking the options menu on the top right area of your screen (delineated by three horizontal lines), selecting "Settings" and then selecting "Extensions".</div>
<div><br />
<div>After you have both windows open, drag the windows media plugin download file from one window into the other "Extensions" window. The Extensions window should say "Drop to Install". So, drop the download file, and it should download.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this works for you!</div>

<h2>            Problems syncing iCloud Calendar with Windows 10 Calendar</h2>
                    I am having a problem syncing my iCloud Calendar with Windows 10. I can sync it with Outlook, but when I add my iCloud account info to the Windows 10 calendar, I receive the message "System error, Can't get calendars". Any thoughts. I don't know if this
 is an issue, but my iCloud signon is the same as my gmail signon.

<p><span>Hi Robindu,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that, you are receiving error: DPC watchdog violation. Don’t worry; we will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Which antivirus application are you using?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the exact/complete error message you receive?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s follow these methods and check if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Try to unplug all the external devices except keyboard and mouse then start the computer and check.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: If you are able to boot to the desktop, let’s start your computer in safe mode with networking and check if the issue persists.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Refer this link to start the computer in </span></span><span>safe mode with networking.</span>
</p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Try to upload dump file from safe mode with networking and see if you can.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>If it works fine in safe mode, perform clean boot.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Perform clean boot.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Clean boot will help us identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow steps from this link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>NOTE: </span></b><span>After checking the functionality in clean boot, c<span>onfigure Windows to use Normal startup. Refer step 3 from the above link for details.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span> If you are unable to boot to the Desktop, perform startup repair using Windows 8 DVD.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Boot from the Windows 8 DVD. <br />
b. Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option “Install now”<br />
c. Click on Repair your computer<br />
d. On the next page click on Advanced Options.<br />
e. Now click on Troubleshoot<br />
f. Click on Startup repair and follow the on screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I used microsoft security essentials on windows 7 but they told me that it was not compatible anymore with windows 8. The only antivirus application that I'm using now is the one that was provided with the cd drivers of my mainboard : Trend Micro Titanium
 Internet Security.
<div><br />
<div>I didn't note the exact error message I received but it's something like that :&nbsp;</div>
<div>Your computer ran into a problem and needs to restart.</div>
<div>If you'd like to know more you can search online later for this code :DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION&nbsp;</div>
<div>It's collecting error info and will restart in :</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm actually writing this on this computer, so the computer can boots the method 1 was no need for me.</div>
<div>I followed the second method and here are my dump files if you want to check them :&nbsp;http://sdrv.ms/TQhPOK</div>
<div><br />
<div>But the utility of performing clean boot is to detect if yes or not with or without certain application you still have the problem. But I don't have any problem till it reboot with this error message so I can't see which apllication causes the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And finally I can boot so the method 3 is also no need for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm a 17 years old french guy, excuse me for my poor english!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for you answering my question but the error occured again this morning( in France). So please help me!</div>

<p>Try copying the minidump files&nbsp;to&nbsp;a folder on the Desktop this way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, create a folder on the Desktop and call it <em>Minidumps</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;open the C:\Windows\Minidump folder&nbsp;and do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home &gt; Select all &gt; Home &gt;&nbsp;Copy to &gt; Choose location &gt; <em>Minidumps </em>&gt; Copy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then right-click the <em>Minidumps</em> folder &gt; Send to &gt; Compressed (zipped) folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then upload the newly created compressed (zipped) folder to Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site and then provide a link here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Windows Live SkyDrive make sure the minidump files are in a "public folder" "shared with everyone":</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-click the folder with the minidump files &gt; Share &gt; Get a link &gt; Make Public</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then copy and paste the link here.</p>

            <p>OK, I see the link now, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minidump files showed DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION (133) stop errors referencing the tcpip.sys, NETIO.SYS and afd.sys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are Windows system files involved in "networking".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process that crashed in all but one of the crashes was uTorrent.exe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect a Trend Micro filter driver, such as a firewall driver,&nbsp;may be at issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you uninstall Trend Micro&nbsp;and see if the errors resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For security software consider using just the Windows 8 built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update KB3213986, KB3214628 &#38; KB890830 does not load windows upon restart</h2>
                    <p>I am running into an issue for the KB3213986, KB3214628 &amp; KB890830 update. </p>
<p>After the updates are ready for install, I select the "update &amp; restart" option. Afterwards it indicates it is preparing windows, and getting windows ready and eventually restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then the problem arises, it loads normally by showing acer logo &amp; circling dots below acer logo, but afterwards the screen turns black. Nohting is happening, doesnt indicate that it is installing windows update or whatsoever. Also unable to see the mouse.
 I have waited for an hour and decided to roll back to the last system restore point.</p>
<p>This has happened over 4 or 5 times. I am unable to boot into safe mode, even though it indicates "unable to install windows update, undoing changes", the same black screen will appear without mouse activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop Specifics:</p>
<p>Acer Aspire E5, Intel i5-4200U, AMD Radeon HD8750M</p>
<p>Windows 10 version 1607 (x64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea's what is causing this issue, and any suggestions on how to solve it?</p>
<p>Let me know if more detailed information is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

            <p>Dear Stephanie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, but unfortunately that did not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed/tried/done a few things;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When these 3 updates have been installed, Windows informs to restart to finalize the update. When I restart,
<strong>before</strong> shutting down, it displays "<em>Getting windows ready, do not turn off</em>" (or something similar). The % indicator will move
<p>
</p><p>2. Booting in safe mode, it does initiate Windows (Update), however it displays "<em>We couldnt complete the updates, undoing changes</em>" whereafter it restarts but
<strong>again/still </strong>goes into black screen like before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Like mentioning in my first post, my laptop starts normally by displaying the acer logo, but
<em>after</em> the logo it gets stuck. It seems like its within a gray area between the laptop startup and the windows (update) continuation. Where the windows update not automatically continues/initiates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. It is not a graphics card issue, card has been updated to the latest driver, and when I roll back via System Restore, it is working fine like usual.
</p>
<p>Even have connected by cable directly to my TV which had no effect as well, like it is not set to another display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now the only "work-around" is by using System Restore to an earlier restore point, and disabling the automatic update service by opening the run command (windows key + R), and typing: "<strong>net stop wuauserv</strong>".
<em>But this has to be done every single time the computer starts/wakes-up out of sleep.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, I have seen related issues to users who joined the "Insider Program" like me. How come that this is related?</p>
<p>Is there a possibility to manually initiate the continuation of these 3 windows updates via Command Prompt?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I forgot to mention that I have even tried to install said updates manually, by downloading the individual installer. Even that resulted in the same situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- During the black screen mode I have also connect my laptop by ethernet cable directly to the laptop, in case it is an internet connection issue. But again to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Also tried to run the update with antivirus uninstalled, and without any usb device (wireless mouse) connected, just the cable.. but still the same situation. Before restart windows update loads until 30%, then restarts, displays acer logo, and get the
 empty/black screen before any action from windows.</p>

<p>Unfortunately your suggestions both didnt work as well.</p>

    <title>How to add Notes to Photos&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blackpanfa  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to add Notes to Photos&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to "attach" text to my photos - to remember place names or other background on places in holiday photos for example. Can I do this with Windows Photo Gallery or other free software? I don't want to add text to photo images or be able to print the
 notes alongside the photos. (I'm quite interested in GIMP and PICASSA too but not sure of they have this functionality either - even if it sounds a pretty basic feature.)</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Doesn't really answer the question. As said the the question, I'm not looking to put text on top of photos: I want to attach a few sentences of notes.

    <title>First horizontal pixel line flickering on idle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corticoid  say:</h3>
<h2>            First horizontal pixel line flickering on idle</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>First I must say that I like my Surface Book very much. I would say it is the best piece of tech I ever bought :-)</p>
<p>But there's one small issue I am concerned about:</p>
<p>In idle times (does not depend on being docked or used as clipboard) when the book is not charging, the very upper horizontal line of pixels is flickering (changing its brightness very quickly). The rest of the screen is not affected, so it is no backlight
 problem. When I plug in the AC adapter or when I move the mouse, the flickering immediately stops.
</p>
<p>Could this be a driver issue (I just used the Intel graphics so far but got the i7 with nvidia dGPU) ? Memory clock? Power saving mode of the GPU (unfortunately, there is no driver Dashboard so I could deactivate this...).</p>
<p>Could you check, if your Surface Books got the same issue? You can see it best, when you open the mail app and move the window with its light blue edge (when activated/in foreground) to the upper edge of the screen (without maximizing the window!)...</p>

            <p>I've read about a lot of SB issues, but this is the first time that I've heard of this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try several things to troubleshoot it, the first of which is to ensure that ALL drivers are up-to-date, but you may be better served by simply returning the unit and getting a replacement.</p>

<p>As it only seems to occur under very specific circumstances, it may well be fixed by a driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try the very latest Intel drivers by manually installing them after downloading them directly from Intel to see if that makes any difference.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed this screen flickering on the top camera edge of the screen as well. It only happens when my surface book is running on battery. No idea why this is happening. I took my surface book into the MS store and had them look at it. They
 couldn't figure it out, so I wiped my surface book and reinstalled windows. That did not fix the issue. So I returned to the store, told them what was going on, and they exchanged my surface book for a new one. The new one does it as well. Exact same problem
 as described above. It is clear to me that this is not a hardware but a software problem. Has anyone found a fix for this? Please fix this soon MS, it is very annoying to be looking at a flickering screen in a dimly lit lecture theater.</p>

            <p>Hi Akheel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry if my question was not clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Bluetooth services are running just fine. &nbsp;I use my Microsoft Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, as well Bluetooth headsets and phone attachment. &nbsp;Bluetooth is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for information on the &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Bluetooth Security Tag</strong></span> &nbsp;feature in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to find information such as what are the compatible devices (i.e. what Bluetooth Security Tags will work with Windows 10) and software setup (i.e. where within Windows the Bluetooth Security Tag feature is controlled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows help does not have any references to Bluetooth Security Tag. &nbsp;The only evidence of its existence in on the lock screen shown as an option for authenticating to Windows. &nbsp;The Microsoft sites have little to no information on the topic aside from disabling
 the feature,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to use the Bluetooth Security Tag feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer me to some compatible products and configuration information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Monitor Resolution Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikekennedy51  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Monitor Resolution Issue</h2>
                    <p>So here it goes..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Hans G 28inch monitor hooked thru a HDMI cable. Everything has been running smoothly until one of my kids hit the reset button a few times in a row. Now windows has defaulted my monitor to a Generic Non-PNP monitor with a default native resolution
 of 1024*768. I have tried everything listed on all these forums and websites. Here's a list of what I have tried. **Note Hans-G is also considered Hanspree (they do not list or seem to support drivers for this monitor) and their website is extremely remedial
 and basic. No driver downloads on the website that I could see. My model is a HANS-G&nbsp; HH281HPB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixes that have failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Update monitor driver via device manager</p>
<p>-Uninstall/Restart monitor driver via device manager</p>
<p>-Uninstall Nvidia graphics card driver and components and re-install newest driver</p>
<p>-Uninstall Nvidia graphics card driver and reinstall via device manager (display adapter)</p>
<p>-Try to adjust resolution via Nvidia Geforce control center aka create custom resolution. Tried and was kicked back error that display doesnt support custom resolution</p>
<p>-Attempt to adjust resolution but entering into advanced display options in system settings. (Only options is 1024*768 and 800x600) Also note: there is no "recommended resolution or native resolution listed in that drop down menu.</p>
<p>-Go to device manager and and update driver. Says its up to date with a driver for generic non-pnp monitor from 2006. ???? 2006?? thats up to date?</p>
<p>- Use device manager to search for list of drivers on my computer. My monitor manufacturer is not listed. Also choosing the correct resolution from the "generic flat panel LCD displays does not fix issue"Also tried unchecking box for "show compatible hardware"</p>
<p>-restarting PC multiple times</p>
<p>-use a different HDMI cable</p>
<p>-roll back graphics card driver and display adapter drivers via device manager</p>
<p>-slamming head of of keyboard repeatedly LOL?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also one last thing... I also now do not get any audio thru the speakers of the monitor at all. Only my USB Logitech headset works. I have installed the windows 10 audio codecs from Realtek HD Audio from my motherboard manufactures website (ASROCK / 990FX
 Extreme 3 board) I have tried uninstalling audio devices in device manager and let windows reinstall drivers after restart. No audio.. Tried unplugging headset no audio. Made sure to enable SPEAKERS in sound control panel to default playback device recording
 device etc.. Nothing.. Checked boxes for exclusive mode control for the speakers nada..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only things I have not tried is to do a rollback to Windows 7 or a fresh reinstall of Windows 10 (which I already did once now due to a SDD issue). It seems pretty stupid I have to go thru all the trouble of reinstalling a complete OS just to get a correct
 resolution and audio to work. Cant you guys at windows just make a driver for Hanspree or Hans-G? The monitor was recognized by windows 7 and I never had these issues with such petty problems. I mean Windows 10 seems pretty legit but like what the hell is
 up with these compatibility issues. I am open to trying anything besides a fresh install, if I end up doing that Im moving back to Win7 and let this Win10 break itself in for a year or so.

</p><p>This is what I got when I did the fix for the resolution. Nvidia kicks back a error message saying that their newest driver (that I already have installed) is incompatible in the recommended Windows 8 compatibility mode. Here is the screenshot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the audio fixes did not work either. After installing the generic Windows high definition audio drivers it just defaults all sound to my USB headset. Reinstalling / "updating" drivers back to Realtek high definition also sends sound back to USB headset.
 When i mean defaults back I am talking about when I go to device manager and enable "Speakers" Realtek High Def to be the default device and then update or change drivers it automatically is switching from "Speakers" to "Logitech G35 USB Headest"</p>

            <p>Well Im not sure if you have had a chance to respond Preeti but I figured out a workaround without having to retry the update to drivers as you had suggested. I hope some people read this and use the "fix" as it worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for those users who own a Nvidia Graphics card and have the Nvidia Control Panel installed on your computer. I am sure there is some equivalent for AMD users thru Catalyst Control Center. Anyways I have my monitor now running at 1920x1200 resolution,
 the only downfall is that its made most of my taskbar icons pretty small, the ones on the desktop were small but I fixed that but right clicking &gt; View &gt; Medium (Large) icons, which ever you prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I did to get the monitor of that 1024x768 resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go into Nvidia Control Panel. Right click on the Nvidia Icon. (In your right hand side taskbar tray). Will have "Open Nvidia Geforce Experience" , "Open Nvidia Control Panel", "Check for updates" ETC... Click on the Nvidia Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. On the first page it loads up you will see a option to customize a user inputted resolution. Click it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Check the box for "Enable resolutions not exposed by the display" Then click "Create custom resolution"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Now in the create custom resolutions screen you will enter your monitors native resolution that you want. It will help to Google your model and get these specifications. For me I made sure that my monitor indeed supported 1920x1200 and I also wrote down
 the screen "refresh rate". In horizontal pixels you enter the first number of the resolution, in my case 1920. In Vertical Lines you enter the second number, again in my case it was 1200. Also make sure the screen refresh rate is correct, in my case it was
 60.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Now before you go any further please note I did this several times and it did not work, I kept getting a error message saying my monitor did not support the resolution I was putting into the fields here. Well the thing that changed it all was this box
 that says "Standard" under the "Timing" box. I have no idea what this is but I started messing around with choosing options and I selected "CVT" ... My screen then went blank after hitting the "Test" button at the bottom. When it came back after a brief 3-5
 second delay my resolution had noticeably changed and I did not receive the error message that I was previously recieved. Also I noticed that instead of "CTV" being selected it had defaulted to "Automatic". I am not sure if you can just select automatic from
 the get go or you have to select CTV but this is what worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. After selecting "Test" if everything went ok you should be at your preferred resolution. Exit out of all this BS and go to your dektop. Your icons will be most likely smaller than you would like, just refer to my first paragraph on how to fix that. Hope
 this "temporary fix" worked for you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Preeti - I am still not getting any audio thru my speakers can you please respond and help me get that going?? Ive updated drivers several times deleted several times and I still have no idea whats going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also am including a screen shot of my screen resolution for those who may need it.</p>

            <p>SBJenkins, Is your audio not working as well?? I still have the same issues from before the latest windows update that rolled out a few days ago. Downloaded it and installed it and still no difference..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - When am I and my fellow users going to stop being your post release "Beta" testers! Like common!! I am a very patient individual and I really could care less about all the programs included in Windows 10 that spy and data mine my activity but
 like give me my damn sound and resolution back for god sake. Stop letting your "customers" who paid good money for previous Windows installments continue to be the guinny pig here. Its 2015 here.. I should not have to scour the far reaches of the internet
 in vain to figure out why my resolution and sound issues are not going to be fixed until a Windows update from the "Gods on Olympus" say so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also FYI - I accidentally hit the "mark as answered" on this thread. It has not been answered, the suggested fixes have not worked. I also found a youtube video which suggested downloading and installing REALTEK AC97' drivers but Windows will not allow me
 to install it because it says I already have the latest installed.</p>

            To NVIDIA: same applies here for you. Paid almost 600.00 for my GTX680 MSI Lightning and this is the BS i get. Your certified WHQL drivers are more or less a first aid bandage on a gunshot wound. Get your **** together.

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sound is working fine, thank you for asking. I have a very basic sound setup on my computer as I use it mainly for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is badly impacting my productivity as I need a normal screen resolution to draft quality presentations which look good on a normal computer screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was fine a few weeks back, I don't understand how the problem could suddenly manifest itself, and NOTHING I do can set it right. I've wasted many many hours on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Microsoft would be kind enough to get back to us with a fix on this issue now it has been marked as unsolved as this is a serious issue causing both of us much frustration and their continued silence is insult to injury.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Sam</p>

            Are you a Nvidia user? I corrected my resolution (sort of) by using the Nvidia Control panel. If you want I can walk you thru what I did and maybe it will work for you..

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the offer. I'm using a <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Radeon Sapphire HD 7870. I'm sure I can do a similar work around following your previous post using Catalyst Control Center (Radeon's version of Nvidia Control Panel).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If I don't hear anything more from Microsoft on this I'll give it a try, but I think what we would both like best is for a response from the Microsoft team on this issue as I'm sure
 we both agree this is utterly unacceptable and though a work around might patch over the issue temporarily the underlying problem still needs to be addressed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have to start a new thread to draw their attention as they clearly aren't paying any to our discussion.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 64-bit, unresponsive mouse clicks, with system hang</h2>
                    <p><strong>My System:</strong> Toshiba 850 / i7 / 8 GB ram / 2 GB video card / 1 TB Hard Drive / Windows 8 64-bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Issue:</strong>&nbsp;Recently it has become beyond sluggish and unresponsive, most of the time double clicking of the mouse does nothing although it responsds to keyboard commands at random intervals. Most of the time the system just freezes or hangs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What I've tried so far:</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I did a disk check, and disk clean-up. </li><li>I updated my anti-virus and did a full system scan which revealed nothing. </li><li>I booted into safemode (the problem described above still persisted) and did another full system scan which revealed nothing.
</li><li>I did a system format and reset back to factory settings using windows. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem still persists. Any thoughts???</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 did not start correctly during Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 did not start correctly during Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was in the middle of updating Windows 10 1703 with the latest package and my machine asked for a restart.&nbsp; Upon restarting I got the screen that says "Your PC did not start correctly".&nbsp; Automatic Repair didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the Troubleshooting options has corrected this situation.&nbsp; I have a Recovery Key and would use it to re-install Windows, but my keyboard (and screen) only allow
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">numbers</span> as entries, not letters...&nbsp; I can't input the Recovery Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have access to the UEFI Firmware settings (and could change to a USB boot if I had one).&nbsp; I also have access to the Startup Settings (after entering my Bitlocker Key.&nbsp; Not sure what to do with that access though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a recovery USB, and it doesn't look like there's a restore point.</p>
<p>Should I make a Surface Pro 3 specific Recovery USB Drive on another machine -or- are there other things to try first?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to your concern, there could be an issue with the Creators update you've installed on your Surface. For us to isolate the main issue, we suggest that you use a USB recovery drive to fix your Surface Pro 3.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to download a recovery image for your device. Once you're done
 downloading a recovery image, refer to How to reset your Surface using your USB recovery drive on this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/storage-files-and-folders/create-a-recovery-drive?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Reminders:</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Your USB drive should be at least 16 GB.</li><li>All USB recovery drives must be formatted to FAT32 prior to loading a recovery image.</li><li>Creating a Surface recovery drive will erase everything that’s stored on your USB drive. Make sure to transfer any important data from your USB drive to another storage device before using it to create a recovery drive.</li><li>Surface USB recovery drives are not interchangeable between Surface models. Use only a USB recovery drive for your specific Surface model.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this help address your concern.<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for your advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a USB recovery drive on another win 10 machine, and copied the downloaded Surface Pro 3 files onto the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting with volume down got me to the Language and Keyboard screens and on to the Recover From a Drive screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected "Remove just my files" and it looked like it was working - progressed to 14% but then it returned to a blue screen that said "There was a problem recovering your PC".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I boot without the USB, I get the American Megatrends screen with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) decision.&nbsp; Whether TPM is enabled or disabled, I can't get it to recover - the recovery progresses to 14% (then briefly flashes 74%) and returns to the
 blue screen reporting that "There was a problem recovering your PC".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-created the USB recovery drive on a different Win 10 machine (that already had the Creators 1703 update) and this time I read the instructions more carefully and did NOT include the system files.&nbsp; I downloaded the SP3 specific zip file, and extracted
 and copied that to the USB drive and overwrote the duplicates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting the Surface Pro 3 this time, the installation is going smoothly.&nbsp; I got the American Megatrends page right at the start (and again a few minutes later) and both times entered Fn F12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully it will finish updating and will boot normally!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<h2>            Cannot redeem forza horizon 3 code</h2>
                    <p>I bought an Xb1 S bundle that came with Forza Horizon 3. I'm unable to redeem the code however. I get a very strange error that's a bunch of random characters. The error I am getting right now is OeBCHs0jHESP+IEU.33.9</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I was on Xbox support chat earlier trying some things and I was told it's from the Xbox preview program...go figure. I submitted a ticket to them but not sure how long it takes a response. Never had an issue like this before.&nbsp;Any thoughts??&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You need to be running Windows 10 1809 or later to access the Clipboard settings in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />If you have not already, please follow the steps to upgrade. 
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-computer-windows-10-creators-update-version-1703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-comput...</a>

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what Version No. of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />If that is lower than 1809, you will not have the clipboard app in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Microsoft have released version 1903 of Windows 10, click the link below, then click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1903 and bring your PC right up to date

            No error messages and when it is doing the not responding thing it is with ALL programs, the light comes on the tower and it just slows down to a crawl.&nbsp; Something is running in the background that brings everything else to a halt.&nbsp; When it did it several
 years ago, I was told to stop one program and I can not remember which.&nbsp; The only thing I have done new is the latest win downloads.&nbsp; If I turn off the computer and back on it will work for an hour or two then something starts running again..light back on
 steady, not flickering.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Thank you for the information. To end not responding application, we suggest using Task Manager to forcefully close it. To do so, you may check the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Crtrl + Alt + Delete</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Start Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Applications </strong>and then click the application that is not responding.</li><li>Click <strong>End Process</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>There are a of factor why having an unresponsive application(s), either it needs an update, corrupted or missing files, viruses and running multiple or many programs at the same time. To optimize your computer, we recommend checking and following the helpful
 tips on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15055/windows-7-optimize-windows-better-performance#optimize-windows-better-performance=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>LOL, Yes I know how to end the programs with task manager, I don't want to end them I want them to work and if I wait several minutes they will work, then go back to being NOT RESPONDING and since TASK MANAGER also tells me it is NOT responding it makes
 it HARD to close a program with it.&nbsp; I just need to find the program that is running in the background and SHUT IT DOWN.</p>

    <title>Classpnp.sys causes restart, and Win7 disc won&#39;t boot to install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Classpnp.sys causes restart, and Win7 disc won&#39;t boot to install screen</h2>
                    Okay, this one's a doozy.<br />
<br />
My computer has been doing annoying things for a while (most frustratingly, dropping back to the desktop from full-screen applications, for no apparent reason). I primarily use it for Steam games, but I also use it for Adobe CS 5.5 products (when I've got something
 besides code to do), so I snagged a little app called Bins to improve the taskbar. I bring this up because the last time I sucessfully started up, Bins had an update... and since it messes with the taskbar, I won't rule it out as a culprit.<br />
<br />
I had also uninstalled Daemon Tools, since I've not used it for months.<br />
<br />
Another potential problem is that I used msconfig to stop several startup programs (I don't see how these could be a problem but: Google Update, iTunes Helper, Hamachi, and Dropbox) that I wasn't using, and their associated services. I took care to only disable
 services that I could confirm were created by those pieces of software.<br />
<br />
_____________________________________<br />
<br />
So here's what happened:<br />
I initiated a shutdown on my way out the door to work, and when I got home, the tower was still running, with nothing on the monitor. After confirming no visible reaction to keyboard/mouse input, I held the power button to shut it off, then let it sit for a
 while and turned it back on. It got to the splash screen with the glowing Windows emblem, then sat there for about 15 minutes before I shut it off. In this time, I noticed that my G19 keyboard screen turned on (it's normally off until Explorer loads) and my
 Xbox360 controller lit up the Player1 light (again, something that usually doesn't happen until Explorer loads). Both of these happened within the first two minutes.<br />
<br />
I retried, and it did the same thing, so I tried again, using F8 to switch to Safe Mode. At this point, I was able to see that it would hang up after loading AtiPcie.sys, so (following the advice of several places online) I used my Ubuntu LiveUSB to append
 a ".old" to the filename. Upon rebooting in safe mode again, I found a new hang occurred at Classpnp.sys<br />
<br />
Doing more internet searching led to two common solutions -- do a repair installation from the Windows 7 disc (thankfully, I still have the original OEM disc I used in the first place) or get a replacement copy of Classpnp.sys from another computer (my parents'
 tower also runs 64-bit Home Premium, so I figured I'd toss a copy of theirs on a flash drive just in case).<br />
<br />
I tried booting to the Win7 disc, to no avail. The progress bar for loading the setup files (I forget the exact string) completes, and then the Windows 7 splash screen comes up, followed by a black screen with the cursor visible... which does not change.<br />
So I booted into Ubuntu again and copied over my parents' Classpnp.sys and I'm still in exactly the same spot. Safe Mode hangs on Classpnp.sys (and sometimes it causes a flash of blue screen followed by immediate reboot, if it sits long enough), normal boot
 hangs on the Splash screen, and booting from the Win7 disc hangs on a black screen after the Splash.<br />
<br />
I should clarify that I /did/ try the "last known good configuration" option from the F8 menu, but that didn't work.<br />
<br />
The tower is homebuilt (and I've had it, with the same hardware and my current Windows installation, for about two years, so it's definitely worked fine in the past). I've got an AMD Athlon II X4 640 Processor (3.0GHz), MSI mobo (can't remember the model),
 12GB DDR3 RAM, with two Nvidia 9800GTs running SLI with a bridge out of the PCIe slots.<br />

<br />
The Windows installation DVD and the Windows Repair CD will boot the machine regardless of what is on the hard disk. If you do not see the first screen described by Vaseem then you have one of the following problems:<br />
<ul>
<li>Flawed installation DVD</li><li>Flawed DVD drive</li><li>Some other hardware problem</li></ul>
<br />
I would try a few combinations and permutations, e.g. test your installation DVD on a different machine, boot the machine with a Windows Repair CD (which you have tested on a different machine), see what happens when you disconnect the hard disk.<br />

    <title>DVD drive has been disabled on PC and laptop by Win 10 upgrades - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davehutton  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD drive has been disabled on PC and laptop by Win 10 upgrades</h2>
                    <p>I've seen previous threads on this which you've now locked, but they don't provide answers.</p>
<p>Both my laptop and PC have lost their DVD drives following Win 10 updates.</p>
<p>Both used to work fine, but now when I put a DVD in the tray, it says please insert DVD and when I click it, it opens the DVD tray, even though a proprietary DVD is in the hole.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried disabling the drive in device management. I've tried updating drivers, both in Win 10 and using Drive Easy. I've seen threads that suggest I use a third party product (what an indictment on you guys...), like VLC, and tried it, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't fob me off with an 'off the shelf' answer, this is a problem that has occurred as far as I can see entirely because of Win 10 updates. AND, don't forget, in two different machines. I don't think the problem's mine, chaps, so please don't ask
 me to 'correct' settings, or blame my hardware.....etc.</p>

<p>Hi Dave. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your
 problems. <br />
<br />
First try the steps here: <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-drive-not-working-missing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-dri...</a><br />
<br />
Did the DVD drive work in that PC before? If so this might have been caused by Windows Update. Did you receive Windows Updates recently? Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Update History. You can try uninstalling any affecting Updates
 there. <br />
<br />
You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened: <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a></p>
<p><br />
If this was caused by October Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:&nbsp;
 http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if the problem returns with the Update reinstalling and if so uninstall it and block it using the Hide Updates tool:
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p><p>To attempt to repair this, go to Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button. Under DVD Device, click on Driver tab, first try Update Driver &gt; Automatically. If that fails see if Roll Back is available. If not choose Uninstall, restart PC to
 reinstall the driver. <br />
<br />
Next right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down to find the DVD drive. Does it have a drive letter? If not right click to issue a drive letter so it shows up in File Explorer, save and exit.
<br />
<br />
Run Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot <br />
<br />
If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a><br />
<br />
FYI there is no DVD player in Windows 10, they want you to buy one from the store. There are better free options here:
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a><br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<p>Thank you so much for taking the trouble to reply so comprehensively. I'm afraid I didn't go through all your suggestions, but took the 'easy' option and installed a new DVD drive, which is working fine, at the moment at least.
</p>
<p>It is strange that my laptop was, and still, is similarly affected, so I'm still not sure whether it is hardware or Win 10. I can manage with one DVD working for a while.</p>
