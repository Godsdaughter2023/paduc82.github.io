    <title>Band tile orientation and font size - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Band tile orientation and font size</h2>
                    <p>The Microsoft Band is great, although I'm not sure about the heart rate calibration.&nbsp; When running, it would be very helpful if the tiles and activity display could run down the length of the Band ('portrait' rather then 'landscape', so to speak)&nbsp;so it s
 easier to read.&nbsp; In addition, when running, especially in the rain, the letters and numbers are a bit small, and so, if you&nbsp; are checking your heart rate during the run in interval training for instance, I some times have to stop to focus on the small numbers
 on the display.&nbsp; I can't run in my reading glasses!</p>
<p>Just an idea that would make a very good product even more customer friendly.</p>

            <p>Hi Brooke,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite clear on this, but are you saying that when you installed MSE and ran the first few scans (quick scans and full scans), you discovered infections?&nbsp; If so, that suggests MSE was installed on a computer that was already infected and if so, this
 alone could be the cause of your troubles.&nbsp; For further information on this, see:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/can-i-install-mse-to-clean-up-my-already-infected/87058857-d181-4019-a723-efd9a49d9275">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/can-i-install-mse-to-clean-up-my-already-infected/87058857-d181-4019-a723-efd9a49d9275</a>&nbsp;(but note that the availability of free MS support is more limited than back then and you should ignore
 that part and instead see what follows).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides general maintenance (covered well by Doc in the prior post and in greater detail as a P.S. below), this could be caused by an incorrect installation, corrupt files, some type of conflict with other software that either exists or once existed but
 wasn't properly removed, some type of infection still existing, or several other factors).&nbsp; We can either start with the general maintenance tasks or a proper troubleshooting of MSE.&nbsp; I'm going to start with the troubleshooting, but you may choose whichever
 you wish to begin trying to seek out and resolving the cause or causes (there may be several).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:
<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:
</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>. THIS IS A KEY STEP TO RESOLVING THE PROBLEM. RUN APPREMOVER EVEN IF YOU'RE SURE (one "sure" person was finally convinced
 to do it and found THREE AV programs on her computer she didn't even know existed - and yes, you installed it before so that shouldn't happen, but for some reason V4 seems to be more sensitive to that than prior versions and finds things that others let slip
 by).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Download, install and run Secunia PSI <a href="http://secunia.com/products/consumer/PSI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>http://secunia.com/products/consumer/PSI/</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and then update or remove&nbsp;any programs that show as being end-of-life or not updated.&nbsp; This too could take time depending on how many programs you have installed.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To uninstall MSE (since you tried so we must remove that attempt), proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</span></a><span>
 or try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a><span> If you have some problem with uninstalling the prior version, you may need to focus more on the manual procedures
 in the first link or the second link with the Mr Fixit in aggressive mode AND manual procedures to be sure it is completely removed. THIS IS A CRUCIAL STEP AND MAY BE THE KEY TO THE PROBLEM. BE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE STANDARD UNINSTALLATION WITH THE MANUAL
 PROCEDURES.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, disable System Restore and then re-enable it to clear restore points from which this problem may be coming. When finished and everything is fine and the problem is fixed, create a new restore point so you'll have one if needed and it will eventually
 repopulate to the maximum you have allocated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Delete and remove all versions of Java on your system and then download and install the most current applicable version from
<a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.java.com</a>. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Delete the Java cache: <a href="http://java.com/en/download/help/cache_virus.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://java.com/en/download/help/cache_virus.xml</a>. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Use Disk Cleanup to remove all temporary internet files and all Windows temporary files (and anything else you feel comfortable cleaning up in the process). Then, to be sure, download and use Old Timer TFC to truly get rid of all temporary files:
<a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/files/file/187-tfc-temp-file-cleaner-by-oldtimer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/files/file/187-tfc-temp-file-cleaner-by-oldtimer/</a>.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Reboot and empty the Recycle Bin.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then update and run a full scan with the updated MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Even if MSE comes up clean, to be more sure, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> and SuperAntiSpyware:
<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://superantispyware.com/</a> and Spybot Search and Destroy:
<a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html</a>.&nbsp;<span> </span>Then run a full ESET online scan:
<a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. I'd also try Microsoft Safety Scanner:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a> and TDSSKiller: <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684</a>. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try Windows Defender Offline to see if it helps. The best instructions are this tutorial:
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html</a> </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing some infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Since we don't know what we're dealing with here as you haven't provided a specific name like "Trojan:JS/BlacoleRef.AW" as opposed to "something about java exploit," it's sort of like needing to use a minigun instead of a sniper rifle to resolve things.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - <a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</a> and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (<a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.answerdesk.com/</a>)
 in the US at this time. After an initial free consultation, a fee will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: <a href="http://Support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://Support.microsoft.com/security</a> and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you find that too costly, some free malware-removal forums (which take much longer - both to get someone to respond and then to go back and forth working the problem, are forum-based, depend a great deal on the "luck of the draw" concerning who
 gets assigned to your case, and are not guaranteed, and often do not include repairs to damage but just removal of the infection -but your symtoms seem more like a redirect infection than damage to me, but I've seen them help a lot and I've seen them not help
 much at all - and suspect it has more to do with the person assigned than with the sites themselves) include:</span></p>

<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If that doesn't work, the preferred support path is via this entry point:</p>

<p><span>If you choose assisted support, you will be given the choices available for your region. Further MSE assisted support in the US and Canada is no longer available. It *<strong>is</strong>* still available in many other regions of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps. If other support is not available to you, post back with as much information as possible about what happened at every step along the way and how you are trying to do this and we'll see if we can figure it out.</span></p>

<p><span>Kosh</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here's my little blurb on improving space and speed in Vista or Windows 7 systems – and some can apply to XP as well but the reference articles and procedures will be different but you should be able to either figure out how to do what is suggested
 on XP or search Bing for an article which addresses that topic for XP or an equivalent program that works with XP (and it also suggests other things of value that you can consider or ignore - the choice is entirely yours). All of this is your choice, actually
 - I'm just presenting some options that may help and that have helped many others (and that I pretty much use myself though sometimes I do procrastinate I'm sad to admit and there are some things I won't do no matter how beneficial - for example, I refuse
 to delete my cookies (but that's a personal choice as I prefer the benefits of having them when going to previously-visited web sites over the limited amount of space recovered and speed gained given their small size)). Much of this should be part of normal
 maintenance, but that includes some other things (like creating periodic system restore points - probably at least weekly as they don't necessarily improve speed, space or performance and may in fact even do the opposite in some cases) not addressed here.
 Even if some is noted to be done monthly, please consider everything suggested as something to do now so we can do as much as we can to improve things immediately if any of this might be the cause.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system. There are ways to handle this (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course
 the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at
 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM (well, almost 4GB, more like 3.5 actually) and the 64-bit version can use even more). If space
 is the issue, replace your hard drive with a larger one, add a second hard drive (if it is a desktop system), or add an external hard drive. Those are hardware answers (which cost money). We'll now discuss software solutions (which are mostly if not entirely
 free - at least the options presented here - there are 3rd party programs that provide additional options but they really aren't necessary)..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster or Enhancer, or Repairer or Fixer software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you have thousands of errors just to get you to
 download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause). Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean
 install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise). Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To improve your speed and space, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</span></a><span> in Vista or
</span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/818-disk-cleanup-open-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Disk Cleanup - Open and Use - Windows 7 Forums</span></a><span> in Windows 7. Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will
 harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files. If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then
 that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also do an Optimization: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></a><span>
 in Vista or </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Optimize-Windows-7-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Optimize Windows 7 for better performance</span></a><span> in Windows 7. Do all of the options (or at the very least, consider
 them - many can help a great deal).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>At least once every month or so, run CCleaner </span><a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.piriform.com/</span></a><span> with as many options as you choose to delete (but be
<b>careful</b> because this program if not used properly and with caution and with you paying attention to what you are doing can delete important and even critical files that could cause a great deal of trouble). Uncheck anything in the Registry section and
 in the Application Section, uncheck Microsoft Antimalware.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clearing out your temporary files can also save you much space and improve performance and while some of the above will clear a lot of the temp files, they won't cover them all. This will. I recommend running it every month or two. It is TFC by Old
 Timer </span><a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/TFC-Temp-File-Cleaner-OldTimer-file187.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TFC - Temp File Cleaner by OldTimer - Geeks to Go Forums</span></a><span> and you should download and save it to your desktop. When run,
 it will close everything else, so be sure to save anything you're working on and basically close all your programs. If it asks (and when done even if it doesn't ask), reboot to complete the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced. It's a trade-off. The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points you will be able to retain -but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough
 to save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them). Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html</span></a><span> in Vista or
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/5482/make-system-restore-use-less-space-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/5482/make-system-restore-use-less-space-in-windows-7/</span></a><span> in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears. Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup. That will probably be the majority of items there
 - if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient). This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup). When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary,
 I noticed startup was quicker, response times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster. Better still, download Autoruns

 was suggested above (though here you <b>can’t</b> delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which

<h2>            None of the authentication methods supported by this client are supported by your server.</h2>
                    
<p>This is more for information than a question as the question has been asked many times. The authentication error "<span>None of the authentication methods supported by this client are supported by your server." was received
 no matter how the authentication settings were set. This was a standard POP3 type setup with no secure password and the smtp server authentication set to use incoming server.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution I finally found was that there was a folder that had been moved to the outbox that should have been in a completed project folder. Removal of the folder from outbox cured the authentication problem. I believe
 outlook 2010 was trying to do an imap type sync of the misplaced folder even though the settings were for a pop account. This is just on more thing to check when none of the common fixes work for this error. Hope this helps someone.</span></p>

<h2>            Cannot update tasks in Microsoft Planner</h2>
                    <p>Love the new functionality. Was able to create a task, but whenever I try to add items to the checklist, assign a team member or add a color label, I receive an error Message.&nbsp; Regardless of what I am trying to update, I receive this error
<em><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">"We couldn't update "task name". Please try again later."&nbsp;
</span></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Does anyone know why?</span><br />

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>TBinIT</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the screenshot, it seems that you are using an integration of Planner in SharePoint Site(In a SharePoint site, click New&gt;Plan). If so, could you please share the detailed repro steps?
 For example, the error message pops up after you open the task&gt;edit task name/add checklist/click the color label&gt;click the X icon in the right top corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, could you please share the following information with us?</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Please test in another browser in InPrivate windows
 to see the outcome.</span></li><li><span>Does this behavior occur with other plan?</span></li><li><span>Please open Microsoft Planner, find the affected plan and test whether it can be edited there.</span></li><li><span>Please confirm whether this behavior occurs with other users who has the same permission as you.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Zixuan</p>

<p>Thank you for the prompt response.&nbsp; Yes, this is within a SharePoint Site. I selected "New"&gt;Plan" which brings me to the "Task Board". I enter the title for a task in the dialog box and select "Add Task".&nbsp; That creates my task.&nbsp; Then if I click on the Task
 Title, it opens a dialog box where I can enter more details.&nbsp; If I select a member like myself in the "Assign" section, I receive that error.&nbsp; If I enter text in the "Checklist" section and hit enter, the text disappears as if it never existed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Please test in another browser in InPrivate windows to see the outcome.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Same challenges in IE and Chrome both InPrivate browsing or not.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Does this behavior occur with other plan?</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Yes</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Please open Microsoft Planner, find the affected plan and test whether it can be edited there.</span>

<li>That worked. I was able to pull up the plan, assign it to a member, label it and create items in the Checklist.</li></ul>

<h2>            Can&#39;t use Cortana to open groove anymore</h2>
                    <p>So I'm not sure if I'm in the right thread, Im on 1709 through the insider program, but then opted out, but on the RTM version for the newest creator update going live in a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is I used to be able to just tell cortana to play a artist and it would open groove, now every time it just prompts to install iheart radio, does this have anything to do with Microsoft killing off groove? Or is it just a bug in the newest build,
 since I still plan to use groove for my personal music library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(update)</p>
<p>I just tried telling cortana to open groove and play the artist and got this<br />

            As you know, Groove is being retired at the end of the year so I suspect that MSFT has changed its status in new installations of FCU (as well as updates to it).&nbsp; They just got a little ahead of themselves in how they are handling it.

            the following is the only thing you can do:<br />
<br />
1-Disconnect the Nokia device from the PC's USB cable and remove the device's battery for 5 seconds.<br />
2-Re-insert the battery then press and hold the device power button for 1 second.<br />
3-Re-connect the Nokia device to the PC's USB cable and wait for 10 seconds.<br />
4-Try the Nokia Software Updater again<br />
If there is no response from your Nokia device, try to recover the device by formatting it:<br />
<br />
Press and hold the following device keys: 3, green and *<br />
Press the device power button for 1 second<br />
Continue to hold down 3, green and * until you hear the device start-up tone.<br />
If there is still no response:<br />
<br />
Take the Nokia device to your nearest Nokia Care point. If the device is within its warranty period, Nokia will repair the device under the usual warranty terms and conditions.<br />
Note: If the Nokia device is not within its warranty period, Nokia is not liable for any loss as defined within the End-User Software Agreement

            I just had the same problem. My phone is about 1 and a half years old, so no warranty covering my problems. I have tried to update its sofware using the Nokia Software Updater, about 15 minutes to finish it it asked me to remove the battery, what I did,
 and now I have this dead phone. I have called Nokia Customer Service, and have been informed that I should bring the phone to a Nokia Care Center, which does not exist in my city, and pay for the repair. It's ridiculous: even though there might be a clause
 stating that Nokia is not responsible for the data loss, it is responsible for the software it makes available in its website!<br />
Now my phone can't be turned on, I cannot take it to any Nokia Care Center, as there is none in São Paulo (where I work) or Ribeirão Pires (where I live), and Nokia just says it's my problem... maybe it's a "Nokia 'I don't care'" strategy...

            Unfortunately this sounds all to familiar.<br />
I was performing the exact same task, reinstalling the operating system because one of the web browsers on the phone had stopped working. After several attempts to attach the phone via USB to PC Suite (yes, I also got problems connecting as has been mentioned
 in other forums, but kept disconnecting and reconnecting till eventually some drivers were recognised and installed), I backed up the phone content and proceeded through the GUI to reinstall the firmware, all looked ok until the '15 minutes left to install'
 bar came up (sound familiar!!??), and then the phone disconnected from the PC and that was that.<br />
I followed the instructions to recover but to no avail. Now it says somewhere that the application restarts your phone to carry out the task and not to worry. This however switched it off and exhaled it's last.<br />
Surely an application cannot be released to the public if there is a possibility it would render your phone useless?<br />
This is rediculous. S<br />
houldn't there be some way of reinstalling the backup version if all goes awry like in our case, and shouldn't there be some liability from Nokia for breaking our phones using a very flakey product!!??<br />
Does anyone know if it's possible to breathe life back into the phone once the OS has been completely wiped?<br />
<br />
Cheers

<h2>            Problems with large sd card</h2>
                    I purchased a Lumia 535 and installed a 128gb sd card after I had put about 6gb of music on the card anything I added after that disappeared was marked as other music &amp; photos thought I had a dodgy card so purchased a 64gb card but again the same happened
 all music files were mp3 and correctly tagged had the phone back to suppliers a few times it was sent for repair fault found but when I added my music same problem, took it back and demanded a replacement phone but when I put the sd card in and added music
 the same occurred with both cards I currently have the 64gb card installed with 6gb of music on it and can add no more as anything I add disappears plus when I turn the phone off and then turn it on the sd card has faults the phone scans the card but the faults
 are&nbsp;unrecoverable change card my music disappears&nbsp;but if you leave it an hour it comes back ?????&nbsp; think these phones have a problem reading large sd cards thinking of trying a 32gb card but am I wasting my

            Many thanks for the reply but I have formatted the cards exfat I have tried everything I can think of 2 sd cards of different size &amp; make,&nbsp;two phones, correct format all files correctly tagged. I am just baffled as to what is happening I think I might
 try another sd card I just might have been unlucky and got 2 bad ones.&nbsp;

            <p>Ok I accept that 32Gb works fine however that is only 25% of the full capacity or 4 cards being used (3 being carried around loss?) if you have over 100Gb of media stored )
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add to that 32Gb is formatted fat32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be case that working cards are not complained about, but I see more problems with 64Gb cards and above than lower capacity.</p>

    <title>HP G7 Notebook Windows 8 WiFi Connection Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blackemmons  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP G7 Notebook Windows 8 WiFi Connection Issues</h2>
                    My HP g7-1310us Windows 8&nbsp;has wifi connection issues.&nbsp; Such as:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- My F12(wifi) button no longer works.&nbsp; I use to be able to hit F12 to disconnect and it would turn orange.&nbsp; Now it just stays white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp; The big issue is and may be related, I keep dropping my internet connection and web page displays "This page can not be displayed".&nbsp;&nbsp;My connection shows&nbsp;that I am connected.&nbsp; If I go disconnect and the connect(Win 8) every thing is just fine for a few
 minutes then I have to do the disconnect/connect thing again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have all my updates from Windows and HP.&nbsp; I even think that maybe that is when the issue start.&nbsp; About the time I updated from HP, but not for sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My router is a Netgear N600/WNDR3400.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please use the KISS theory when responding to this old man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>First thing, check to see if you have any "optional" Windows updates waiting, and if you do, go ahead and install them.&nbsp; There is one particular optional update that fixes a number of small connection issues.&nbsp; Windows will automatically install the "important"
 updates, but you have to elect to install the Optional ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Key + X</p>
<p>System</p>
<p>Windows Update (bottom of page on left)</p>
<p>Check for Updates </p>
<p>Click on the blue text in the box (if it says there is an optional update)..then check it and click "install"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next..........</p>
<p>If the network status button on your laptop is white (on), it means that the network is still connected, but it may not be giving you a strong enough connection;&nbsp; you may need to connect to&nbsp;one with a wider range (more bars).&nbsp; First you may want to try troubleshooting
 your wireless connection, and if that doesn't help, try setting up a new (stronger)connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--On the Desktop, hover your mouse over the network status icon (bottom right corner of the taskbar)&nbsp;and see if it identifies your network. (While you're there also have a look at your battery level to the left).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c047e3c-c21e-4a6f-a1f2-42835ce3642d" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-- Right-click the&nbsp;status icon&nbsp; and select "Troubleshoot Problems" (to run&nbsp;the troubleshooter).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9cb0202-7d45-494f-8f7d-b5717597af7d" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&nbsp;If that doesn't fix it, right-click the&nbsp;icon&nbsp;(again) and select "Open Network and Sharing Center"</p>
<p>-- Select "Set up a new connection"&nbsp; A list of options is displayed, allowing you to search for and
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connect to a different&nbsp;wireless network.</p>

            <p>Updating your computer's BIOS was a very&nbsp;important change and should not have caused any of the difficulties you are experiencing, in fact, it should improve your computer's performance..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;BIOS stands for Basic Input/output System.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is the program on your computer that makes sure all of&nbsp;the other&nbsp;components--from your Windows operating system to your central processing unit (CPU) to your RAM and everything in between all function together
 as one unit.&nbsp; The BIOS&nbsp;originally installed on&nbsp;your computer was probably "overcome by events" as Windows 8 changed over the past year, and it needed to&nbsp;be brought up to speed, so that's a good thing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the changes HP made in&nbsp;an update was that the wireless button remains white (on) and does not toggle to off (yellow) as it did before.&nbsp; When it turns yellow, it means that you have lost your wireless connection altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you toggle&nbsp;f12 now,
 you will be switching "Airplane Mode" on/off.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Airplane mode allows your laptop to operate without interfering with air traffic control when you are flying.&nbsp; By turning it on, you disable your laptop from sending/receiving wireless signals.&nbsp; So, be sure you have it turned OFF).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two things I might suggest you try............</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;turn off your computer, unplug your router, and unplug your modem.&nbsp; Wait for about 2 minutes, then turn them back on in this order....modem, router, computer, waiting until each one "initializes" before going to the next one. (this is merely synchronizing
 the three devices and resetting everything).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Restore Internet Explorer advanced settings and reset Internet Explorer's defaults.&nbsp; To do this....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Internet Explorer on the Desktop</p>
<p>Select "Tools" from the menu bar</p>
<p>Select "Internet Options"</p>
<p>Select "Advanced" (tab on top)</p>
<p>Click the button "Restore Advanced Settings"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Click the button "Reset"&nbsp; (you don't have to check the "personal settings" box)</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>restart your computer</strong> for these changes to take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more thing you should do, if you have not already done so, is to go back into HP Support Assistant and check for more HP updates.&nbsp; Windows just sent out a bunch of updates this Tuesday, and HP may have to keep pace with those.&nbsp; You are probably set to
 receive them automatically, but check for them now to get current.</p>
<p>If you have an anti-virus program,such as Mcafee, Norton, etc, also check for updates in your AV program.</p>

<h2>            Voice Recorder Problems Nokia Asha 301</h2>
                    
<p>Hi There</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have several of these phones in our business and we are finding that if you make a voice recording intermittently the recordings are silent.&nbsp; So they look as if they are there, have a file size and the play button moves along but no sound comes out however
 you can make another recording and it is fine.&nbsp; We have tested this quite extensively on several of these phones but can't figure out what is causing the issue.&nbsp; It does look as if the problem becomes worse if the recordings are over a minute but there is
 still no real consistency.&nbsp; Has anyone else come across this please?</p>

<h2>            Deleted items IMAP Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I see many posters who have the problem of being unable to delete emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is the opposite. When I delete an email, it just vanishes. Trash folder remains empty. Sometimes - not often - I need to retrieve a deleted email or at least review it one more time. But they just go poof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are they going?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first upgraded to Outlook 2016, deleted mails were going to the trash folder but no longer.</p>

            <p>It seems you have missed my point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is the opposite of the problem of that post, which I had read IN DETAIL before posting. That poster cannot delete mails - winding up with one in the inbox and 10 in the trash folder, with repeated attempts to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My emails delete just fine. Click delete and poof - gone! The problem is <em>where do they go?
</em></p>
<p>They are not in the trash folder. They are not in the inbox. They are nowhere to be found in Outlook 2016.</p>

            Hi RichardFavara
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Most likely you are using a different ID to login. You need to use your Skype ID not mail ID to login to Skype. Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID seems to have been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. Your old Skype ID is also preserved. So you can use either old Skype ID to login (to get into your old account) or Microsoft Account to login.
<br />
<br />If you want - You can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your new account

<h2>            Dopod 838 pro HELP&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, I just recently bought a 838pro. Having abit of problem adjusting to my 1st PDA phone. I read about changing the alarm ringtone and i have done what is said on the forum but it doesnt work for me.I copied and paste in the documents folder, tried application/sounds,tried
 storage card.Do i have to soft start it or....?any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And how to get the alarms to keep running instead of just ringing once.The 'repeat sound' function does not go continously, it is intermittent.As for the reminder alarms, can i specify a diff alarm for each individual task instead of using the
 same ringtone for all the reminders?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, i am getting a navi map for my 838, I have read that Destinator 6 is good and recommended by the Dopod staff. Anyone got any experience with that?

<p>I'll try to dea with some of your questions in different replies (hopefully it will make it easier for you (and me))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ringtone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the sound of an old phone ringing and years ago I had a device that had that ringtone.&nbsp; The new devices I have do not have or use that tone so I have copied it and have it saved to add to each device I get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, so you have&nbsp;the ringtone you want to use.&nbsp; What I do is copy the file and place it in the windows directory of my Pocket PC.&nbsp; That is it!&nbsp; Now I open the Sounds, go to Phone and select "OldPhone" which now appears in the drop down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try it, let me know if that works for you.</p>

<p>Shut Down Running Program:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>START/SETTINGS/System Tab/Memory Icon/ Running Programs Tab</p>
<p>Pick what you want to do.&nbsp; Turn off individual programs or stop all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another choice is to run a FREE program called Magic Button.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<li>It is free. </li><li>Does not take up any of your screen real estate, yet easy to access. </li><li>Located on title bar but does not cover any standard info, i.e. Sound icon, notification icon.
</li><li>Very small foot print (memory usage). Only 80 KB executable file does it all (help file is 8 KB extra).
</li><li>Makes close button really close applications. Just in case you haven't noticed, the default one only minimizes them.
</li><li>Compatible with latest and greatest Windows Mobile 6.0 (new in version 2.1).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get it here: <a href="http://download.com/i/dl/dl-bta.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Magic Button Download</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A different choice and my prefered method is to use a program from Spb Software house called
<a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/products/pocketplus/?en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Spb Pocket Plus</a></p>
<p>It is a terrific program and one that I cannot live without on my device</p>

 with other mail exchanges its been our e-mails flagging as spam but all we send is customer invoices out with the PDF attached after they have ordered from us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In most cases its fixed with an e-mail sent to the relevant party but I can't find the one for hotmail.<br />
<br />
Coincidentally haven't had this issue at all with any @Outlook addresses, or at least no orders have come from someone with an @Outlook address to verify this with.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Where do I go/Who do I contact to get this resolved as it's obviously a bit of a problem for some of our customers not being able to get their invoices by e-mail.</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>To look into the issue, can you please confirm the following information?</p>

<p>2. Does the issue occur to other Hotmail users or just some specific ones?</p>
<p>3. Where did you purchase the Office 365 subscription , from our official website or resellers/partners?</p>
<p>4. Please send us the complete NDR (non-delivery report) for analysis.</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>Thanks for your detailed information.</p>
<p>To better understand the issue, we need to confirm the following:<br />
1. Where do you send the mail, from Outlook or the third party? If it is the third party, what kind of third party products are you using?<br />
2. Could you try OWA to see if the mail can be sent to Hotmail successfully?<br />
3. According to the NDR(Not delivery report) you provide, the last hop of mail is still in the Office 365 tenant. So we need your admin to run “Message Trace” and send us the screenshot of the result.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience and time.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Wenxi</p>

<p>1. Our invoices are sent out by a third party central system that processes orders from all sales channels (website, Amazon, ebay, rakuten etc etc) this program is called Linnworks.
</p>
<p>2. Assuming I'm doing this right, when I try to enter <a href="https://mail.abtoolsonline.com/exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mail.abtoolsonline.com/exchange</a> or <a href="https://mail.abtoolsonline.net/exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mail.abtoolsonline.net/exchange</a> I'm getting a DNS error.</p>
<p>3. I'll send across the screenshot of the message trace.</p>

<p>hi kevin,</p>
<p>according to the message trace you provided, the mail was sent out of office 365. to narrow down the issue, i have performed a test. i used my office 365 account to send a mail to the hotmail address you provide and also got an ndr and the error “550 requested
 action not taken: mailbox unavailable”, but i could send mails to other hotmail accounts. besides that, i ran the tool of rca(remote connectivity analyzer) and got the same error as the screenshot shows below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9181320-7829-4f2b-91d0-96dd4f129901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9181320-7829-4f2b-91d0-96dd4f129901" /></a><br />
<br />
since the issue occurs on the hotmail account based on the message above, i suggest you confirm with the hotmail user if the email address is correct or he/she has set any allow/block list.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
wenxi</p>

<p>Well as a possible progression - or perhaps a different issue entirely - we've started getting Hotmail messages bounced back with a 5.7.1 message stating part of our ISP's network is on the block list. I presume this means I'll need to chase up our ISP directly
 (in this case BT).</p>
<p>This is the error message: COL004-MC3F5.hotmail.com gave this error:</p>
<p>SC-001 (COL004-MC3F5) Unfortunately, messages from (IP removed, can send in private message if needed) weren't sent. Please contact your Internet service provider since part of their network is on our block list.</p>
