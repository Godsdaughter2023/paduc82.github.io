<h2>            Windows phone will not open a one-note file stored on my skydrive.</h2>
                    I have synced my OneNote notebook to skydrive. &nbsp;(I had to convert it to the new format first, it was originally in 2007) When I find it on skydrive on my Windows phone and try to open it I get the message "Destination not found. OneNote can't open this."
<div>Suggestions?</div>

            <p>Not quite sure why you are having this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might try saving it again to your desktop in the correct format (Office 2010 or higher) then close Office on your PC.&nbsp; Now click on the file from your desktop just to make sure it opens and as long as it does save it to SkyDrive again (use a different
 name)&nbsp;then see if you can open it from SkyDrive with your device. </p>

            <p>Hi Imanat,<br />
<br />
The empty sub-folders will not be downloaded if we click the <strong>Download</strong> button in the OneDrive web portal. You can use the OneDrive sync client to sync your folders to your local drive, in this way, the empty foldes can be synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For personal OneDrive, you can download the sync client <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. <br />
For OneDrive for Business, follow the steps in the <strong>Test the feature before you enable it for your organization</strong> section in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-users-to-sync-SharePoint-files-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-22e1f635-fb89-49e0-a176-edab26f69614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> to set it up.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            How to &#34;downgrade&#34; skype to a previous version</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agreed to try a new version of skype when offered with the latest upgrade of Windows 10. I remember seeing a note that it was possible to go back to the version I had before if I did not like the new version. I have had the new version for 24 hours or
 so, and I do not like it. It gave me features I do not need and took away features I do need. How do I get back the previous version? I miss the oportunity to see if some of my contacts are online or not and not just see if they have posted anything recently.
 The version I did not like is: 12.8.487.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it the version&nbsp;Skype-8.10.0.9.exe I should use to get what I want? If so, is it ok to just install it on top of the version I have now? I do not want to loose the desktop integration with my microsoft account, so I am afraid to just uninstall the whole
 thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You don't need to do anything with the new Microsoft Skype for Windows 10 App (Skype UWP). The only what is required to close this app is sign out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34668/how-do-i-sign-in-to-skype-for-windows-10</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you have signed out of Skype for Windows 10, the App will close and you can start the classic Skype for Windows Desktop, which should still be installed on your computer. Look for the desktop shortcut pointing to this Skype program or open it from
 the installation folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Skype\Phone\Skype.exe&nbsp; (<em>if your Windows is 64-bit</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Program Files\Skype\Phone\Skype.exe&nbsp; (<em>if your Windows is 32-bit</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Actually, you can also just start and sign in to the classic Skype for Windows desktop, and this will also close the new Skype for Windows 10.</span></span></p>

    <title>How to really disable field updates before printing in Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srahimitp  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to really disable field updates before printing in Word 2007</h2>
                    Whenever I click Print in Word, all fields get updated, but most of my hyperlinks (cross-references) seem to be broken. So my document formatting gets lost when fields update.<br />
<br />
I went to Word Options =&gt; Display =&gt; Printing Options.<br />
Both 'Update fields before printing' and 'Update linked data before printing' were unchecked. But the fields still get updated, every time I print the doc, corrupting all document formatting.<br />
<br />
How can I get rid of it please?<br />

            Some fields are updated at print time regardless of your settings (see <span>
“<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/211629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Which fields are updated when you open, repaginate, or print document</a>.” You would have to lock these fields (Ctrl+F11) before printing. If you Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+F11, you'll get most of the fields in the
 document body, but you'd still need to lock fields in the header/footer that you didn't want updated.</span>

<h2>            Can&#39;t use Windows 10 TP as screen flashes constantly</h2>
                    <p>I am on a Surface Pro 3 running windows 8.1, 64 bit. I installed the current Windows 10 Technical Preview Build last night.<br />
</p>
<p>When it starts up I can access the login screen fine and put in my password, but once I'm in everything on the screen keeps flashing, like it's just constantly refreshing everything. It's refreshing too often so I can't get into any programs, menus, updates,
 nothing..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can do is reboot or access recovery mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to restart in low resolution mode. This gave me the exact same result except picture was only only 1/4 the size of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode does not flicker but gives me an error message and menu buttons/search don't work so no help there. While in safe mode I did disable all startup processes to get a clean boot but that was to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I could do was revert back to 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous to upgrading to Windows 10 i had installed all available updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this issue and figure out how to work around it so that I may try out the preview?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feedback/discussion appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that your screen flashes while using Windows 10 and I appreciate for the troubleshooting steps that you have followed to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For better understanding of the issue, please provide us following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Which build was installed on your computer?</li><li>Have you installed any driver on the computer after installing Windows 10?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Windows 10 is in development stage hence there are few features which are missing and there are few issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually the issue that you have faced occurs due to the corrupt or missing drivers, hence I suggest you to upgrade all the drivers from the Surface Pro 3 website and install them in compatibility mode after Windows 10 is installed and see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>How can I record a voice call&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I record a voice call&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows softare team did not need to develope a software from the scratch. Making a late entry to the field, the software should have been the best. Alas! Windows phone software misses some basic features which other players had introduced in their infant
 stage. </p>
<p>How can microsoft decide that a call should not be recorded?!</p>
<p>For sending/forwarding an sms I need to search and find the name of receiving person each time! There is no list of recently sent list!
</p>
<p>The group list of contact names appear with tiles. If it is dipslayed as list more number of contact names can be viewed without tapping the phone.</p>
<p>Why do not you allow to resize the tiles? </p>

<p>use the 'contacts+messages backup' app(avialble from store) to back up your texts and contacts so that you can restore the backup after upgrading to windows 10(I am telling this because some users lost all of their contacts after upgrading).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn't lose anything after upgrading. the phone simply didn't display them (a widespread bug). resetting the phone and adding the same account back would get the contacts and texts back.</p>
<p>using the backup app should only be necessary when moving to a different Microsoft account.</p>

    <title>Unable to upgrade from Insider Preview Build 10130 to Windows 10 RTM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickw56  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to upgrade from Insider Preview Build 10130 to  Windows 10 RTM or go back to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS X200CA notebook with Windows 8.1 installed. I joined the Insider Program and my machine eventually upgraded to Windows 10 preview release 10130.&nbsp; I don't use this machine often but when I went to use it recently I get a message telling me
 I need to upgrade to a later version.&nbsp; I thought this would happen automatically but I seem to be stuck on release 10130.&nbsp; I've tried resetting the machine but it won't go back to 8.1 and Asus have told me that Windows 10 will have overwritten Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Windows Update will not upgrade the machine beyond 10130. A batch of upgrades which appeared today could not be completed and I've been rolled back to 10130.<br />
</li><li>I can't install a clean version of Windows 10 because I don't know the product key and Asus Support tell me that this probably would not work as the 8.1 product key was an OEM version.</li><li>I can't restore the machine to 8.1 and start afresh because the recovery partition has been overwritten by Windows 10 and I don't have an 8.1 recovery disk/stick and Asus can't provide one.
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>So it looks like I either need to buy a new Windows 10 product key or return the machine to Asus for them to "repair" at a cost of £50 +</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion on how to get out of this mess ?</p>

            Posted at the top of this forum is how to activated or click on this&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/activation-faq-for-insider-preview-build-10565/68e759a2-abcc-4b16-8758-92a720a6efe9">How
 to activate older builds</a>, the reason for the messages is because of not being active in the program "I didn't use this machine often" now with this new activation release from Microsoft people who were not active in the program can still get the upgrade
 and I hope become active in the program this way we can get back to testing the Preview builds.

            Thanks for the suggestion but that does not work because I don't know the Windows 8.1 product key.&nbsp; I've tried to using a Key Finder but it only reports the Windows 10 evaluation key which has now expired.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been in contact with Asus and they say
 the key is embedded in the machine but that the Windows 10 Preview will have overwritten the original OS install so it's not recoverable.

<p>This was posted before installing beta/preview was to make a recovery media of the old system, also to make note of the key, as you waited too long to upgrade I think the only option is to install an active version of Win7sp1 or Win8.1. maybe others may
 have an answer. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have now resolved this problem but to do so I had to purchase a new licence key for Windows 7 and then upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; This was a time consuming experience and I am disappointed by the whole exercise. Neither ASUS or Microsoft were able to help
 me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice to others is that if you acquire a Windows 8.1&nbsp; PC ensure you can find the licence key before you try to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp;

 working on my iphone and on a windows machine using 365. &nbsp;I DO connect to smtpout and can send emails - just can't receive. &nbsp;Firewall? &nbsp;something in the OS update? &nbsp;Thx

<h2>            Outlook web mail unable to bulk select email messages and delete</h2>
                    <p>I delete messages in the following manner:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) search for messages from a certain sender or by certain key words</p>
<p>2) quickly glance through the search results to confirm that i want to delete them all</p>
<p>3) select the check box at the top to select all of the emails within view</p>
<p>4) use the delete key to delete all of the selected emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, step 4 doesn't seem to be deleting the emails as expected. &nbsp;Nothing happens when I press the delete key in the web browser.</p>

            Same thing happens when I use <strong>Search</strong> to find messages:&nbsp; nothing in the Outlook Mail main heading works --&nbsp;no Delete, no Move, no More, etcetera.&nbsp; Apparently the Outlook Mail, main heading, buttons are either
<strong><em>disabled by design</em></strong> or <strong><em>by a bug</em></strong>.&nbsp;Since you seem to prefer having the buttons workable for
<strong>Search</strong>, your best solution is to <strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com/category/100480-report-an-issue?page=7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">report an Outlook.com issue at Outlook Uservoice</a></strong>

<p>Bookmarks are not a standard method of TOC construction, though you can do it with some manual field editing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>99% of&nbsp; tables of contents are styles-based so the TOC automatically displays your heading text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other standard method is to use <strong>Insert&gt;Field&gt;Index and Tables&gt;TOC</strong> to create table entry fields. This is similar to your approach with bookmarks, but is a little easier to get working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the fields must be bookmarks, please see the answer on this page:&nbsp;<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/848097/adding-a-bookmark-table-in-a-document" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I'd like to create a Table for bookmarks, like a Table Of Contents,

    <title>Detailed&#58; sd card and files duplicating and files not being seen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avtir66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Detailed&#58; sd card and files duplicating and files not being seen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an update to the below saga, which was posted to the MS Answers forum.</p>
<p>Because many have been blaming the SD cards for the problems noted below, I contacted SanDisk, whose customer service and support were exemplary, BTW.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you plug the SD card into your PC and the files are there and acting normal, it's not the SD card. To be certain, do three things: 1. Reformat it; 2. Try your SD card in someone else's computer and phone; and 3. Try a different SD card in your computer.
 If all is well with these other devices, it's not your SD card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did all of these things. So my SD card is fine.</p>
<p>Bottom line: THE SD CARD IS NOT LIKELY THE CULPRIT causing problems with duplicate files or not seeing files on these phones.</p>
<p>SO Nokia, please fix your phones, PLEASE. I've given you great info to work with below and above. So far this phone has been a LOT of work for me. If I don't get a fix soon, I will be going nuts. I love my phone and I love my music - please help me make
 it work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*******************<br />
From the MS Answer forum, where I got no answers that helped...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with the SD card on my phone and the music/videos/pics showing up on the phone; BUT the files show on the SD card when I connect to the PC. Previously, the music and pics were duplicating; now, they are not showing up at all. When I go into
 Settings, Storage, the files show up under "Other." The do not show up in any photo albums or music apps (including Nokia and Xbox). NOTE: I use the file folders created by the phone. As my pics and music are an important part of my life, I hope you can help
 me!</p>
<p>At first, my phone would see the files on the SD card. But then file duplications of both pictures and music started. Some files would be duplicated twice, some up to six times. NOTE: The pic files were not affected as often or as badly as the music files,
 probably because I don't access them as often (?). I have not been using videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I will first give you spec info on the phone, then I will tell you what I have done to troubleshoot (in part, I have troubleshooted mostly using info on these forums). With all this info, I hope that you can help me resolve my problem (and as both the
 duplication and the SD card issue seem prevalent, your answer to this post my solve the problems for many).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PHONE SPECS:</p>
<p>Phone Model: Nokia Lumia 822<br />
Mobile Operator: VZW-US<br />
Mobile OS Version: 8.0.10211.204<br />
Configuration ID: 121012<br />
Firmware Revision: 1532.5951.1250.1012<br />
Hardware Revision: 1.0.0.0<br />
Radio Software Version: 2.0.092021.3<br />
Chip SOC Version: 8960<br />
Boot Loader: ?? [Cannot find this]<br />
Software: Windows Phone 8.0<br />
Accessories Agent: 2.5.3.3<br />
Firmware updater notifier: 1.0.1.7<br />
Silent installer: 1.3.0.6</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you also need the following, I can supply it: MAC address; RRL-ID; MEID; MDN; ERI; IMEI; SimID; Sim Unlock; SMS vCard Receiver; Contacts Initializer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SD CARD INFO:</p>
<p>SanDisk 64GB ultra/SDHC/SDXC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When reformatting, I reformat it to its “original” state, when it asks me; I've also had the phone reformat it.</p>
<p>Music files are in .mp3 format; tried .mp4, and that did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I update/check the following at least 3x/week per what came with the phone and what I later installed per Nokia: Phone Update; Lumia Pusher; nokia-lumia-updates.xap (now on Sim Card [wasn't working on SD card]); Phone Storage; Email + Accounts; Backup; Backup
 Assistant Plus</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT I'VE DONE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. First, I tried deleting all files and recopying them over using my phone cable connection to the computer. After doing this 5-6 times, I decided that something else had to be done, as nothing was improving, and file transfer over the phone cable takes
 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Next, I tried reformatting the SD card. I thought this would work, because when reinserted into the phone, the phone asked if I want to use it for music/videos/pics, and I answered "yes." When I went under Storage in Settings, it is indeed set up to use
 the SD card for these items. Then the duplications started again. I repeated the formatting procedure. Dupes started again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Next, I tried reformatting the SD card, then putting the files onto it not through the phone cable, but through the SD card slot on the computer (which was significantly faster, BTW). I reinserted the card into the phone. Again, it asked if I wanted to
 put music/video/pics on SD card; I said "yes." This time, I went into the xBox music application and most of the music is there, but not all of it; so I went into Nokia Music app, and all of it was showing there. So I decided to use the Nokia app. Then dupes
 started up again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. At this point, the pics seemed OK, but I was getting empty albums, which I deleted from the phone since I never used them anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Without reformatting the SD card this time, I deleted all music files from the card, then recopied files again, not using the phone cable since it was faster (I figured if I had to keep doing this, I might as well do it the quick way). Result: I put the
 SD card into the phone again. This time NO files at all showed up in the picture and music apps. I went to Settings/Storage. The SD card was there, the settings for it being used for pics/videos/music were in place. I clicked on the SD card. It showed 0 bytes
 under pictures, music, and videos. Instead, all memory used was located under "Other," which doesn't help at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. So, I reformat the SD card again, reinsert it into the phone, and again, asked if wanted to put videos/pics/music on SD card; I answer "yes." I connect the phone directly to the computer, and this time use the phone cable to the computer to copy files
 onto the phone (SD card) again. Result: Files </p>
<p>still not showing up in pic and music/video apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. I tried reformatting one more time. Same as in point #6 above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Lightbulb goes off: I wondered if the problem was with the *.xap file I downloaded from Nokia. The instrux had said to put it on the SD card. If the SD card was not communicating with the Sim card/phone correctly, then maybe that was the issue. So I moved
 the Nokia updater *.xap file from SD card to Sim card on a whim. Suddenly all sorts of things were being updated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Since moving the *.xap had such positive results, I did step #6 again, wondering if the lack of updates were the problem. But, no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am sitting here with a phone that might as well not be a Smartphone. Without pictures and music, it is just a phone to me. I might as well have not upgraded from my old phone (which was BASIC, cheap, etc.). This is my first Smartphone, and I have been
 almighty frustrated with this situation. When it's working, I love it, though. As an aside, I find the trend to have everything dependent upon the Internet a bit much, and with data plans no longer unlimited and getting more expensive, this dependence on the
 Internet is cumbersome. I don't have Internet at home, and I live in a rural area, which means I have to travel to get to a Wi-Fi zone.&nbsp; Which I turn makes it hard to get things resolved when they go wrong. *sigh*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to look into this. If you can help me troubleshoot this, I would be SO appreciative!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello avtir66, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you very much for posting here. And thank you for all this *huge* effort you've been putting into this.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the issue you're having is not only experienced by you alone, there&nbsp;are quite a few people having this issue.
</p>
<p>Microsoft are already looking into this, as it seems, and they are working on a fix. But please allow me to check the status of that for you and I will get back to you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hardreset of the phone <em>can</em> be a temporary (!) fix for this, but as all the other things that you have already done: it'll most likely come back. So I won't really recommend that as a solution.
</p>
<p>At this point, I'm sorry to say: there is no real solution, we'll need to trust on Microsoft to actually fix that once and for all.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll get back to you once I know more. </p>
<p>Kind regards, </p>
<p>Ronika M' </p>

<h2>            One Userform to Close Another Userform</h2>
                    <p>I am completely stumped. I have tried everything I can think of to make this work.&nbsp; Here is my issue: I have a StartMenu userform with a command button that brings up a Password userform. When the user enters the correct password, I want to close the Password
 userform (which I can easily do with an Unload Me). Then, I want to close the StartMenu form and get into the Excel Workbook. My Password userform allows me access to Developer Mode (and VBA).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using two Unload Me commands, but once the first form is unloaded, the other remains in place.
</p>
<p>I have tried a separate macro that would unload both forms and restore other aspects of Excel that I have disabled while the form is running and that does not work either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions??? Please help........</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Thank you </p>

<h2>            Synchronization Issues with outlook.com android app on HTC ONE S</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I have install the outlook.com app to my mobile, I was able to add my outlook account without any problems, but there is no synchronization with email folders, calendars and contacts. I have clean the cache, uninstall and re-install the app but still nothing,
 I can't receive any emails or see my calendar data or contacts. Using my phone accounts settings and creating&nbsp;<font color="#000000">Exchange ActiveSync account or Hotmail I was able to have all working (email, contacts, primary calendar). The problem is that
 I have several calendars in outlook and only outlook.com app allows me to sync all of them on my mobile calendar (the app works fine on my android tablet). My phone is HTC one S with android 4.1.1, if any help or pointers to follow would very much appreciated,
 I would like to have my contacts and all my calendars sync with my phone if&nbsp;possible. To finish I have to say that all&nbsp;permissions&nbsp;for the app are ok since I have check those too.</font></div>

            <p>Hi Constantinos123, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're glad that your issue is now resolved by installing the latest version of Outlook.com app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your new issue on your Calendar not syncing the past events/meetings older than three weeks, please note that what you're experiencing with the Outlook.com app is by design. Two weeks is as far as what the app can sync back with the calendar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Should you have other queries, I highly encourage you to post them here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

    <title>Windows Live Mail will not export to Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail will not export to Outlook</h2>
                    December 20, 2012<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Live Mail will not export to Outlook. I receive an MAPI error,&nbsp; despite the fact that my MAPI setting is correct. How am I supposed to export to Outlook, Thunderbird or any other email program. Windows Live Mail crashes and stops working.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the fix? This is important to the future success of my business. I need a working email program.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will Windows Live Mail export to Outlook 2013? I'm working in a Windows 7, Dell XPS 64 bit machine, 8GB RAM, and a vast amount of free space on the hard drive.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Please have someone send me a fix for this.<br />

            Just because you can't see it any more on your end doesn't mean it was removed. &nbsp;They may (almost certainly) have collected it and are storing it on their end still.

            I would advise you to reinstall your firmware,<br />
connect your phone in PC suite mode and open " Nokia suite ".<br />
<br />
If you have the latest version of firmware already installed on your phone, nokia suite will give you option to reinstall it.<br />
<br />
You should also visit to your nearest Nokia care point.

            Unfortunately you need a pc for this purpose. Download and install Nokia Suite from here:<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, you can also update your phone's software from your phone if the update is sent in your device.

            If nothing works, you may contact a Nokia Care Centre near you.
