<h2>            opening without saving an attachment</h2>
                    i am having a problem with downloading to files and opening email attachments. &nbsp;For example, when i want to download to my quicken , the information goes to my program files and not directly to quicken. &nbsp;also when i receive an email attachment i can only
 save it, not just open it. &nbsp;it seems that these issues are related but i do not know what to do to fix this problem. &nbsp;I need help.

Can you be more specific about what happens if you try?</p>
<p>Have you tried from multiple accounts?</p>
<p>In safe mode?</p>
<p><strong><u>The less you have running all the time, the better the things you want to run will perform:</u></strong></p>
<p>Use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoruns</a> to figure out what all is starting up when your computer does/when you log on. Look up anything you do not know about using
<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google</a> (and/or ask here.) You can hopefully figure out if there are things starting when you computer does (or you logon) that you do not need and then configure them (via their own built-in mechanisms is
 the preferred method) so they do not start up - using your resources without reason.</p>
<p>You can download and utilize <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Explorer</a> to see exactly what is taking up your processor/CPU time and memory. This can help you recognize applications you might want to look into alternatives for and/or get rid of all together.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Why do those?</u></em></strong> The most likely reason your system is hanging on shutdown is some service is not closing properly. If you eliminate the unnecessary - you just may figure out (inadvertently) why your system is not shutting down.
 Not to mention - who doesn't want a faster computer without paying for it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may want to do some other maintenance you may not have known you should do...&nbsp; or could do at the very least.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Free up some hard drive space and get it organized:</u></strong></p>
<p>Open an elevated command prompt by clicking on the start orb and browsing through All Programs --&gt; Accessories and right-clicking on "Command Prompt" and choosing "Run as Administrator".</p>
<p>Type in the following in the command prompt:</p>
<p>dism /online /cleanup-image /spsuperseded</p>
<p>... and press ENTER.</p>
<p>The process takes a few minutes to complete, it ends with the sentences “Service Pack Cleanup operation completed. The operation completed successfully”.</p>
<p>Use <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/818-disk-cleanup-open-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Disk Cleanup</a> to eliminate more temporary files safely. May want to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Schedule-Disk-Cleanup-to-run-regularly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
schedule this regularly</a>.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
( just the disk cleanup - don't play with the registry part for now )</p>

<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/</a></p>
<p>Those can help you visually discover where all the space is being used. Then you can determine what to do and what to delete/archive.</p>
<p>After that - you will want to check for any physical errors and arrange everything for more efficient access...</p>

 have searched long and hard for an answer, but either no-one else has the same problem or i'm searching for the wrong thing. Thanks in advance.</span>

<h2>            How to disable Google Update Service in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am trying to achieve what's said in title. I want to prevent Google Chrome from auto update in order to prevent some of their new features I don't like (new bookmark manager design).</p>
<p>I went into msconfig and disabled Google Update Service (GUS), restarted Pc etc. It says it is "disabled" right now.</p>
<p>But GUS keeps running anyway. Than I tried to click on 2 GUS processes in "service" section of task manager - right mouse click, properties, and in properties, where it says GUS works as "automatic update", I tried to change that into "disabled" or "manual".
 I tried both options, but after a while&nbsp; it reverts itself on it's own into "automatic" and keeps running.</p>
<p>Is there any way to disable that annoyance permanently?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi Steva, yes Google Update Service will keep running . . . 
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Search for and untick, anything related to Google Update Service

<p>I resolved it by deleting "GoogleUpdate" folder in Google folder in Program Files.</p>
<p>I don't see option to delete this thread, so if there is some moderator or administrator, you can delete it since help is no longer needed. Thanks.</p>

<br />
To install a screensaver, drag and drop it into the C:\windows\system32 folder.<br />
To install a theme, follow the steps here: <a href="http://www.guimods.com/tutorial-how-to-install-and-use-vista-themes-and-visual-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>There is nothing wrong with the desktop or screen resolution. I can see the entire desktop spread across all 3 monitors. All monitors are operating at the desired screen resolution of 1200x1920 ( yes that is correct - the monitors are in "Portrait" mode")
 &nbsp;The entire desktop space is 3600x1920.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Windows "The best driver software for your device is already installed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a fresh install of Win 10 that is only a few days old. Its not unique to this PC. I have a several PC's here all running Win 10 and they all do the same thing - Its some sort of bug in Win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you get in front of a PC (with 2 or more monitors) that is running Windows 10 and try and make something run full screen across all the monitors - A simple test is run Youtube in full screen. It simply does not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image below shows a Youtube video in full screen mode - It only spans out to fill the middle monitor - It should fill all 3 monitors.</p>

<p>Adriandiehm, has your issue been solved yet?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven't found anyway to span an app across multiple monitors native within Win 10! I have found a program that you can set up a keyboard shortcut to span all monitors, I think you might be able to set up a trigger to span all when you click full screen
 on YouTube. I don't use the trigger function so I'm not 100% on that.</p>
<p>This is to the program I use is DisplayFusion by Binary Fortress Software. <a href="https://www.displayfusion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DisplayFusion</a>&nbsp;has a free version that will give you access to keyboard shortcuts, again I'm not sure about trigger functions. They give a 30 day trial of the pro version so you can try it out without much risk. In my opinion its one of the best programs
 for window manipulation and well worth the 30 bucks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this works for you. Let me know if I can help with anything.</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Non-Commercial Use, Unlicensed Product&#58;  Problems with Microsoft Office Home and Student AND Windows Essential &#40;issues with word, excel and photo gallery tools&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Purchased my home computer two years ago, Windows 8 (was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>factory loaded by Dell</strong>) the software title "Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013"</span>.&nbsp; Windows was updated to 8.1.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I went into my PC settings and under Windows 8.1 it states "Windows is not activated."</span>&nbsp; How can this be after using my computer for two years.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Non-Commercial Use, Unlicensed Product - these words appear on a banner when I open an word or Excel file. &nbsp;It doesn't let me edit the file, save or get out of the documents unless I go into task manager
 and end the task.&nbsp; I receive a message to repair it before locking up. &nbsp;The link (</span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2751424) provided to a similar question about this issues doesn't&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">take you
 to the fix. &nbsp;I also have been able to run my Office (Home edition 2013, Windows 8.1) products for 2 years without this problem. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As of two days ago I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
can no longer use the tools in Photo Gallery</span> - as an artist I rely in this software for editing my images. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As of two days ago the error message upon Windows startup of "Windows couldn't connect to the Group Policy Client service. &nbsp;This problem prevents standard users from signing in. &nbsp;As an administrative
 user, you can review the system event log for details about why the service didn't respond."&nbsp; The message doesn't tell you how to fix the problem. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Per your (microsoft) instructions on community board, I went into control panel and what did I find as of 10/27/2015 my word office, while it is listed as a program, it has zero (0) file size.&nbsp; That means
 my office software is gone?&nbsp; How can this happen?&nbsp; What I do remember is that microsoft had an update around that time and am wondering if this update wiped out my office program and also does it have to do with Windows 10 release?&nbsp; Did microsoft unintentionally
 wipe out windows 8.1 capabilities (word, excel, powerpoint and photo gallery tools) on my computer with the recent update?</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Continuing with my problems.&nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing that windows 8 on my computer was factory installed when I ordered from Dell two years ago and have not had a problem operating windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today this is what I found on my computer under PC Settings:</p>
<p>Windows version 8.1</p>
<p>Windows is not activated</p>
<p>BUT when you first log onto the computer it shows Windows version 8.1 activated.&nbsp; Then within two-to-three minutes it switches it to read Windows is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into PC Settings again and went onto Change Product Key and typed in the original key on the Microsoft Product Identifier Card Dell gave me with the computer.&nbsp; The computer didn't recognize the product key code.&nbsp; Is this because the original Windows
 was 8, even though today it operates as Windows 8.1 through an online update when 8.1 version came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into control panel under system and tried to activate Windows.&nbsp; The computer said that it successfully activated Windows.&nbsp; The same problems occurring and it won't stay activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did a Windows Essential repair - it got stuck around 46% and would get any further in it's repair process.&nbsp; Was stuck on 46% for about 1/2 hour.&nbsp; Turned off the computer and did again and the computer got stuck at the same point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating, as all I did last evening is turn the computer off.&nbsp; It seems (if you look bove) that this seemed to have occurred in my computer on 10/27/2015 when all of a sudden Windows Office and Home 2013 was listed as installed on 10/27/2015
 (when I never did anything like that.&nbsp; And now this (in control panel) shows 0 file size AND Windows Essential is showing 0 File size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any ideas to help resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Shubham, thank you for your detailed response to my numerous issues and questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; After some 36 hours of trying to resolve my computer problems, I am happy to report that as of late last evening the problems were resolved.&nbsp; Here is what I think took
 place:</p>
<ul>
<li>I completed forgot that several days ago Dell did an update.&nbsp; I noticed soon afterward the computer started operating funny.&nbsp; And then for the last three days, as noted above, all of the problems happened at once.&nbsp;
</li><li>Last evening about an hour before I shut down, I noticed that Dell did another update and what do you know - all the issues stated above were resolved.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>This morning when I turned on my computer, the system was operating with no apparent problems - Windows 8.1 stayed activated, word and excel both worked smoothly and quickly, as well as the editing tools on the Photo gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has lead me to believe that the problems stemmed from the update that Dell did earlier and were resolved with the update last evening.&nbsp; All the while I thought it was do to an update that Microsoft pushed down in late October.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't tell you how much I appreciate the information you've provided here, your response was both detailed and helpful, hopefully will help others too.&nbsp; I plan to keep the information on hand for future use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this has happened after upgrading to Windows 10, it could be due to incompatible display/graphics driver. I would suggest you to update the driver and check the status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Update the driver from Device Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key +<strong> X</strong> and click <strong>Device Manager</strong></p>
<p>b. Expand <strong>Display adapters </strong></p>
<p>c. Right click the driver and click <strong>Update driver software</strong></p>
<p>d. Click <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest display/graphics driver available for the same computer model and for Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>If the issue still remains, uninstall the current display/graphics driver and restart the computer for Windows updates to install the required driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To uninstall the driver:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key +<strong> X</strong> and click <strong>Device Manager</strong></p>
<p>b. Expand <strong>Display adapters </strong></p>
<p>c. Right click the driver and click <strong>Uninstall</strong></p>
<p>d. Restart the PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
        </p>

<h3> frontpack66458  say:</h3>
<h2>            recover saved over original piture in paint windows 10</h2>
                    Had a picture with 4 pictures on it, I was removing each picture to make 4 individual pictures, but wanted to save the original too. After removing one picture off the page, I was going to go back to original picture (w/4 pics.), but Paint* asked if I
 wanted to 'save' my new picture and of course I did. So, I clicked sav e or ok or yes or whatever and it totally replaced the original picture with the 4 pictures on it.&nbsp; Can I get these back and how? Please, Help, these pictures cannot be replaced and are
 very important to me.&nbsp; Thank you.

            Hi FrontPack66458
<br />
<br />If you have not closed that file yet in Paint, press Ctrl + Z  a few times to see if you can undo what you have done to that Photo
<br />
<br />If you have saved over the original Pic, I am sorry that original cannot be brought back as the pixels in that pic will have been overwritten
<br />
<br />A golden rule with pictures is always work on a copy never the original . . 
<br />
<br />If you have File History turned on, there is a chance you can get that original back
<br />
<br />In Windows File Explorer, find that file, right click the file and choose Properties
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, click the Previous Versions Tab, is there a previously saved version of that File?

            This was close to a month ago, no. I have searched everywhere for it, on my computer, including the File Explorer. I also ran a recovery program using different types of searches and search names. They all came back with no results or file had been damaged,
 deleted, or renamed. I had it saved to several different spots, but all were under the same name. I was just hoping there might be something I hadn't tried yet.&nbsp; Thank you so much for your help.&nbsp;

            Hi 	FrontPack66458
<br />
<br />You mention 'I had it saved to several different spots' surely one of those would be the original copy, as saving that overwritten file would only change one version of that file . . .

            All of them have the new name, which is just the date I modified it, since paint did not give me any options. It just asked if I wanted to save my changes. I just assumed it would save it as a separate photo file not know that it would copy over my original.&nbsp;

<p>I almost made the same mistake.&nbsp; You need to save it as a new photo.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Did you check your online OneDrive Pictures folder?&nbsp; The original file could also be in the online recycle bin.&nbsp; That's an advantage of using the OneDrive.&nbsp; But the recycle bin gets cleared out in about a month's time.</p>

            I have been in One Drive online and went through the recycle bin, is that the same thing? Thank you, for the link, I will most definitely try that right now. I am new to one drive, I did not even know there is a One Drive sync. Is that easy to do?

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Have you tried to log in another profile? If not, please do try it out. And your error code means that " there's a network issue in connecting to the Xbox Live service. "
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest to test also your network Multiplayer and the Detailed network. So you can get your console network speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try these following troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;First is to&nbsp;remove a Microsoft account from your Xbox One console<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Press the Xbox button&nbsp; to open the guide. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Select System &gt; Settings &gt; Account &gt; Remove accounts. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Select the account that you want to remove, and then select Remove to confirm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.When you're finished, select Close. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a power cycle before you add your account back</p>
<p>1.Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the Xbox button&nbsp; on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Unplug the console's power cable. Wait 1 minute. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Important: Be sure to wait 1 minute. This step resets the power supply. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Plug the console power cable back in. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.Press the Xbox button&nbsp; on your console to turn on the Xbox One.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (NOTE: do not use surge protector as it affects the console functionality. Xbox one power supply has already a built in surge protector)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add your profile then:</p>
<p>1.Press the Xbox button&nbsp; to open the guide. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Select your gamerpic in the upper-left corner of the screen, move all the way down and select Add new.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Enter the email address for the Microsoft account that you want to add, and then select Enter.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.Enter the password for your Microsoft account that you want to add, and then select Enter.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.Read the Microsoft Service Agreement and Privacy Statement, and then select I Accept.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.Follow the steps to configure your Sign-In &amp; Security preferences to add your Microsoft account to your Xbox One console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that it works now</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade not compatible with Zoom Text Maginfier&#47;Reader 10.1</h2>
                    I have reserved my upgrade to Windows 10, then when I came to do it wanted to uninstall my zoom text 10.1 program as it states that it is not compatible with windows 10. I am partially sighted and require this program so that I can do my work as&nbsp;I work
 from home. So my question is how do I&nbsp;stop my laptop from trying to upgrade every time I turn it on? and also will windows 10 ever be compatible with the zoom text 10.1 so that those with sight problems can use the new windows 10?

            <p>Hi Andie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know if the Zoom Text will ever be compatible with Windows 10, you will have to get in touch with the developers of Zoom text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want to upgrade or don't wish the notification for the upgrade then follow the steps :</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch Control Panel</li><li>Click on Programs &gt; Programs and Features</li><li>&nbsp;Left side of the screen hit the “View installed updates” section.</li><li>Look for <em>KB3035583</em> in the list</li><li>Right-click it and hit the remove option.</li></ol>

            Thank you. This has helped, I have been told that zoom text will be releasing New drivers shortly so I will just have to wait for them before I can upgrade.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>After you have setup a folder with the options that you want to stay persistent for all similar folders, click Organize/Folder and Search Options/View Tab.</p>
<p>Click the Apply To Folders button. Confirm the change.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>xbox takes forever to load my profile and dashboard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            xbox takes forever to load my profile and dashboard</h2>
                    I turned on my xbox today and my profile would not load. I took about 5 minutes for the profile to load and for me to select it. Then i waited for it to sign me in but i ran out of patience and shut my console off. This has never happened before and usually
 this processes takes 5 seconds MAX. I have a 120gb hard drive and a older xbox elite. I have tried restarting the console and removing the hard drive and puting it back in and nothing has worked. If you have a fix to this problem please tell me! Thanks.

    <title>Copied window 10 Installation media to Sandisk 128GB Cruzer Glide - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Copied window 10 Installation media to Sandisk 128GB Cruzer Glide</h2>
                    <p>Not sure what has happened here...</p>
<p>Before I tried to copy the above media, the USB already had some files on it. Since it stated it only required 8 Gigs to complete the transfer. I proceeded with over 100 GB left. However, when I came back to the PC it said Error with Code 0x80042405-0xA001A.
 a Box appeared&nbsp; saying You Need To Format The Disk in drive E: before you can use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In order to Format the drive, </span>It gave various options in three separate boxes: Capacity: 32.0GB? (Should be 128GB). File System: FAT32. Allocation Unit Size: Default Allocation Size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything already on the disk was important to me and now I cannot get to it? What happened and can I retrieve the documents?</p>
<p>Appreciate anyone's input...</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>When you burn the iso file to thumb drive the drive used must be blank media or have files that you can lose.&nbsp; There is a warning you must have missed that says you will lose any files on the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;See the instructions for creating media for another computer. You make a bootable drive
 when burning the file to the drive. A smaller 16 gb drive would be a better choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you <strong>copied</strong> the iso file instead of burning, try opening the drive with Explorer to see if anything is left on it.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Garry,
<br />
<br />When you use the Media Creation Tool, it formats the USB drive and prepares the installation media for that, so as a result, everything on that flash drive gets removed. Because it's at FAT32 with typical Microsoft software, it can go up to 32 GB only.
<br />
<br />You'll have to go into Disk Management. Hit Windows key + R and enter: diskmgmt.msc
<br />
<br />If you could, send a screenshot of the window so I can see what you're working with? I'd like to send you the instructions on how to extend your flash drive's partition to its fullest extent.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend you format the drive again, but not before you extend the 32 GB partition to the unallocated (64 GB?) space. After you do extend it and get it formatted, do *not* write anything to the flash drive.
<br />
<br />Install Recuva here, it's free and it looks for missing files, I can't guarantee you can get everything back since the tool probably wrote 8 GB's worth, but it's surely a start: <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/go/recuva.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/go/recuva.com</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know, Garry.
