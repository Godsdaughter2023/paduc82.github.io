<h2>            What are the Minimum Requirements for a USB Drive&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried 3 different USB drives in my new Xbox 4GB consol. They all ranged anywhere from 8 to 32GB of storage capacity. One of the bad things I noticed right off is, the 3 USB slots in the back are very limited in how big of a USB stick will fit. My
 32GB one was a little too wide and won't insert far enough to make contact, so I had to use an extension cable to get it to work. All 3 drives were formatted by the consol and all 3 came up with the same warning: "If your USB flash drive doesn't meet the USB
 minimum requirements, you may experience significant performance problems while playing games on the flash drive or saving content to the flash drive." That's just wonderful! I've searched everywhere and all I find is the requirement of 1-16GB of available
 space. I've got that, Obviously there must be a minimum Data Transfer rate for it to work properly.....................................What is it!!</p>

<p>If it configured it should be fine, that warning pops up every time you configure a drive. It just lets you know basically it is not as good as a hard drive and could cause problems. Again, you should be fine though.

<p>All it says on the support page is</p>
<p>USB minimum requirements</p>
<p>To use a USB flash drive with your console, the USB flash drive must meet these requirements:</p>
<p>•A minimum of 1 GB storage capacity.</p>
<p>•Formatted with the Windows FAT32 file system. Macintosh or Linux formats do not work.</p>
<p>Note Using a USB flash drive that does not meet the minimum performance requirements might significantly affect the performance of your console.</p>

<p>I already read that. If you put the 70 buck Sandisc Xbox certified usb flash drive in, I bet you don't get that warning! There are other much cheaper USB drives that don't give you that warning also. Before I go out and buy one of those 20 buck drives, I
 want to know what the recommended minimum data transfer rate is. Is it a secret or something?</p>

 random write. To operate decently, a USB flash drive should be able to sustain 15-20MB/sec&nbsp;sequential read speed&nbsp;(15.5MB/sec is about what 12x DVD ROM reads at). Beyond that, it's good to have decent sequential write (15-20MB/sec would be nice) and random
 read/write performance in the 1-9 MB/sec range (better than most HDDs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all flash drives are created equal. I have several I use with my consoles. A couple do not pass the test, but as I don't install games to them it's not an issue.</p>

<p>best bet for usb drives that don't have written specs</p>
<p>usb 2 support or readyboost if it don't have specs its not likely usb2 compatible though</p>

<p>Thanx icestorm, you really are a piece of work. I normally don't make too many spelling mistakes, so I'm not too worried about missing the e in CONSOLE. As far as the spacing between the USB ports, it's PERFECT and exactly represents what I have on the hundreds
 of mainboards I have installed over the years. Unfortunately the spacing between the face of the USB socket and the back of the CONSOLE doesn't allow for my 32GB stick to fully plug in. It will plug in to every other computer in the world, because the socket
 is flush with the surface and not recessed 1/8" or 3.175mm! As to the last part all I want to know is what does Microsoft recommend? I think it's probably a minimum of 20-30 read and a minimum 10 write................that blows a lot of USB 2.0 flash drives
 out of the water, but makes it easier for us poor slobs!</p>

<p>@growlingclown i think you got that reversed</p>
<p>it eliminates most cheap usb drives that don't comply with usb 2 connections</p>
<p>most cheap noname drives fall under usb 1</p>

<p>[quote user="GrowlingClown14"]Unfortunately the spacing between the face of the USB socket and the back of the CONSOLE doesn't allow for my 32GB stick to fully plug in[/quote]Keeping in mind that there are plenty of motherboard USB clusters where the USB
 ports are side-by-side, the casing should be of no concern for properly designed USB sticks.[quote]As to the last part all I want to know is what does Microsoft recommend?[/quote]They've never published that information. You can infer what it should be given
 the performance of the DVD drive.[quote]I think it's probably a minimum of 20-30 read and a minimum 10 write[/quote]I've given estimates based on the DVD drive's performance, as well as what happens when a USB HDD is attached. USB HDDs never pass the test.
 As their sequential performance isn't an issue, that leaves random performance.</p>

<p>That's what I figured 20-30 read and 10 write. I can get a lexar with those specs for under 20 bucks. I'll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>Well I did some shopping around and I found a product on Amazon.ca (Patriot Xporter XT Boost 16 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive PEF16GUSB), for $30.50 including taxes and free shipping. I just got it today, tried it, and it was up to Xbox standards. These units are
 even cheaper on Amazon.com if you live in the States.</p>

<h2>            Forced gamertag</h2>
                    Hello microsoft. My profile is splash god. Gamertag was&nbsp; <strong>[mod removed - PII]</strong> i think someone must have reported my gamertag for the use of the word
<strong>[mod removed]</strong>. I signed on today with a forced gamertag “scaryjoey400832”. I already changed my gamertag once before and i was never charged for this new one. I tried to change it but its telling me to pay $10. Even if my tag was reported i
 should have at least gotten an email letting me know and for me to change it to a new and more appropriate name. I hope you guys can resolve this without me paying for new gamertag. I have also changed my password just in case of a hacker. Thank you for your
 support. Please call anytime @<strong> [mod removed - PII] </strong>or email me -
<strong>[mod removed - PII]</strong> thanks again.&nbsp;

<h2>            Problem with signing in and changing password</h2>
                    I cannot sign in to my Skype account. When I change my password it still does not allow me to sign in, but accepts the new password to sign in to my Microsoft outlook account. The message I get is that I have signed in too many times and to check that
 I am not a robot. I have changed my password a few times yet the same problem arises.

<h2>            Windows reinstall not finding product key</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have a Toshiba Satelite Pro laptop however the operating system recently crashed and I have had to carry out a reinstall of windows. As the laptop does not have a disk drive I downloaded Windows from the microsoft website and saved on a USB to
 use however once the operating system has installed, it does not register a product key and says it needs activated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original operating system was windows 8 which was then updated but I cannot find on my laptop or a sticker on the laptop what the product key is. Is there a way that I can find this on my laptop after it has been completely whiped and started again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Joseph, the most common cause of Windows 10 not activating automatically after a fresh.clean install is that the incorrect Edition (Home, Pro . . . etc.) has been installed . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - System - About - is the correct Edition installed?

            The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core will install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro will install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />To find out if you have the right edition installed:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Edition.
<br />
<br />If the edition of Windows 10 installed does not correspond with the edition of Windows 7 or Windows 8 you were previously running, then you need to reinstall the right edition.
<br />
<br />If its the right edition, do the following:
<br />
<br />Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 came preinstalled on my computer, how do I find the product key?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt phone activation:

<br />
<br />If you don't have the right edition installed, you will need to perform a clean install again:
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>

<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Joseph.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it was activated after you first Upgraded then it has permanent DIgital License stored in MS servers, and needs time after reinstall to connect to activate.  
<br />
<br />If it still hasn't activated after a few days contact Microsoft Support here to get help activating:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />If Windows 8/8.1 came on the PC then you can read the embedded Product Key by installing ProducKey and looking for OEM-BIOS key:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>.  This should not be necessary but if for some reason it was never activated using that key might still get the free Upgrade activated the first time, since we have not heard that the extended Grace Period has ended for that method.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>I recently set up my home server with Home server 2011. I found in trying to configure remote access that my ISP, Cox communications, has port 80 blocked. They seem to take pleasure in these tricks.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
When you uninstalled the software it probably also uninstalled the camera drivers and/or<br />
control software.</p>
<p>Check with ArcSoft Support and ask in their forums for known issues.<br />

<h2>            System Reserved Partition</h2>
                    My machine is a MCI motherboard, model P67A-C43.&nbsp; It has an Intel i5-2500K 
CPU@3.30GHz.&nbsp; The core speed runs at 4.190GHz.&nbsp; I have 16Gb of RAM.&nbsp; This system is setup to run x64.&nbsp; I have 2 hard drives.&nbsp; The one that my operating system is based on is a SSD 250GB and the other for data is a WHD 2T.&nbsp; Presently, I'm running Windows
 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; So I ask you, why can't I run Windows 10?&nbsp; When I setup it up to run, it gives me the following in the "Windows 10 Setup" window:
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This PC can't run Windows 10<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi Samba.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1803 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If there are other performance issues with the install you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues like this, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Need Kinect Help</h2>
                    
<p>Ok my problem with the kinect is that its chopping off my head. I have measured myself from the sensor and im 8ft away from it. The sensor is 2ft 5in from the ground on a flat table infront of the tv. Im 6ft3 i have tryed placing the sensor higher and getting
 the same result. Why is the sensor not reading my head?</p>

<p>By clicking up manually do you mean with your hands or using the kinect tuner option to alter angle. If you click it up with your hands that could be the problem the motor only has a certain degree of movement if you have forced it passed that you may have
 broken it</p>

<p>I would put it on the tv but its at a 45 degree angle downwords so it wont work. Iv also stuck it up 8ft high and it still cuts off my head. Its like the sensor cant read by head. Does it matter what colour the carpet is cos its a maroon red.</p>

<h2>            Why do I have Windows 8.1 Enterprise Evaluation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was previously running windows 8.1. But I realized that my laptop was running slow. So I decided to format my laptop, but the thing is. After It finished I realized that I had Windows 8.1 Enterprise Evaluation. Which I have a hard time understanding why.
 I had the full version of windows 8 which came with the laptop which I trade with a friend to get. So I don't understand why, when I restored my laptop. That it changed versions and I no longer have the full version of windows 8. So my question is, Is there
 a way I can fix this and go back to Windows 8.1?</p>

<p><span>Hi nweissma,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the drive shows unallocated under the lower section of the disk management, then it won’t appear in the upper section of the disk management
 window and in Windows Explorer. </span></p>
<p><span>You’ve to format the volume to make it appear under Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to format a partition/volume</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type diskmgmt.msc and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the ‘Unallocated’ space and choose New Simple Volume.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Follow
 the instructions further to make the partition healthy.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the volume is created, you’ll be able to see the partition appearing both on the upper section of the disk management window and on Windows

<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;1507&#41; PC  keyboard suddenly stops responding.  Mouse continues to work.</h2>
                    <p>My Windows-10 (v.1511) PC has worked well for months but something has changed in the last month or so. &nbsp;PC works well for a day or two, &nbsp;and then the keyboard suddenly stops responding. &nbsp;Mouse continues to work, so I try to investigate with only the mouse,
 but cannot do much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;With no keyboard response, &nbsp;I try to open any program with the mouse and I get message &nbsp;" Allow this app to make change...?", &nbsp;in a User Account Control "pop-up box". &nbsp; &nbsp;With this problem, I cannot open any program from the task bar using the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a PC-Restart restores the PC and keyboard to a normal operation, for a day or 2. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>When keyboard is operating OK, I have checked my UAC settings and it is set for "Notify only when apps try..." (recommended setting).<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;This keyboard and UAC problem happens unpredictably about every 1-2 full days of PC trouble-free use and has happened &nbsp;for past month or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This maybe connected with another unresolved problem; &nbsp;Microsoft reports my Win-10 (ver.1511) is up-to-date despite that the Win-10 (ver.1607) update has been out for months. &nbsp; I have gone thru the "normal" MS update process several times, all reporting
 "success" but without any change from ver.1511.</p>

<p>Hi ezed9,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 versions 1511 and 1607 are essentially two different operating systems. Win 10 v.1511 is still being supported and&nbsp;updated so your 1511 version is up to date as version 1511. The last I heard the WAU (v.1607) was no longer being pushed through
 automatic update do to the fact that some systems (not all) were/are having issues and problems with it, as far as I know&nbsp;this is still&nbsp;a work in progress. However, if you want to upgrade to WAU (v.1607) you still can but must initiate it yourself (before
 you do check with your OEM to check if your device is compatible with Win 10 v.1607).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Go to All Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;then click on Check for Updates and let it finish. If the version 1607 upgrade shows up as available you will then manually select it to give it permission to install. If it does not show up your device may be on&nbsp;a list
 of problem or incompatible devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Go to the Windows 10 download page, there are two options here:</p>
<p>Preferred: Create the physical installation media by using the Media Creation Tool following the instructions for</p>
<p>"Using the tool to create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) to install Windows 10 on a different PC (click to show more or less information)". This way you will have the installation media to keep to use in the future to boot, for example,
 into the repair menu's if ever need be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or; click on the Update Now button for the online upgrade process (not preferred, in my opinion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To try the troubleshooter for the keyboard go to All Control Panel Items (click the view by: small or large icons&nbsp;near the upper right corner)&gt;Devices and Printers then right-click on the keyboard and select Troubleshoot. If the troubleshooter cannot fix
 the problem then try in the same right-click dropdown selecting Remove device then do a&nbsp;restart of&nbsp;the PC, Windows will then install the device driver that it likes after start up, this may take a minute or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, Good Luck,</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Richard</p>

<p>Thx for your reply.</p>
<p>I'm surprised that you refer to the 2 versions as 2 different O/S's. &nbsp;Haven't seen that info before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Update" (as I understand this, not "Upgrade") from 1511 to 1607 &nbsp;should work for my PC as the MS website checked my PC for update to 1607, and said my PC was good-to-go. &nbsp;I got a 1607-ISO download in Dec. and tried that lengthy process. &nbsp;Finally, my PC
 reported "Couldn't install....", "Failed in the SAFE-OS Phase....". </p>
<p>
</p><p>Beginning to think you're right about "1607 update has problems".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx for idea about the KB &nbsp;Troubleshooter. &nbsp;Tried that and it reported "USB device might have stopped" and "fixed". &nbsp;Odd as my KB was working when I ran the Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ran the Troubleshooter again and it reported "USB device older, might not work in USB 3.0..", and "Not fixed". &nbsp;Again odd, as my KB (still working) is definitely plugged into a USB 2.0 port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am still open to any new help.</p>

            <p>Hi ezed9,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that I make the distinction of upgrade vs. update is because the WAU is indeed a complete new OS installation along the lines of the same procedure as the upgrade from a previous qualifying&nbsp;OS&nbsp;(Windows 7, 8, 8.1).</p>
<p>If&nbsp;during the update (upgrade) installation you choose to save your files and apps it is exactly the same procedure along with the same potential outcome(s). The main difference being that the resulting Windows Old folder that is created for the purpose
 of rolling back if you want or need to is good for only 30 days as opposed to 90 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The check that was run on your device for compatibility with the v.1607 Win 10 tells you that the device hardware is compatible with the OS, not&nbsp;necessarily all of the software, drivers, and potentially corrupted files that exist on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, when an upgrade type of installation (in this case the WAU)&nbsp;repeatedly fails do to&nbsp;such conflicts there are basically&nbsp;2&nbsp;avenues of choice available. One is to chase down and identify and correct the conflict(s) and try again and repeat as needed,
 which is sometimes successful and other times you just&nbsp;end up&nbsp;realizing that the other choice would have been&nbsp;the better, faster, less headache way to go in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other choice (and the&nbsp;best by far) is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean installation with disc erase and reformat, this is the best and most trouble free, both during and after,&nbsp;type of OS installation that is, for any OS, as even a seemingly successful upgrade&nbsp;type of&nbsp;installation can often turn out to be, shall we
 say, a bit buggy after the fact. So, based on past experiences regarding I recommend to you that the best thing to do would be to perform a clean installation of the Win 10 v.1607 OS. It is really not nearly as bad as it sounds and I am fairly confident that&nbsp;you
 will be quite&nbsp;pleased with the end&nbsp;result(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>More info and a detailed tutorial on performing a Full clean installation will be found at the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I hope this helps. If you have more questions, need more help, or have any comments let us know.</p>
<p>Also, please give us feedback on the end results, thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Richard&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit to add more info:</p>
<p>What will be missing on the device after the clean installation will be all of the OEM software (most of which is bloatware) and the recovery partition thereof on the&nbsp;system drive, thusly, ending up with more storage space available for use&nbsp;on the drive.
 If there are any OEM apps that you would&nbsp;like to reinstall&nbsp;to continue to&nbsp;use&nbsp;they&nbsp;can be downloaded from the OEM's support website, individually, with the most up to date versions,&nbsp;for reinstallation at any time thereafter.</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>Thanks for the complete info on how to proceed to update from 1511 to 1607. &nbsp;I'm convinced that the clean install (sounds hard to me) is best way to get a POSSIBLE trouble-free OS. &nbsp;But I just don't have the time or motivation now to do that "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">not
 nearly as bad as it sounds " process. &nbsp;I see that &nbsp;the reference tutorial for the update is 14-pages long.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;I'll wait to update until I have more time and then maybe there will be a update-fix or even another new update without the problems of 1607. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also,
 I'm waiting for guidance on this problem and problem getting &nbsp;a current BIOS update from my PC maker.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So, &nbsp;I'll try to live with my problems with ver.1511 for now.</span></p>
<p>Thanks again for all your info and help.</p>

            <p>Hi Ed, thanks for the update reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, a clean install is always the best way to go with any OS that is, or ever has been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually its a very straightforward and not too time consuming process (if you have the installation media downloaded and created before you start the installation). The preparing before hand can be done at your leisure as in, backing-up your files and collecting
 any 3rd party software installers with the most up to date versions available that you want to reinstall. But, of course, having the necessary procedural knowledge in documentation form or otherwise is the key to a successful outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you make reference to the link that I had supplied being 14 pages it occurred to me the you must be referring to how it showed up as a print to PDF so I checked and that was the length of the print document shown. For what it's worth, that does include
 3 and 1/2 pages of empty (3 pages of wasted paper).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I choose to supply the link to this document as a rule because it is packed full of information not only for the installation process itself but also a plethora of information as to the what, why, how, and best practices before, during, and after the fact
 to achieve not only the best results but also the best most trouble free performance going forward. Included at the end are the instructions for creating a full system disc image so as to then have the best and most versatile type of system backup in your
 "toolbox" for any future use if need be. Of course, those that believe they need just the basic download and initiate info can pluck that out but it's doubtful that that person would be here asking questions other than that on this forum in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a point of reference concerning my personal experience with Windows 10 Pro x64:</p>
<p>I originally installed v.1511 and used it completely trouble free for 6 months then upgraded to v.1607 2 days after it was released (it was released on Aug. 2nd 2016) and have been using it, also trouble free, to date. Therefore, I must conclude that there
 are other players involved, other than the OS itself, with the problems that some (or many if you prefer) people report that they are having with their devices. The most probable being, in no particular order, would be, glitchy hardware, 3rd party software
 and/or utilities (includes OEM apps and tweaks), bad practices, outdated, corrupted, or incorrect drivers, incorrect settings, damaged or missing system files, etc., etc., etc.. The list can go on and on and then some. Hello start fresh with a clean install,
 ahhh, success at last!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to have rambled on a bit but now back to the task at hand. I'm a bit surprised to read that you are having a problem with Asus in procuring a BIOS update for your device (assuming that there is one that has been released), being that you had stated
 earlier that it had already been done and also the fact that these days it should be an easy straightforward process to download that firmware from the OEM's support website as an executable self installer. If I had the complete model description of your device
 I most likely could supply you with a direct link to it but in the absence of that I can supply you with this link to enter the model description information yourself and then search it out (also pay attention to whatever else is available to your device as
 firmware and/or WAU compatibility software: </p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>Your discussion is very clear and very helpful to me. &nbsp;I agree that both, being comfortable/prepared, and doing the clean install, is the way to go for the usual messed-up O/S and other software on my system. &nbsp;And I did printout the "Clean Install" doc for
 my future use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm fairly sure that I should try to fix my ASUS PC "problems" . &nbsp; I have a "Vivo M32CD 1C 156400", and have had several exchange e-mails with ASUS Service Center Support. &nbsp;This 1-year-old PC came with BIOS ver. 0501. &nbsp; ASUS advised me to update to v.
 1004 (ASUS current ver.). &nbsp;But my PC would not accept that update. &nbsp; ASUS then advised me to update to BIOS v.0602, which I did. &nbsp; But my KB problem and other problems continued. &nbsp;So now, ASUS is advising I send my PC to their repair station with a RMA ticket.
 &nbsp; So, I'm planning to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'll post an update here when the smoke clears.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the history&nbsp;of the device that you just described coupled with their technician deciding that issuing an RMA ticket is warranted by all means pursue it. Before you send it off be sure to backup all of your personal files to an external storage device
 for safe keeping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I will be interested&nbsp;in hearing back from you on the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;You're Welcome and Good Luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Richard&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Skype Meeting Broadcast - present attendee video feed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil_crmls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Meeting Broadcast - present attendee video feed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Trying to determine the best way to use Skype Meeting Broadcast for our specific need. We have regular "board" meetings in a conference room and they are currently voice conference only. We would like to make them video capable. Roughly 20-30 attendees usually
 on these calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From our HQ we would have a camera in a conference room with 10-15 people around a table, but would like remote attendees to be able to speak and show their video if they like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the video feeds that are broadcast have to come from Skype Mtg Broadcast "Team Member", or can a feed be broadcast from an audience attendee? If they do have to be a Team Member in order to present, can you restrict them to allow only their video/audio
 feed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx,</p>
<p>-Neil</p>

            <p>Hi Neil,<br />
<br />
Below are answers to your questions one by one:<br />
<em>Q1: Do the video feeds that are broadcast have to come from Skype meeting broadcast "Team Member", or can a feed be broadcast from an audience attendee?</em><br />
A1: The video feeds have to come from the event team members. It’s not feasible for an attendee to broadcast his video feeds.<br />
<em>Q2: If they do have to be a Team Member in order to present, can you restrict them to allow only their video/audio feed?</em><br />
A2: Upon test results and consulting, the answer is no. It’s not workable to restrict other team members to allow only their video/audio feeds.</p>
<p>
