<h2>            DPC Watchdog Violation while installing networked printers</h2>
                    <p>I've got a relatively new Dell Inspiron 5555, but have struggled to get my networked Brother printers installed.&nbsp; When I use the Brother utility, it successfully installs my printer using the USB cable, but cannot find any printer when it gets to the point
 where it searches for networked printers.&nbsp; (Note, my other computers are successfully connected to the printers, so I'd imagine it's not a printer problem or a network problem.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try going old school to manually install a printer using the Control Panel, it slows down at the point of searching for networked printers, freezes and then gives me a DPC Watchdog Violation blue screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got so frustrated that I reformatted the hard drive and reinstalled Windows 10.&nbsp; I'm still having the same troubles with the new installation that I had before.&nbsp; I don't think it matters, but the printer I'm installing is a Brother HL-L2360DW, and a Brother
 MFC-L2740DW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some info:</p>

<p>What other info do you need?&nbsp; I'm not all that sophisticated when it comes to complex computer issues, but I can usually figure my way through things, especially with good directions.&nbsp; As I mentioned, this is a new installation of Windows (last night) so
 error logs are going to be very brief if anyone wants to look at them.</p>

<p>... Never mind!&nbsp; Not sure how, but I finally (after weeks of trying, then reformatting and trying some more) got the two printers installed and working.<br />
</p>
<p>Actually, I still would like to know if anyone has any idea what the issue could have been.&nbsp; It was a very frustrating problem and after many crashes led to problems logging in when powering up.</p>

<h2>            Change server location&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>HI everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My connection is 85 Mbps down 12 Mbps up 9 latency. When I test it on my xbox 1 I only got 35 down 12 up 84 latency. so with this being side is there a way to change servers so my pping is lower and my speed is where it should be. its pretty annoying as
 I'm trying to download a game its a few games at 39 gigabytes and I'm only getting less than half the speed I should be getting.</p>

<p>O packet loss NAT open UPnP on. All settings correct.</p>



<p>Thanks Mike</p>

<p>Hi That Guy!</p>
<p>It's far more likely that your download is suffering because of the high demand Xbox Live is under at this time. Moving Server will not fix that problem.</p>
<p>I'd expect this to improve as the new console rush abates over time</p>

<p>I was also thinking this, Normally I would route it through a proxy on my Media PC like I do for PS3 that tends to jump the speed quite a bit.</p>
<p>Is there a way to use a proxy setting on the Xbox One?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, I think CosmicThoughts was correct and it is just the server under load.</p>
<p>I ran the test again at (7PM EST) and got the fowling results:</p>
<p>Download Speed: &nbsp; &nbsp;60.03 Mbps</p>
<p>Upload Speed: &nbsp; &nbsp;12.23 Mbps</p>
<p>Total packet loss: &nbsp; 0% For both</p>
<p>MTU: &nbsp; 1480</p>
<p>Latency: &nbsp; 82MS</p>
<p>This was around the speed I was expecting as I believe the servers are located in California, Virginia and Washington. &nbsp;I live in Georgia so I know I won't be hitting the max speeds for me.</p>
<p>I suppose I'll just start downloading large games at night.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone.</p>

            <p>There doesn't seem to be much information about this if&nbsp;you mean C:\i2api_debug.log.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best guess is it's some kind of disk controller log. See:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/3524/p/18821044/18956857.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/3524/p/18821044/18956857.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program that creates the log is called webPAM. You can try deleting the file. If that does not work, there is information about deleting the logfiles from WebPAM in the manual:</p>
<p><a href="http://firstweb.promise.com/upload/Support/Manual/5_WebPAM%20User%20Manual%20v1.4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://firstweb.promise.com/upload/Support/Manual/5_WebPAM%20User%20Manual%20v1.4.pdf</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should consult your computer manual and the manufacturer's website to see if you can find more information about this and also look for any updates.</p>

</p><p>Even though you might get this message, you can always run Windows Update after installing Windows 10 and download the latest driver.
</p>
<p>I recently installed Windows 10 on an HP Elitebook to see how well the most recent Windows 10 build performs. The Elitebook is a fairly recent model notebook which includes an assortment of hardware technologies. Out of the box though I did not get a complete
 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing drivers through Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is the premier starting point to resolve most common driver issues you might experience immediately after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply launch it from <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update and Security </strong>and click <strong>Check for Updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></p>
<p>Type: <strong>wuapp</strong></p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Check for updates (make sure you have an active Internet connection). </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffef491e-e2d1-4398-89fc-d15108bc34a9" /></p>
<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my Antivirus be compatible with Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely not. Windows 10 will require that you have a version of your Antivirus that is designed for Windows 10. It is recommended that you uninstall your current Antivirus before intiating the upgrade. If you have a subscription that has not expired,
 contact the developer to find out about Windows 10 support. Most Antivirus utilities should be upgraded by the time Windows 10 launches. If your subscription is still active, then you should be entitled to a compatible update for Windows 10</p>

<h2>            How to Disable Windows Updates Permanently&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I <strong>PERMANENTLY</strong> disable windows 10 updates?&nbsp; I disabled the windows update service in March after 1709 updated and crashed my (6 month old stock) system.&nbsp; The only recourse I had was to reset it which resulted in a great loss of my
 personal files.&nbsp; &nbsp;After that fiasco I decided no more updates unless I authorize them, however, somewhere along the line Microsoft saw fit to re-enable windows update service and installed updates without my knowledge or permission.&nbsp; Tonight it installed KB4023057.&nbsp;
 Now my system is freezing after about 20min of usage or anytime I try to have more than 1 app or webpage open.&nbsp; The system process is using 100% of my hard drive and I have 32 svchost.exe running.&nbsp; I disabled updates again in services and rebooted.&nbsp; I checked
 services after I rebooted to confirm it was still disabled.&nbsp; After experiencing a lag, I checked windows updates and sure enough windows was trying to update 1803 which failed.&nbsp; I checked services again and windows update was enabled.&nbsp; I no longer want windows
 updates.&nbsp; When Microsoft provides me with a free laptop, then they can tell me what hardware and software I can run on it.&nbsp; I am so frustrated.&nbsp; I have already run chkdsk and it found errors.&nbsp; I have not yet repaired them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm considering my options based
 on feedback about disabling updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amused are you? Well great at least one of us should be.&nbsp; Its not a laughing matter when you lose your data that took days even hours to create.&nbsp; And yes, I do keep backups but its time to reset everything.&nbsp; To answer your rhetorical question, why one would
 buy a device with Windows 10 and not want to use it.&nbsp; Here's my answer, I DIDN'T buy a Windows 10 device,&nbsp; I bought a Windows 7 device which was forced updated to Windows 10 upon bootup like so many other users experienced.&nbsp; It is the only device I own that
 has Windows 10.&nbsp; All others are still using Windows 7 which I have no intention of ever upgrading.&nbsp; When its no longer possible to use Win 7, I will migrate everything to Linux.</p>

<p><em>I remember those days! </em>That was a lousy thing for Microsoft to do. It showcases their arrogance. There was a way to avoid being upgraded, and it was easy, but you had to know to download one of the two third-party applications that prevented the
 upgrade from happening, and unless you were the type who likes to read technical computer websites (guilty!) you wouldn't know about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft stopped doing that on July 29, 2016, so you can go back to Windows 7 if that's what you want. You actually have several choices, and you may as well pick one of them, because Windows 10 is not going to stop upgrading computers. Here are your choices:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- (From the Rub Salt in Your Wound Dep't) If you had an image backup of Windows 7, you could restore that in a matter of minutes. No matter what you choose to do, daily image backups make life much easier.</p>
<p>2- Do a factory restore, which will bring your computer back to the way it was when it left the factory.</p>
<p>3- Do a clean install of Windows 7, if you have an installer and a license - you can use your original license. You can
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
get an ISO from Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>4-&nbsp;<em>IF</em> your computer's hardware is supported on Windows 10, you can do a Windows 10 reset, which is a clean install of Windows 10. Sometimes the reset procedure fails, so in that case you can do a clean install on your own&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
following Microsoft's procedure</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You shouldn't try step #4 unless you're certain that the manufacturers of the hardware in your computer support their hardware on Windows 10. If not, there's no guarantee that your hardware will work properly (or at all) on Windows 10. It might or it might
 not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5- As long as you have other computers that run Windows 7 successfully, why not try Linux? It's a very competent operating system and Mint has a user friendly interface. There's a learning curve to Linux, of course. It's not 'like Windows only different'
 but if you have a willingness to learn and a spirit of adventure, you could really enjoy Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Linux is not likely to become your go-to operating system - the Linux community is too geeky to make that happen (in my opinion) - but it will always be a worthy alternative.</p>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20.&nbsp; I should have restored my laptop immediately after it did the Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; Although Windows 10 wasn't what I wanted or purchased, once it loaded I said, "self give it a shot, you may like it."&nbsp; So that's why I kept it.&nbsp; Then
 when it updated with fall creators edition, it all went sideways.&nbsp; I thought I prevented the updates by disabling the service which is why I never restored back to Windows 7.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't set group policies as Kapil suggested due to my Windows&nbsp;
 version is the home edition.&nbsp; For the time being I've set it to metered but I have a feeling Microsoft will have the reach to turn that off as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll probably have to do a fresh install of Windows 7 in the next few days just to stop the madness.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are a lot of people that had big issues with Windows 7, however, I never did.&nbsp; The minor things I did experience never resulted in a re-image,
 lost data or downtime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running some legacy software that I don't believe is Linux compatible so that's the reason I haven't switched over yet.&nbsp; The new versions of the software appear to be compatible so I'll probably invest in those soon and begin the migration.&nbsp; I have
 6 other computers running Windows 7 that I will also have to switch over so my slow progression has also been about time availability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are a lot smarter than I.&nbsp; Keep reading those technical sites.&nbsp; I think I'm going to start now that I know that developers are putting in more permissions than they should.&nbsp; I know Microsoft is not the only one doing it and I need to be more aware of
 what they are all up to.&nbsp; I can't lose another 8 hour body of work because windows sneaks in an update before my backup has time to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; I really do appreciate it.</p>

<h2>            my webcam turns for 1 sec green and follow up with a weird video effect</h2>
                    <p>Dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i am skyping with someone sometimes my webcam turns for 1 second green and then switches over in a weird video effect. It looks like there are multiple frames at the same time showing. So lets say in a normal video you see frame1 turns to frame2 turns
 to frame 3 turns to framt 4. In this effect it is more like frame1 + frame2 + frame 3 turns into frame 2 +frame 3 + frame 4. It is annoying and i cannot find any fix,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance<br />

            Can you confirm if the web cam works properly in other apps such as the Camera app?
<br />
<br />Check your antivirus software
<br />
<br />In your antivirus app, look for settings related to blocking access or permission to use your webcam. For help, visit your antivirus software company’s website.
<br />Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results.
<br />    Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers.
<br />    Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If it’s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />    If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.
<br />
<br />Roll back your webcam driver
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers don’t provide a rollback option.)
<br />    After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If rolling back didn’t work or isn’t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt; Delete the driver software for this device, and then select OK.
<br />    In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Scan for hardware changes. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If your webcam still doesn’t work, try looking for help on the webcam manufacturer’s website. 
<br />
<br />Also make sure Skype is updated. 
<br />
<br />Try uninstall Skype then reinstall it.

<p>Dear Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you quick reply.<br />
<br />
I tried all the above and find something. I don't find any file name names steam.sys, but I also can't rollback my webcam driver update. I think indeed that my webcam is newer then my Skype version. The only thing is that i really don't like the windows 10
 app Skype because you are not able to change the audio. So i think there is no other way then to start living with the windows 10 application Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 thing. My camera works fine on Skype at the moment. It works okay there are just moment when the camera shows this malfunction. i am trying to find a pattern why it is doing that. It happend around 2 times in a Skype call of 3 hours and it lasts for 7-10
 minutes. It mostly happens when I alt+tab to google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Robin</p>

<h2>            Photos app keep adding lawlessly main Pictures folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft Photos app is nice and I like slideshow tile. But, I don't want to have ALL photos in my computer visible through this app. Some of them are p r i v a t e, other are some schematic or technical junk that no one want to look at. So I deleted
 in setting main Pictures folder as a source for app and added couple of subfolders containing safe and nice pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT this crazy blyat' keeps adding main folder, every time I delete it, and it don't seem to be tired with this game. How can it be, that I can't specify what I want to have displayed and what nope, and how can it be that it ignores my will and does this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, is it a way to discourage system from adding Pictures to libraries, because that can cause problem and not app itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Grzegorz</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response and keeping the status updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also set a specific photo to be displayed on the tile. To do so, open the Pictures app and photo you want to display. Right-click on the photo. You will, in the menu bar which appears at the bottom, see
<strong>Set as</strong>. Click on it and then select <strong>Photos tile</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To show only selected pictures in the app tile on the Start Screen, you will have to remove default folders and add a folder to the
<strong>Pictures library</strong>. To add or remove the folders in Pictures library, do the following in Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open your <em>C:\Users\username\Pictures </em>folder and create a new folder Next, open your
<em>C:\Users\username\Pictures\Tile Slideshow</em> in it. Move the pictures you want to be displayed to this folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now right-click an a blank space in the Navigation Pane of the Windows 10&nbsp;file libraries&nbsp;and select
<strong>Show Libraries</strong>. You will now see the Libraries displayed. Right-click on the Pictures library and select Properties.In the Properties box, you will see the default
<em>Pictures</em> and <em>Public Pictures</em> folder included. Using the <strong>
Add</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons, you will have to remove these two folders. Next add the newly created
<em>Tile Slideshow</em> folder to the Pictures library. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So now the Pictures library will include only the Slideshow folder. Click Apply, OK and Exit. Restart the computer and check the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, we will be glad to help you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>selecting option to back up only changed files and to delete the prior - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brucelerner  say:</h3>
<h2>            selecting option to back up only changed files and to delete the prior file</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to put in the settings that will direct my Windows 10 &nbsp;backup (to an external HD) to delete an old file when backing up a revised version of that file.&nbsp; The options seem to combine two features:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; How far back to look for files to delete, i.e., 1 year old, 2 years old, etc.&nbsp; and</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; To delete the old file when backing up a revised version of it.&nbsp; I find these two features in one setting to be confusing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>A.&nbsp;If I were to select 3 years and then accept this option, would it only delete the files that I've revised or will it delete all files 3 or more years&nbsp;old?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or</p>
<p>
</p><p>B.&nbsp; Will it only go back 3 years to look for the file that I've revised so that it can be replaced with the revised version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm trying to do is only delete old files that I've revised and (obviously) back up the revised file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for getting in touch with Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Backup allows you to make copies of data files for all people that use the computer. You can let Windows choose what to back up or you can select the individual folders,
 libraries, and drives that you want to back up. By default, your backups are created on a regular schedule. You can change the schedule and you can manually create a backup at any time. Once you set up Windows Backup, Windows keeps track of the files and folders
 that are new or modified and adds them to your backup.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the response, Syed, but it didn't really address my question.&nbsp; It's my fault for not taking you to the site in the backup setup section&nbsp;that generated the question.&nbsp; So, I'll do that now, starting on the Backup page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup Page--&gt; more options--&gt; see advanced settings--&gt; advanced settings--&gt;clean up versions--&gt; "Delete older versions of files and folders"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It's in the Delete older versions...&nbsp;site that I have my concerns.&nbsp; The explanatory wording is confusing to me.&nbsp; If I select 2 years, will the backup process then delete all files older than 2 years?&nbsp; Or will it just go back up to&nbsp;2 years to find&nbsp;the file
 (that has been changed by me), delete it and replace it with the revised/changed file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that clarifies my question sufficiently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Problem with pixelated display</h2>

<p>I have Ati radeon r7 240 graphics card</p>
<p>My problem started after changing resolution in game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried this</p>
<p>1. reinstall graphics driver</p>
<p>2. disconnecting grapihcs card and pluging the cable into integrated port on motherboard&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. reinstall windows 10</p>
<p>4. several other cables and displays</p>
<p>5. old drivers and even without drivers&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. in the bios it is okay but when windows logo on boot disapears and dots only start animation then the problem starts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for helping !<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t change account picture and lockscreen wallpaper on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>As the title says I'm not able to change my account picture and the lockscreen wallpaper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm logging into my machine via my Microsoft account. Even changing the avatar picture on the website doesn't change the picture of the avatar in my local Windows installation. Account synchronization is set active in my Windows settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When clicking on the folder button on my local acount settings and selecting a picture from my HDD I get this, regardless of filetype and location:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abf7275b-ded6-42b7-960c-a7aae6fe55dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abf7275b-ded6-42b7-960c-a7aae6fe55dd" /></a></p>
<p>It says: Account picture error - Setting the account picture failed. Please try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to change my lockscreen picture, I don't get any error message but this (an indicator that never stops spinning):<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76b31ae9-8404-45c7-b69e-59f290e2352b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76b31ae9-8404-45c7-b69e-59f290e2352b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After reopening this settings page it shows the default picture again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did SFC /SCANNOW as it seems to be some kind of standard answer to similar questions. It runs 100% with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the DISM "solution" (<span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth) to no avail.</span></p>
<p><br />
This problem persits for some months now.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm using an administator account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My install of Windows is activated.</p>
<p>My version is 1703 (Build 15063.540).</p>
<p>My installation of Windows 10 is a clean install (including CU), no upgrade from an older version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is posted&nbsp;<a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=windows+10+can%27t+change+account+picture+site:answers.microsoft.com&amp;safe=off&amp;hl=de&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=760&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwianvDyyfTVAhXCVxoKHc1hCdMQrQIIOygEMAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="just an example">everywhere
 over the net</a>, but no solution works.</p>
<p>I tried some registry hacks that also didn't work (and reverted all of them after that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just hope that Microsoft get's aware of this fault and will fix this soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if I can contribute more info to get this problem reported properly.</p>

<p>Hello Cassini,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern, we suggest that you try the troubleshooting steps and information provided by Divya Murugan on this

<p>Yeah, no this doesn't work. It changes nothing. I forgot to mention this hack in my first post.</p>
<p>My setting was on "not configured" and I changed it to "deactivated". The problem persits.</p>
<p><span>I also tried the "clean boot" as described by&nbsp;</span><span>Divya Murugan, no change.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to force the lockscreen via gpedit.msc, it doesn't work.</p>
<p><span><br />

</span></p>
<p><strong>Also, how should this hack bring back my ability to change my avatar picture?</strong></p>
<p>Could you at least please accept that these two problems are correlating and not just ignore my post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also did you even read the thread you linked? Did your suggested solution fix the problem of the user?</p>
<p>No, it didn't. Why waste my time with an answer like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I understand you're just trying to help.</p>
<p>First thing to help users with this problem would be to take these reports seriously. I don't really know what your "Microsoft"-tag besides your name means but you should use it to communicate
 these reports to someone who can really do something to fix this problem.</p>
<p><span><br />
I'm really willing to work this out.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Let me know what I should try next to show you that Microsoft dun goofed.</span></p>

    <title>0x00000024 reboot loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhwonderdog  say:</h3>
<h2>            0x00000024 reboot loop</h2>
                    
<p>I restarted Vista recently as it was running very slowly, and it got stuck in a continuous reboot loop. Startup repair also fails to load properly and reboots before I can do anything with it. After turning off the automatic reboot I was shown a BSOD with
 an error message:</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000024 (0x00190444, 0x86ec9940, 0xc0000102, 0x00000000).</p>
<p>I am told to run chkdsk but do not know how to do so as I cannot get into Vista at all.</p>
<p>Safe mode gets stuck at crcdisk.sys and reboots.</p>
<p>Any ideas? How do I run chkdsk without getting into Windows?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Disk corruption or hardware related to disk operation (hard drive, cabling, and mother board controller),<br />
lack of enough system memory, BIOS and antivirus/antispyware/security programs can all have a role.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<strong><br />
BCCode: 24&nbsp; 0x00000024&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong>
<p>One possible cause of this bug check is disk corruption. Corruption in the NTFS file system or bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk can induce this error. Corrupted SCSI and IDE drivers can also adversely affect the system's ability to read and write to
 disk, thus causing the error.</p>
<p>Another possible cause is depletion of nonpaged pool memory. If the nonpaged pool memory is completely depleted, this error can stop the system. However, during the indexing process, if the amount of available nonpaged pool memory is very low, another kernel-mode
 driver requiring nonpaged pool memory can also trigger this error<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>To resolve a disk corruption problem:</em> Check Event Viewer for error messages from SCSI and FASTFAT (System Log) or Autochk (Application Log) that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Try disabling any virus scanners,
 backup programs, or disk defragmenter tools that continually monitor the system. You should also run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Run<strong>Chkdsk&nbsp;/f&nbsp;/r</strong>
 to detect and resolve any file system structural corruption. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition.</p>
<p><em>To resolve a nonpaged pool memory depletion problem:</em> Either add new physical memory to the computer (thus increasing the quantity of nonpaged pool memory available to the kernel), or reduce the number of files on the Services for Macintosh (SFM)
 volume<br />
<br />
Schedule chkdsk (checkdisk)&nbsp;to run at next start. <br />

                    I was messing around with my new computer (Dell Inspiron 15 3000 series) and when changing my desktop picture, got stuck in the high contrast font. &nbsp;I tried to change it back and it wouldn't. &nbsp;So after an hour, I tried changing the colors to white. &nbsp;Unfortunately
 that worked. &nbsp;Now EVERYTHING is white, so I cannot read any print at all. &nbsp;Which means that I can't change it back!!!! &nbsp;HELP!

<p>
</p><p>Resetting your PC reinstalls Windows but deletes your files, settings, and apps—except for the apps that came with your PC. You will lose your files if you have installed Windows 8.1 Operating System on D drive. If you haven't installed the Operating System
 on D drive, then you will not lose any files in D: drive. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Refer to the section "Remove everything and reinstall Windows".</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. All apps that you installed will be removed. Only apps that came with your PC will be reinstalled.</p>

                    I have been running window 8.1 since it came out without issue. I installed the updates that come out last week or so and when the system rebooted it just goes to a black/black screen. No mouse cursor or anything.
<br />
<br />
I got to the windows recovery screen and tried to revert back to before the installation of the updates, but this gave me an error and said it could not be done; i do not remember the error. So after trying everything I could find, I was forced to go back and
 reinstall windows 8 from scratch, losing all my data. Windows 8 work just fine and I am now running it with all updates installed.<br />
<br />
When I try to upgrade back to windows 8.1 it gets to the 40% mark and the screen goes black/blank never to be seen again. It even reboots at one point, but the screen is still black/blank. After powering it off, one hour later, it reboots and reverts back to
 windows 8 with an error saying that it could not install 8.1.<br />
<br />
I have read all the items on the video driver and I have an HP touch screen laptop Spectre xt touchsmart. I went to HP and loaded the most updated video driver. I first tried installing the windows 8.1 before installing the new driver and after installing the
 new driver with no difference in the error I got trying to install Windows 8.1.<br />
<br />
To be clear, I have a totally blank screen, no cursor or anything at all.<br />

            <p>Thank you for your reply, but this is not the answer to the problem. I had been running Windows 8.1 for months before I updated the video driver (as part of the normal update process). This is when everything went wrong.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system rebooted to the black/blank screen after the video driver update. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system restore points could not be used because Windows gave me an error when it tried to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was forced to reinstall a clean version of Windows 8. After installing the windows 8 drivers, and before installing any other items, I tried to upgrade to Windows 8.1 and got the Black/Blank screen at the 40% mark. The screen never shows anything, not
 the cursor or anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After turning off the system and turning it back on, Windows reverts back to Windows 8. Everything works great on Windows 8. Again, this is with no applications installed, just a totally clean Windows 8 with updates installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system also has nothing attached to it, no printers, hard drives, external monitors, nothing at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system is an HP Spectre xt TouchSmart that comes from HP with Windows 8 preloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Now I am really in trouble :(<br />
<br />
I followed the instructions on the other link and got it to load windows 8.1 and all seemed well, but none of my office programs would open (e.g. Outlook, Word, Excel). so I tried to repair them, but this failed and said to try restarting, so I did. While trying
 to open Outlook the screen flashed a few times, once giving me a very low res screen, then back to the black/Blank screen of death!<br />
<br />
After rebooting/resetting the computer, now I have a blue screen saying I cannot boot! It says<br />
Recovery<br />
Your PC needs to be recovered<br />
The boot configuration Data file is missing some required information.<br />
File: \BCD<br />
Error code: 0x0000034<br />
<br />
I guess I have to do a fresh install of Windows 8 again!!!<br />

            I did not do anything, This entire process happened within the first 5 minutes of Windows 8.1 coming up. It looked like the system was trying to do something with the video driver though, as the screen flashed a few times with one of these times showing
 a very low res screen (huge icons).<br />
<br />
UPDATE: I rebuilt the BCD and got the system to reboot. I just let it sit there after I logged in and within 30 seconds, the screen went black. After waiting 5 minutes with the black screen and nothing else happening, I restarted the system and back came the
 recovery screen.<br />

<p>That may be manageable.&nbsp; Sounds like the same symptom that I got when I was experimenting with a low res boot.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was actually a surprise to me that that Start Screen would show at all.&nbsp; The consequences of being in a low res boot only show when you try
 opening a MUF app.&nbsp; E.g. it would tell you that your display properties were not sufficient to run that app.&nbsp;&nbsp; Desktop apps worked without that complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; The really good news (another surprise) is that I was then able to switch to normal video within that
 boot simply by using Win-P and picking a different&nbsp;configuration, e.g. Extended.&nbsp; So, if your video problems are only during the boot you may still be able to use your preferred drivers after the OS is loaded.</p>

<p>Black screen or blank screen?&nbsp; The difference is significant IMO.&nbsp; E.g. a blank screen can show you that your mouse pointer can be used.&nbsp; More importantly, if your keyboard is working you can use it to switch display configuration, which at least would cause
 the display to refresh if not render the correct view on the monitor you are looking at.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect the recovery screen is simply a reaction to you causing a hard restart to get out of that scenario, similar to the warning screen that we having been getting
 forever under the same conditions--unexpected, unmanaged shut down, manually caused or not.<br />

 windows 8.1. </p>

            I have this issue, as well, and greatly wish for it to be fixed. Windows 8.1 acts as if it installs properly, then it goes into the reboot part of the install, makes it to the 40% mark of the second time a loading percentage comes up, and then goes blank/black.
 (No cursor on the screen, just black.) I have made sure to install all of the current updates, and I ran the upgrade assistant to make sure my laptop was compatible (which everything was.)
<div><br />
<div>I'd greatly like to update to Windows 8.1, but currently, I had to restore my computer back to regular Windows 8.</div>

            <p>I had this problem and luckily the solution for me was easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>A&nbsp;generic i7 PC</p>
<p>NVidia Quadro NVS510</p>
<p>DisplayPort monitors. Two using DP 1.2 Daisy Chaining.</p>
<p>Upgrading from Windows 8 to 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the upgrade from Win 8 to 8.1, the display went blank after reboot and the keyboard LEDs no longer responded to Caps Lock etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple power cycles resulted in the same behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The single action that fixed it for me was to change the settings on my Dell Monitor -&nbsp;to disable Display Port 1.2. I.e. no changes at all to the PC itself - only the on screen display of the monitor. On the next reboot, the install continued without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen that many NVidia users are having problems, so I guess that this might be because NVidia are one of the first companies to support DisplayPort 1.2 Daisy Chaining on their cards. Perhaps the problem I had was related to some part of the install
 not catering for multiple monitors on a single DisplayPort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this is the fix for some others out there.</p>

<h2>            Storage Space Issues - 0xc0380030 and other errors</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to utilize the storage spaces a bit more in Windows 8 (tested it out with a mirrored one when I first set up almost a year ago).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem is that I cannot add drives to the existing storage space (again - mirrored). &nbsp;I initially set it up with (3) 2 TB drives with the intent of adding the 4th drive as soon as I cleared some data off of an existing home server (and also let Windows
 8 work out any bugs with the new storage spaces). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now - the drive is installed - and the existing storage space will NOT let me add the drive. &nbsp;I get a slew of errors, but mostly the&nbsp;0xc0380030 packet ID error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also decided to utilize a storage pool to place the various "my" documents to free up space on my SSD. &nbsp;I can make a "1 drive" storage pool - moved some items over to said drive, and then when I tried to add the second drive? &nbsp;Same error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not a pro - I know enough to be slightly dangerous. &nbsp;I did build this system myself, I've checked forums and so forth to try and figure this out on my own. &nbsp;I can't find much on this error. &nbsp;What I have found, I have tried. &nbsp;The drives are all GPT.
 &nbsp;I've deleted the volumes before trying to add to the pools. &nbsp;I've disabled Intel Rapidstart. &nbsp;I've fiddled with the storage configuration in BIOS. &nbsp;I've read that if I delete all of it and start from scratch I should be able to rebuild the pools with all
 drives attached - but that REALLY defeats my purpose. &nbsp;The whole point is to add drives when storage starts becoming tight. &nbsp;I have a lot of data, and I don't want to have to move, delete, rebuild, and retransfer every time I need to add more storage.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My intent was to utilize this setup to replace the windows home server I had (which Microsoft decided to stop supporting) by utilizing the functions in Windows 8. &nbsp;I've spent a lot of time trying to get this thing to work right.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using Windows 8 Pro (store bought)</div>
<div>Asrock z77 Pro4 mobo</div>
<div>Intel i5-3570k CPU</div>
<div>8 GB RAM</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just a bit frustrated. &nbsp;I am probably missing something really easy - but I'm not sure what it is.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your time! &nbsp;Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</div>

            FYI - I managed to get my one mirrored storage space back online after adding 2 more drives (and rescued the data). &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>In regards to the pool, I still couldn't add another drive, but after researching this issue ad nauseum, have decided that WIndows 8 Storage spaces is not ready for prime time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will be purchasing drivebender or another 3rd party software to take care of my storage issues. &nbsp;Microsoft really needs to re-think even advertising that this works. &nbsp;I'm not dumb (I did figure out how to rescue data) and if I am having issues, I can
 only imagine what a normal person without many tech skills would think. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Great idea - poor execution. &nbsp;I am still a Microsoft fan - it's just too bad I have to go "outside" to get the tools I need to accomplish what should have been an easy task. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>
