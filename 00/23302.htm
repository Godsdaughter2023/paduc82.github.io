    <title>Table defaults to different indentation on second page - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Table defaults to different indentation on second page</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone. &nbsp;Hoping someone can help with this problem. I have a document that has been formatted by someone else that I need to submit answers to questions on. &nbsp;The formatting on the document is all over the place and it's quite difficult to see where
 the question I ned to respond to ends and my response starts so I've decided to provide my answers in a shaded single cell table below the question so it's easy for the reader to see where my response starts and ends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I'm having is that I have an answer that spans more than a page and when it falls over onto the next page the table shifts by about a centimetre to the right. &nbsp;I haven't inserted any page breaks, this is happening automatically when the table spills
 to the second page. &nbsp;When I try to line up the table on the second page with the table on the first page, both tables move and the centimetre difference remains (which is natural considering it's actually just one table, not two).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really want to split it into two separate tables because I'm anticipating more text will be added as the submission develops and I'd rather not have to keep going back to adjust page breaks etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Margins on both pages show as exactly the same. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p><span>Hi Pauline,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In your case, could you share some screenshots about the symptom for clarification?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, about “</span>I have a document that has been formatted by someone else that I need to submit answers to questions on.”, do you mean that the document is encrypted?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, could you share the version of your Mac (Go to top menu&gt;Click Apple icon&gt;About this Mac) and Word (Go to Word&gt;Click Word on the top menu&gt;About Word) with us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Rodney</p>

<p>Thanks very much Rodney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac is version 10.11.6 (El Capitan)</p>
<p>Word is Word for Mac 2011</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document isn't encrypted but it is a tender response form that needs to be submitting using the supplied response form. &nbsp;Because the formatting of the tender response form seems to be designed to ensure the tender review committee will find it very hard
 to see where a question finishes and the answer starts, I am creating a one cell table for each answer which I'm then shading in light grey so they can easily identify our response text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshots below - first shows ruler and layout settings when I click in the top page. &nbsp;Second shows the same when I click in the second page (note the ruler seems to move about 1 cm to the right when I click the second page even though the settings are
 unchanged and it is all one table)</p>

<h2>            query</h2>
                    <p>trying to do pivot tables in excel using data from a filemaker db.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>running filemaker off a server...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>here's what we have:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><u>SERVER:</u></b></p>
<p>We have a server (mac server running Mac OS X Server)</p>
<p>The server is running Filemaker server pro 10.6.8 [ yes... ODBC / JDBC is enabled in the FileMaker Server Admin Console Configuration ]</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><u>TERMINAL:</u></b></p>
<p>My terminal is a macbook running mac OSX 10.7.3.</p>
<p>I am running excel from office for mac 2011 (i upgraded after discovering this would not work on office for mac 2008). excel version 14.0.0.</p>
<p>My terminal also has Filemaker Pro 11 [ 11.0v4 ]</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I ran the Actual ODBC pack with the following options.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The driver i chose was the <i>FileMaker ODBC</i>... but is that correct? should i choose the
<i>Actual Open Source Database</i> one? if the <i>Filemaker ODBC</i> driver is not correct, this could be the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In any case, i use the <i>Filemaker ODBC</i> driver, name it, i put in the IP address of the host server just like this:
<i>10.0.1.51</i>. i select the "connect to host to obtain the names of the available databases" The names show up, i select my database.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the next page, i hit the "test" button... enter my name &amp; password for the filemaker db, and get a "test completed successfully"&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>in the ReadMe File it says:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><i>Note: If you are using Excel X, you will need to download and install MS Query X,</i></p>
<p><i>which is not included in the default MS Office X installation. MS Query X is a free</i></p>
<p><i>download available from the Microsoft website at </i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><i>www.microsoft.com/mac</i></span></a><i>. You</i></p>
<p><i>should search for “Query X”, download the package, and run the installer.</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When i bring this in, i get, I can't use this because powerPC Applications are "no longer supported"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When i go to excel to "Run a new Database Query" excel freezes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated. I have been on the phone with Filemaker support, and Actual technologies via email.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As stated, i had to upgrade from office for mac 2008 to office for mac 2011 because i found an obscure corner of the some support community stating queries like this wouldn't work in office 2008.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i hope that is not true for office for mac 2011.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <span>In order to connect MS Excel to a FileMaker database, you need to use the "FileMaker ODBC" driver available from FileMaker, Inc. &nbsp;It sounds like you already have that installed.</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>To use FM as a data source, you do not need a driver from Actual Technologies. &nbsp;Our drivers let you use FM (and Excel) as a "front end" to other databases, such as Oracle,
 MySQL, etc.</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>In order to use MS Query on Lion, you will need to make sure you have the latest updates installed. &nbsp;MS Excel 2011 version 14.1.2 was the first update to include a native
 Intel version of MS Query. &nbsp;The latest update to MS Office 2011 is available here:</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads</a></span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>Again, to use ODBC, you must have MS Office 14.1.2 or later. &nbsp;You will not be able to use ODBC with 14.0.0.</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>Once you have MS Office 2011 with the latest update installed, you should be able to successfully connect to your FileMaker database.</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />

<h2>            &#34;We&#39;re sorry, but Excel has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Excel will need to be closed as a result. Woud you like us to repair now&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    This is the constant error message that I get when I use any of my Office Professional 2013 applications. If I do a fresh install, quick repair, or online repair, the programs work fine until I restart my computer or shut it down for the night and turn
 it back on in the morning. If I do either of those, the issue persists. I am so sick of the "advanced tech team" in India I could just puke because they have not accomplished anything in fixing this. Nothing. I purchased this software on June 3rd of this year
 and I haven't yet been able to use it because of this damn error. I worked with tier 1, 2 and then the Global Escalation Team for almost 2 weeks for tech support and none of them were able to resolve my issue. Here's what I/they did:&nbsp;
<div>
<ul>
<li>Fresh install of my Windows 7 - 2 times!</li><li>Online repairs through the control panel.</li><li>Cleaned out the registry.</li><li>Installed through the disc I was sent in the mail from Microsoft - 3 times!</li><li>Checked and unchecked compatibility.</li><li>Checked for ABYYY - Never had it installed</li><li>Checked the various add-ins for Word and Excel.</li></ul>
I have done absolutely everything I can to fix this. None of the tech teams have fixed this issue after over a month. In fact, a new case was just re-opened last week. The tech team was supposed to work on it further last week sometime, but I don't have time
 to sit and monitor them and log into my computer every time they reboot my computer for something. I have three jobs and don't have time!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, if anybody has a possible solution, please, tell me! There's nothing wrong with Windows because it's been freshly installed 2 times now. I've done countless online/quick repairs. The registry has been cleaned thoroughly many times. I have installed
 it from the disc at least 3 times now. Does anybody else have this issue? Have you fixed it, if so, how? If you did something different other than any of these things, please help me out! I really would like to start using these programs!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any help! I really appreciate it!&nbsp;</div>

<div>Just do this as a trial, if you have access to a different system, check if the same happens when you install office using the disk.</div>

            <blockquote>This is the constant error message that I get when I use any of my Office Professional 2013 applications. If I do a fresh install, quick repair, or online repair, the programs work fine until I restart my computer or shut it
 down for the night and turn it back on in the morning. If I do either of those, the issue persists. I am so sick of the "advanced tech team" in India I could just puke because they have not accomplished anything in fixing this. Nothing. I purchased this software
 on June 3rd of this year and I haven't yet been able to use it because of this damn error. I worked with tier 1, 2 and then the Global Escalation Team for almost 2 weeks for tech support and none of them were able to resolve my issue. Here's what I/they did:&nbsp;
<div>
<ul>
<li>Fresh install of my Windows 7 - 2 times!</li><li>Online repairs through the control panel.</li><li>Cleaned out the registry.</li><li>Installed through the disc I was sent in the mail from Microsoft - 3 times!</li><li>Checked and unchecked compatibility.</li><li>Checked for ABYYY - Never had it installed</li><li>Checked the various add-ins for Word and Excel.</li></ul>
I have done absolutely everything I can to fix this. None of the tech teams have fixed this issue after over a month. In fact, a new case was just re-opened last week. The tech team was supposed to work on it further last week sometime, but I don't have time
 to sit and monitor them and log into my computer every time they reboot my computer for something. I have three jobs and don't have time!</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, if anybody has a possible solution, please, tell me! There's nothing wrong with Windows because it's been freshly installed 2 times now. I've done countless online/quick repairs. The registry has been cleaned thoroughly many times. I have installed
 it from the disc at least 3 times now. Does anybody else have this issue? Have you fixed it, if so, how? If you did something different other than any of these things, please help me out! I really would like to start using these programs!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Thanks for any help! I really appreciate it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update (3/17/2014):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have resolved this issue. Being that Microsoft is extremely cautious about pirated and torrented software, they only allow their programs to be installed once. Once you install it, a file is put into your computer not allowing for it to ever be re-installed
 again, even if you completely uninstall it. If you do, you will get this error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In August of 2013, I put a new hard drive in my computer. After re-installing all of my software, including Microsoft Office, it works absolutely perfectly. So it was that registry key or something in the old registry that was causing the issue. A new hard
 drive will fix it for sure! It did for me anyways. That is the only fix thing that I've found to work otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

            I figured out this happened after the windows 8.1 update. Once I uninstalled the update, my excel has worked perfect. I had to turn off my windows updates. This is the only fix that has worked allowing me to use the excel program. It will have to work
 until they come up with a permanent fix.<br />

            <p>This started happening with me in mid March, prior to 8.1. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed the 8.1 patch in the hope it would fix it: It did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am stuck with my new office companion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're sorry. but (pick an office application) has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. &nbsp;Excel will need to be closed as a result.</p>
<p>Would you like us to repair now?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its still less annoying that the paperclip, but YES, why don't you figure it out Microsoft, it would appear to be a distributed problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bit of a reach, but as we all encountered a problem mid March, is it possible there is a mistaken or malicious windows network push flag change on office products that has taken away our privilege to run it correctly? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have the same problem - performed all the checks/tests/verifications and resets suggested in the trail so far - without any success.&nbsp; I have also noticed that this started happening for both Personal and Business editions of OneDrive on the same machine.&nbsp;
 I have include a picture of the process and responses for both.&nbsp; (Note step 3 in OneDrive for Business section only flashed momentarily before step 4 appeared.)</p>
<p>Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Wilhem0708,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you made this change in Internet Explorer (not in Microsoft Edge) :</p>
<p><span>&gt;Advanced &gt; Under Security&gt; <strong>uncheck </strong>: Do not save encrypted pages to disk</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8268a0f7-8c8e-4215-8b8e-8bbe0bf0fde0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8268a0f7-8c8e-4215-8b8e-8bbe0bf0fde0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<div><span>Once you are done, validate the change and try again to share file through OneDrive For Business.<br />
<br />
Important : If this option is grayed out it may mean a GPO is used to controle this option, so you must make a change on the GPO that manages Internet Explorer settings.</span></div>

<p>Thanks, Jean-Marie.&nbsp; No, I did not make the change in Internet Explorer since I don't use it at all - I have it unchecked in my 'Turn Windows features on or off' settings.&nbsp; I did however check the same Internet Options in the Control Panel and can confirm
 that 'Do not save encrypted pages to disk' has been unchecked all along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since uninstalled and removed OneDrive (Business and Personal) entirely from my device, re-installed it and now I can share a link from OneDrive personal but am still getting the same response from OneDrive for Business.&nbsp; This seems to be directly
 linked to the build before last - I checked it on another pc that hasn't had that applied yet, and it was still working well on there.&nbsp; I am currently on 1837.rs_prereleasee.190111-1556.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for looking into this for me.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me.&nbsp; Yes, I have been sharing the links via browser for the past while now, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As luck would have it, the machine that was still working yesterday after being offline for a while, must have ingested the same toxins as my daily use one and now that has stopped working as well.&nbsp; I have however managed to capture the first dialogue that
 popped up (you will see it has the #1 tag in the screenshot and is different to the subsequent messages - I recall the same message appearing on my daily use pc the first time it happened).&nbsp; Thereafter, the same message appeared as on my machine that failed
 first.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Wilhem0708,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The OneDrive version you are using is insider build, not the production version.</span><em>
</em><em><span>Insider builds are best for users who want to use the earliest preview builds, released more frequently, to identify issues and provide feedback, and who don’t mind a bit of risk using unsupported builds.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want to continue using insider build, then you can provide your feedback by right-clicking the OneDrive app, select
<strong>Send Feedback </strong>otherwise you can install the production version i.e. 18.240.1202.0004. To install the production build, you must first uninstall OneDrive client you already have on your computer and then install the production build from this

<p>

<p>Thanks, Neha.&nbsp; Yep, I've been an insider for a while and very aware of the risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, when spotting something slightly 'out of line', I'll first check the forums, etc. to ensure it's not just something that's wrong on my specific setup before logging it as feedback to the Insider program - call it "due diligence".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for confirming that this is specific to the Insider built - I will now go ahead and log it as an issue to the Insider forum.</p>

<h2>            How to format borders in an Access Report like one can in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>How can i create borders in an Access report like I can in Excel.&nbsp; (e.g. top single border, bottom double border for a number field.&nbsp; and have a bottom border under the field that extends past what a normal underline would do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Access doesn't offer the amount of control over borders that Excel does. You'll have to imitate the effect by placing one or more line segments around a text box, e.g. two horizontal line segments below a text box if you want to simulate a double bottom
 border.

            I would format a double underline for number fields rather than a double border. But as Hans said, you don't have the&nbsp;control&nbsp;over borders that Excel has. So you have to simulate using a line control.&nbsp;

            <p>As Hans and Scottgem have said Access doesn't like borders ;-)<br />
<br />
You can however simulate some by using the String format (as Hans pointed out)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add two text box to a form and make the background transparent<br />
Ajust the hieght so they are quite small and make the length as long as you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use </p>
<p>=String (5"_") or any other number you want.</p>
<p>Place the 2 boxes "almost" on top of each other</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing about this is that you can control it.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<p>Text box 1</p>
<p>=(If isnull(textbox),String,(5"_"),String,(5"-")</p>
<p>Text box 2</p>
<p>=(If isnull(textbox),String,(5"_")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just play around with it and you'll find a format that you like as this will allow you to extend the lines outside of the text box with the report details (as you say you're looking for)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I was searching on the Internet on how to add a bottom border to a text box. &nbsp;I found that someone suggest a simple solution....set the text box Special Effect to Chiseled. &nbsp;That works great...

<h2>            Unable to search for an email which is sitting right in the Inbox</h2>
                    I upgraded recently from hotmail domain to Outlook. This has been a nightmare, I can't seem to use the search field to find old emails. For example, I have an email which is sitting right in my Inbox but when I try to use Basic / Advanced search it does
 not find anything. I tried with From, Subject, attachments etc without any luck. I am in the IT field and use other email services and have been able to add this account but this is my primary account and have lot of old emails which I would like to retrieve.
 Hope someone can point me in the right direction because outlook has been very disappointing so far.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>The chart has a y value, an x value and a value deciding the size of the bubble, I was wondering if anybody knows if it is possible to let a number influence the color of the
 bubble shown in the chart. for example 10 being bright green, 5 being a neutral color and bright red being 0. I am personally not quite capable of changing the program to perform this action but I will be able to find somebody to do so if I know how.</font></span></p>

            <p>Thank you Mr. Liengme, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find a lot of info, however not quite yet what I was looking for while most answers suggest changing chart type to a scatter chart. this doesn't completely solve my challange. here is what I want&nbsp;to do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>keep a value X to reflect on a numerical factor (e.g. 1 - 10)</p>
<p>Keep a value Y to reflect&nbsp;on a numerical factor (e.g. .01 - .3)</p>
<p>Keep a value to determine the size of the bubble (e.g. 100.000 - 1.000.000)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and additionally make a value decide the color of the bubble. </p>
<p>(e.g. a gradient fill from red to green, whereas bright green reflects on the number 10 gradiently changing color to yellow for the number 5 towards bright red for the number 0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I change to a scatter chart I loose the ability to automatically create the bubble size which will create the same problem while I would be manually adjusting one factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>maybe this specifies a bit better what I am hoping to achieve.</p>

            Here the MS answer to controling chart color. Now to figure out how to apply it to 3d bubble charts ...<br />
<div>
How to Change the Colors of a Chart Dynamically
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/200527/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/200527/en-us</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<br />
<br />
The simplest approach to controlling Excel colors is using the 56 color index numbers<br />
<br />
Excel Color Palette and Color Index change using VBA
<p><a href="http://www.databison.com/index.php/excel-color-palette-and-color-index-change-using-vba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.databison.com/index.php/excel-color-palette-and-color-index-change-using-vba/</a>
</p>
<br />
If you want more subtle color control you are going to want to use RBG (Red Blue Green)
<br />
Cell-Fill Color based on Cell Value
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-customize/cell-fill-color-based-on-cell-value/29297f11-d99e-4f76-ad51-3fbdf7e4308a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-customize/cell-fill-color-based-on-cell-value/29297f11-d99e-4f76-ad51-3fbdf7e4308a</a>
</p>
<br />
<br />
I haven't seen examples of predefined charts. I have seen examples like this where shapes are color controlled. Usually related to mapping.
<br />

<span>The Bubbles app for Office lets you visualize your data in a fun and interactive way. Your data is represented as bubbles of different sizes and colors with realistic physics behaviors. Select a table of data and see bubbles sizes represent
 the number of times each distinct value appears. Bubbles can also use numeric values for size and color allowing you to easily visualize value distributions at a glance. A "lookup" mode allows you to visualize data from two different tables. Selecting rows
 on the primary table visualizes the corresponding rows from the secondary table as bubbles of different sizes and colors. This is a great way to analyze more complex data sets.</span></p>

<br />
<br />
Here is a macro for adjusting chart color, If you can find the object name for the bubble chart, you may be able to do what you want by adapting this macro<br />

<p>I'm using google chrome, and I can't get to my email account at all, the app won't load and simply reloads every second or so on a black page. (I can see it reload because the little spinning orb for loading just keeps on resetting itself.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've opened it on Microsoft Edge and it works perfectly, so the issue is linked to google chrome.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 on my CPU</h2>
                    <p>Okay, for a couple of days this notification has been popping up every time I go to use Microsoft Word. This pop up says:</p>
<p>"Microsoft Office Activation Wizard</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013</p>
<p>This copy of Microsoft Office is not activated.</p>
<p>You have 23 days left to activate. Ensure you are connected to your corporate network to enable automatic activation. Your system administrator can help.</p>

<p>Change Product Key</p>
<p>Error Code: 0x4004F00D</p>
<p>Privacy Statement</p>
<p>Help</p>
<p>Close"</p>
<p>The thing is, I haven't downloaded anything (yet this new program of Microsoft Silverlight downloaded on 8/11/2015 which is long before this pop up began but seemed worth noting) nor have I upgraded really anything since I took it to a computer place to
 fix a really bad virus. I have absolutely no idea what this is for considering this is my personal desktop i have at home. One of my main questions is "When the time runs out, in 23 days, will I no longer be able to use Microsoft Word?" Thus is my quandary.
 (I refuse to download any program due to past viruses that emerged afterwards.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not too sure what windows program my computer is running on, in all honesty it very well may be windows 7. I actually don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, any suggestions is very appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks much for trying in advance.</p>

</p><p>Did you install and activate a copy of 2013 Pro Plus on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check to see if you also have a copy of Office 365 installed on the computer, probably by the builder at the factory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have 2 unactivated copies of Office installed, the activation system "gets confused'. You have to get rid of one to unconfuse it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have 365 and want to activate Pro Plus you will first have to uninstall 365, then do an Office Repair of Pro Plus, boot the computer and finally activate the Pro Plus again with the product key.</p>

            <p>Where did you find this "activation code"? If it is on a sticker on the bottom of the computer, look again, it is almost certainly for Windows.&nbsp; Is it 25 characters, written in 5 groups of 5 char?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2013 includes Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Pro Plus does NOT come installed from the factory, so someone had to buy (or trial download it) and install it at some point.&nbsp; Many (all?) Windows computers come with a free trial of Office 365.&nbsp; Having 2 copies of Office unactivated on the computer
 will cause activation problems. </p>

            I don't have any idea why this version of Microsoft Office is on my CPU. My family and I have NEVER bought any Microsoft program, it's been on our computer the day we bought it or someone put it there when we have taken them to get fixed. As I said earlier
 the last time any program was really upgraded was from when my computer had a nasty virus we took to get fixed. There is a sticker on my cpu but not for this version of Microsoft so it does not work. I am the only person who can access my cpu so no on has
 downloaded anything onto this computer. My computer did not come with a free trial of any other Office product. (I have found several activation codes as stickers on my cpu and through a coding program on my cpu, I have input all of them several times without
 mistakes and none of them work. They all were codes that were in 5 groups with 5 characters.) There is ABSOLUTELY no other Microsoft Office program on my cpu, none besides this one. NONE.

            <p>Except under very limited circumstances a new PC is only supplied with an Office trial version.</p>
<p>If the PC was supplied with a full working version of MS Office, the specification sheet for you PC Purchase would have showed this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you took your PC for repair then its likely the repair shop has installed MS Office Pro Plus, either as a trial or an illegal/hacked version</p>
<p>
</p><p>The label on the PC is for the Win Key</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unless you physically purchased an Office version you don't have one, except a trial or illegal version</p>

            I thought the code would be on my PC too but all the couple of codes, admittedly more than 2 (and i look EVERYWHERE inside and out for a other codes which were not there), did not work. I didn't not accept a free trial of anything nor did my computer ever
 come with the option for a free trial considering my PC was top of the line when Sims 2 was first released &nbsp;(maybe even before Sims 2 was released) and has a bit of an issue telling me if there is anything to update (not because the button isn't set because
 it is). I have not obtained anything illegally nor have i bought a physical copy.&nbsp;

 the whole column selected), thanks. more? ok: ALTERNATE / better? answer might be to modify the Cells.Find line to include a colum to start in. (seems that selecting the whole column does not leave just the desired cell hilted when done, but the whole column).

            <p>Hi again.</p>
<p>I see you still haven't got the hang of asking a specific question to get a specific answer! ;o)</p>
<p>Oh well.&nbsp; Here's a couple of guesses for what you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find the first cell containing "x" in column A, you can use:</p>
<p>Sub FindXinColA()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rngFound As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngFound = Columns("A:A").Find( _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What:="x", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After:=Range("A" &amp; Rows.Count), _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LookIn:=xlValues, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LookAt:=xlPart, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SearchOrder:=xlByRows, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SearchDirection:=xlNext, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MatchCase:=False, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SearchFormat:=False)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not rngFound Is Nothing Then <em>'the search term was found</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rngFound.Font.Bold = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note the test at the end to make sure we are not working with "nothing".</p>
<p>Also notice how there is no need to use </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <strong>.</strong>Select </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection<strong>.</strong> ....</p>
<p>&nbsp;in your code, it will slow it down.&nbsp; Just declare objects, e.g. a Range object and do your operations on the object without selecting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find the first populated row in a column, you could use this function:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Function <strong>FindFirstRowInCol</strong>(vCol As Variant) As Long<br />
<em>' Function returns the row number of the first populated row<br />
' in the parsed column vCol.<br />
' If the whole column is empty the function returns -1.<br />
'<br />
</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rng As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rng = Columns(vCol)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If rng.Cells(1).Value &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FindFirstRowInCol = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FindFirstRowInCol = rng(1).Cells.End(xlDown).Row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If FindFirstRowInCol = Rows.Count Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If rng.Cells(Rows.Count).Value = "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FindFirstRowInCol = -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Function </p>
<p><br />
Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print <strong>FindFirstRowInCol("A")</strong><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'or</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print <strong>FindFirstRowInCol(1)</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
</strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'example (make the first cell bold):<br />
</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lnRow As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lnRow = FindFirstRowInCol("A")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("A" &amp; lnRow).Font.Bold = True</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

&nbsp;<br />
or if it's a named range on a sheet:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("name_of_range")(1, 1).Font.Bold = True</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>which is technically:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("name_of_range")<strong>.Cells</strong>(1, 1).Font.Bold = True</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want the cell at the top of&nbsp;the (first) column of a range object:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(1, rng.Column).Font.Bold = True</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and similarly if you want the cell in col A in the (first) row of a range object:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(rng.Row, 1).Font.Bold = True</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

Dude!&nbsp; Didn't you see my smilie?&nbsp; But to address some of your points:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) People on this site (including me) volunteer their time to help people (like you).&nbsp; If you post a "question", it is reasonable to assume you are hoping for an answer.&nbsp; Instead, it appears that you repeatedly post a list of "others tried" - i.e. code you
 guessed at to see if it did what you want.&nbsp; While I admire your attempts to solve the problems yourself, telling us a load&nbsp;of "code" that didn't work doesn't help "us" in anyway to work out what the problem is that you are trying to solve (or whether you even
 have a problem)!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You said "<em>unless i asked for a long answer..., i am generally looking for just the 1 liners that i had posted</em>".&nbsp; That somewhat conflicts with the text in your signature: "<em>novice vb may need a working example, thanks</em>".</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>2) Since "we" have volunteered "our" time, please make it easy on "us".&nbsp; i.e. Please don't make "us" read a load of... words... if you haven't really got a question.&nbsp; If you answer your question yourself, (since you can't mark one of your own posts as the
 answer)&nbsp; you could just delete it.&nbsp; Or you could post a reply to yourself saying "<em>Don't worry guys, I figured it out... the answer is: __________</em>".&nbsp; As I just said, who does it help when you spend all that time typing (and make other people take their
 time to&nbsp;read) all of the nonsense code that you tried and didn't work?&nbsp; What I'm saying is, if you have a question, let "us" answer it, and make it as easy for "us" to answer it as possible.&nbsp; Please don't just use this site as a diary for the toiling you have
 done one evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just post a question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) You said "your site is messing up the posts".&nbsp; What, so you think this is "my" site?!?!?&nbsp; Microsoft created this site.&nbsp; I (and all the other volunteers) are not Microsoft, we are just nice people who are happy to help YOU.&nbsp; If you find your post gets
 messed up (and I believe it depends on which browser you use!) try pasting your code into NotePad first, then copy from NotePad into a post on this site.&nbsp; That tends to fix most text formatting problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that clears things up.&nbsp; I didn't mean to sound negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jon Peltier (charting god) has some good tips on how to ask a good question on a forum.&nbsp; Scroll down to "<strong>How to Ask a Forum Question</strong>" on this page:
<a href="http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/getting-excel-answers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/getting-excel-answers/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, having looked at your own "answer"... I think your question is (or was)&nbsp;<strong><em>how to find the first occurance of "x" after the first cell of a range?</em></strong>&nbsp; If I remember your code from your previous posts, you use P4 as a string containing
 the value of the cell P4 (despite my recomendations not to do this!), and P4 contains a reference to some cells.&nbsp; e.g. P4 = "B2:B10".&nbsp; So:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RANGE(P4).Cells(1, 1)</p>
<p>will indead return the first cell of whatever range is returned by Range(P4).&nbsp; But note that
<strong>there's no need to select that cell</strong>.&nbsp; That will just slow your code down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Now, here's a question for you.&nbsp; Do you:</p>
<p>a) want to find the next occurance of "x" AFTER the first cell in your range anywhere on your worksheet?,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b) want to find the first occurance of "x" WITHIN your range (which could include the first cell in that range)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;VBA code:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngFound = <strong>Range("B2:B10").</strong>Find( _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What:="x", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After:=Range("<strong>B10</strong>"), _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LookIn:=xlValues, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LookAt:=xlPart, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SearchOrder:=xlByRows, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SearchDirection:=xlNext, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MatchCase:=False, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SearchFormat:=False)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>will find the first occurance of "x" <strong>WITHIN </strong>the range "B2:B10".&nbsp; Note how by using the LAST cell in that range (<strong>B10</strong>) for the After arguement, means the Find straight away loops to the first cell in the range (B2) and looks
 there first.&nbsp; If B2 contained "x", the above would find it before any other "x" in the range.&nbsp; But if we set After:=Range("B2") then it would check all the other cells in the range (i.e. B<strong>3</strong>:B10) first, before looking in B2.&nbsp; Make sense?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You used Cells.Find, which will give the result described in (a) above: the next occurance of "x" AFTER the ActiveCell,
<u>anywhere on the sheet</u> (which could end up being BEFORE the ActiveCell, depending on what is on your sheet!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp;you need to protect for the event that Find doesn't find what you were looking for.&nbsp; That is why you should assign the output of Range.Find to a Range object:&nbsp;
<em><strong>Set rngFound = </strong>Range("B2:B10").Find(...&nbsp; </em>and then you can test to see if rngFound is nothing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If <strong>Not </strong>rngFound <strong>Is Nothing </strong>Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ....do your code...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think you need:</p>
<p>either a)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rngFound As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngFound = <strong>Range(P4)</strong>.Find(what:="x", After:=<strong>Range(P4).Cells(1, 1)</strong>, _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LookIn:=xlFormulas, LookAt:=xlWhole, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SearchOrder:=xlByColumns, SearchDirection:=xlNext, _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MatchCase:=True, SearchFormat:=False)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>which will find the first occurance of "x" WITHIN Range(P4), <u>AFTER the first cell in Range(P4)</u>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or b)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rngFound As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngFound = Range(P4).Find(what:="x", _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After:=<strong>Range(P4).Cells(Range(P4).Rows.Count, Range(P4).Columns.Count)</strong>, _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LookIn:=xlFormulas, LookAt:=xlWhole, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SearchOrder:=xlByColumns, SearchDirection:=xlNext, _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MatchCase:=True, SearchFormat:=False)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>which will find the first occurance of "x" WITHIN Range(P4), since, <strong>Range(P4).Cells(Range(P4).Rows.Count, Range(P4).Columns.Count)</strong> gives the LAST cell in Range(P4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above helps you to&nbsp;both:</p>
<p>a) ask questions on this forum that will give you the answers you need (and get more people to offer answers)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>b) better understand the Range.Find method and how to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions on any of the above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

    <title>OneDrive &#34;Person&#34; Icon Popped Up Out of Nowhere - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronniechambers  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive &#34;Person&#34; Icon Popped Up Out of Nowhere</h2>
                    <p>I access some of my OneDrive files on both my personal computer and my work computer via Windows File Explorer.&nbsp; This morning when I logged into my work computer, I noticed there's a little "person" icon on just one of my OneDrive folders titled "Personal."&nbsp;
 See below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
What does that mean??&nbsp; I didn't share out any folders to anyone.&nbsp; I have gone everywhere I can figure out in OneDrive to see if someone else was showing up in permissions, but couldn't determine that anyone was.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to force Outlook 2013 to sync all folders with Gmail IMAP&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We seem to be going round in circles with sync problems between Outlook 2013 and Gmail IMAP. We see loads of complaints and suggestions but no definitive
 solution(s).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Background:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My wife and I have 2 desktops and 2 laptops using the same 2 Gmail accounts. We had been happily using Win 7 and Outlook 2007, since Win 7 first came out, without
 problems (absolutely nothing wrong on these nor various&nbsp;other&nbsp;previous PCs and laptops).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Recently we have replaced one of the old laptops and the new one came with Win 8.1 pre-installed.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also recently replaced&nbsp;our iPhone 4s with Windows Nokia Lumia phones with Win 8.1 &nbsp; . . . none of them had or have any problem whatsoever syncing to Gmail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Over the past few weeks we have "upgraded" both PCs and both Laptops to Office 2013. No problems with Word, Excell and PowerPoint etc. apart from getting used
 to the new formats. However, Outlook 2013 and Gmail IMAP is a whole different matter. Doesn't seem to make any difference whether we are using Win 7 or 8.1. Can’t be 100% sure but the problems seem limited to Outlook 2013 and Gmail IMAP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Problems . . . These are just a few of the problems in Outlook 2013:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) Approx 100<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Sync Issues (This computer)</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span>every
 day like this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05d4837f-b139-4e9d-8be4-bf39467a49d8" /></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From what I can see, the Sync Issues all appear to be identical.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) We have set Outlook to open in the Inboxes of our respective accounts, each time we log in. I have never seen the Inboxes actually up to date. They
 open and <strong>SYCHRONIZING “Inbox”</strong> appears in the bar immediately above the task bar but Outlook only goes through the motions and seems stuck until switching to a different folder. Clicking on a different folder only brings the same message
<strong>SYCHRONIZING “Name of New Folder”</strong> but again nothing happens. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) However, some days quite at random, after clicking on a folder,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">one</span> message will appear in it, but then it stops and the Syncing message disappears. Subsequently clicking on yet another folder, again
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">one</span> message will appear . . . them clicking on the previous folder, it seems to start syncing all messages that should be in that folder (but only if one had appeared with the previous click).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) When typing a new email or simply replying to an email, Outlook seems to generate multitudinous drafts in Gmail, which are then really difficult
 to get rid of. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v) Often when trying to save a draft or send it after “Popping it out", it won’t save or send. Can’t offhand remember the exact message but something
 like, "The operation cannot be performed because the message has been changed". The only way round it is to make a new draft and send it quickly or the problem will happen again. When I next go to Gmail I see that there are multitudinous drafts, as per (iv)
 above. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vi) Yesterday, I renamed a label in Gmail but the name change didn’t happen to the folder in Outlook. Out of curiosity, I checked the Outlook
 IMAP folders subscribed list and the name change showed. However, despite closing and opening Outlook numerous times the folder never updated. I eventually gave up and changed it manually in Outlook as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vii) Today, still trying to get to the bottom of the folder/label name change problem of yesterday, I changed the name of a folder in Outlook
 and Gmail’s label changed almost immediately and showed up in the Outlook IMAP folders subscribed list.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (viii) After sending a new e-mail it doesn’t appear in the Outlook sent box . . . sometimes for several days . . . . However, it is “sent” and
 appears in the Gmail sent label. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is not a complete list of the syncing problems with Outlook 2013 and Gmail IMAP, just those that spring to mind.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We use Outlook basically because it is a much better editor than Gmail but the 2013 version with all of its strange foibles and syncing problems is
 really unusable/unworkable. We know that we have received mails because our phones show them but we can’t reply to them with Outlook.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What a terrible shame that such a great program has been ruined.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before reverting back to Outlook 2007 (we never bought 2010) Is there any hope of a fix?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, back to my original title/question, Is there any way to force Outlook 2013 to sync all folders with Gmail IMAP?</span></p>
<p>I would be most grateful for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>P.S. I know that this is not the forum for Windows 8 or 8.1 comments but shouldn't Windows now be renamed, &nbsp;"Apps that take over your whole screen or at best be made to
 share a percentage of a screen but cannot be made into&nbsp;</span>variable<span>&nbsp;sized WINDOWS anymore"!!!!!!! &nbsp; &nbsp;I will persevere with Win 8.1 as the inevitable will happen anyway, but h</span></span><span>ow
 I dream of having the "windows" back.</span></p>

            Is this problem present on the new PC, where presumably you configured outlook 2013 from scratch, or only the upgraded PC's<br />

            <p>It's present on all 4 (both laptops and both PCs). Can't say its exactly equal on all 4 &nbsp;but I&nbsp;am&nbsp;personally more conscious of it on the new laptop which I am using far more (even when at home) because I am trying to get used to Win 8.1 before deciding whether
 to upgrade/update the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I did a format and re-install of Windows 7 on my wife's laptop before installing Office 2013 and she is also constantly complaining that Outlook is "hanging" with nothing happening and has also asked me quite a few times how to save or send messages
 when she also gets the previously quoted messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have just looked in her <strong>Sync Issues (This computer)</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span> folder and she has far fewer than me (only 58 in 3 days) but very long error messages, which seem to involve every folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore can't say if any one is any better or any worse than the others because I have seen the same problems on all of them . . . but maybe to different degrees.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in summary, we seem to have similar if not exactly identical problems on:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i) A brand new HP laptop with Win 8.1 and which came with Office 2010 pre-installed. However, I never &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;activated Office 2010 and removed it completely before installing Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) A 2 year old Sony Viao laptop which was reformatted before clean re-installing Win 7 and then &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Office 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(iii) Two non identical just over 1-year old ASUS All-in-Ones with Win 7 in which I simply uninstalled &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Office 2007 and installed Office 2013.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not ever having had any issues with O'2013 and GMail folder sync'ing - not aware of any specific generic problems - to that end</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - have you subscribed to all your GMAIL folders - there should be a folder called [Gmail] in the folder tree with all the Gmail related folders listed as sub-folders - right-click on the folder --&gt; select &lt;IMAP Folders&gt; --&gt; query your subscribed folders.
 Those are the ones that will (should) be sync'd the next time you connect to GMail</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Purpose of Send/Receive function enables you to force a send/receive process to occur for a given email account outside of the regular schedule. The general S/R schedule is governed by the settings found in
</p>
<p>File --&gt; Options --&gt; Advanced --&gt; Send &amp; Receive section --&gt; click on the S/R button the right where you can control what gets sent and/or received either collectively or individually based on the time scheduled entered.</p>

            <p>Thanks Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Yes all G-mail labels are "subscribed" and appear in the Outlook folder subscribed list but newly created ones don't appear in the folder panel list in Outlook. Have tried unsubscribing and subscribing again and again but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Thanks &nbsp;. . . . I believe that Send/Receive is set up correctly . . . but wouldn't it be redundant if sync were to work correctly. How often should sync actually sync? Is there any way to force it "manually" out of schedule as per your description of
 Send/Receive?</p>

<p>
</p><p>What you're referring to as "sync" is when Outlook connects with the GMAIL Account during the Send/Receive process - there is no "instant real-time" connection if that's what you're expecting. The (.ost) Data File for a GMAIL IMAP account is a reflection
 (mirror) of what is contained at the server level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Impossible to comment on if S/R is set up correctly - comes down to whether or not the GMAIL Account is included in the Account Group followed by the frequency of the S/R process which may not occur at all if you've opted to do it manually. As a for instance
 - I have chosen to manually perform the S/R on all my accounts - nothing is automatically done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short - if you're new GMAIL email items are showing up in the Outlook folders - then any new folders that may have been created since the last time you connected should also get created. Since I don't really use GMAIL for much of anything related to production
 - just did some additional tests creating new folder on the Outlook side which got reflected on the server side as well as the reverse - everything worked exactly as expected.</p>

<h2>            Some Thoughts on Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>The Start Menu is not one of my favorite features, but a few simple changes would make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. An option to have the Start Menu be full screen rather than the strange "window" stuck in a left/bottom position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Have an option to place the Start Menu at users desired position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;3. When "All Apps" is selected, the line at the top with users name and the power button disappear. Why? Seems to me it would be better to leave that line at the top.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Good luck, Jim</p>

            Hello N8 users,<br />
I have access to 2 N8.According to nokia n8 records video in 25flps.But<br />
after using the phone i have found that while recoding videos of<br />
dynamic conditions sometimes the framerate drops and the resulting video is recorded in 24flps according to my<br />
pc.And while watching the same video both in pc and cell the area where framerate drops is noticeable.I mean jerkyness at those<br />
point. But while recording videos indoors such drops never happen and the<br />
video is recorded in 25flps. Also i have noticed that playback of recorded videos is jerk free in n8 but<br />
not as smooth when the same video is played by my pc.Ok guys is this<br />
normal becoz both the n8 does same thing.

    <title>Email Problem with Nokia Lumia 635 phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cliverickman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email Problem with Nokia Lumia 635 phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have taken over my wife's Lumia phone. I carried out a full reset to Factory settings before adding my 2 email accounts (one Btinternet and one Yahoo) but neither of these work as they should. I can send emails with the BT account but my phone will
 not receive them. I am informed that my Yahoo account 'requires attention' and I am unable to fix this regardless of what I do, so I can neither send nor receive messages with this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been round in circles with various 'help' contacts who simply pass me on to someone else.&nbsp; Frankly, I'd be happy to fix just the BT account (that one will, at least, allow me to
<em>send</em> messages). Does anyone have any advice on resolving the problem, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks - Clive</p>

<h2>            All inbox mail items lost after Outlook.com upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My account was upgraded from a Hotmail account to use Outlook.com and all of the mail items in my inbox have disappeared.&nbsp; My email address in question is ***removed for privacy***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would never permanently delete messages and I have checked my deleted items however there is no trace of the missing mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as how the email could be recovered?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Louis</p>

            <p>Print options for booklets in Word 2010 are even more limited than in previous versions: it would appear that there is no provision for printing less than the entire booklet. I think you will have to create a new 5.5"
 x 8.5" document and copy/paste the contents of the single page to that document. Then print that document using the "Scale to paper size" option set to Letter.</p>
<p>Or, if you don't want it scaled, just paste the contents into a Letter-sized document with margins adjusted to allow the same page area that you have in the booklet.</p>

    <title>Unhide Headings in MS Word 2016 for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eikehaecker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unhide Headings in MS Word 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hope someone can answer this - been searching everywhere but all solutions that are posted to unhide headings to be visible in the Style Pane/Quick Style&nbsp;list &nbsp;are for PC users.</p>
<p>I have set up format styles for the built-in Headings 1, 2 and 3. I can see Heading 1 in my Style Pane/Quick Style list ("In current Document" setting) but NOT Heading 2 and 3...even though I have used them in my document more than once. If I switch to "All
 styles" I can see my other Headings but I would like to have it visible in the "In current Document" setting. How can I do this?</p>

<p>Hi Cliff Gu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer. </p>
<p>I tried to copy the content into a new document but the same happened. I also ticked the box that said "<span>Add to Quick Style List" when I modified the style.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution was, in the end, to do what you suggested first: go back to a former version and reapply all new styles and formatting. :( It worked but it was very time-consuming.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I know, that at a PC, you can "unhide" format styles and I wish I would have had that option too on my Mac Version. I would have been done in 2 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
<p><br />
