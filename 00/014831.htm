<p>I need help...not sure what to do.&nbsp; Everything about Outlook seems to work great (running Outlook 2007, part of Office Enterprise 2007), except emails I send to one specific email address bounce.&nbsp; Actually, it doesn't even bounce, I don't think it ever gets
 that far.&nbsp; I get the below error message within like 1/4 second from the time I hit send...it's instant.&nbsp; How do I stop this?&nbsp; The email address (marked out below) is 100% good for sure and I can email it from work, but emails at home do this every time.&nbsp;
 Any ideas?</p>

    <title>O365 Top Menu CSS not loading correctly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            O365 Top Menu CSS not loading correctly</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Finding an issue across multiple tenants, personal and business-owned, on multiple machines, multiple networks, multiple browsers, and with multiple users. Occurs whether or not custom CSS (alternate CSS) is applied or a theme is applied.</p>
<p>The App Launcher is incorrectly displayed as well as the "?" help menu on the far right. This issue began to occur last week, first starting on one tenant, and then a few days later another, and then another. There are at least 3 tenants affected by this
 issue.</p>
<p>It is the same issue as this and began occurring around the same time: https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/418775</p>
<p>The image that Taha from the thread referenced above has posted is exactly what I am seeing.</p>
<p>Can you please escalate this to see if this issue has occurred due to some recent SPO update? This is not a client-side issue based on my above description.</p>
<p>To summarize, the issue occurs on:</p>
<p>-multiple tenants</p>
<p>-multiple browsers</p>
<p>-multiple networks</p>
<p>-multiple users</p>
<p>-irrespective of custom CSS via alternate CSS</p>
<p>-irrespective of theme</p>
<p>-began to occur early last week or sooner</p>
<p>-friend suggested that it might be due to my customizations (custom CSS), but then the issue hit his personal tenant days later. His tenant is bare-bones with zero customizations of any sort.</p>

<p>Hi Spuser10000,</p>
<p>This issue is now reported at Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident SP34396 starting at Nov 19 15 01:00 AM.</p>
<p>The user experience of this incident is: Affected users are experiencing an issue when opening the Suite Navigation menu from SharePoint Online sites in which the tiles for the different applications (Outlook, OneDrive, etc.) are not rendering properly.
 As a workaround, users may can navigate to any other portal page as the issue only occurs when opening the Suite Navigation menu from a SharePoint Online MySites page.</p>
<p>A suggested workaround is: Navigate to any other portal page as the issue only occurs when opening the Suite Navigation menu from a SharePoint Online MySites page.</p>

    <title>Mixing Office Component Versions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p christel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mixing Office Component Versions</h2>
                    Can I install Access 2013 on a computer that currently has Office 2003 installed?<br />
<br />
Or, can I install Office 2013 (from the Small Business 365 subscription), but use my older 2003 version of Outlook instead of the included 2013?<br />
<br />
The reason for this is that I have to upgrade our PCs to Windows 7 and MS Access to at least 2010, but we are still running MS Exchange 2003, which cannot be immediately upgraded or migrated to the hosted solution.<br />
<br />
My ultimate goal, would be to have the machines on Office 365 using MS's hosted email solution.&nbsp; But, that is probably a few months down the road.&nbsp; The migration to a newer version of Access is more urgent.&nbsp; I thought I would just upgrade all machines and install
 Office 2013, but I just discovered that Outlook 2013 will not work with Exchange 2003.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Paul<br />

<p>As I understand you would like to use Office 2013 along with Office 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A side by side install of Office 2013 Click 2 Run (C2R) with Office 2003 is not recommended or supported.

            Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I am not sure if this matters, but to clarify, I do not want to install duplicate components of Office.&nbsp; I either need to run an older version of Outlook with a new version of Office.&nbsp; Or, I need to run a new version of Access
 with an older version of Office.&nbsp; I do not wish to install overlapping versions of similar components (ie - Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2013 on the same machine).<br />

BALAJINISH</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. Does it happen regardless if you have a good signal strength on the phone? Do you mean you are unable to hear the person on the other line&nbsp;and the other way around? Speaker is not working even when listening
 to music, right? We look forward to your reply. </blockquote>
<p>Both the speaker and mic not working, even I can't hear the ringing tone after dialing a number. Please suggest what to do.</p>
<p>this is happened after the third day of usage after buying new phone</p>

            I also experienced this problem.<br />
I'm using Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual Sim<br />
And will the trial and error I did here's the solution.<br />
<br />
Upgrade your phone to Windows 10 if your still using Windows 8.<br />
And in case that you can't upgrade to Windows 10 from 8, install the Upgrade Advisor and then try upgrading again.<br />
<br />
Now when you're running on Windows 10 do a complete reset of the phone.<br />
After resetting the phone install Smart Dual Sim from the Store.<br />
<br />
After installing the Smart Dual Sim, turn off your phone and then put two sims on your phone, better put your favorite sim on the first slot.<br />
<br />
When you turn it back on again it would ask you to do a restart a lot of times, just do it.<br />
Also don't forget to configure SIM 1 to your liking.<br />
<br />
After all of this, you could now remove SIM 2 and then turn it back on again, or just retain it.
<br />
<br />
This fixed mine. Hope it helps.

<p>I need some assurance that, if I load my new Office package with Outlook 2007,&nbsp;my contacts and other data&nbsp;will convert and sync up correctly. I can backdate the file type on Excel, Word, and other programs, but just don't know what the new Outlook
 2007 allows and whether my version of ActiveSync is up to the task. --LeoLop</p>

<p>There are different programs available to determine which codecs you're missing. I've not tested any, but here is a free download to one:<a href="http://jockersoft.com/english/codecinstaller.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://jockersoft.com/english/codecinstaller.php</a>. I'm

    <title>WMP deleted files still there - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottbarnes.327  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMP deleted files still there</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a Lenovo touch screen computer with windows media player 12. I ripped / brought all music from existing external hard drive I had. There where duplicated songs but not a lot. I was messing around and some how added a additional folder with
 all the music I already had on the External HD. So I went in and deleted that folder.&nbsp;Now that the folder is gone I still have duplicated songs. I when I hit properties&nbsp;it say that folder&nbsp;s in recycle bin. But there are no folders in recycle bin. Question</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How do I get those files from recycle bin out if there not there.</p>
<p>2) On a older computer I had the same problem. I went to WMP tools and refresh music and the duplicated songs where gone. Why&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't WPM 12&nbsp;in windows 10 don't have this option. (kind of silly not to have it)</p>
<p>3) Should I or does downloading duplicated file removal work or should I download it.</p>
<p>4) Any suggestion, I do use Winamp but a lot of files don't transfer from WMP to it. Or should I use something besides WMP ( I have always had trouble with duplicated files in WMP.</p>

            <p>Hi Scott - I remember seeing your earlier question at some point but lost track of it because I was busy with other stuff and then went away for a short while.</p>
<p>Can you just clarify your problem a bit... Is this just about cleaning up the library or do you think you may have actually lost some files?</p>
<p>You can still tidy up the library easily enough in WMP12/W10 - first just reassure me that you haven't lost anything</p>
<p>(or otherwise!) - Chees, Ric.</p>

            Thanks Ric&nbsp;for the response, I do have all my files still there on my external hard drive. But there are duplicates in WMP. I did delete the duplicated files but they still remain in WMP. When I go to&nbsp;some folders in WMP the songs are gone but some say
 that they are in recycle bin in which it is empty or still duplicates but theirs no destination of where the songs are in properties. Also does WMP 12 have restore media library in WMP. I think that will fix the problem if I can find it.

<p>Yes it's easy to miss that 'Restore Media Library' tool... two ways of getting it - both shown here (under

<p>Green arrows to permanently display menu bar or right-click in the red oval area to bring up menu dialogue box....</p>

            That's good - how is the library set up on the external drive? (I used an external drive with my previous laptop and only operated the EHD library in a separate user account - that seemed to avoid a lot of the pitfalls!)

            I just use the external hard drive just for music only and when I download any new music goes directly to there. I don't have any music in the music folder in C/drive. One question is there is folders without album art work in the external&nbsp; HD. Can I put
 art work in those folders&nbsp;and will it recognize or can I update external HD music&nbsp;folders to get the art work.

            <p>That should still work, yes (although I would not use 'update media info') &nbsp;- you can just copy and paste the album art to the square In WMP&nbsp;from google images. I like to keep a folder of downloaded album art in the pictures folder (jpeg files are best -
 png can cause problems although they are supposed to work) - If it just needs to be put on the folder you can title the jpeg 'Folder' and paste it directly in - that'll work.&nbsp;(example below) I then make 'Folder' a hidden item in its general properties tab.</p>

            Hi H280,<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, you will experience interruption when switching plans. The behavior will be the same as adding a user's license for the first time, meaning that some apps like
<strong>Mail </strong>and <strong>Calendar </strong>will show up as "<strong>Setting Up...</strong>".<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a799c751-6236-4948-ab4b-617555c7ff34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a799c751-6236-4948-ab4b-617555c7ff34" /></a><br />
<br />
Your mailbox will stay the same, which means that your e-mails will also be kept, and any e-mails sent to that address should be received.<br />
<br />
However, in order to ensure the protection of your data, we suggest backing up important e-mails as well as other data and also prepare for a prolonged downtime in case something went wrong.<br />
<br />
I would also share with you the <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Office365-License-cfd9489c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 License Reporting and Management Tool</a> for your license management. This tool includes a GUI that can help simplify the process of migrating to a new plan.<br />
<br />
Lastly, please do keep in mind the best practice is to do your own testing before using any of this in a production environment.<br />
<br />

    <title>Outlook 2013 Reminders Dismissing Themselves - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt_s_84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 Reminders Dismissing Themselves</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue with Outlook 2013 reminders. When the time has been reached for the reminder to appear, the Reminders window opens up, you briefly get to see the calendar entry and then it just disappears leaving the Reminders window open and empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users that are affected are not actioning the calendar entry with a Dismiss or Dismiss All, and what they would normally do is just leave the item in the Reminders window and just hit X on the top right. This obviously leaves a historical trail of calendar
 reminders in the window, but this is how they work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mailbox for these affected users is open in 2 locations. The first is by the locally installed Outlook 2013 client on their PC where the issue is happening, and the next is within our Citrix environment. The Outlook client within Citrix that has their
 mailbox open as well has reminders turned off to stop dual reminder boxes appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that regardless if the mailbox is open in 2 locations, its the Outlook client that looks after the reminders window, so even if it is turned off in one location and on in another this should not have any affect on the reminders themselves,
 and when testing, this is the results I got.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is baffling is that the reminders just seem to be actioning themselves and just disappearing, any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Matt</p>

    <title>Cannot clear the Auto-Complete Cache or List from Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tess harris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot clear the Auto-Complete Cache or List from Outlook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>I installed Office 2010 after uninstalling Office 2007, using helpful instructions provided by people on this forum.</p>
<p>For Outlook, I moved the .pst files and renamed the nk2 file as I wanted to start with a clean program. I had been unable to clear the old 2007 nickname cache (despite help from this forum) and that issue persisted.</p>
<p>I created a new profile etc.</p>
<p>Alas, the old names keep popping up in the To box, including some people who are dead many years.</p>
<p>I've disabled the Auto-Complete in Options, I have cleared and restarted several times, I have searched high and low, in vain, for a solution.</p>
<p>Is there a way for me to get rid of these suggested names for ever?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            A lot depends on how you actually migrated your data. Outlook 2010 no longer uses an NK2 file. If you migrated your NK2 file, just empty your Suggested Contacts Folder.

<p>Hi Russ</p>
<p>You may recall you gave me good advice a few weeks ago, prior to my installing 2010.</p>
<p>I didn't migrate the NK2 file. I renamed it .bak and only moved/copied the pst files.</p>
<p>I just checked the Suggested Contacts folder and there's only one person there, an addition today.</p>

<p>Something doesn't fit here. Your autocompletion cache could not have transferred to a new Outlook 2010 profile unless you expressly did so using an "importNK2" startup switch in Outlook 2010. The nearly empty Suggested Contacts Folder verifies that. Perhaps
 you are confusing autocompletion behavior with autoresolution. State the behavior you are seeing that makes you think your autocompletion cache was transferred.</p>
<p>It is always a gamble when you try to install Outlook on a partition where an earlier version was installed. Odd things usually do happen, but I've not seen this one yet. Any information you might have on how you created your new profile might provide some
 additional clues. Renaming your previous NK2 file would not have been necessary since Outlook 2010 would not have used it. The fact that you were previously unable to clear your autocompletion cache in Outlook 2007 is another clue. I've never seen a situation
 where the autocompletion cache could not be cleared unless the file was still in use because of an incomplete exit of Outlook.</p>

            Autoresolution is what happens as you send&nbsp;a message&nbsp;where Outlook tries to verify the address and reconcile it to what exists in your Contacts Folder. Autocompletion is what happens while you are still typing within the To: field of a new message.

<p>Hi Russ,</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>My problem is with autocompletion. Each time I enter a name, I get a list of possible contacts, including the dead and changed ones.</p>
<p>You asked for more information on how I created the new profile in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>After closing the folders in Outlook 2007 and shutting Outlook down, I copied the main Outlook pst file (which had been stored in the Outlook program folder) to a new folder on my hard drive. I had read that Outlook 2010 created an 'Outlook Files' folder
 but I didn't save it there as I had read (from one of your posts) that it was best to keep it separate. This file contains just the inbox, plus a few 'pending folders', calendar and contacts. I have one main contacts folder and a LinkedIn contacts folder created
 when I installed an outlook LinkedIn add-in.</p>
<p>I also copied a pst data file that I was using for Active and Completed emails, which has a sub-folder structure for all the projects I'm working on.</p>
<p>I uninstalled Office 2007, ran CCleaner, disk clean up etc.</p>
<p>I installed Office 2010. I created a new profile in Mail and manually configured the pop account. I think I then copied the pst files to the new Outlook Files folder/directory, then opened Outlook and opened the old pst file. I then closed down Outlook and
 removed the new pst file it had created. I then opened the Active/Completed pst file.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help with this.</p>
<p>Tess</p>

<p>When you created the new profile in Outlook 2010, did you give it a new, unique name or just use the name Outlook proposed? Did you set your old PST file as the default before you removed the new one?</p>
<p>What would have worked best is to place your old PST file somewhere _other_ than the default location, then connected to it as you were creating the new profile instead of letting Outlook create a new PST file. You'll find that option in the manual configurartion
 dialog with Outlook 2010.</p>

<p>I did put the old PST files into a different place from the default location.</p>
<p>However, I then moved them to the new Outlook files folder. It wasn't clear from all the instructions if that was the right thing to do but I figured that would work.</p>
<p>I think that I let Outlook propose a name which is now Outlook1. It created a new pst file which I later removed after I'd moved the old PST into the new Outlook Files folder.</p>
<p>What do you suggest I do?</p>

<p>I still don't think you've managed to create a new profile&nbsp;if you didn't specify a unique name. That would explain why you still have your old autocompletion cache. You're still using the profile settings from Outlook 2007. An Outlook 2010 profile won't
 use the NK2 file.</p>
<p>First make sure you have a good copy of your previous Outlook data file in a neutral location on your hard drive. Create a new Outlook profile with a&nbsp;unique name in Outlook 2010. Connect it to your old PST file before you finish creating the profile by using
 the manual configuration option and selecting the option to use an existing data file,&nbsp;selecting your old PST file. There's no way your autocompletion cache could persist using that path. If it does, it would be a first.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks Russ. I will try that.</p>
<p>I have a related issue, which is to do with an IMAP account (not Google) that I use in addition to my POP accounts. Outlook persists in creating a PST file in the old Outlook folder, not the new Outlook Files folder. I've removed and reinstalled the email
 account twice and tried to point it at the PST file which I copied to Outlook Files, but it still creates a new PST file each time in the old Outlook folder</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, those steps don't work for me. If you click on the plus sign next to the box you only get some options for a "New Chat" or "Add New Bots."</p>

<h2>            Cortana is not altering me when time to leave for appointments,  etc.</h2>
                    <p>Back in windows phone 8.1 Cortana would notify me that it's time to leave for work, home, &nbsp;or other appointments. Now, &nbsp;since updating to windows 10 mobile on my L1520 and L950 I'm not getting any notifications from her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling everything, rebooting, and then re-enabling all the tick boxes and still nothing. Has anyone got a way to fix get? &nbsp;I really miss the little things she did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in the US on at&amp;t with a surface pro 3, lumia 1520, and lumia 950.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks so much&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Are you setting your reminders on the phone? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as an FYI, as I replied to your post I set a reminder on my 950XL&nbsp;to alert meat a specified time. When the time arrived (just a few minute after I set it) the reminder appeared on my PC and on my device exactly on time. So when I use a reminder I have
 always set it using my phone but I decided to try it using my PC since I was working on it to reply to you. As soon as I set a new reminder I checked the list on my device and it was there as well so it syncs over quickly. At the specified time, it sounded
 on both my device and PC.</p>

<div>
<div>Cortana is still adapting to the PC, so right now reminders can't be edited in Windows 10. Also, reminders can only sync across Windows 10 devices. So if you created one on Windows 10, you'll need to set a new one on your Windows 8.1 phone. Person-based
 reminders ( as in, "Cortana, remind me to say happy birthday when Jill calls") currently only work for the following scenarios:
<ul>
<li><strong>Modern email app</strong> -you compose or receive an email from someone in your contact list on your desktop or mobile device.</li><li><strong>Calls</strong> -you call, or get a call, from one of your contacts. (phone only)</li><li><strong>Text-</strong> you send, or get, a text from one of your contacts. (phone only)</li></ul>

            <p>Yes, everything is done on the phone. I did a factory reset on my L1520 to check it on that phone. She &nbsp;didn't remind me to leave on that one either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't revert to Win8.1 to check that.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm not sure what to offer. So if you ask it to remind you when it is a certain time on your device, nothing comes up on your phone? If you set a reminder on your phone for 5 minutes from when you read this, nothing will happen?

            <p>Oh yes, I can set location reminders, time reminders, and contact reminders... Those all work with no issue.</p>
<p>Cortana used to remind me automatically of calendar appointments. When to leave, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can set the appointment in Outlook and my Android tablet will pick it up and notify when to leave (google now)</p>
<p>I use my microsoft account with outlook for my calendar. I have the tick boxes in the Cortana notebook (screen grabs attached).</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have defined my home, work, and other address in the notebook as well. Cortana knows where I am and where I work.. (Screen grab attached)</p>

            <p>So that is how mine are set but I just made a change (I did not have notify me when it is time to go to work) and I just added a new test event (watch the Patriots pre-game show) so we will see if it works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen driving notifications before but never paid much attention. I generally just add a reminder which now as I understand it work for you. I'll play around with it. Although it should not be, it is a work in progress and I expect Cortana will get
 better and better.</p>

            <p>Time to leave hasn't worked for me either in Windows Mobile 10. Never for me to go to work and&nbsp; for calendar appointments with addresses.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since they change the location feature in outlook where it no longer provides location address suggestions is probably the likely the cause as well as the new Map app.</p>

            <p>Hello, Guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query to Microsoft Community. We understand that you're having issues with reminders set up via the Cortana assistant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When setting up the reminder through the said assistant, you will have to confirm if you would like to be reminded. For example you've set up the reminder to meet someone at 6:00 PM, at a certain location. Cortana will ask if you would like to be reminded.
 Say "YES" and the reminder reminder alarm would go off once the time has come.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try it and keep us posted.</p>
        </p>

            The reminder is not the same as time to leave. The reminder is set to a specific time where as the time to leave is based on traffic, speed limits and your route to the appointment.

            Not a particularly helpful response as it is still possible to manually update firmware upon device, although choice of language set may be restricted.

<h2>            Is There a Problem With The Find My Phone Website&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The last time the Find My Phone website was able to find my phone (Nokia 920) was yesterday, 10/03/2014 12:27 PM.&nbsp; I tried several times today with the phone screen unlocked sitting right next to me and after several minutes after refreshing the Find My
 Phone website it times out &amp; says it can't find my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I clicked on 'Ring' my phone.&nbsp; It successfully rings my phone, but the website says sorry we couldn't ring your phone.&nbsp; Huh?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sitting at home where I have very good cell coverage (4G LTE) and also Wi-Fi connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the settings in my phone and both option boxes are checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anybody else having trouble getting the Find My Phone website to work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several months ago it worked like a charm every time.&nbsp; The OS was updated to 8.1 a few weeks ago but I don't know if that has anything to do with it or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service seems to be working fine on my end. Are the date and time settings correct on your phone?
</p>
<p>Also, have you tried it again since? This may be a momentary bug</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try soft resetting the device if the issue persists by holding the volume down and power buttons for a few seconds.
<br />
<br />
Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Denis</p>

<h2>            &#91;Please help&#93; I can&#39;t stop forwarding emails from Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use to forward my emails from office 365 to my personal email account. Right now, when i enter the Options page &gt; Mails &gt; Accounts &gt; Forwarding, and presses on Stop forwarding, it just doesn't work. I am pestered daily by the spams of this account. Please,
 can any knowledgeable soul help me on this? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi all, </p>
<p>I have finally solved the issue!! :)</p>
<p>My admin found no forwarding rules set, but turns out there was a rule set under 'mail and sweep rules' to redirect all my emails to my personal account.
</p>
<p>I have set a forwarding rule a few years back, before the interface of Office 365 made a change.
</p>
<p>Post-upgrade, the forwarding rule was translated into a mail sweep rule.</p>
<p>Mystery solved, thank you for all your kind help, it has done me a great favor.</p>
<p>Have a great day everyone.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive - Something went wrong - Error code&#58; 6</h2>
                    <p>I've read some other threads about this issue, but I'm having this since this afternoon - at work - and now - on another pc at home - I experience the same. I tried the suggenstions from&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-do-the-onedrive-error-codes-mean-f7a68338-e540-4ebf-ad5d-56c5633acded?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What
 do the OneDrive error codes mean?</a>, however, to no avail:</p>
<p>- my internet connection is fine</p>
<p>- the <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Service Health portal</a> states "We're all good!", with a green check next to OneDrive.</p>
<p>- I restarted my computer, but this didn't help either</p>
<p>- I can access my other Microsoft services, eg mail or contacts&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of my files, I also have on my pc, but since my hard disk is too small, a number of folders (82 GB) is only available online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this lasts for quite some time (half a day), I thought it would be better to post a question in the Ms Community, so at least someone will take care of it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it will be solved soon!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>

                    <p>I got a phone call that I was putting out a 139&nbsp;virus&nbsp;&nbsp;and that Microsoft was in partner in this software(Team Viewer) and they remotley download it and went in to my computer telling me all along that I have very,very&nbsp;dangerous files&nbsp;all over my computer
 and that only Microsoft knows about it this virus 139.&nbsp;I do have a good anti-virus and a good tune up program (AVG not the free one)And that my computer was going to crash in a few day's.This guy was hard to understand and in my computer before I knew it.
 Do you know anything about this???</p>

<h2>            unable to send emails as IP was blocked</h2>
                    <div>original title: MSN has blacklisted our IP. Why?</div>
<div>Hi</div>
<div><br />
</div>
First of all here is the situation
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In my kids' school our parent community is using emails to communicate. Using it HEAVILY. We rely on these!</div>
<div>We have roughly 500 parents out of which maybe 100 have MS email accounts. Since few days ago MS decided not to deliver our emails to those parents with MS accounts saying that we (our IP) have been blacklisted. This was made clear by an error message
 returned by the MS (NOT the users!)</div>
<div>There was a link which led me to a detailed form (clearly tailored for spammers) which I filled in and submitted</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is the ordeal:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. No phone number or email address that I can contact. No human to communicate with</div>
<div>2. I call the MS support and was forwarded to MS Spam department. In here I was told that because this is a technical issue I have to go to answer.microsoft.com online community for answers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now my questions:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Why there isn't team that receives actual phone call and emails where these issues can be expedited and explained?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. Why do I have to go to an online community to find out WHY our I has been blocked?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. THE MOST IMPORTANT: WHO DO IT TALK (T-A-L-K) to IN ORDER TO EXPEDIT THIS AND REMOVE US FROM THE BLACKLIST</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My understanding is that there's actual MS people who read this, so please MS try to make this right and let us resolve this problem. Right now at least 100 families are cut off from our email communications which is simply bad.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did not mean to be personal, but clearly I am upset as we are facing a form of a crisis where I am being sent from door to door without any answers for the second day</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help is more than appreciated</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thank you</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Emil</div>

<p>Sorry for it took long for us to respond to you and for the inconvenience that you were unable to send emails as they were returned. Let me see how I can help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to inform you that you're already in the right forum. For issues regarding Outlook.com including your issue, phone support is not an option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;we would like to investigate your issue and find out the reason the message was bounced. Please provide us the complete message header of the bounce message you received.
<font>I would like you to send this via the private message area I created for you. For you to be able to access the private message area, click on the "You have a private reply to this message.<b>"</b>Post back to this thread that you've replied to it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Also, please provide us the link of the form that you fill in when the email message was not delivered. We wish to verify if this is the link/form from us.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Looking forward to your response.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Thanks!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello There
<div><br />
<div>First of all I want to thank you for the private message. Not having a phone option is clearly a huge problem here. 1-2-1 communication is not going anyway and it is the best and most efficient way of resolving problems. MS is not exempt form this. This
 is why this issues is in it's 5th day.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The link where I initially filled (it was in the error message we got back for the SMTP):</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="https://support.live.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl3&amp;ct=eformts&amp;scrx=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.live.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl3&amp;ct=eformts&amp;scrx=1</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>As a result of this I exchanged a few emails with Hotmail guys (SEE BELOW). At the very bottom is the error message from today (one of many in the past few days)</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is not good. There is this SmartScreen that clearly is not working as expected and on top of that us - who do NOT abuse the system - we have to adapt to the requirements of this system that doesn't work in the first place.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am really hoping to be able to resolve this ASAP as currently a huge group of parents are not receiving are emails</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks you</div>
<div><br />
<div>Emil</div>

<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><font>Hello Girish</font>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>There is one BIG problem here. we are a school community and we RELY on those emails 110%</font></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>You said "Unfortunately, after reviewing the information you provided and in compliance with our mail policies, we are unable to offer immediate mitigation for your deliverability issue.â</font></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>So what is it exactly that you guys need in order to be&nbsp;able to offer immediate mitigation. As you can see on Friday we were removed form one of those black lists. Now&nbsp;there is another one that we are&nbsp;stuck with? See the problem?&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>I know all too well that spamming is a big problem, but this is a proof that these anti-spam system cause more problems than they solve. I still&nbsp;receive tons of unwanted emails every day, and yet here we are a school trying to communicate our issues
 with parents and we get blacklisted for some made-up reason. Those who spam know how to go around these system and we just donât care and yet get caught in the net.</font></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>Girish, I need more than this. I understand that you have to follow&nbsp;protocols and rules, but clearly we have a problem here and leaving us out in the cold with these guidelines and documents to read in a hope that once our emailing pattern changes
 (why would it?) the problem will just go away. We do NOT have time for this. We need to send out&nbsp;communications to parents on regular basis.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><br />
<div>I look forward to hearing from you and have some more immediate solution here</div>
<div><br />
<div>Kind Regards</div>

<p>
</p><p>Read the error message in the upper screenshot. That's what the problem is. You don't have a printer installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you have a printer installed on your computer and that your preferred printer is set as the default printer. Without a printer installed, Excel does not know how a page should be displayed in print view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a physical printer, you can select a PDF printer that may already be pre-installed on your machine, or install a 3rd party PDF printer and select it as the default printer.&nbsp;</p>
