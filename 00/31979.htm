            <p>Hey Pawan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for ur help. this is a local account (only 1 on my system ... me{lol}). tried the SFC, but it said no problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is all happening since i installed a TP-Link USB Wifi Adapter. it worked fine for a while but now it's having trouble connecting to the Wifi in my building i always use to connect to easily. also when i can get connected to a friends (in the building)
 it doesn't ask me for a login screen. so i can only connect through this friends wifi, but in trying to connect to the regular portals i use to use it will either seach (till it times out) or say it's connected when it's not (and usually the yellow triangle
 w/ the exclamation point).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>there's a 'wifi' setting in the Airplane mode that i think would fix this, but the whole 'Airplane' mode has disappeared. i did also check for updates. all set there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but thanks for ur help.</p>

            <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>was on the phone/internet Sun 3/26 for 20 hours. that's right twenty! talked with Joselito who checked out my system and had me download the mediacreationtool.exe (which took like 5 hours to download). it did nothing. he created a case # 1332147138. worse
 when i called back and asked for some more help, i found out he didn't even write down my problem, let alone document all he did. he should be fired! not even disciplined. fired.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>called back and got a supervisor Albert Mark (or got him through a super). anyway, after watching him do all the tests Joselito did (to no avail), he had me download the Win10_1511_1_English_x64.iso file, which he assured would fix the problem. another 6
 hour download that did not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>outsourcing help to the Phillipines? un-**** blievable. and they call bill gates a success? huh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>wanna guess again? </p>
<p>
</p><p>y can't u just fix your product? </p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for frustration. u guys r good a that... i'll give ya.</p>

<p>“No Windows Store login window, Windows 10”</p>
<p>“Sync option grayed out Windows 10”</p>
<p>“Error trying to log into Windows Store”</p>
<p>“OneNote will not Sync”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These and errors similar are flooding Internet Help Forums since Microsoft released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The end point, you were able to log into the Windows Store after upgrade or update, but several weeks later after tapping “Sign In” the
 log in windows quickly appears then disappears. In Settings&gt;Account&gt;Sync you noticed all options are grayed out.</p>
<p>You searched the self help forums, nothing.</p>
<p>Contacted Microsoft, nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the cause, effect &amp; solution. No one is going to like this. First to establish my credentials, I have 5 IT degrees &amp; Certificates. I have a CompTIA A+, 3 DCSE, and 2 degrees from going to an IT school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAUSE: After setting up Windows 10 User Sam logs into the Windows Store for the first time. He logged in with his Microsoft Passport account. When asked to make his account secure by entering his computer login password or pin he chooses “Just log into this
 app only” or similar. He has just defeated the Microsoft security system. Now Sam puts in his credit card information to buy apps, and all seems okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EFFECT: Although Microsoft allows users to choose “just log into this app” without any more security, the Store itself was not intended to bypass 3<sup>rd</sup> stage security. When a user does not use all stages of security the login for the store will
 fail after a few weeks, then Sync will stop for most if not all apps on Sam’s Windows 10 device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this mean I have to use the “Sign un with a Microsoft Account Instead” option?</p>
<p>This explanation will sound odd, no you will not, but the system will. Set up your system as always, then go to Settings&gt;Accounts create a password for the system then a computer user login pin. After doing that go to the Windows Store, use your Microsoft
 Passport information to log in, when asked to enter your computer password DO IT, then it will ask for your PIN, ENTER IT. You will be emailed a security key. Open your email, copy and paste the key in the security box provided. An encrypted digital key will
 then be created to lock your device to your account. Each user can have 10 devices on one account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what if you did not do the above and you can’t log into the Store or get Sync to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOLUTION: This is the sad part. There is NO fix after the lock out has taken place. You can search all you want, you can clear Store Cache, you can run Troubleshoot to fix the Store, you can call MS and spend hours on phone. Once security lock out happens,
 that device is locked out. There is NO fix from within the current install. As hard as it is to accept you have to reinstall Windows 10. So I suggest save time, stop trying every idea on the Internet (I tried then all) and reinstall. Once you have reinstalled
 go to Settings&gt;Accounts, create a user password (can be done during install but I would wait) then a pin. Then go to the Store and log in as described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>This is currently the only fix. But why? Consider if you logged in without security and your account got hacked, you would blame Microsoft, but this leaves it up to you. It is cumbersome, but it
 is more secure.</span>

<h2>            Xbox One Controller &#38; Windows 10 Connection issues</h2>
                    <p>I have a bit of a strange issue here: my Xbox One controller connects to my PC initially, but if it powers off after the 15 minute wait period, it won't reconnect until I restart my PC.<br /><br />I'm using the official Xbox One Controller and official wireless adapter in a USB 3.0 port, with new batteries and everything. At any point, I'm able to connect my controller to my PC, but only once for some odd reason. I've also had similar issues using bluetooth and other wireless controllers, which is why I decided to get an Xbox One controller.</p><p>So far, I'm believing it might be either a driver issue (unlikely since I've reinstalled them), or an interference issue, which could possibly occur if the wireless adapter is on the 2.4GHz band due to a nearby wireless home phone, an adapter for a Logitech g930 headset, and a dual band wireless router. However, since the controller does connect initially and stays connected, and does not disconnect until either the PC is turned off or the con

</p><p>The error appears to happen randomly, I have been preforming different tasks each time it happens.</p>

<br />
More troubleshooting if needed :<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems), their<br />
on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />
Update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers</strong> (all of those can have a definite impact on boot speed and performance).<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings
<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop and <br />
Start Screen.<br />
<br />
Check&nbsp;Startup Programs.<br />
<br />
Right Click in the lower&nbsp;left hand corner - Task Manager<br />
Or WinKEY + X - Task Manager<br />
Or Right Click the Taskbar - Task Manager<br />
<br />
Check the StartUp tab.<br />

<div>The changes that it is talking about is it finding the new hardware (motherboard, etc.). You have to restart to reload those drivers to have them work correctly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To access the BIOS, you have to be quick. You monitor may not initialize before it goes from the POST screen to the Windows startup. Try hitting DEL as soon as you turn on the PC, and keep pressing it (Assuming that your MB uses DEL to access the BIOS).</div>

            The software choose which version and which Direct X files to use. <br />
Is the file you are trying to use with Movie Maker using a compatible format ?<br />
What exactly is, or is not happening when you try to use Move Maker ?<br />
<br />
Is your DirectX up to date ?<br />

<h2>            How do I set up my Windows 10 laptop to disable&#47;ignore WIFI when Ethernet is available&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Instructions I have found online, (such as http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/give-ethernet-higher-priority-over-wifi-connection-in-windows-10),&nbsp;&nbsp;advise me to go to
<strong>Change adapter settings</strong> from my Control Panel, then click Alt to view menus (great tip!). Then, I should be able to access Advanced &gt; Advanced Settings. From Advanced Settings, I should be able to see the
<strong>Adapters and Bindings </strong>tab, where I can specify the order of the connection types (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Remote Access connections). My Advanced Settings window does not provide that tab. Do you know why? Are these instructions not valid for Windows
 10? If this is not the correct method, please advise how I can control this setting. Thanks!</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Was doing a windows 10 update to a notepad laptop , using pen drive for additional space (as requested by the screen) . When log in screen appears,&nbsp; for the only account,&nbsp; it loads in flight mode only and says password or username incorrect despite it being
 the correct password&nbsp; and only user. Shift and restart options to load blue screen for other options like roll back version won't work as pretty much all options require same log in details from home page that it won't accept. Safe mode with networking option
 doesn't work either.&nbsp; Can't do a usb reboot on the device it , it says device cant do it and no DVD drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I best trying to go down command prompt route and look at user corruption as the problem ? Can anyone advise ?</p>

<br />If you cannot sign in Safe Mode following one of these methods: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />then I would Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC to do the vastly superior Clean install, making sure during the install to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:. These steps compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:

<p>The HP website reports that printer as not supported on Windows 10, however it says that Windows 8 has a driver for that printer in the Windows Driver cache, so I would check if this is also true in Windows 10</p>

 installed the Bluetooth and it seemed to go fine then when I tried to open the settings a pop up appeared saying that Group Policy has turned off the Bluetooth. I haven't been able to find anything about this online that pertains to or matches my situation
 I am unsure what is going on but if anyone can help out I would greatly appreciate the help in fixing the issue.<br />

 every startup. The MEMORY.DMP has already reached 100 Mb. Here are the error codes for two days:</p>

<p>&gt; there was no BSOD and there still isn't</p>
<p>I suppose it was just too good to be true. The next day the system BSODed as usual. Spoke to the support once more, they said that some system files were corrupted (namely, the ready boost driver and kernel-something driver) and the only way to repair them
 was to reinstall Windows. Seems that they were right, after the reinstall there has been no BSOD.</p>
<p>So, the problem is solved. Solution: complete reinstall.</p>
<p>P.S. I've got box version of Win 7 Pro so I've used the disk to reinstall the system. During this procedure there is an option to upgrade or refresh (my version is in Russian so I don't know how this option is named in English) the system, the support said
 that it may also be used to repair system drivers. In my case it didn't work due to unidentified problems with compatibility even after I deleted all incompatible programs so I had to choose the other option, to reinstall the system completely (if the system
 disk is not formatted then all the files will be stored in the directory C:\Windows Old).</p>

 both fail to upgrade to Windows 10 through auto upgrade with Error Code 80070005. So far I have tried the following:</span>

<div>4. Creating a DVD from the Windows ISO file (Windows 10 Home 64-bit) - result the Setup.exe runs initially showing the Windows 10 popup screen then stops (DVD grinds to a halt).&nbsp; Task Manager shows no program is running.&nbsp; The same occurs when the setup.exe
 is run on either PC.</div>
<div>5. Clean booted the PC (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/en-us/</a>) and again setup.exe fails to run.</div>
<div>6. Downloaded the Windows 10 Creation Tool (MediaCreationToolx64.exe) - this program also won't run on either PC.</div>
<div>7. Downloaded the Windows Update test tool (WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab) - this tools finds and corrects some errors however Windows 10 setup.exe &nbsp;still won't run.</div>
<div>What gives?&nbsp; Do I have the only two PCs on the planet that won't upgrade?&nbsp; ASUS want me to do a clean install Windows 8.1 on each PC then upgrade to 10.&nbsp; Rebuilding each PC after this exercise would waste more hours of my time.&nbsp; Is there a better option?&nbsp;
 Please help.</div>

            Why are u using/relying on 3rd parties to answer questions about your products? Why are u taking advantage of them without pay? Why don't u make a decent product to begin with? I just bought an Azuz r417n which I will have to return-unusable!&nbsp; It seemed
 to be working OK with win10 1703 until u started forced updates. Then I can't uninstall your updates (not allowed). Was suggested by Asus to install win 1709, but now the computer is so slow and unworkable I can't even do that. Is it possible to download and
 install an earlier version like 160X? I bought the Asus to replace the HP I recently bought which I don't like and also uses win10 1603, I believe. Both computers freeze very often when typing or clicking/scrolling/moving the mouse. Not nearly as bad on the
 HP. I'm sending this on the HP which I had to get out of the box. Is this because u are trying to force me to use internet explorer or to use McAfee? You are a very crooked shady company. How dare you treat the public like this??? It

            Nice,&nbsp; clicked on the link the MSN monitor provided and got "access denied"! You need a good class action lawsuit from millions and millions of people. I'm now making screenshots documenting all my problems with your products and will put together a lawsuit.
 BTW, your 'Office' product is total garbage. The first I see that on a new computer I remove it right away.

<p>most of the replies deal with reformat....the original post says he wants to recover from that drive so reformat doesn't help.....&nbsp;most external usb drives, come with cables that have 2 usb ends, plug them both in to; seperate usb ports on the MB, seperate
 usb hubs, this is because the power causes issues ( current rises voltage drops) so somtimes the access to the drive causes the voltage on a single usb to drop down, the os thinks this is read only/permission issues, with 2 plugged in to seperate power sources
 the issue goes away....they were built that way....</p>
<p>I also never recommend putting a usb drive through a third party hub as most often that can cause the issues with the drive not being recognized.</p>
<p>Having said all that, yes I have had to reformat to get access to a drive, if you cannot write to a drive rclick and look at the permissions, if you had formated the drive on another pc and not changed the permissions to everyone, then under sercurity you
 see permissions set to a long number, this is because it's still set to to original pc (or the id from that pc). Sometimes you can over ride those settings by taking ownership (in the sec settings) and resetting to everyone on the local pc.</p>
<p>Another trick I found about the drive not being recognized....plug it in to the usb as described above and reboot the pc, I've had this work....</p>
<p>Note: I've deal with almost all the different drives avalible as my clients all use them.</p>

<p>Hi Bradner ,</p>
<p>Clicking on the .Lnk files should open up the associated .exe files. However if the .LNK files doesn’t work, this can be because the underlying .EXE association has been broken often by some programs improperly changing the registry or the association in
 the registry can become corrupted.</p>
<p>You may try changing the file association from the Control Panel.</p>
<p>Navigate the following location to change the file association.<br />
<br />
<strong>Start \Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Default Programs\Set Associations</strong></p>
<p>Instructions on how to change is provided in the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Change which programs Windows uses by default<br />

<p>If that doesn’t help, please follow Sean Zhu’s post on Tuesday, May 19, 2009 6:26 AM from the link below on how to restore the .link file association.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/itprovistadesktopui/thread/e8631c28-4ce5-43cc-8865-b75fa2255b57" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/itprovistadesktopui/thread/e8631c28-4ce5-43cc-8865-b75fa2255b57</strong></a></p>
<p>That should do the trick.</p>

    <title>WIndows 7 Activation on MAC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bilcad21  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 7 Activation on MAC</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Parralells on a MAC and have windows 7 running on a virtual machine.&nbsp; I have had troubles with version 5 and will be installing version 6 of Parrellels.&nbsp; My windows activation product key is only being used on this one virtual machine but reloading
 it does not allow activation.&nbsp; Is there a way to show that the key is only being used once?&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call later this morning to see if the phone activation works.&nbsp; I am a student in the VOCREHAB program through the VA so getting money for a new key is unlikely.&nbsp;
 Any help from someone who has experienced a similar issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Bill</p>

<p>Please note, a Virtual Machine must also licensed just like a physical machine. Regardless you might have the license on one machine, and then install the same license in a virtual machine, its two separate installations.</p>
<p>If this is not the case, try using phone activation:</p>
<p>Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person.</p>

<p>so just to be clear - lets say you have a retail copy of win7 installed via bootcamp on a mac (which I currently do), but then if you want to run a virtual machine (fusion) you have to buy a whole new retail copy of win7 to do this???? even though the OS
 will be run on the same machine???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what if I run the BC partition using fusion? this is not technically another installation as I'm running my BC partition. what happens in this case?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

<p>No what I have is 1 use of the software but I have had to reload it several times because parellels 5 has issues with windows 7.&nbsp; I will be installing parellels 6 tonight and want to load the virtual machine with windows 7 but it appears I cannot use my
 product key because it was used once already.&nbsp; That's 200.00 to reuse my product key?&nbsp; I am not running windows 7 on any other computer or virtual machine.&nbsp; Parelles can create a new virtual machine if the one you are using gets a virus or becomes inoperable
 by simply creating a new virtual machine.&nbsp; I am realizing this venture into MAC and windows working together is still just that an adventure that if you truly need to use the software for school or business just buy the MAC version or don't use it at all.</p>

This is supported - you can run your bootcamp partition using fusion. So again, this is just one installation either run natively using bootcamp, or virtual using fusion accessing that same bootcamp partition. So my question is - if there are lisensing issues
 will microsoft hook me up with a new activation key? (I've read SEVERAL posts where MS has done this for its customers in the past) As Fusion states that if we run into these issues we need to check with microsoft. Certainly microsoft will not make me buy
 another product since I'm using the SAME installation right?<br />
