<h2>            Inbox folder disappeared from Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>My computer is brand new and is a little sensitive.&nbsp; I was working in Outlook 2010 and noticed my Inbox folder disappeared from the folders section on the left.&nbsp; Its not listed in my favorites either.&nbsp; I have done a search into every other folder I have
 and also expanded all folders.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Please help!&nbsp; The only way I can access my Inbox is by going onto the Outlook Today page.&nbsp; Very annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel Template only opens as a normal worksheet.</h2>
                    <p>So, I have created a template and it is saved into my "Custom Office Templates" folder, it is also accessible when I open a new excel file under the "Custom Templates" tab. However, when I put a copy of this file onto the Dropbox that our company shares,
 it does not open as a template from my computer or any others. It just opens the file as a normal excel worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, we need to have your concern clarified. When you mentioned that the file only opens as a normal Excel worksheet, does it mean that template's information was missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you download the file, or are you trying to open it via Excel Online?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>All of the template's information and all formulas are intact. The file opens and I can edit it, but when I press "save" it just saves the file as if it is the most updated version, as opposed to letting me save the copy as a new file, keeping the template
 blank for future usage as a re-usable template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the file and saved it as a template. When I open it from excel or my "custom office templates" folder, it opens as it should. But now when I paste a copy into the dropbox, it doesn't open as a reusable template.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft account is sending and receiving spam emails.</h2>
                    <p>Old Title: emails sent to me FROM MY ACCOUNT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have received another email to myself purporting to come from my account. I had a rash of these in September and spoof emails in their hundreds were sent from my account but not by me. I looked at this forum and answers that had been given to other victims
 and followed the instructions, set up more security and changed my password. All seemed well until today. I have looked at the source and it seems to be coming from Rumania and is about "meds" which I don't want. My junk filter is set to exclusive so it remains
 in my junk mail but I need to know if I have to set yet another password and what to do with the message. To whom do I send details of the source?</p>

<p>
</p><p>No I have not been able to resolve the problem. I have not had any help from Microsoft other than repeated advice to change my password etc., etc., all of which I had already done and continue to do regularly now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem began when a friend's email account was hacked and subsequently my own was compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received scam emails purporting to come from paypal but not from my own email address.</p>
<p>The ones I receive regularly "from my address" are for dubious meds. and I don't open them.</p>

<p>However I&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">do</span> find it alarming and want it to stop but like you I am clueless as to how - &nbsp;short of closing my account.</p>
<p>

            <p>tiptoe, thank you very much for replying. I'm sorry there has been no help. After reading many many requests for help on a variety of issues it seems that microsoft is at a loss or has no interest in helping people. If I can find a solution I will be sure
 to let you know. Someone did suggest blocking them but I have not tried it because it would only be a bandaid not a fix.

<h2>            I am getting a VBA project error when trying to open a access database.</h2>
                    <p>When I try to open the database I get the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The database cannot be opened because the VBA project contained in it cannot be read.&nbsp; The database can be opened only if the VBA project is first deleted.&nbsp;Deleting the VBA Project removes all code from modules, forms and reports.&nbsp; You should back up your
 database before attempting to open the database and delete the VBA Project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The file I am opening is a backup copy that worked with Access 2016 before May 12, 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also tried three other older files and still get the same error.&nbsp;&nbsp; How does this work one day and not the next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to decompile the database and this did not work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am missing queries, forms do not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked online for fixes but everything is talking about older version of Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any help you can provide would be grateful as this is a critical database.</p>

<p>This message is known and there are a few different solutions offered if you search on the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most successful seems to be to open a blank database and import all the objects from the problem file. In your case, since you have working copies, I would just import the objects you need then copy them into a working copy.</p>

<p>Hello all</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had to start the database all over.</p>
<p>Yes I started with a new database and copied in what I could from the old database.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tables were ok.&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 1/2 of queries we bad and had to be redone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least the macros were ok and I was able to see what queries we missing that would not
 copy over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say yes my question was answered the best and this can be closed as I will not be able to restore the original database and at this point I don't want to as I have redone the database and do not now that old version.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

    <title>VBA to open all txt files in a folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ecoeco  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA to open all txt files in a folder</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
This was the first time I used VBA code for excel. I recorded Macro as follows. <br />
However I have two questions to <br />
1. The code below requires to write down all file names. How can I modify the code to&nbsp; open all files in a folder?<br />
2. I closed the original file after saving the new file but&nbsp; it can't be recorded properly. Thus the code below does not allow to close the original file. How can I modify?<br />
Please advise. Thank you for your help in advance.<br />

            <p>Here is some 'bare bones' code to show how opening all .txt files in a particular folder could be done.&nbsp; But as Hans V has indicated - what do you want to do with them once you get them opened?&nbsp; This code sets up to read from the files one line at a time.&nbsp;
 But your other code is trying to open them as a Workbook - with uncertain results?&nbsp; But that could also be done.&nbsp; If your Workbooks.OpenText code would work for all of them, let us know - along with what to really do with them after opening them - do you want
 to simply save them out as a .csv or perhaps even a .xls or .xlsx file?</p>

<p>Hi GeekGriff,</p>
<p>Class Notebooks that are created in Microsoft Teams cannot be managed in Add/Remove Student in the Web Application. Since Teams has its own membership, any changes to the notebook must be made to the Team.</p>

<h2>            Can not verify PlanetHoster domain</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I have a PlanetHoster domain and I can not pass the verification process. I'm the owner of my domain : s****a.fr</p>
<p>PlanetHoster does not accept @ in domain name. I must enter in the PlanetHoster cPanel the name of my domain name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I correctly add a TXT record with MS=msxxxxxxxxx and set TTL value to 3600.</p>
<p>I wait a few minutes and I can see this value with nslookup command and some online tools (mxlookup...)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">http://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=a%3as****a.fr&amp;run=toolpage#</span></p>
<p>So, I don't understand why Office 365 refused to validate my domain.</p>
<p>I also try with a MX record without success. I try a MX entry with&nbsp; msxxxxxxx.msv1.invalid and msxxxxxxx.msv1.invalid.outlook.com. Same problem: no validation.</p>
<p>I already contact the PlanetHoster support team. There is no error in my configuration. So, what's the problem?</p>
<p>Does Office 365 support PlanetHoster domains?</p>
<p>Does something wrong with my domain and Office 365?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Denis</p>

<p>Hi Denis,</p>
<p>We have masked the domain in your thread, in order to protect your privacy.</p>
<p>After a quick check on the s****a.fr, we currently found you have added both the TXT record and the MX record for verify the domain. Please first remove&nbsp;either of them&nbsp;to leave only one record, and if you would like to add the MX record, please use these
 values as the below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Record Type: MX<br />
&nbsp;Alias or Host Name: s****a.fr<br />
&nbsp;Value: MS=msXXXXXXXX<br />
&nbsp;Priority: use a lower priority than the priority for any existing MX records<br />
&nbsp;TTL: 1 hr</p>
<p>It may take up to 72 hrs for DNS records to take effect.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we would like to collect your tenant information, please read and reply through the private message I have sent you at

<p>Hi Denis,</p>
<p>It is good to know that the situation is now sorted out, by removing the custom domain from your previous tenant.</p>
<p>We have checked that so****ta.fr is verified in the Office 365 tenant of so****ta.onmicrosoft.com.</p>
<p>We appreciate your working with us.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com display &#38; sender name different from account name</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I can't for the life of me seem to figure out how to change the name that appears when I send e-mails from my outlook.com account.<br />
Every article I've read illustrates how to change account display names. Well, I've done that, but it's made no difference to my e-mail</p>
<p>account.<br />
<br />
I have set my name in my Microsoft account as 'Benjamin Jowett' but when I send e-mails it is sending as 'Stylo J' and this name is</p>
<p>also appearing in the top right of my outlook account. If I click through to 'Edit Profile' or any account options, it will show my name</p>
<p>as 'Benjamin Jowett' but my e-mail sender name is 'Stylo J.'<br />
<br />
I would like to get my sender display name to also display as 'Benjamin Jowett.'<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Benjamin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change the displayed name in your Outlook account by going to your Account Settings. The action you've made is actually correct. It's just that, the changes made are still not showing yet on your browser. For us to troubleshoot this issue, we recommend
 that you sign in your account using another web browser. With this, we can confirm if the changes are successfully applied to your account or not. There's a possibility that it has something to do with the cookies on your current browser.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Crashing Across Domain</h2>
                    <p>Over the past month, I'm getting quite a few reports of Outlook randomly crashing across the domain.&nbsp; It seems to be specific to certain people for some reason.&nbsp; I have not experienced it myself, but a few users are seeing it multiple times per day.&nbsp; The
 error coming through in event viewer is 'Add-in execution error. Outlook crashed during the 'Open' callback of the 'ItemEvents_10' interface while calling into the '' add-in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attempted the following:</p>
<p>Disabled all Add-ins</p>
<p>Uninstalled/Reinstalled Add-ins</p>
<p>Updated LoadBehavior to 3 and 0 (to force as well as not force)</p>
<p>Upgraded Office from 2013 to Click to Run</p>
<p>Upgraded 2013 client from 32bit to 64bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disabled Proxy</p>
<p>Disabled Anti-Virus</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's across the board and affecting 3rd party and Microsoft Add-ins (Teams and Sharepoint Add-ins).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting in Microsoft Community. As I understand a symbol is inserted while you start to compose an email in Outlook. This issue usually occurs if the paragraph symbol is enabled in the email window. Let me help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the below step and check if it helps.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open the new mail window.</span></li><li><span>Click on Format Text tab.</span></li><li><span>Under Paragraph, you will see the Symbol highlighted, click on it to disable it.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and reopen a new mail window and check if the issue occurs.</span></li></ul>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>I hope the above steps helps. If you need any further assistance reply and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            IE Will not load Office 365 Sharepoint and Skydrive pages</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am starting to lose it as I am unable to load up the first page of the Office 365 SharePoint (sites) and the Skydrive home page. IE does show the page, but then starts to hang not letting you click on any buttons on the page. IE will then come back with
 an error at the bottom "A Problem with this webpage caused Internet Explorer to close and reopen the tab" You are still unable to work with the page and with the Skydrive home page it does not show any of your folders in skydrive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to load the pages via other web browsers, Firefox and Chrome. I get the error the Webpage has Crashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So...... The pages do load on other computers, I am at a lose to try and work out what it is that is stopping them loading fully on this computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lower Java versions. Then back to the latest Java version. </p>
<p>Clear out history and cookies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All no good. </p>

            My Apple Mail went down on the 15th at 1:30pm with the 150 error. I can send but not receive. Called Apple, they just argued with me. They make changes from time to time and don't tell anyone. I hope this is only temporary. I have had my Mac.com addresses
 for 20 years and the Mac Mail app is junk. Not only Entourage, but Outlook 2011 and Thunderbird won't work. But the cheapy app on my $39 tablet works. Go figure.

            <p>Same issue here and also since (around) 16 March 2017 ... I suspect after MS updates of "other MS" stuff were installed from auto update. &nbsp;Entourage still works perfectly for all the other email accounts I have that are NOT &nbsp;Apple (such as gmail and a couple
 of private listings). &nbsp;I have not been able to set up any new Apple email accounts with Entourage either ... they just time out (time out was always a problem in last 2-3 years, especially when uploading are emails from sent folder). &nbsp;I do have MS Office 365
 and therefore an OutLook app and there are no issues with this app running my Apple account. &nbsp;I have copied all the same settings over to Entourage but Entourage still won't cooperate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this problem is unique to Entourage and Apple's email ... the problem I would suspect is with the party that wants Apple email users to switch to another service. &nbsp;As Apple don't charge for their email client software one can only suspect MS. &nbsp;If such
 is the case ... then I can only say that this habitual client bullying tactic that they always use (stop supporting software so that it becomes so problematic that CUSTOMERS are forced to purchase new versions) to recharge their whole customer base and reap
 the financial rewards for and is nothing more than financial **** of their customers. &nbsp;This is predatory behaviour and customers like us are being bullied into submission. &nbsp;Even when I don't mind paying &nbsp;for new software (which I have) and then I find it has
 flaws and issues still with OSX and that the most recent OutLook fails in comparison to ease of use of Entourage ... I still can't get my Entourage to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put it to you that MS is legally and deliberately derelict of duty, uncommitted to its total client base, and is holding older software clients to ransom ... which in my personal opinion is comparable to the operational procedures in organised crime of
 targeting a client, enticing the client, addicting the client and then trying to charge them again for an alternate product to replace the original product which has been deliberately left to spoil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't have Entourage &nbsp;... and even though my OutLook does work, then I will go back to Apple Mail, but really MS ... shame on you !</p>

            <p>Hate to burst your train of angst. But it's not all MS, it's mostly Apple that is causing the problem. I have been using the latest version of Entourage for a very long time and no problems, after the POP dump. At 1:30pm MDT on the 15th, as I am seeing others
 post relative times to their stoppage, it stopped working as did my install of Outlook 2011. It worked just fine all morning. Although, Thunderbird works. It looks as though Apple changed security processes that MS mail clients are not set up to deal with.
 I have tried to emulate the setup that I get with Thunderbird that amazing goes automatically and can't due to the lack of options in the outdated software. And if I remember correctly, MS pulled back on their Mac division years ago. There was word that they
 brought it back a bit. But that was to really screw up Office for the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The errors that I get are all associated with server malfunctions or communication errors. I got a 158 also. That's not a software problem. Unless the software is too old to accommodate newer tech. Maybe in a couple of days it'll go away. Fingers Crossed.
 The call I had with a Senior Apple Tech was so severely nonproductive that it could be rated as a negative number. This same thing happened when Apple dropped POP and went solely IMAP. But the outdated MS apps were able to accommodate the change. We'll see.</p>

            The strange this is that I can still send using the Apple Mail SMTP settings in Entourage. Curious that security for incoming is more intense than sending. I guess that they don't care if you send a ton of SPAM, they just don't want you getting it. I don't
 think they get it. Well on a corporate isolationist level, they do get it. That's why we're here talking about this.

            <p>There are many reasons why I prefer the superior interface of Entourage 2008 over and above all the more modern email clients, but that is another subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get back to the original questioner, I too have had this problem since the 15th/16th. All was working fine till then. Nothing in my set up changed so I assume Apple has changed its server arrangements for allowing us to access our own emails. If only
 they would publish what the new settings should be. As it is, like other writers, Entourage 2008 works absolutely fine both for sending and receiving, with both my other email providers (gmail, outlook.com), so there is only Apple to blame for any difference
 in the outgoing server arrangements since last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I went through Apple Care to the second tier help service, but they denied that anything had changed at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made a work-around but it is just so frustrating to have to incur the extra steps. If you, like me, really prefer Entourage, here's what you can do without needing to change your email addresses - especially important if you have all the other Apple
 equipment such as tablets, watches etc and need to hang on to your Apple email address.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I go to my emails directly in iCloud and set the preferences to send a copy of all incoming mail to gmail.</li><li>In Gmail, I set my account sending options so that it shows my mac.com address when sending emails.</li><li>I make a new account in Entourage to receive emails from Google (i.e. a gmail Inbox). &nbsp;Then I set Entourage 2008 to fetch mails from gmail.
</li><li>Once they arrive via gmail into my Entourage Inbox, I then deal with them as usual. Just need to bear in mind that any folders you create will actually sit on Google's servers, not Apple's. There may be a way you can keep the folders you already had before
 this crass change to Apple's servers, but I haven't got that far in my experimentation yet.</li></ul>
<p>In that setup, you are barely aware of any difference between Entourage connecting to mac.com, and Entourage connecting to Gmail. Indeed, having set Gmail up to show my address as mac.com, my receivers have no idea that gmail has done all the work. They
 see my mac.com address as the sender, reply accordingly, the mails go to mac.com from where they are automatically forwarded to gmail, then I receive them via my Entourage. It probably costs a few extra micro-seconds of time for this pathway, but the result
 is that I get to keep the user interface and functionality of Entourage while Google is actually doing most of the work, and I get to keep my old mac.com address, and do not lose the access from my iPad etc.</p>

            <p>I am attached to Entourage 2008 for the same reason that it is the last feature rich client on the market. And I have been setting everyone I know up in Thunderbird. If only Mozilla were smart enough to make a "transition tool" that would move 20 years of
 mail, contacts, notes, calendars and what not into it, I'd move in a heartbeat! I was praying that Outlook 2011, from all the hype was going to be incredible. Yup, incredible crap. They took everything that MS users have ever complained about and put it in
 Office/Outlook 2011 for the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But they will not be publishing any new settings. If they do it'll only be out of pressure and they'd have to revert security. So I rather doubt it. Because the old ones are fine with clients that can handle the new security changes being that of security
 protocol being SSL/TTL, which Entourage and Outlook (as I have seen) can't do. SSL only. That's why the server errors and not software. Even though it's both. Your software can no longer talk to their servers "securely". Another covert, but planned, change
 brought to you by Apple. Although you/I can still send. So there is no fix. Like there was last time when they went 100% IMAP after years of people screaming for it when we all were told POP only, then having gotten all settled with POP, they go IMAP so they
 can retain your mail and data mine it. For that first one, I set up an IMAP account in Entourage, made rules to fully DL the eMails, erase their servers, then move them into my POP inbox. It was if it was the old days. Now I just went into the iCloud prefs
 and set it to forward to my main address and they, alias' included, come in under their original account, can reply to them without issue and send back out through my Mac account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND I finally did a real assay of all the mail, 400-500 a day, that I was getting and canceled a lot. When asked why I was cancelling, I told what Apple had done. Got some replies back asking what? I told them to talk to Apple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, until . . . </p>

            <p>FarmerBob / Maythahla</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feed back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been through the mill and back on this effort to "retain the primary use of Entourage" as my email client. Here are the problems I have discovered in trying to fix things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Objective: &nbsp;To continue to receive all my .mac emails in Entourage and to reply to them from Entourage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems:</p>
<p>1. When this issue first happened I tried to reset the settings in Entourage not knowing that it was a server security problem as explained by FarmerBob. &nbsp;Changing .mac to .me to .icloud were options I played with but obviously to no avail. &nbsp;The only thing
 achieved was the deletion from Entourage of all my past emails !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately before this event I had archived all email prior to 2015. &nbsp;So the data lost was everything from 2016 to present. &nbsp;I was able to recover this by using TimeMachine to restore Entourage to a state some days before the problem started. &nbsp;Of course
 this also shifted all of my "many many" other email accounts bad in time but fortunately as they are IMAP they were easily replenished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. OutLook2016 (Office 365 OutLook) does work with iCloud but is in not as savvy as Entourage ... and painfully slow (I'm using a 2009 MacPro fully loaded). &nbsp;But I still prefer Entourage ... especially as my address book of XXX years worth is key to my needs.
 &nbsp;OL2016 cannot import directly from Entourage. &nbsp;I had a copy of OL2011 so installed that and imported everything from Entourage to OL2011 and intended then to use OL2016 to import from OL2011. &nbsp;This did &nbsp;work but the address book did not copy over. &nbsp;Multiple
 attempts to export the OT2011 address book to be available for import as standalone import to OT2016 failed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Then Mac OS MDworker kept crashing and reporting kernel panics and stuff due to OL2011. I had to uninstall OL2011 and rebuild Spotlight to fix the MDWorker problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Desperate for Entourage I created a new gmail address for my business, and set up an automatic forwarding of all messages from iCloud to this new gmail address. &nbsp;It is an "OK" solution ... not every email seems to make it over ... for example YOUR REPLYs
 tin this thread did not. &nbsp;I also set up an auto reply to all emails received advising the send er that their emil has been received and relayed to the new email address ... while the .mac email is good, it's best to wean people off &nbsp;of it so I become less
 dependent in the long term for what other iCloud issues may transpire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. &nbsp;Even before this problem with Apple server security, for the past three or so years there have been issues between Entourage and iCloud ... and most commonly time outs resulting in sent messages being saved on the computer and not on the server ... which
 does not help when depending on Entourage as a data base and historical record system. &nbsp;Having to manually attempt ... multiple times to get this messages onto the server was becoming a royal pain in the butt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. &nbsp;Yes, iCloud message can still be sent now in Entourage but noticeably the above mentioned time to preventing the mail being saved to the sever seems more apparent. &nbsp;This negates the reliability (great idea btw) of having the send settings in the new
 gmail account send as .mac (with .mac settings). &nbsp;Splitting servers ... shudder the thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. &nbsp;If there was a way using Entourage to set up the sending of emails from gmail to make it look like the mail was sent from .mac then that would be great but I can't find a way to do that ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Gmail settings online have an option to get emails from another email address. &nbsp;It says ideal for people starting a new email address with gmail and eating to carry over past emails from a past account. &nbsp;Sounds great but it does not work with iCloud ...
 error message states iCloud was waiting for an OK prompt after gmail tried to access and as there was no OK prompt if failed to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically I'm on Entourage with a new gmail address and I can't get gmail and iCloud to hold hands. &nbsp;What I want is for all my past iCloud in/out communications and attachments to transition into my new gmail account data base. &nbsp;Using both Entourage "move
 to" instruction works with single emails but crashes with bulk emails. &nbsp;OT2016 "move to" function is awkward ... instead of showing you what other INBOX or SENTBOX exist it asks you to type the box name ... but then cannot find it. &nbsp;Drag and drop on Entourage
 failed ... crashes, too big for Entourage to handle. &nbsp;But alas drag and drop from iCloud inbox to gmail inbox &nbsp;in OL2016 does work and same for sent mail boxes ... note: after selecting all emails I've it a minute or so before trying to drag otherwise it will
 not have enough time to accumulate the select all and won't respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having done this in OL2016 ... still on going and so far for the past 24 hours ... the email client has copied (not deleted after copy) all the iCloud emails over to the gmail folders and then set about uploading all the dragged emails to the sever to update
 the gmail server with the newly copied data. &nbsp;As I said this is ongoing ... as you know, once uploaded to the server, the server then as well checks with the email client to keep that up to date in true IMAP fashion. &nbsp;In my case that is sound 25,000 Inbox
 emails with attachments and about 11,000 sent box emails with attachments ... on a slow average 2mb bandwidth. &nbsp;There is a constant uploading, updating server going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separately, with Entourage, the new gmail account started to download the emails in the respective In/Sent boxes. &nbsp;I probably should have let the OL2016 process finish first but I was impatient and started Entourage after about 12 hours ... it seems to have
 worked (is working) just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So apart from not being able to send from gmail pretending to be iCloud ... I do have all my past emails now (on e way to being) in one email account. &nbsp;The old .mac in and sent boxes are intact up until recently and can still be searched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Remember to "backup" incase things go south so you can always import and replace main data base in entourage later.</p>
<p>- Remember to keep an alternative iCloud client running just incase one or two of the emails were not relayed by iCloud to Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows how to make Gmail send mail using an iCloud source signature and retaining that sent mail in the sent box of the Entourage &nbsp;gmail account then please let me know how ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feed back.</p>

            Aliases are multiple addresses that deliver to the same mailbox.&nbsp; If you add an alias to a Hotmail mailbox, it will deliver to Inbox unless you also create a rule that will move it to a separate folder.&nbsp; This separate folder cannot also be named "Inbox".&nbsp;
 When you add an alias, you shold be asked if you want messages sent to that address to be moved to a separate folder.&nbsp; Take that option and call the folder what you want.&nbsp; Otherwise, create rules by clicking the Options gear, selecting "More mail settings",
 then "Rules for sorting new messages".&nbsp; You can set up the same type of filtering there.

            Yes, it can have its own Inbox, but you can't call it "Inbox", you'll have to use a different name for the folder. You create a rule that moves all incoming messages sent to the alias to that new folder. CLick the Options gear, then :Manage rules". Create
 a rule that says "Recipient contains &lt;your alias&gt; then move to &lt;new folder&gt;"

            Hello Thomas.Templin 
<br />
<br />My recommendation is to follow the steps described below to perform a  repair of Office since these errors are solved once the repair is finished.
<br />
<br />Repair an Office application
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Office does not work correctly, try the online repair process, this will solve the problem. Finally, as the installation of Office has been repaired correctly, you will be asked to reboot the system to apply the changes&gt; click on the Yes option
<br />
<br />After rebooting the system, start the newest Office 2016 and you will see that the problem is now resolved.
<br />
<br />If there's anything else that I can help you with, please do not hesitate to reply here and we will further assist you. We'd love to hear from you again.

<p>This is an odd one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2016 Version 1803 (Build 9126.2210), using either Save As and selecting PDF or printing to the Microsoft PDF driver, the little lines you asked about do appear when I view the PDF at 100% or 200% zoom. But they disappear when I increase the zoom
 to 400% or anything greater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the same version of Word, if I print the same document to the Snagit editor and save as PDF from there, the little lines aren't present at any zoom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an Insider release of Word, Version&nbsp; 1806 (Build 10228.20021). When I save the same document in that version or print it to the PDF driver, there are no little lines at any zoom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have the latest build that's available to you, then I doubt that doing a repair or a reinstallation will change anything. Probably the lines will go away when you get the next Office update. Meanwhile, I recommend
<a href="https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Snagit</a>, not just for this issue but for its superior graphics editing and screen capture.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your detailed info, Jay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded trial versions of&nbsp;both&nbsp;Snagit and Acrobat Pro DC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use Snagit because I have links and bookmarks (e.g., table of contents, chapter headings) in the document that aren't available when using Snagit. True, when using Snagit the lines do disappear, but, in addition to the loss of linked content issue,
 the resolution of the entire document is far poorer.</p>

</p><p>The little&nbsp;lines also appear when Saving as Adobe PDF or Creating PDF&nbsp;using Acrobat Pro DC (at high quality print).&nbsp;When I printed to PDF&nbsp;with an earlier version of&nbsp;Acrobat (Acrobat 8 Professional),&nbsp;the lines do not appear, but this old version doesn't recognize
 the bookmarks and links from Word anymore, even though this feature is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Acrobat Pro DC version is actually worse&nbsp;than the Save As PDF from Word, in that some horizontal lines disappear when viewing the entire page on the screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ceafc7b-c786-470a-99d4-7bd34c7b96cb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ceafc7b-c786-470a-99d4-7bd34c7b96cb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It also depends on which monitor you view the document on and at what magnification, as you pointed out. It appears there's some aliasing or so going on. When printing&nbsp;any of the tables on paper, there are no little lines (or missing lines).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked my Word version. It's actually Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus Version 1708 (Build 8431.2250 Click-to-Run) Semi-annual Channel. I tried to update, but the updater claimed I have the latest version of Office installed. Is there any way to get
 Version 1806 (Build 10228.20021) you mentioned? That seems the most straightforward way to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            The only way to get Version 1806 at this time is to enroll in the Office Insider program. The signup is at&nbsp;<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-insider?tab=Windows-Desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/office-insider?tab=Windows-Desktop</a>.
 As that page makes clear, you get early access to new features and a channel for giving feedback to Microsoft, but it isn't entirely without risk. Occasionally the early features have glitches or don't yet play nicely with other software. That said, I've been
 in the Insider program for several years and have had less trouble than many of the ordinary users who post here.

            Hi Denise,<br />
<br />
Sorry for my misunderstanding. <br />
<br />
If we access the files in a folder of a document library which shows in the home page of the site collection, we can't get the file path in the library title section. The library is added in the home page as a Document Library Web Part and it is not feasible
 to show the path. <br />
<br />
As a workaround, we can see the file path via clicking on the library title “Documents” in the home page to access the library. We can also click the Documents button in the left menu. Then, we open the folder, we will see the path as below:
<br />

<h2>            Share link to specific page in OneNote</h2>
                    I have a shared OneNote notebook. When someone visits the share link, they go to the first page of the first section. Is it possible to create a link to a different page in the notebook, so this is the first page that is displayed?

            <p>Mohan's answer isn't entirely correct. Although the link created via the Share dialog takes recipients to the first page of the first section of a notebook, you can also give users a link to specific page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To generate a link to a page in <strong>OneNote Online</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the page tab in the Navigation Pane to which you want to generate a link.</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Copy Link to this Page</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c10db41b-655c-4a15-ab37-a3e99ad424b9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In the <strong>Copy Link </strong>dialog that appears, press <strong>CTRL-C</strong> or right-click the link and select
<strong>Copy </strong>to place the link to the clipboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link will take anyone who has permission to view or edit the notebook directly to the chosen page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting! I hope this answers your question. </p>

            <p>This is possible, but the document has to be shared using the Public option first. So if you click
<strong>Share</strong> , then click <strong>Get A Link</strong> and select the <strong>
Public Option</strong>, then&nbsp;links to&nbsp;specific pages created using the method above&nbsp;will work for anyone who receives them (though your notebook will also be open publically to everyone).</p>

            Hi Peter, everything I have seen on this error has users deleting their partnership, soft reset the device then connect and establish a new partnership.&nbsp; I might suggest giving that a try.<br />
<br />
I have a question ... are you using Exchange?&nbsp; If you are, this problem is caused when anyone executes Get-ActiveSyncDeviceStatistics cmdlet from a server or workstation that is not running Exchange 2007 SP1 management tools, this bug should be resolved in
 Exchange 2007 SP1. Therefore please update to Exchange 2007 Service Pack 1 and install the latest hotfix.<br />
<br />
I ask that based on <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/conversation.aspx?messageid=32724956&amp;threadid=32699457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this post</a> I found in a different forum as I was trying to find a solution for you.

<h2>            Data Validation issues with &#37; format - Excel 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I'm running into a really annoying issue with using data validation on cells formatted as percents.&nbsp; I haven't found a way to report it to Microsoft, so someone on another thread suggested posting it here with a link to an example workbook.</p>
<p>In short, if you format a cell as a percent and then type in an integer, Excel is smart enough to know you meant a percent (enter 10 and it displays 10%; you don't have to type in the % sign).&nbsp; However, this seems to fall apart if the cell is subject to
 data validation constraints, once the data validation has thrown an error.&nbsp; All of a sudden, once the error is thrown and you "Retry", you've unknowingly deleted the % sign and Excel forgets that when you enter an integer you really wanted a percent like before.&nbsp;
 And it throws a continuous loop of error every time you retry unless you either cancel out or realize what's going on and manually&nbsp;type in&nbsp;a % sign after your integer before you press enter.&nbsp; This is highly annoying and confusing to many of the less-experienced
 Excel users (who happen to be my boss or boss's boss) and who sometimes pilot my spreadsheets.</p>
<p>I have uploaded a very simple Excel spreadsheet example at the link below (no viruses, etc.&nbsp; I promise).&nbsp; If you just read the sheet&nbsp;from the top down, it should hopefully be self explanatory.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=orl4u1o8ux9vm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=orl4u1o8ux9vm</a></p>
<p>I'd love to know why this is acting like it is and what can be done about it if anything.&nbsp; I'm sure there are ways around it, but it doesn't seem right that a very basic tool blows up like that and especially for what seems like a very common use case.&nbsp;
 Can anyone help me understand if there's a reason for this or something I'm missing?&nbsp; Or if there is a better way to do this?&nbsp; Or how to get this to someone at Microsoft to fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>That is how it works.&nbsp; Say A1 is formatted as Percent and the Data Validation rule is:</p>
<p>FormulaIs &gt; <strong>=A1&lt;1</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>if you enter .4 you get 40% </li><li>if you enter 40 you get 40% </li><li>if you enter 40% you get 40% </li><li>if you enter 120, Validation gets tripped </li><li>at this point, entering 40 is no longer allowed, you must enter either .4 or 40%</li></ol>
<p>The reason is simple.&nbsp; Once Validation has been tripped, it examines your typed retry BEFORE the regular Excel UI converts 40 to 40%</p>

<p><span>I am so much disappointed by Microsoft Lumia 950 Product, It is a lemon product. I have been using MS Phone&nbsp;since 2008 and always thought this time they&nbsp;might do&nbsp;a better
 job.&nbsp;I cannot have or find any decent apps that will work with this phone. I wasted my money...&nbsp;Just wanted to print a simple document from my phone.</span></p>

            <p>Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers as feedback channel. Why ever. Therefore, your comments drown within the Internet swarm. Microsoft wants you to use the app Windows Feedback which is included since Windows 10 Mobile. Currently, if you want to
 print, you have to:</p>
<p>A) go for a Wi-Fi or Ethernet printer supported by Microsoft, see list</p>
<p>B) go for an app created by the manufacturer of your printer, see Store</p>
<p>C) go for printing via E-mail, like Hewlett-Packard is offering, or</p>
<p>D) print as PDF and send that to your computer, to print from there.</p>

            Since i have a Canon printer you can see there are very few that print on the Lumia phone.&nbsp; This is too bad.&nbsp; Its a by product of not having a good menu of apps.&nbsp; Oh well. Thanks all for your input.

            <p>This is because these are the only Canon printers that work with the phone.&nbsp; There are fourteen Canon printers that are on the list. All are probably relatively newer model printers.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with apps.</p>
