    <title>ATT Tilt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aspromalee  say:</h3>
<h2>            ATT Tilt</h2>
                    Over the weekend I upgraded to WM6.1 on my AT&amp;T tilt and began the process of reloading my program files back onto my phone.&nbsp; Now half of my games won't work, and at least four programs that I had no problems with when I used 6.0 keep shutting down whenever
 mI try to use them.&nbsp; I'm told by HTC that I cannot go back down to 6.0; so why whould I be having so many problems?&nbsp; Is there a fix or plug-in anyone has had to use for a similar problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Potentially there was an issue when it was reflashed but my guess is that hard resetting and starting fresh will cure that ill if all else is working.&nbsp; Might have been a bad install of one program causing issues with the rest of the installs.<br />
<br />
If you hard reset, reinstall new programs one at a time checking carefully that each work before the next install.

            apparently it had something to do with netcf for the most part.&nbsp; But there are still a few programs that keep reporting "errors" that I can't figure out, but they work for a time.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<p>There is no automatic method, nor has there been in the past. You could run a replace for the words you want redacted, perhaps replacing with xxxxxxxxxx. You would want to do this on a copy of your document.</p>

    <title>Emails stuck in draft - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emails stuck in draft</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of yesterday my sent emails seem to be getting stuck in the drafts folder. If they do actually send it takes several hours for them to go through. I also can't delete the drafts once they are in the drafts folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using hotmail and this happens on two computers, my phone and with both safari and chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as I have been trying to work this out for two days straight now and I can't seem to find a solution on any of the other forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>I too have this exact same problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>I will answer your specific questions to keep the thread going since my situation is probably identical to the original author of this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I access my Hotmail account by going to www.outlook.com, where it has me sign in to my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has changed here; same thing I’ve been doing for a long time.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I appear to have the “upgraded” version of Outlook (following the migration from Hotmail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has become very nearly impossible to send an email, either composed as a new message by me or to reply or forward a message from somebody else.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the message window, when I’m ready to send, I hit send and the message window closes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The message then becomes visible in my drafts folder, where I cannot delete it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It does NOT show in my Sent Items.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I re-open the draft and then try to send again, it eventually comes back with “You don't have permission to perform this action.” and the still-undeleteable draft is in my Drafts folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is no discernible indicator that the message did, in fact, go out.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is not an issue of having been logged out due to user inactivity, as the problem occurs no matter how long it has been since I interacted with my account, even only a second or two.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, the message will go out hours and hours after multiple attempts to send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started happening to me a few days ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>It happens on every desktop I use, all running Win 7 Pro or Win 7 Home Premium.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It happens in every browser I try (IE, Chrome, Firefox).<span>&nbsp; </span>I am a fanatic about keeping all my machines fully updated (windows and programs) and I religiously run Norton Security.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This problem happens on my US Govt workplace machine too, which is Win 7 Pro in a classified environment (so its locked down with a draconian firewall, hence my confirmation of the problem by using my home machines which aren’t quite so comparable to
 Fort Knox).<span>&nbsp; </span>I managed to get it to actually send a message today by logging into outlook.com in the browser on my Android phone, but that was a rare success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I build desktops from parts, install/configure/maintain Windows, have two degrees in computer science, etc. ... and can’t figure this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens when sending to to any and all addresses or domains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made NO configuration changes lately, other than stuff routinely offered in Microsoft Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon log in, it says “Outlook Mail” in the upper left.</p>

<p>hi, i've got so many worthless notification for this thread, that i obviously missed the right one. sorry!</p>
<p>in the meantime, i was contacted by ms support, and i've got similar explanation. but in our case it is confusing and doesn't fit.</p>
<p>we have 5 e3 users, 1 essentials and 2 kiosk - but as you can see on picture we have 21 gb &nbsp;- so on intial 10gb we got 11 gb - what is the math?</p>
<p>i was most freaked out for this storage limit story - i don't understand why i have storage &nbsp;that i cannot use - why &nbsp;i just don't have tenant size as limit?</p>
<p>what is the benefit of having 1024 gb storage limit, when it cannot be used?</p>
<p>anyway i was exceeding the size &nbsp;for more then 2gb, but my site didn't become readonly as the warning says.</p>
<p>if you can please give some clarification on this contradict issue.</p>
<p>many thanks!</p>
<p>meshy</p>

<p>hi meshy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the storage base per tenant:</p>
<p>10 gb + 0.5 gb per subscribed user + additional storage purchased.</p>
<p>note: licensed kiosk workers do not add to the tenant storage base.</p>
<p>for the details, please refer to <a href="https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-us/article/sharepoint-online-and-onedrive-for-business-software-boundaries-and-limits-8f34ff47-b749-408b-abc0-b605e1f6d498?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us#__toc351043094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for the 1024gb storage limit about your site collection, it is just a threshold value for the site collection storage&nbsp;and it is not the real storage&nbsp;of the site collection. we can customize it (from 1gb to 1024 gb)to help us manage
 the site storage usage. as shown in the screenshot below, i set the storage limit as 1gb, when the site collection's storage reaches 80% of the 1gb storage limit, the site collection admin will receive a notification about the site storage usage.</p>

<b>storage quota </b>button on the top menu bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>moreover, your current tenant storage is 21gb and no storage is available, so you get "the out of space" email. you may try

<p>The 21GB is your current tenant storage. For the additional storage, it was assigned to you when you purchased the Office 365 subscriptions.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>No, it’s not a virus or malware related issue, it’s a bug in Version 1709 – but we recently learned that the issue only affects the old Windows Defender interface (MSASCui.exe), so the obvious workaround is to start using its replacement – the new
<strong>Windows Defender Security Center</strong> app. We still have a few minor glitches in the new Windows Defender app, but the equivalent History functions all seem to be working as expected. The answer in this thread will help get you started with the
 new interface <span>&nbsp;</span>– and also provide you with a link for up-voting the bug report that I posted at the
<strong>Feedback Hub</strong> yesterday for the old interface (courtesy Community Moderator

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In fact, the issue is really limited to people who are still using their old taskbar shortcuts for MSASCui.exe, and who might not have noticed that the Start menu and icon shortcuts for that interface have now been replaced by shortcuts for the new
 Windows Defender Security Center app. Even when you search for “Windows Defender” you’ll now get a shortcut to the new interface. So all of Windows 10’s internal links to the old Windows Defender interface have now been replaced.</span></p>

<h2>            N900 NO IMEI AND RED LINE ON THE SIM CARD.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I do really have serious problem, I have nokia n900 which is U.S.A. I was trying to update through flasher, then the phone doesn't complete booting I mean just stuck on booting. I did try another version, and also doesn't work.&nbsp;The phone &nbsp;only accept
 one or tow version which is a Global RX-51_2009SE_2.2009.51-1_PR_COMBINED_MR0_ARM&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Middle East version&nbsp; RX-51_2009SE_1.2009.42-11.003_PR_COMBINED_003_ARM.</p>
<p>Just accepting the old version. When I update to latest version, it just stuck for more than 4 hours on the 5 dots or booting. I did read almost or all the posts talking about this problem and no one worked with me. I did flash it with EMMC first then OS&nbsp;
 but also nothing happened. And when I flash with the old global, the phone boot up and work fine but when I check the IMEI there is nothing show up. And there is red line on the top on the sim card. I tried many SIM card. But nothing work.</p>
<p>I hope I can find solution.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<p>The phone out of warranty.</p>

            firstly make sure you have the latest flasher, os and emmc, rename them to 'OS' and 'EMMC' and make sure they're saved in the correct place as instructed on the guide. then use this guide that i got fron cpitchford.<br />
<br />
start a cmd window<br />
type these two commands:<br />
<br />
cd \program files\maemo\flasher-3.5<br />
start .<br />
<br />
Now an explorer window will pop up<br />
drag the os.bin and emmc.bin files into that explorer window..<br />
<br />
Now, back to the cmd window.. turn off phone, and unplug<br />
<br />
run<br />
<br />
flasher-3.5 -F os.bin -f<br />
<br />
press and hold U<br />
plug phone into computer.. keep U pressed<br />
<br />
flasher should wake up and start flashing.. if it finishes correctly (command completed sucessfully), WITHOUT touching your phone or the cable, run:<br />
<br />
flasher-3.5 -F emmc.bin -f -R<br />
<br />
it'll start doing stuff straight away and then hopefully when flasher completes sucessfully the phone should restart..<br />
<br />
unplug the phone (and maybe turn it on) and you're done

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will prevent your phone working.. NEVER downgrade.. It is not supported and hardware (in particular the phone hardware) will stop working.. as you've noticed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you MUST install this file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.19-1.002_PR_COMBINED_002_ARM.bin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.19-1.002_PR_COMBINED_002_ARM.bin</a></p>

<p><a href="http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.13-2.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.13-2.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Open this link:</p>
<p>&nbsp; <a href="http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter your IMEI number and accept the terms and conditions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Open this link</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.19-1.002_PR_COMBINED_002_ARM.bin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.19-1.002_PR_COMBINED_002_ARM.bin</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save the file. Once the file has been downloaded, rename it to "os"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Open this link</p>
<p><a href="http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.13-2.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php?f=RX-51_2009SE_10.2010.13-2.VANILLA_PR_EMMC_MR0_ARM.bin</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save the file. once the file has been downloaded rename it to emmc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) start a cmd window</p>
<p>press start, then run then enter cmd and press enter..</p>
<p>A black cmd window will pop up. Enter these two commands EXACTLY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>cd %ProgramFiles%\maemo\flasher-3.5</font></p>
<p><font>start .</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another window will pop up..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drag the two files you downloaded in step 2 and 3 INTO this window, then close it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Flash the phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disconnect the phone from the computer and turn it off</p>
<p>In the black cmd window run:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>flasher-3.5 -F os.bin -f</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will pause saying "waiting for suitable device" or something like that</p>
<p>Press and hold down the U button on your phone's keyboard and plug it into your PC via the USB cable. Keep the U button pressed until the flasher program starts to do something</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait until flasher says "completed successfully"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't do anything to the phone, leave it connected</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) flash the emmc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now run this command in the cmd window:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>flasher-3.5 -F emmc.bin -f -R</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The flasher program should start flashing your handset.. When it has finished (and it says "completed successfully") unplug the phone and turn it on (or off then on) and you should be fine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank You (cpitchford).&nbsp;I tried as you said. I did flash it with latest version of U.S.A which is 10.2010.19-1.002. &nbsp;but the phone doesn't start up just keep booting almost 5 hours. Now the phone does accept any firmware no matter what &nbsp;<em><font color="#ff0000">EXCEPT
 THE LATESTS ONE</font></em>..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when i flash it with old one no matter what, the phone will power on but there is red line on the Sim card, then when i check the IMEI there is no number show up. Even on
<font color="#ff0000">About Product</font>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then i Notice that the WIFI Also doesn't work, it says No connection Available. Also i did check the Bluetooth but doesn't work. i turn it on and i save the setting and when i come back to check it says off. That what's up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope i can find solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i Downloaded All the firmware on the website. UK,USA,INDIA, MIDDLE EAST, GLOBAL, EMMC&nbsp; :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>thats because you cant flash backwards. theres a different core firmware that is applied when you flash the latest firmware, and it will only work with the latest firmware. there is a way to replace the core firmware with an older one, but its extremely
 messy...</p>

            ok...stop flashing old firmwares! it won't work and that is normal..<br />
<br />
if you flash the latest 10.2010 version, what happens? did you flash the emmc too? did both flasher commands complete successfully<br />
<br />
are you sure the os image you have is not corrupted?<br />
<br />
what does you phone do when it won't boot? what did you flash to make it like that?

    <title>Recover recently deleted MSN email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sangyl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recover recently deleted MSN email address</h2>
                    <p>Hi so about an hour ago I accidentally deleted my father's email account. While I thought I was entering my email address to replace my dad's email address from my xbox live account, I actually deleted his email address and replaced it with my address. Now
 he cannot receive any emails without the sender knowing of the email address. This account is 20+ years old and acknowledging every account or person to send him through a new email address would be impossible. The emails from the old account is accessible
 using my email address.</p>
<p>So my question is: Is it possible to retrace my steps and recover the deleted MSN email address? Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            File sending is disabled</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using skype for chatting. I used to be able to attach a file or paste an image, but now I am getting "File sending is disabled" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have come across a few responses regarding this error message for other members in the community, but it talks about going to the registry. However, there is no instruction what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found was:</p>
<p><span><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies does not have "skype" entry.</span></span></p>
<p>but,<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies does have "skype" entry.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>How do you alter the default date that appears below the title of each - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> admstr  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you alter the default date that appears below the title of each new note&#47;page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using OneNote for the first time on my iPad. &nbsp;I plan to also use it on my Android phone and my PC. &nbsp;I want to transfer some meeting notes from another competitor note app but I want the date to show when the meeting actually happened. &nbsp;Instead it defaults
 to today's date directly below the title of the page. &nbsp;I have the awfullest time trying to select that line. &nbsp;It usually takes me 5 minutes to get it selected (either using my finger or rubbed-ended stylus) and then allows me (sometimes) to cut it. &nbsp;I have
 to do this for both the date and the time. &nbsp;It won't let me change the date. &nbsp;For that, I have to create a new note area in the same location and manually type the correct date. &nbsp;Very frustrating!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to be able to create a note/page ahead of time for a meeting with "to discuss" topics. &nbsp;I want the date to reflect the meeting date, not the day I type up the discussion topics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there a way to sort your note pages within section tabs (within one specific notebook) by date order? &nbsp;It would be most beneficial to see the meetings in order they occurred. &nbsp;In fact is there a way to sort the list within section tabs at all, other
 than Edit, manually move to where you want?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these questions pertain to the iPad version. &nbsp;I haven't tested on my Android phone or PC yet.</p>

<p>To help deter spammers, Outlook.com limits the number of messages that can be sent in one day.
</p>
<p>If you receive a message that you've reached the daily message limit, try the following:

<ul>
<li>
<p>Save your email as a draft and send it the next day.</p>

<p>If the email was created on a mobile device, tap to close the message. You'll receive a prompt asking you if you want to save or delete the message. Select
<strong>Save</strong> and then <strong>Sync</strong>. You can then to go Outlook.com on a computer, open the draft, and send it.</p>
</li></ul>
<strong>You've added too many recipients to one email </strong>
<p>Outlook.com limits the number of recipients you can add to an email message. </p>

<p>Outlook.com blocks the sending of messages when the content looks like junk email to the Outlook.com junk filters.

<p>Hi Saeed,<br />
<br />
In SharePoint Online, data protection services are provided to prevent the loss of data. Backups are performed by Microsoft every 12 hours and retained for 14 days.<br />
<br />
As administrators, we can’t perform the above backup action. Instead, we can consider these features:

    <title>Excel 2013 additional instance functionality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonpowell52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 additional instance functionality</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my work laptop to Excel 2013 from Excel 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an instance of Excel 2013 is already running, Excel 2013 by default does not open a new instance of Excel upon request, unlike all previous Excel versions, to my knowledge.&nbsp; In order to obtain a new instance, it's necessary to hold Alt key down while
 opening Excel, and then answer a pop-up box question ( Are you sure you want a new instance ... ).&nbsp; Either that or create a command line argument to run excel specifying a new instance. This is more work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior is rather inconvenient for those of us who typically do want additional instances of Excel.&nbsp; I would guess there are MANY people who do want to create addtional instances without the hassle of alt keys, waiting and pop-up boxes.&nbsp; In my small
 department at work, there are at least two of us, multiply that by hundreds of thousands for other companies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be an Excel option that the user can set to determine this behavior.&nbsp; The behavior could default to no additional instance, but have a setting to allow additional instance creation similar to previous Excel versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See below excerpts of MS manager Chad Rothschiller's commentary on this functionality. It is not clear to me that the "confusion" the new behavior avoids ( who is confused ? ) merits the inconvenience rendered to power users.&nbsp; Does it make sense to sacrifice
 simplicity of use&nbsp;to simplicity of understanding? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this has already been addressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Excel 2013 helps prevent accidental extra instances (or processes) of Excel running. We’ve found that extra instance introduced unexpected and sometimes confusing results (for example, pasting a range from a workbook in one instance of Excel to
 a workbook in a different instance of Excel works differently than if the two workbooks were running in the same instance). In the new Excel, we have built new detection logic that knows when an additional, new instance of Excel is starting up (e.g., you clicked
 Excel on the start menu), and merges that workbook (and new Excel instance) into the instance of Excel that’s already running.&nbsp; In other words, you won’t very often see more than one Excel.exe in the Task Manager. Word has behaved this way for several releases
 now, and it is a much simpler model to understand.</p>
<p>However, we’ve built in a couple of ways for you to get a second (or third) instance of Excel running, if that’s really what you want. Most often, people want to do this when they know they have a huge workbook that takes a long time to open (or
 some other process that takes a long time to complete, such as a data refresh or a calculation), and they want to keep working in Excel while that long-running process finishes. One good way to accomplish this is to get two instances of Excel running: one
 you can use to kick off the long process, and the other you can use to keep working while you wait for the other process to finish."</p>
<span>"In Windows 8, one way to start an additional instance of Excel is to press and hold the ALT key, then, without releasing the ALT key, right-click the Excel icon in the Windows taskbar and click the Excel icon above the Unpin option."</span>
<span>"In Windows 8, one way to start an additional instance of Excel is to press and hold the ALT key, then, without releasing the ALT key, right-click the Excel icon in the Windows taskbar and click the Excel icon above the Unpin option."</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>"There’s also a switch for booting Excel from the command prompt: /x.&nbsp;In Windows 8, press the Windows key and X key at the same time and then select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Run</strong><span>."</span></p>

            <p>I don't know if it will help in your situation, but there is a means whereby a macro-enabled workbook can ensure that other workbooks will not intrude into its instance of Excel.&nbsp; Include this in its Workbook_Open:</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business Unsynced Changes</h2>
                    <p>I have a onedrive account provided through my school. It is working fine, but I automatically see extra folders:</p>
<p>- OneDrive for Business</p>
<p>- OneDrive for Business - Unsynced Changes</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what these folders are. I never created them, and they have no impact on my files whatsoever. There is another main folder which I did create, and which I do use, and I have never noticed any issues regarding the syncing of files that I keep
 there. But for whatever reason, these two other folders keep appearing even if I delete them. It looks like they contain far older versions of my main folder (which I can tell because they don't contain all the new sub-folders that I've added in recent months),
 but if I delete these extra folders, it appears to have no impact on my main folder. In other words, I can keep deleting them, and none of my main stuff will be lost,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, they are just two random folders that appear, and I can keep deleting them and they'll keep coming back, and it's just extra clutter. I'd prefer if they were just permanently gone. I can also stop deleting them and ignore them and nothing will
 happen, but they'll just be extra clutter in my onedrive forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering what these folders are, how they got here, and how I can permanently get rid of them.</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>soundsofscience</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>According to your description, it seems you may use the previous OneDrive for business sync client. Please refer to
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-version-of-OneDrive-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Which version of OneDrive am I using?</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When we run Repair for the
</span><span>the previous OneDrive for Business sync client, it will disconnect all libraries that were experiencing sync problems and then reconnect these libraries. This means
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Repair</span><span> downloads and syncs the current server version of each library, as if you were syncing for the first time.</span><span> Then it will c</span><span>reates
 an archive copy of any file that had unsynced changes and places these files in a library folder</span><span>.
</span><span>If </span><span>we</span><span> change where
</span><span>our</span><span> synced folders are stored, the archive folder may be called \OneDrive for Business -- Unsynced Changes\ when viewed in Explorer.
</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about what happens when we run Repair, you can refer to
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-sync-connections-in-OneDrive-for-Business-21aac895-9f32-4e3e-a75a-6f12824f0975?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Repair sync connections in OneDrive for Business</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Y</span><span>ou may need to manually copy the files which you want to sync to the library from the unsynced changes folder to the syncing folder after the syncing
 progress is completed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So to permanently get rid of the extra folder, I would suggest you delete it and then use the new OneDrive sync client. Please refer to this article:
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Improve-your-OneDrive-sync-experience-7af500d9-a18e-4abb-8450-b94f4e52c1a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Improve your OneDrive sync experience</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you already have the new OneDrive sync client and still have the extra sync folder displaying, please feel free to post back and share the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.The current version of OneDrive sync client you are using. (OneDrive Settings&gt;About)</p>
<p>2.A screenshot of the issue symptom in File Explorer.</p>
<p>3.What steps have you done before the extra folder showing in File Explorer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<h2>            Problems with updating windows 10 tehnical Preview Build 9926</h2>
                    <p>On my PC I have installed Windows 10 Tehnical Preview 9926 by the end of last year.Till now updates were instaling without any problem,and OS worked fine.</p>
<p>When I switched my PC on,a couple days ago,I recognise that the new update is coming. and the monitor stays grey/black &nbsp;all the time.</p>
<p>After some time the PC automatically turns off without new update.When I switched PC on again the situation repeated(It was updating some time and then switch off)The monitor is gray/black all the time without any picture or information that something is
 happening. And it repeats again and again,making practically my PC useless.I had read somewhere that some new updates asks for cca 10GB free space,but on that partition I have more than 20GB and all makes me confused.Please answer what can I do!!!!!!</p>

    <title>Microsoft Windows Phones - 950XL, 950, and the 1520 - All Nokia phones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidfazio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Windows Phones - 950XL, 950, and the 1520 - All Nokia phones</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I have been a long time ATT subscriber and happy with the service. The last several months, the service has not been good and ATT does not seem to
 be able to fix it. I have always had Nokia Phones and have always believed them to be the best. December of 2015, I purchased the Microsoft 950XL phone. I did so with great confidence because the phone was manufactured by Nokia, the very best. Along about
 March of 2016, I started to get lots of dropped calls. Calls going into voice mail because of no signal, etc. I have worked with ATT for almost 4 months now, and they cannot seem to resolve my issue. Nobody wants to pay for a service they cannot use or is
 very unreliable. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">So, we decided (my wife and I) to switch to the Verizon cell service. We went to the Verizon store and they told me that neither of our phones will
 work on the Verizon network. My wife has the Nokia 1520, which I also had until the camera no longer worked, so I purchased the 950xl. After all my 1520 was 2 years old. We purchased our phones outright, no monthly deal from ATT. When I purchased the 950 XL
 phone from Microsoft, they wanted to give me an ATT branded phone. I did not want an ATT branded phone since I thought I may wish to switch to Verizon at some point. By the way the 950 XL phone is a great phone.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Since ATT cannot fix the service related issue with my phone, I thought we would switch to the Verizon network. BTW, ATT tells me the issue might
 be with the phone, and since the phone is still in warranty, I should send it back to Microsoft for an exchange. I do not think the issue is with the phone as my wife is having a similar issue on her 1520.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">The Verizon store tech could not explain why the phones would not work on the Verizon network. He even tried a Verizon SIM card and they would not
 work. I called the Verizon Tech Support line and they gave me the following explanation which I cannot believe, so I am writing this long e-mail to you for
<strong>confirmation</strong> that they are speaking the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">They told me that because Verizon does not want to sell the Microsoft phone due to low demand, that Nokia has refused to certify the Nokia phones
 on the Verizon network. I cannot believe that I paid all this money on a new state of the art cell phone that will not work on one of the largest cell providers in our Country, and that nobody disclosed this information to me at the time of purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I have been a long time, loyal Microsoft and Nokia supporter. If what Verizon has told me to be true, Nokia is being extremely short sighted. It
 is this kind of corporate game playing, with no consideration for the customer and the market, that makes the case for Apple. If this issue cannot be resolved by Nokia and Verizon in the short term, I will be eating the cost of the Nokia phone, basically putting
 an $800 phone in the trash, and I will become a long time, loyal Apple customer.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">My neighbor, just last week, asked me to help her purchase a new cell phone. She had never had a cell phone before and as she is getting ready to
 retire, needed some help. She thought that the Android Phone was way too complicated for what she wanted in a phone and had similar thoughts about the Apple phone. I told her how happy we are with our Windows 10 phones. She purchased the Microsoft 950 phone
 because she liked the simplicity of the Windows 10 OS and the feel of the phone. This was all before I found out that the phones will not work on the Verizon network. Had I known this beforehand, I would have recommended that she get an Apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Just how dare you as a major corporation that spends lots of money each year with name branding, name recognition, and building a loyal following,
 limit the use of the service that can be used. &nbsp;Not only the service that can be used, but also one of the two major cell service providers in our Country. I would hope that someone at the top will do what needs to be done to do right by your customers. Please
 fix this issue. Verizon says that the issue lies with Nokia, not them. If this is true, Nokia is being stubborn at the cost of its customer base.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Microsoft should force Nokia to have the phones work on the Verizon network. Microsoft is limiting its market share by not getting this issue resolved.
 Remember the days that Microsoft was pushing hard for market share with Windows Mobile, the Pocket PC? I, as many other, invested heavy in this strategy, products, and applications for the Windows Mobile, call Pocket PC. Then, Microsoft just decided that it
 was not profitable for them, so they dropped it and moved on leaving all that supported and invested in the Pocket PC and the development of APPS for the Pocket PC.&nbsp; Now Microsoft wants back in to the mobile market, trying to convince end users and developers
 that they are here to stay this time. After screwing over the developers and the end users last time, it is no wonder why the great Windows phone is not all that popular. It is no wonder why developers are concerned about investing in the Windows 10 phone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Microsoft needs to work with Nokia and Verizon to
 get this issue for its current customers fixed. I used to be a Microsoft business partner. I am no longer. I was part of the "Insider" program to test&nbsp; Windows 10. I believed that Microsoft, like Apple, has finally taken control of its own destiny by making
 the hardware that will support their software. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I have filed a complaint with the FCC about Verizon and its business practices of limiting service. They have responded quickly with an e-mail explaining
 that Verizon has 30 days to get back to me with a resolution. I am not hopeful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">But&nbsp;the issue is for Microsoft to fix&nbsp;by pressuring Nokia to do the right thing. Microsoft is the one that will take the hit, not Nokia. So, here&nbsp;I
 am, a loyal Microsoft partner, user, supporter for many, many years and they are about to lose me. If this cannot be resolved in the short term, then I will throw the great 950xl phone away or sell it, and I will become a long time Apple customer, never to
 return to Microsoft again. Is this really what your objective is Microsoft?</span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;that excuse is just Verizon shifting the blame to Microsoft. Microsoft could care less about where you use your phone. But Verizon cares about which devices it allows in its network - if you have to buy another phone from Verizon, they profit from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: You can stop saying "Nokia" in your statements. Nokia is a separate company. Microsoft purchased Nokia's mobile phone division, not Nokia itself. There is no "working with Nokia" - Nokia has no business with Microsoft.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Just as a follow up, Verizon called today. There is no resolution because Nokia is not blocking Windows phones on the Verizon network. Verizon is
 purposely blocking Windows and Nokia phones on their network. As the corporate person from Verizon told me that this is an intentional business decision on Verizon’s part. They just do not want the Nokia or Microsoft phones on their network, and from their
 point of view they are not missing much market share by doing so. Their remedy is for me to purchase another new phone from Verizon, a none Windows phone, so that I can switch to the Verizon service.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I will not be doing this any time soon. I do not know how Verizon can get away with this since they are a communications service provider. At a minimum,
 Verizon and Microsoft should advertise or provide some kind of notification that the phones will not work on a Verizon network.

<p>Just had to jump in here!&nbsp; I am on Cricket, which is somehow a part of AT&amp;T and have had no issues in the Tampa Bay area!&nbsp; I have a Nokia 1520 but Microsoft will not support it&nbsp;for Outlook so I just bought a new Microsoft 950XL, hopefully I will like it
 as much as I like the 1520!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft and all the so called BIG companies do not really care about us or they would not do the things they do!&nbsp; Upgrading Windows 10 every few days is one thing, I have shut off the upgrades to my PC's!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been loyal to Microsoft for longer than most of the employees have been alive!&nbsp; I started with Windows when it would not even run because the hardware was not powerful enough!&nbsp; I actually started with DOS 1.0!&nbsp; In fact I still have a sealed copy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My business associate went to Apple for everything, he is no better off that those of us loyal to MS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS like all the rest are gathering info on all of us, note all the ads popping up everywhere you log in!&nbsp; Even if you try you cannot turn them off, EBay is so damn slow now because of this!</p>

<p>Hi Hans,</p>
<p>I have done some tests and research on my side and would like to share the results with you:</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to delete&nbsp;a message within a modern group conversation&nbsp;in both Outlook client and OWA as a group owner/administrator. Also, group members cannot achieve it either.</p>
<p>We can delete a modern group conversation entirely in OWA, but not in Outlook client. Group owners can delete any group conversations. Group members can only delete group conversations they started.</p>
<p>It will be great that your goal can be achieved, so I invite you to submit feedback to our related team via:

<h2>            Buying a new machine with no OS, can I install Win10 using my Win8 key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought two keys for Windows 8 Pro&nbsp;when they were on the reduced offer some while back. I installed on my 2 computers and have consequently upgraded both to Win 10 Pro. On my most used machine I'm on the fast ring insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this, I'm planning to buy or build&nbsp;a new machine in the summer, probably after the free upgrade to Win 10 has passed. I'd then de-commission my second machine, move my current main machine to the backup machine role and use the new one as
 my main box. My plan is to use my Win 8 Pro licence on my new build. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is can I use that Win 8 Pro licence from my decommissioned machine to install Windows 10 Pro on my new build, and then migrate&nbsp;that to the Insider Program, and then downgrade my current main machine - now to be my backup - to regular non insider
 status?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this all makes sense.</p>
<p>

<p>There is a known issue (to be fixed in next updates) that requires the phone to be connected to the Wifi when bigger than 20 megabytes.<br />
Basically you have to connect to a wireless network, and force reinstall. Not sure if this is what you did when you said "try to redownload the game".<br />
You have to tap and hold, and click on retry while connected. This should solve the problem.</p>

So start the Onenote app:<br />

            <p>Thanks for the information Bernd P.</p>
<p>However, as users, what we are asking for is that when we open the SkyDrive Android app and see a onenote file in our documents folder, we should be able to click on the icon and the OneNote app opens the file we've selected. &nbsp;This is standard functionality
 of many other 3rd party applications on Android.</p>
<p>Can you see about speaking with the developers of the SkyDrive Android app and ask them to add this functionality?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
