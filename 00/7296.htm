            Make sure your phone and apps are up-to-date. Now try a soft reset(vol. down + power for ~10 sec. until phone vibrates and restarts).

            <p>Hi Luca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have caused due to not meeting the system requirements of Windows 10 Technical Preview. I suggest you to refer to the following Microsoft Help article and check if it meets the system requirements to install Windows 10 technical Preview
 on your computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here in this scenario, you will have to enable the Data Execution Prevention feature from BIOS (Basic Input Output system) and check if it helps. To enable the Data Execution Prevention in BIOS you will have to contact the computer manufacturer as this may
 vary according to the computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.</p>

<h2>            Some Links in Microsoft Edge are yellow</h2>
                    The most obvious of this is Craigslist. I upgraded to Windows 10 and Edge came in suit. I have had this problem since install, however was told it was just a graphic driver incompatibility and to wait until the update came....well a few updates later and
 it's still not any different. Can't find it in settings anywhere. Only in Edge (Visually fine in Chrome) I have an MSI computer (only about&nbsp;4 months old) Any help would be great, because I'm not going to pay for help in this case, and if I would have known
 tech support was only covered for a month I would have not waited for the driver.

    <title>copy text from one document to another without headers and footers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            copy text from one document to another without headers and footers</h2>
                    <div>Hi everyone,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a document that contains both portrait and lanscape pages – I've used section breaks throughout to achieve this effect. I need to copy the contents of that document into a different template which (among other changes) has different headers and
 footers. I just want to get the raw text from the old document into the new and apply the new body text once it's pasted. To do this, I selected most of the document from the old template and copied it to the clipboard, then I chose "Paste and match formatting"
 when I inserted it into the new document. Everything came in correctly however the headers and footers now reflect the old template. I'm assuming this is because I included the section breaks when I copied it across.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way though to copy everything across (including the section breaks which dictate the page orientation) without copying across the header/footers from the old file?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any help.</div>
                </div>

            Sections also control the content of Headers and Footers and that is why this is occurring.
<div><br />
<div>So I believe your only option is to copy and paste by section. When doing this, do not copy the last paragraph mark in the section, this is where the section break is attached and it carries the header and footer information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your other option however is to Paste Special (Unformatted Text) and this will remove all formatting, including section break information and page orientation.&nbsp;</div>

            Thanks for the reply,
<div><br />
<div>Yeah I thought this would be the case. I really can't afford to paste as unformatted text as there is too much local formatting such as bold and italics that need to stay intact once brought into the new file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Pasting by section is quite time-consuming also as the document is close to 200 pages. I may have to consider just reformatting the headers and footers once the information is in the new file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is such a pain, I really wish Word had some workaround for this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again.</div>

            I did actually try copying the styles from the new template into the old but none of the text updated. For example, the old template had a style called List bullet and after copying the identically named style from the new template into the old, the text
 didn't update. The new template List bullet style was Arial 10p whereas the old was 11pt but didn't update to reflect the newly imported style.

    <title>Why is Microsoft killing good Symbian features&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Microsoft killing good Symbian features&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>No tethered USB internet, no bluetooth modem. On a desktop computer, it's free of cost to plug in a USB cable, and much cheaper to purchase a bluetooth dongle than a WiFi card!</p>
<p>I thought Windows was going to be better than Symbian.</p>
<p>Now I think Symbian was way better.</p>
<p>The quality of Windows Apps is in no way better than Symbian Apps, so why kill Symbian? Windows phone 8.1 lacks basic features that a Nokia phone should have. Heck you cannot even stop the music player, only pause it. And when paused, if you press the volume
 key (at least on my 925), it shows the name of the paused song in the change volume popup!</p>
<p>*No "profiles" feature that was so cool in symbian.</p>
<p>*No "Vibrate first, and then ring" option.</p>
<p>*The ringer doesn't have the option to speak the caller's name.</p>
<p>*No thethered internet via USB, no bluetooth dial-up modem.</p>
<p>*Screen rotation doesn't work universally. (screen won't rotate when you're on the start menu, it would only rotate in some apps, like messaging).</p>
<p>*Very little customization (no folders, no downloadable themes).</p>
<p>*Cannot set songs as ringtones directly (need to use a make ringtone app!)</p>
<p>*No call recorder out of the box, and could not find an app in the store that records calls in WP8.1).</p>
<p>*No flash lite in browser.</p>
<p>*Battery sucker. And the phone heats up while performing mundane tasks like clicking pictures. I have had Nokias for years. My Nokia 3230, 6681, N95, N73, N97, and E7 never heated up if I wasn't gaming on it!</p>
<p>Sad to see a brilliant brand with loyal (albeit few present) fans, being raped and murdered by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Advice: Keep designing Windows for computers. and keep the Windows 7 look and feel.</p>
<p>You'll probably never succeed in the mobile space (it's already too late for you) so quit trying.</p>
<p>And stop shoving mobile UIs on your desktop OS. I'm yet to see a single person who likes the "modern UI" concept on Windows 8/8.1</p>

            No mobile OS uses flash player anymore in their browser, that was gone years ago. And yes there are folders in latest update to Windows 8.1. I'm tired already.<br />

Anyway point is, everyone else has moved on so why can't you? We get these threads a lot. If you don't like windows phone, use android. If you don't like android, use ios. Etc

<p>You know, replies like this aren't helping Microsoft, or me, or the others who want a NOKIA device to work like the previous Nokia devices, if not better.</p>
<p>I like Windows on my two computers (even Windows 8.1, with a classic shell), and thought I'd get the same performance and versatility from Windows on my mobile. On the contrary, Windows Phone refuses to give you functionalities which are basic, and were
 present in cheap Nokia phones for years.</p>
<p>How hard is it to give you dial up networking?</p>
<p>How hard is it to give you an option to lock to 3G instead of "select maximum connection speed"? (My area has 3G, my E7 can be locked to 3G only, and it gives me good browsing speed, but for some reason, even with max speed set to 3G, my Lumia 925 will fall
 back to 2G, and slow down browsing).</p>
<p>How hard is it to have a "standby breather light", or the windows key flash if you have unread notifications?</p>
<p>How hard is it not to accelerate up the CPU to full power for basic tasks like clicking photos?</p>
<p>How hard is it to give a file manager out of the box, instead of having to hunt for one in the store?</p>
<p>How hard is it to give you a call recorder?</p>
<p>How hard is it to let the phone remain switched off while charging?</p>
<p>How hard is it to let the alarm clock function even if the phone is switched off?(haven't checked this after the latest update, but this wasn't possible a few days back. My phone now runs Cyan)</p>
<p>How hard is it to give you a "vibrate then ring", and a "Vibrate and ring" as two seperate options?</p>
<p>How hard is it to give a damn "stop" button in the music player?</p>
<p>How hard is it to give you a "Nokia PC suite" that supports Windows Phones? (the Windows Phone app in Windows 8.1 is so dumb. all it can do is import and export files from the phone, that too over a USB connection, no bluetooth support. Why on earth would
 one use an app if all it can do is import and export pictures? Are we too dubm to copy/paste using Windows Explorer?)</p>
<p>Leave flash, I understand adobe has stopped working on flash for mobiles, but how hard is it to implement these other Nokia features? These tiny things add up, and tarnish the overall experience. Microsoft these days, is all about "simplicity", and they're
 so paranoid about it, that they're willing to sacrifice functionality for simplicity.</p>
<p>I don't want to move to Android, cause I love Nokia, and if you read my previous post, I have used Nokia devices all my life (my only two phones that weren't Nokia were a Samsung SGHX100, and a Motorola T180).</p>
<p>And now you're asking me to switch to Samsung or Apple for good, just because I want Nokia to be as good as it was in my E7. Android is a second class citizen in Nokia, and if I really want a good android experience, i would probably need to switch to Samsung.
 Unfortunately, I hate Samsung even more than I hate Windows Phone. Apple is good, but is too expensive, and I don't like Apple's walled-garden approach. Nokia is going the Apple way now. There's no way to install apps from places other than the Windows Store.
 Please don't tell me this is a good thing, I have installed apps from all over the internet on my Symbian phones, and never ran into problems.</p>
<p>I don't hate the idea of having Windows on my phone, I hate the idea of Windows not being able to perform basic tasks that I expect from Nokia devices. If only Nokia would have a high end phone with Symbian, I'd dump my Lumia and get that tomorrow. But switching
 to Samsung or Apple is not really an option for me. I'm a Nokia fan, and I feel hurt when I see what Microsoft is doing to Nokia :(</p>

<p>just a small note from my part – I am not about judging on your opinion – I am still using a Symbian phone as my main phone: Just technically, Microsoft did not
<em>kill</em> these features, but Microsoft&nbsp;did not create/duplicate them. With Windows Phone, Microsoft started from scratch and was not able to recover software source-code from platforms like Symbian. The computer-science competence-level (within Nokia and
 Microsoft) was not able to copy and paste software source-code from Symbian. This tells a lot about the software quality of the Symbian OS, as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, you are about ‘new’ features, feature requests. Because of this, are you aware of the website for
<a href="https://windowsphone.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feature Suggestions</a>? Please, vote for the features you are looking for. With all of your features, your are not alone. However, please still vote there because that page helps Microsoft to quantify
 the interest/need for one particular feature.</p>

<p>With Windows Phone 8.1 Update (Lumia Denim), you get Bluetooth PAN.</p>
<p>Please, note that this is not the Bluetooth DUN, you might be used to from your Symbian device. However, I miss Bluetooth PAN in Symbian very much. Nokia Series 40 for example supported both Bluetooth DUN
<em>and</em> Bluetooth PAN for years. And in both platforms, I miss Wi-Fi tethering which is secured by modern standards (WPA2). Go figure!</p>

<p>I want to pick that feature because I am curious and do not understand that particular feature yet. Please, let us imagination, I am a Computer Scientist at Microsoft, very busy and working on the source code of Windows Phone. I have to schedule my time
 and prioritise my work. I do not think it is very difficult to code that, neither does it take much time. However, why shall I code this at all? Or asked differently: What was the benefit of having a stop button?</p>

<p>Abi99, thanks for your reply :)</p>
<p>And thanks for introducing the feature request page to me :)</p>
<p>But with so many features I find missing, there's probably no hope of getting them all done in any recent time. Nevertheless, it's at least a point to start and maybe I'll find these features in the next Nokia device I purchase :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Lumia Denim be available for the Lumia 925? I have Cyan, and if I check, it says no updates available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What exactly is PAN? Will it let me hook up my desktop to the internet? I have a broadband connection, a desktop, and a laptop, both HP. If the broadband is down, I cannot connect the desktop to the internet at all, it doesn't have WiFi, only a USB bluetooth
 dongle.</p>
<p>I can browse the internet on the laptop using WiFi sharing of my Lumia, but the sharing switches off if I don't browse for a while, didn't have this issue when I browsed with bluetooth modem option of my Symbian devices. Is this a design feature? Or a problem
 with my phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took it to nokia care and told them that the phone heats up if I use the camera, they said it's normal for the phone to heat up while using apps, it will cool down if you leave it idle for a while. And that's what happens. It's cold as water if I leave
 it idle for 5 minutes. But this heating up while using, is wasting power. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the principle of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created, nor be destroyed, it can only be converted from one form to another. If
 I'm converting electrical energy to useless heat, I'm wasting energy. If I could let the CPU run at a lower clock speed all the time, only run it at full speed when absolutely required, I'd be saving a lot of heat generated, and hence, save energy.</p>
<p>In Windows 8.1 PC edition, I can select a "Max CPU speed" in Power Options --&gt; Change Plan Settings --&gt; Change advanced power settings --&gt; Processor power management.</p>
<p>I select "MAX CPU SPEED" to 45 %, and my 2.10 GHz Quad core intel CPU instantly downclocks itself to 0.78GHz!</p>
<p>Even as I type this, it's running at 0.78GHz, and there's NO performance hit at all! Firefox is only a fraction bit slower (not noticable if you're not being too focussed or running benchmarks) than it would be if my CPU was running at 2.10GHz. The only
 performance hit is when I launch a game. The game lags, and frame rate drops. So while playing games, I select 2.10GHz, and for every other task, I keep it at 0.78GHz.</p>
<p>Benefits: The CPU cooling fan doesn't kick in at all, and the laptop is cold to touch, even if i browse on firefox for 3 hours at a stretch, while at the same time play an MP3 song in jetaudio, have yahoo messenger open and have Microsoft Outlook open. My
 point here, it's not a good idea to run the CPU at full speed most of the time, just because the CPU is capable of running at full speed. WP unfortunately is very interested to throttle up the CPU to MAX almost all the time you open an app (as the phone heats
 up every time I open apps like facebook, WhatsApp, Here, or IE, and Nokia care told me it's normal).</p>
<p>And don't you think a file manager is a basic thing in an OS? Imagine you purchasing a computer and not being able to launch Windows Explorer, and having to download an App for that, that would, to put it gently, suck :p</p>
<p>This other day, i was listening to an Eminem song, "You can suck my d**k", then I paused it and exited out of the music player app. My mom came over and I was showing the phone to her, hit the volume up, and a popup flashed on the screen saying "You can
 suck my d**k". Pretty awkward situation. A stop button would have helped,, :p</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new phone models already have it (Lumia 735, Lumia 830, Lumia 530, Lumia 535) and some models like the Lumia 930 already got Windows Phone 8.1 Update. Perhaps you get it as Christmas present, perhaps it takes some months. Anyway, if you go for the Windows
 Phone Developer Preview programme, you are able to use it today because Bluetooth PAN does not need the firmware update (Lumia Denim).</p>

<p>Yes, you are even able to share the Internet connection of your mobile phone to more than one device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a user-perspective (and unfortunately from a top manager perspective), Bluetooth DUN and Bluetooth PAN are the same because they solve the same issues. Technically, both are very different and some devices support only one of them. This cause incompatibilities,
 therefore my statement. You have to double-check whether your other devices support not just DUN as you used it with Symbian but PAN as well.</p>

<p>Conversion of energy is not going to be perfect ever (thank you science, for allowing me at least that statement). You are going to ‘loose’ energy with everything you do. Every manufacturer about mobile phones tries to minimize that. Actually, your previous
 phone(s) did get very hot as well. However, because they were bigger, heat could find its way much easier.</p>

<p>Before we start academic talks here – you cannot do that actually that easy, because it is not the CPU but the GPU which is getting hot – are you having problems to find a power outlet? Or asked differently: Doesn’t your Lumia last at least the time you

<p>Thanks again Abi99 :)</p>
<p>I'll wait till the update is officially available, scared to run preview versions on the phone, because if something breaks, it's not always as easy to fix a phone as it is to fix a laptop with a "System Image" or even a complete re-install from the original
 DVDs. Good to know that they've not abandoned the 925 and the update will be available :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hoping the PAN thing will work on my desktop, can you suggest me a way to check if the desktop supports it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When WiFi sharing switches off, the laptop cannot find any wireless network, and Firefox fails to load pages. I'm uploading a screenshot of what happens, please take a look. When this happens, I open the "internet sharing" option in the Lumia, and it says
 "Sharing: off". I tap on the off, it turns on, and within a few seconds the laptop finds the network and connects again. I'm using Windows 8.1 Pro, with update 1, on the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're probably right about my other devices heating up as well, but they never felt as hot to touch as my 925 does. Probably the slimmer form factor is to blame, probably the faster CPU, probably the GPU.. But the fact is, if I browse the internet on firefox
 in my laptop with CPU downclocked to 0.78GHz for 3 hours, it's not at all hot, the CPU cooling fan is not running, and the laptop surface is colder than my body temperature. But if I browse facebook on IE in Lumia for 15 minutes, it's hot to touch. The laptop
 heats up only when I use it at 2.10GHz, enable "intel turbo boost", and launch a 3D directX 9 game. That's then i hear a whirling sound and the cooling fas switches on automatically. When I'm done gaming, I downclock it to 0.78GHz again, the fan keeps running
 for a while, and then turns off again, after about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lumia doesn't last more than 17 to 18 hours in my daily usage. My E7 lasted about a day and a half.</p>
<p>Every backgroud app is turned off in battery saver. Ironically, I didn't turn off background apps in my N series and E seried devices, I don't think there was even a way of doing that, and it still lasted a day and a half, and my usage pattern hasn't changed
 much. I&nbsp; make some calls, send some messages, listen to some music, click some photos, but don't really use the internet a lot - i'm almost always in front of a running computer, so don't really need to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the search button, I personally can live without a search, but living without a file manager is pretty odd. Think about it, every OS has it. Symbian had it. Android has it. Windows on PC has it. Mac OS has it. Ubuntu has it, openSuse has it, fedora
 has it, not sure about iOS, didn't play with iPhones much. Search is good, but a file manager is needed, at least in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in that Eminem example, I closed the Music app (by the back button, there's no option to close it within the app itself, only the back button) but the obscene song name still popped up. Give it a try if you've got some free time, play something on the
 music player, pause it, back out of it, long press back to make sure nothing is running, get back to the home screen, and hit volume up, you'll see the song name being popped up in the change volume dialogue. I just tried, and that's exactly what happened..
 Rebooting the phone would have solved it though, but isn't it easier to press a "stop" button, than to reboot the whole system to get rid of the paused song? I wasn't handing it over to her as in "Hey ma, here, take my phone and use it for a few hours", it
 was more like "Hey ma, I got this new phone, take a look at it", didn't feel like rebooting it before doing that :p</p>
<p>There's an app, "kill my music", it does the job. But I'd still say it would be neat to put a stop button, or at least to reprogram the volume control popup so that it doesn't show the paused song if the music player is not running in background..</p>
<p>Thanks for your help about denim and PAN, and also for sharing your view on what I wrote :)</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have time in the future, please, go for a local community project or your neighbour and give a course to explain computers (or mobile phones) to novices (or attend a course to learn from).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; File Managers are complicated to explain because they are a copy of a real-world structure which requires formal training in many countries: office manager. Cabinets, folders, and files are not real-world structures but a solution to conquer an issue
 – too much data plus difficulty in physical access.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;That is one of the reasons, why it is so complicated to explain a file manager to people. Even those who had been office managers, those struggle with the copy of the concept in a computer. It is easy for you, it is easy for me, but please, go for it
 and try to explain that concept to somebody who never used a computer before – and many mobile phone users never ever go to use a computer at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A search button might not be the perfect solution, however, I am not aware of a better one, yet. Thank you Apple! Actually this topic was an active usability-research topic many, many decades ago, nothing new but today it works finally.</p>

<p>The whole package (battery size, screen light) was created to last a working day (12 hours). Consequently, you have a perfect value! With that value, you are able to charge your phone over night or before sleep without disruption of your day life. We are
 used to charge our devices, but do not ask me how many people forgot to recharge theirs. If we are forced to recharge every day, we are trained to do so. No way to forget it. No empty batteries anymore. Even in an emergency, I have a battery which is working.
 I do not want to know how many lives were saved by this change in habits already. Thank you Apple!</p>

 different and iOS does it this way. That would be your stop-button actually. Mhm. Where do we report that issue?</p>

<p>Abi99, thank you. I did something drastic today. I did something I never thought I'd do in a million years.</p>
<p>I got myself a Samsung</p>
<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/in/consumer/mobile-phone/mobile-phone/smartphone/SM-N910GZKEINU?subsubtype=android-mobiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here's</a> the link to the device I got :)</p>
<p>I did this because of one reason, you confirmed my belief that Microsoft Mobile (and more importantly, my trusted brand Nokia) doesn't care about me any more. You made me believe that the "engineer" at Microsoft thinks "Who cares a file manager, who cares
 a device that behaves like a PC while handling files, who cares a device where you can actually quit apps (stop the music player), who cares a device that stays switched off untill the power button is long pressed, WE know better that the STUPID user, and
 the STUPID user will eventually give up what he likes, become a zombie, and start thinking our way".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Samsung does everything I expected the Lumia to do, and it doesn't heat up unless I do something really heavyweight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't write about the battery though, just got it, but I hope it'll do better than the Lumia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many Apps are available, the device is so much more customizable, it's fast (the Lumia was fast too, but then ..) and it has everything I want. Looks like Google developers get me, and Microsoft Mobile developers don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To each his own, but I think I made the right choice to move on from Nokia. Nokia is NOT the Nokia it used to be. Nokia is no longer the Nokia that designed brilliant N series and E series devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll still keep the Lumia though, as a secondary device in case something goes wrong with my Samsung, but I hope it doesn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only bad thing about this Samsung, is the body/ casing of the device doesn't feel premium, it feels like cheap plastic. But other than that, it's so close to perfect :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help :)</p>

            <p>Do File, Help in Word (or one of the other applications) and it will tell you which version you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is Office 365 you won't need a PK, you log in to the MS Account you associated with the 365 subscription, and use the links there to uninstall from the PC and install on a Mac. &nbsp;(With most 365 subscriptions you are allowed more than one install anyway.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is indeed Office 365 I would have expected you to have been nagged into doing the 'free' upgrade to Office 2016 months ago.</p>

            <p>OK I have not answered before, but would like to put in my 2 cents on this one.</p>
<p>I have version 1607 build 14393.0.</p>
<p>since installing this version I no longer have sound in my speakers from the sound chip on the motherboard. It is listed as a usb device in device manager. However, now I have NVIDIA hdmi audio coming out of my monitor speakers. I cannot get anything from
 my main speakers other than "white noise" when audio is supposed to play. I can make the NVIDIA output the default and the proper sound comes from the little speakers in the monitor. I don't have hdmi output on the video card, but and using a DVI to HDMI cable
 to drive my monitor.</p>
<p>Before this build was installed I never had the NVIDIA&nbsp; audio in device manager.</p>
<p>I would really like to get the sound back on the motherboard as I have 7.1 surround with all speakers hooked up. With the HDMI I can only get the little monitor speakers to play. I miss the bass and mids.

<h2>            Saving to favorite locations in 2003</h2>
                    In version 2003 I was able to save a file (Word, Excel, Publisher) to a "favorite" location which I could put on the left side of the "save as" box.&nbsp; What is comparable to this in version 2010?

            <p>Hi Marcia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would need more information to help you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Are you reffering to the feature in which when click on save as button, you must be able to save the files in the locations such as desktop, favorites?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, then you will be able to save the files in these locations in Office 2010 as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this has helped you or else provide us the steps you perform &nbsp;and the screenshots of the issue to help you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Guruprasad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot provide you with a screenshot since I have a new computer and upgraded Office.&nbsp; In 2003 there was an option on the "save as" box to put favorite locations in the left column.&nbsp; For instance, we have a network F drive for all our data.&nbsp; So I would
 save a particular report in "f\data\finance\accounting\reports\2013\June.&nbsp; When I arrived at the June file I could select this file to appear in the left hand favorites so the next time I went to save something to that location I could scroll down the 10 or
 so favorites to the June one and click on that, thereby saving myself all the tediousness of selecting sub-folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this describes the problem a little better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Marcia</p>

Select a folder/drive first in the SaveAs or Open dialog box<br />
The panel on the left side of the dialog is titled Save in or Look in.<br />
Right-click a blank area in that panel and on the pop-up menu you should have an "add" option.<br />

                    <p>Hi, I've been using a pen on my surface in Word successfully, but this morning the only usable function in via the Draw ribbon is the "ink to math" tab.&nbsp; It is impossible to de-select this feature and select another Draw feature.&nbsp; It applies to all Word
 documents.&nbsp; I have restarted word, and re-started the surface also.&nbsp; The pen functionality works absolutely fine in powerpoint - so it's a problem with Word only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas please?!</p>
<p>

            thanks - I solved this just now.&nbsp; For some seemingly pointless reason, when a word document is in "web layout" the pen function is solely limited to "ink to math",&nbsp; but when I switch back to "print layout" full functionality is re-enabled.

<h2>            View Permissions not applying within modern site.</h2>
                    I am having an issue where the view permissions I have set on lists are not being applied when the list is switched to a modern experience. We are using sharepoint online as well as infowise ultimate forms. I have submitted the question to Infowise, but
 figured I would ask here as well. The view permissions on the list are set within Infowise and we have not had any issue with the permissions not being applied on a classic list experience. I just noticed I was able to view all views today while logged in
 as a test user with no admin rights. If I switch the list to classic, my views are restricted. If I switch back to modern all items are available to be viewed/edited. The reasoning behind rolling over to a modern list experience was a better mobile view. Would
 use powerapps if not for so many caveats.&nbsp;

            Correction to original post, this issue is present even when Infowise ultimate forms app is bypassed. I created an additional list to test. I broke site inheritance permissions on the list and shared the list with a select few individuals. Not with my
 test user. With my test user, I was able to log in, see my access to the list denied, click "exit classic experience" and view all items in the restricted list without it being shared with me. The workaround for this seems to be to set the default site experience
 through sharepoint admin center&gt; settings to be classic. This removed the option for the user to switch between experiences. This is a flaw. Microsoft is very hesitant to acknowledge the issue.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Mmmcoffeegood,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Infowise ultimate forms is third party, we are unable to test with this form.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, view permissions do not work when Infowise ultimate forms app is bypassed, I suppose, you created a normal list in SharePoint online by following the method below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In SharePoint online site, click <strong>Settings</strong> icon and then click
<strong>Site contents.</strong></li><li>Click + <strong>New</strong>, and then click <strong>List</strong>.</li><li>Type a <strong>Name</strong> for the list, and optionally, type a <strong>Description</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Create</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I created a normal list and shared the list only with a test user with <strong>
Read</strong> permission. When I opened the list in InPrivate browser mode with the test user account, the list appeared in read only mode as expected in both, classic and modern view. The test user was unable to edit the view or edit any item in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how it appeared in Classic view: All the option in the ribbon are greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9efbaf7d-af5b-4fea-b4ca-749b8e2121c7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9efbaf7d-af5b-4fea-b4ca-749b8e2121c7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Modern View: Edit/update is disabled </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9337e746-aeaf-440b-98f9-b1984b698644?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9337e746-aeaf-440b-98f9-b1984b698644?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are getting the issue with a normal list as well, I would like to collect following information to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Please provide detail steps to reproduce the issue.</li><li>Provide the screenshot of the list in both modern and classic view.</li><li>With which permission did you share the list?</li><li>You mentioned “<em>If I switch back to modern all items are available to be viewed/edited</em>”, provide more detail about this with some related screenshots.</li></ol>
<p>

 a nightmare to maintain and a better approach would have been to just update the styling on the "classic" version and not try to reinvent the wheel.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Neha, Thank you for your response. Yes, I did see it. I am in a live production environment. I will try and work through your assignment after work. How about let me ask you a question. You are in my shoes. You have a list that over 1000 employees need
 access to. They need to be able to submit a request and edit their request if errors are made in the initial submission. However, they only need to be able to edit their own requests and really do not need the ability to see any other requests other than their
 own. On the flip side there needs to be the ability for a certain group of individuals to edit any of the items on the list.&nbsp;

                    How do I "lock" Shapes window in Ppt 2007 without having to click on Insert &gt; Shapes each time?

            The Home tab actually shows the Insert Shape menu open with shapes displayed and most commonly used ones and last used ones at the top constantly displayed. In other words, using that menu, you don't have to click first to make them appear... unless you
 need to see the shapes that are not in view. What I'm saying is, although it's not totally what you want, the Home tab's Shape tool is closer to meeting your needs than the Insert tab's Insert Shape tool.<br />
<br />
Personally, it's still stuck in my craw that MS took away the "tear-away" menus, where we could position certain menus (like the Shapes menu) permanently fully open and in view where ever we frickin' wanted to. &lt;UGH!&gt; But... life goes on.&nbsp; ;-)<br />

When I right-click on an Outlook folder in Firefox, the usual FIREFOX menu of options (e.g. "save link as", "open link in") appears, none of which is specific to Outlook.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, if I right-click on an Outlook folder in GOOGLE CHROME, an OUTLOOK menu of options appears. This includes the option to delete the folder.<br />

            kdjd2020: what that sensor does is adjust your screen display brightness and your keypad backlight brightness according to how light/dark it is...<br />
<br />
i.e. in daytime, your keypad will not light up that much as it is not needed, but at night, in a totally dark room it will work at full power.<br />
this saves some battery life in the end..

    <title>Saving to .xls from Excel 2007 and Windows 10 with embeded email links - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tombreckon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving to .xls from Excel 2007 and Windows 10 with embeded email links corrupts the file.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Excel 2007 and&nbsp;Windows 10 with all the latest production&nbsp;updates.&nbsp; Lately I have had trouble opening .xls files in Excel that we have been using for a long time, but now throw an error when opened.&nbsp; This problem does not occur when using .xlsx
 files, but we use .xls files in order to distribute those files for use with certain legacy applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some trial and error, I have determined that the problem occurs when&nbsp;the spreadsheet&nbsp;contains cells with email hyperlinks.&nbsp; The problem occurs after an email hyperlink is either added or edited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;used Excel 2007 to create&nbsp;a simple brand new&nbsp;test spreadsheet with only one cell, A1, populated with an email hyperlink.&nbsp; When I saved this file as .xls and then re-opened the file&nbsp;using Excel, I get a Security Alert - Office File Validation message saying
 that the file is probably dangerous and may allow a malicious user to take over your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing in the spreadsheet but a single email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the file with LibreOffice Spreadsheet, save the file as .xls, and then&nbsp;open the file with Excel, the file comes in with no error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes me believe that Excel is corrupting the file when storing the file as .xls.&nbsp; LibreOffice is able to store the file in a way that then works perfectly in Excel, until of course&nbsp;the file is saved again in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/perspective with this problem would be helpful.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Robin, but neither of these threads apply.&nbsp; The hyperlinks in my spreadsheets all work just fine.&nbsp; My problem is that when I save the spreadsheet in Excel as .xls, and the re-open the file in Excel, the file no longer passes the new Office File Validation.&nbsp;
 When I do finally get the file open, however, the links work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why saving a file as .xls in Excel that contains hyperlinks&nbsp;produces a file that when re-opened in Excel&nbsp;will not pass Microsoft Office File Validation?&nbsp; LibreOffice can open and the save the file, even after Excel has corrupted it, and
 then after LibreOffice has corrected the file, it then loads into Excel just fine.&nbsp; This makes me think the problem is how Excel saves the file.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would love to provide you a file, but I must admit I don't know how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I just reproduced the problem with these very simple steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a new blank workbook in Excel.</p>
<p>Put an email address in cell A1, &nbsp;such as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, and confirm that it highlights as a hyperlink.</p>
<p>Save the file as .xls.</p>
<p>Open the file in Excel, and you will get the red Protected View message right away at the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any insights about this, please let us know.</p>

</p><p>Thanks. You can always send me the file at this address :&nbsp;szwel dot support at arstdesign dot com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this Excel 2007+Windows 10 combination, it's Windows 10 which must be responsible because I can't reproduce the problem otherwise. As for why this occurs, Excel must rely on Windows IE system dlls for hyperlinks (urlmon.dll) and Microsoft probably broke
 how it worked with previous versions of Windows. This does not offer a workaround or fix for this problem I admit, only perhaps the beginning of an explanation, which implies the problem is for any version of Excel not just Excel 2007. I have to see such a
 file to know more.</p>

    <title>Autosave tab is not available on Onedrive Business - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artechdi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autosave tab is not available on Onedrive Business</h2>
                    So we are migrating from Dropbox to Onedrive, and we have found several cool things that make us want to come back dropbox. I wanted to activate the option in autosave to save the screenshots in the cloud, but the tab is not available in the business version.
 Now that I set up my free personal onedrive&nbsp;with my hotmail account onedrive,&nbsp;it has the option to autosave. Why this feature is not available in the 365 being that this is a paid enterprise version?

            <p>Hi Artechdi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you noticed, Autosave tab is not available on Business account. However, you still can select the save location you want each time you save a file. When you click Save for new files or Save As for existing files, click OneDrive or This PC and then pick
 a folder to save your file to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, the best way to influence the product is to provide feedback through the link below:</p>

            Hi Debkumar
<br />
<br />Office 2019 has the same icons as Office 2016, however an update is currently being released around the world, which will change your icons to the totally new icon set . . .
<br />
<br />Open a new document in Word
<br />
<br />Go to File - Account
<br />
<br />How many Office licence(s)re listed there, is it just Office 2016 or is there also another licence listed there?
<br />

            Hi Deb
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Office 2016/2019 will not get the new icon set.
<br />
<br />The new icons are specific to Office 365 subscription.

<br />

<p>
</p><p>I thought that was true also, until I found out I was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to rain on your parade Andre, but MS was lazy / sloppy when they programmed the change. Instead of limiting it to 365 and 2019 they included 2016 too. I just got the new icons on my Office 2016 Pro Plus installation (even though I don't want them).</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 willnot start even in safe mode</h2>
                    <p>I have a windows 7 machine and Office 365.&nbsp; I have had both for some time with no problem. Almost a week ago Outlook just stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It comes up with the initial little office outlook blue screen with processing in the bottom left corner and then does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried starting in safe mode it just sair it needs to repair itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a full online office 365 repair and still nothing.&nbsp; All the other office products work.</p>
