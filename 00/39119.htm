<p>- It's a common misconception that Win10 has only DX12. Most DirectX files in Win10 are&nbsp; DX - 9,10 &amp; 11.<br />
- The following is a list of the Direct X .dll's you will have when the files are up to date.<br />
Go to the <em>Windows </em>/ <em>System 32</em> folder, (and <em>SysWOW64</em> if you have 64bit). &nbsp;<br />
They are in alphabetical order and will start with<em> d3dx9 - 24 &gt; 43</em> . Then
<em>d3dx10 - 33 &gt; 43 </em>&amp;&nbsp; <em>d3dx11 - 42 &gt; 43.</em><br />
There should also be - d3d9, d3d10 and d3d11 (among others).<br />
These come before the D3Dcompilers-33&gt;43+47.<br />
- Win10 currently has only two d3d 12 files. One in System 32,and SysWOW64 .<br />
- There are more DX files, but these are most of the graphics related Direct X&nbsp; .dll's<br />
<br />
- When using a 'clean' Windows install it's advisable to run the <em>DirectX Web Installer</em> to 'update' or verify</p>
<p>all DX files are installed.</p>
<p>Note that the Web Installer only installs 'missing' files and does not overwrite corrupt files as does the</p>
<p>full DX Redist installer.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from Official Microsoft Download Center</a><br />
<br />
- Use this when there is a corrupt DX file&nbsp; DX Redist (June 2010) ...<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Details - Microsoft Download Center - DirectX Redist (June 2010)</a><br />
<br />
Note - The installer download unpacks files to a location of your choice. You then open the folder<br />
and find the <em>DXSETP.exe&nbsp;</em> and run that to reinstall DirectX.<br />
Once the reinstall is complete you can delete the folder the files were unpacked to.<br />
<br />
- Another reason for DirectX errors is if your graphics accelerator (either Integrated graphics or graphics card)
</p>
<p>does not meet the specifications of the game.<br />
- Outdated audio drivers can also cause DirectX errors in some cases.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you do not use the Ethernet connection it should affect your computer functionality.</p>
<p>Otherwise, log to Acer support, find and download the Drivers for your computer.</p>
<p><strong>In general.</strong></p>
<p>ollow this process to make sure that the network aspect of the laptop is On and configured correctly.<br />
<br />
Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry.<br />

<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.<br />
<br />
Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Local Area Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.<br />

<br />
Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are connected (few more will be even better).<br />
<br />
Switch Off the computer and the Router, Reboot the Router, and the computer.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p>TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.<br />

<h3> austin project consulting  say:</h3>
<h2>            Had to down load a WIN 7 interface in order to make WIN 10 logical</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded WIN 10 for my PC and as much as i like the look of it and a lot of its new tools and toys.....I didn't like the way so many old folders had changed from WIN 7...either renamed, or reduced in function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something as simple and useful as<strong> 'Control Panel'</strong> is not apparently there any more.......apparently not but actually it is.....its just not there at a click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to avoid a clumsy series of clicks in WIN 10 that would give me access to control panel, I had to download
<strong>Start10</strong> from software company&nbsp;<strong>Stardock.</strong>...... A nice little interface which sits on top of WIN 10 and gives you all the familiar WIN 7 'start menu' features ....including 'Control Panel'</p>
<p>
</p><p>My criticism of WIN 10 is that while its arrival is part of any platform life cycle upgrade, Microsoft should publish a simple list of all functions in an upgrade that are either new change or disappear
<em>'in comparison with what it replaces'.</em>...then you know what you are getting yourself into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that a company would come up with a platform interface between 7 and 10 so soon is a serious criticism of WIN 10.....WIN 10 isnt perfect, it is an improvement on 7 in some areas, it is worse in others</p>
<p>

<h2>            Wide Screen  setting causes photos to flicker and lines to break up</h2>
                    <p>I am making a video using some 100 slides all shot in high definition on a new Nikon D5100 at highest quality setting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially tried to preview project on my computer, and wide screen setting played all right. Tried again after adding music and each shot flickered/blurred. Regular screen plays fine. I have never had such a problem with using wide screen HD video slideshows
 of my photos in some 25 YouTube posts (using the OneTrueMedia program) so I know it is not the definition of the photos or my desk top or my monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To top everything off, when I hit save for the video, it dumped all my transitions panning and zoom settings carefully set photo by photo. I am not very impressed!</p>

            <p>100 slides all shot in high definition?</p>
<p>Are we talking about stills? These don't come in high definition.</p>
<p>I'm assuming you do mean stills, so at highest quality setting, do you mean</p>
<p>4928 x 3264 RAW?</p>
<p>I've never tried MM with RAW pics, so it could be this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What file type was the music? MP£ causes lots of problems, so it always best to use wav or wma.&nbsp; Try using a different piece of music in this format and see if the problem persists.&nbsp; If not, convert your mp3 to wav/wma and all should be good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you got the latest versions of directx, graphics and audio drivers installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never heard of MM not saving everything when it saves. Did it save your stills as a movie file but no sign of everything else?

Did it not save anything?</p>

            Yes, highest quality JPEGs&nbsp;stills that I then sequence as a slide show. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Music was MPEG. will try converting to WAV.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
MM saved the slide show as a movie file but&nbsp; as with later Previews I had tried before saving, the photos were blurred and any lines flickered.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My desktop is up to date and I have never had similar problems on over 30 slide shows I did using OneTrueMedia in HD/Wide Screen which provided a very similar service as MM.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The other problem with the saved version was that I could not uncheck the two green arrow "Apply To All" under Animations. I have tried uninstalling and re-installing MM twice but it still opens with both green arrows checked which means any individual zooms.
 panning and transitions I wanted to apply to specific slides, while they showed up in Previews, were removed&nbsp; when I downloaded the finished movie.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I need to fix this Apply to All problem before I go back and remake the whole movie and try using a WAV soundtrack as you suggested. Your help in dealing with this much appreciated

            <p>Did you download and save the install file to your computer?</p>
<p>Are you using the same file to install each time?</p>
<p>I'm wondering if there is a glitch in your file and downloading it again and using this file might work better.</p>
<p>This isn't something I've come across before, so sorry can't think of anything else to suggest.</p>

            <p>My&nbsp;other problem with MM&nbsp;is that I&nbsp;can not uncheck the two green arrow "Apply To All" under Animations. As soon as I select some photos and then click Animations, the screen opens with both Apply to All with a green checkmark.&nbsp;Clicking on the green arrows
 does not turn them off--nor does any other command that I can find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have tried uninstalling and re-installing MM twice but it still opens with both green arrows checked which means any individual zooms. panning and transitions I wanted to apply to specific slides, while they showed up in Previews, were removed&nbsp; when I
 downloaded the finished movie as the Apply to All over-rides them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can get a fix on this, MM could be quite useful for me--but at the moment it is a source of frustration.</p>

            <p>I've opened up my MM to have a look at this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The green tick on the apply to all button should be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To apply one transition to one pair of pictures, click on the picture that you want to transition to, so second picture and select a transition.&nbsp; Select third picture and select a different transition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select one transition and click the select all button it will put it on all transitions.</p>

            Having a green check mark on select all is counter-intuitive but yes, as long as I indicated for each photo the pan or transition I wanted and then avoided any other select all check marks (e.g. on seconds for each slide to show) it worked. Made the mistake
 of trying to change the seconds for all my slides after&nbsp;my other editing. This sent me back to a single pan or transition for all slides

<h2>            Error&#58; Asms file needed Windows XP Home edition after os repair. &#40;Windows 7 upgrade&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: asms file needed windows xp home edition after os repair.</p>
<p>I know this is old but i am trying to get on my mothers pc so she can transfer files to a usb harddrive. This computer has had viruses in it and has caused for some files to be rearranged. I got the viruses&nbsp;out&nbsp;</p>
<p>i&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;access&nbsp;the device manager since it disappeared. The computer would not recognize the usb hardrive, so i decided to repair the pc using the&nbsp;re installation&nbsp;disc.&nbsp;
</p>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer repaired itself but now i get this message saying asms file is needed. I tried using the steps from this article ( kb 311755) but still the same problem. I would use the recovery console but i dont know the password for the safe mode administrator.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer that had the os repaired is a&nbsp;dell dimension 2350 and i used the original windows xp disk.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a windows 7 disk but the graphics card on the computer is below adequate. I was wondering if&nbsp;I&nbsp;could tone down the graphics to the windows classic theme so that windows 7 will work and is there a way to save the files because the computer is still
 on setup of xp</div>

            Your stated specifications (RAM) do not quite meet the minimum requirements for WIndows 7 as stated here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/system-requirements</a><br />
<br />
But, Microsoft also <span style="font-style: italic">recommends</span> 128MB of RAM for XP as stated here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314865</a><br />
<br />
So I think their minimum requirements are a lot of hooey for most environments.&nbsp; It might run, but you are probably not going to like it.<br />
<br />
If you want to see if you can get your XP working (I am not familiar with this problem), if you do a little Googling for phrases like clear XP administrator password, forgot XP administrator password, reset XP administrator password, etc. I am pretty confident
 that you will find a way to get past that little bump in the road.&nbsp; Just clear the password and be on your way.<br />
<br />
We're just not supposed to tell you how to do that kind of stuff, so I am just dropping a few hints :)<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the make and model of the laptop?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you using any external mouse on the laptop?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you face this issue on particular application or all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:
</p>
<p>Try to run the Hardware troubleshooter and check whether the issue is resolved or not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></a><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>Try running this Microsoft Fixit and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows
</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>You can reinstall the touchpad driver, be sure though that it's for your laptop's model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</b></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>Also try
<b>decreasing the sensitivity</b> of the touch pad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to the 'control panel'.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Then select 'mouse'. </p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Choose the &gt; 'device settings' tab, and then click 'settings'.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You need to change either &gt; the 'tapping' (to disable tapping - meaning you can no longer use the &gt; touchpad itself as a button for the mouse) or 'sensitivity' to decrease &gt; the sensitivity of the touchpad.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You can also try the following:</p>
<p>
<span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>First go to the site of your Computer’s/laptop's manufacturer. There should be a place where you can find the drivers for your scroll pad. (Since I don't know the maker of your laptop, I can't really give any
 step by step instructions. The websites will usually tell you how to install the driver after you have downloaded it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 4:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To work around, you can try performing a
<b>system restore:</b></p>
<p>Refer the below link to know how to perform a system restore:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<h2>            Constant WiFi Error &#8221;No Internet, Secured&#8221;</h2>
                    I am constantly having a problem with my Wifi, receiving the yellow triangle with ”No internet” message. I've tried everything in the book and nothing seems to work. The wifi works perfectly on all other devices so I don't believe the adapter or router
 is to blame. The issue tends to solve itself sometimes and other times I can do tricks to resolve it but that doesn't always work. While I've had the issues only a few times in the past, it has become more regular with the 2017 window's update. Please help
 this problem is extremely frustrating.

<h2>            Screen size&#47;Windows 7</h2>
                    Following downloading, then uninstalling various programmes I have somehow managed to decrease both the size of my text and images.&nbsp; I have tried changing the dpi, then changing the screen size which just made everything too big.&nbsp; Is there someway I can
 get back to the original size I had before I miniaturized everything?

<h2>            Things i would like to see</h2>
                    
<p>I have a few ideas for the one and i hope you guys will back me up.</p>
<p>1. Allow xbox music app to run in the background without it snapping the app. Its a cool feature but playing half screen gets old.</p>
<p>2. If #1 cant be patched in please let us rip music to our hard drive. Its kinda cheap that this is next gen and i cant enjoy my music without paying for a music app created by microsft.</p>
<p>3. Allow us to view our HDD space and manage it. I would like to know how much free space i have left and the option to delete things i never use.</p>
<p>4. Bring back wallpapers for our home screen. Or at least give us somthing to fill in the black background of the home screen.</p>
<p>5. The party chat needs to be fixed. Having to turn chat on when i hop in a party is a pain and half of the time it will not allow me or my friends to use it.</p>
<p>6. Gamer&nbsp;pics, add more. Or at least let us make our own by way of download or upload.</p>
<p>7. The game DVR is a great feature. But the video captured looks almost nothing like the game as far as picture quality goes. It looks blured out and fogy at best. Maybe cranking up the picture quality will help a little.</p>
<p>8. The NAT settings are a pain to change for those of us that have no idea on how to set up static IP's and such. Give us a option to change it by a simple options for network tab.</p>
<p>9. Allow us to stream game play live with voice over work. For example, if im in a party with some friends and somtheing funny or epic happens i would like for the chat to be apart of the recorded moment. Most of the time peoples reactions are what make
 moments even better. Adding music to the moment would be great as well.</p>
<p>These are just a few things i would like to see come to pass for this gen. If this is to be the next gen and XB1 is all about entertainment, give us a next gen system that allows us to better entertain ourselves and the community. Loving the XB1 so far,
 but adding these things would make me love it even more and i hope you guys and girls agree with me.</p>
<p>Happy gaming people and feel free to add me. Maggotking18</p>

<p>So add a option to allow voice to be heard in recorded/streamed video. PC gamers have been able to do this for years now and if this truly is "next gen" I feel we should not be so limited in what we are allowed to do and share.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t select native screen resolution after latest update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikewragg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t select native screen resolution after latest update</h2>
                    <p>Since the latest Windows 10 update, I am unable to select the native 1920x1080 resolution for my screen. I am concerned that support for the AMD Radeon Mobility 4500 chipset is no longer supported. Instead, all I have is an elongated 1440x1050 screen, which
 is useless.</p>
<p>I have tried to install legacy drivers using both the Catalyst software and Drive Talent, but I keep getting messages that the graphics card can't be found or that the latest driver is already installed. The Device Manager, however, still indicates my adapter
 as "ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4500 Series". How can I fix this?</p>

<p>I think I have managed to resolve the issue on my PC.</p>
<p>It was a bit contrived how I got here, but these are the steps I think would work:</p>
<p>1. Install the legacy AMD Catalyst software - mine was a Windows 8, 64-bit utility. It will not detect the graphics adapter because Windows is using the basic Microsoft Display Adapter.</p>
<p>2. In Device Manager, uninstall the ATI display adapter and uninstall the software.</p>
<p>3. Reboot the PC and the system will auto-detect the ATI card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine did not fully detect it the first time, but I deleted it again, along with the non-pnp monitor and it then worked. You may have to play around with these option as I cannot fully remember which order I did them in.</p>
<p>I have now rebooted my PC 3 times and the display has been working fine. I can even access the Catalyst utility as it fully detects the graphics hardware. The Microsoft basic display adapter has disappeared (I could not manually delete it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is a solution for at least some folk with a similar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PHEW!!!</p>

    <title>Cannot connect to internet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot connect to internet</h2>
                    I am running 64bit windows 7 Professional. My problem is that I cannot connect to the internet with my desktop via LAN.<br />
<br />
My desktop is sitting behind a wireless router connected to a modem. (I use Comcast cable)<br />
<br />
When I boot up, the network icon is fine, but I cannot open any web pages. When I diagnose the problem, it says that troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem.<br />
<br />
I have a valid IP address, but when I ping my default gateway in the command prompt, it could not find it.
<br />
<br />
I do not think it has to do with my ethernet cable, and I have tried resetting my modem/reconnecting everything.<br />
<br />
I have tried disabling then re-enabling my LAC, and then it says my broadband modem is experiencing connectivity issues. This is strange because when I use LAN for my laptop (XP) using the same cable everything works fine, no problems.<br />
<br />
My network adapter is: <br />
<br />
Realtek RTL88168B/8111B Family PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC (NDIS 6.20)<br />
<br />
Please let me know if anymore information is needed. Thanks

<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Try resetting the
<strong>TCP/IP</strong> stack.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To reset the
<strong>TCP/IP</strong> stack go to this article and either click on "Fix it for me" or follow the instructions to fix it yourself:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If still the same problem persists then try the next method.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; check if the problem persists
 in safe mode with networking (step 1). If the problem doesn’t persists in safe mode with networking then perform clean boot (step 2) on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: To use a Safe mode with networking option, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting
 to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the arrow keys to choose Safe mode with networking in Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press
 ENTER. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2: Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether
 a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform a clean boot on a computer, follow these steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Please monitor the system in the Clean Boot environment. If the problem does not occur, it indicates that the problem
 is related to one application or service we have disabled. You may use the MSCONFIG tool again to re-enable the disabled item one by one to find out the culprit.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;If your issue is resolved, follow the How to Determine What is Causing the Problem section in the KB article to narrow
 down the exact source. </span></span></p>

            I occasionally get this issue when doing a fresh restart with windows 7 64bit. Its just this computer...i have 2 game consoles and a windows XP comp on the network, and they all function properly, so the router doesnt seem to be the problem.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best thing i've seen to fix it quickly is to open up your network and sharing center, then click on the blue link for the public network and disable it. When you click on the red X that appears on the network map at the top, windows will identify that
 the adapter is disabled, and will give you the option of performing the action as an administrator. Oddly enough, this works every time...i've been looking around for a permanent solution with no luck, but this has gotten me by for the time being.

I also have this problem with a desktop connected via cable with Windows 7 64-bit, I cannot connect at all either directly through a connection from my cable modem or through my wireless router.</p>
<p>I also cannot connect through a cable with my Windows 7 32-bit laptop. I can connect wireless though.</p>
<p>Would really like to fix this.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello Ferrari599,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I see that there are known compatibility issues of Tomb Raider: Anniversary with Windows 7. I suggest that you try the below methods
 to fix this issue. </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to run the game in Windows Vista or Windows XP compatibility mode. You can refer the below link that will give you information
 on How to run the game in compatibility mode: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also try to update the drivers for your graphics card. You can check out the below article that will give you information on how to
 update drivers:</span></span></p>

<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>The script error that you're receiving&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>can
 be due to a third-party program loading up in the background. We suggest that you perform a clean boot and remove any suspicious third-party software to see if that clears up the error message. To perform a clean boot, you may check this<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>article</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

If you haven't already tried, please give an install on your Xbox One console's internal storage to see if there's any change. Keep us looped in with how it goes and whether other games are having issues with your external hard drives.&nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp;Error messages are unfortunately often misleading . AOE 3 is compatible with Win7 64bit, but a lot of people seem to have problems with the game or it's expansions (there is a new thread almost daily).
<br />
If you are installing the game and expansions then try first installing the main game and get it running before installing any expansions.<br />
I don't really have many suggestions as the game installed for me without using any sort of Compatibility Mode.&nbsp; I also have the Asian Dynasties expansion.<br />
<br />
If you type Age of Empires 3 into the search box at the top of the page&nbsp; you will find many threads, and maybe a solution&nbsp; that suits your situation.<br />
Or - Game specific forums are generally the best place for answers. Try the two below -<br />
<a href="http://forum.agecommunity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Age of Empires Forums - Forums</a>
<br />
<a href="http://aoe3.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/index.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Age of Empires III Heaven Forum</a>
<br />
<br />
Have you patched the game ? <br />
Have you used Windows updates ?<br />
Have you updated Direct X ?&nbsp; If not use the Direct X Web installer -<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Do you have other games installed and running with no problems ?<br />
<br />
btw - when you get an error message that says 'Windows is searching for a solution', don't believe it.<br />
&nbsp;I have never heard of&nbsp; Windows finding a solution. <br />

<h2>            Couldn&#39;t open folders and couldn&#39;t search for files</h2>
                    <p>Hello and thanks in advance for the help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is running great for me except for these problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>&nbsp;If I attempt to open a folder within a folder, there's two seconds of pause, and then my screen goes black and I'm back on my desktop. I've worked around this by always right-clicking and opening everything in a New Window. If I try right-clicking and
 choosing Open, screen goes black and I lose Windows entirely-- as in no taskbar, no Startup! Jeez.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>If I plug in an external drive, the same happens. Screen goes black, everything interrupted until screen goes back.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>If I try to search within a file folder, the same happens. Everything hangs up and then black screen again.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, I lose Startup (taskbar would be there but nothing happens when I click on the Windows icon and I can't pull up Windows apps like the Calendar by clicking on the clock on the corner).&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I've never had these problems back when I was using Windows 7 Ultimate. I'm on 32-bit. I've already researched this and only found answers that gave instructions for a disk check and health check or something I'd forgotten. I've already done them and they
 didn't solve anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again. I need to be able to Search in my folders!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span><span>Thanks for sharing your concern on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur if some of the system files got corrupted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to try the below steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) </span></span><span>Open an <strong>Administrator CMD</strong> window (Type
<strong>CMD</strong> in the Search bar or Press <strong>Windows Logo Key + X</strong>. Click on
<strong>Command Prompt admin</strong>).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you can’t find a way, use these steps: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>CTRL + Shift + ESC</strong> to open Task Manager.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>File &gt; Run New Task.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Make sure you have a check mark beside <strong>"Create this task with administrative privileges".</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type CMD. </span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>2) Type the following commands at the CMD prompt: </span></p>
<p><strong><span>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>sfc /scannnow </span></strong></p>
<p><span>3) If both the above commands are completed and show no remaining issues, run the PowerShell command and copy and paste the following:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>4) Check to be sure this command ran, showed a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt. If you see a red error, please try again. The command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps, reply to us with the status of your issue. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Santosh_Rai,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your response and help. Sorry for the late reply--I didn't receive any notification so I only checked now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran both commands without a problem. No integrity violations and all that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With PowerShell, that's when I ran into problems. Please see the screenshot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I saw 'access denied' so I tried running the app as administrator, but I only got an error box. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I hope this is soon resolved. I have friends whose Win10 are now running smoothly so I'm optimistic. Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ETA: Here's the clearer view of the PowerShell error:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You had the right idea to run PowerShell elevated (e.g. in a window titled Administrator: Windows PowerShell&nbsp; but your second example went back to normal PowerShell.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that it is possible to create an elevated PowerShell window from an elevated cmd window.&nbsp; (In fact, that is what the "run the PowerShell command" in "Step 3" will be intended to accomplish before its "Paste".)&nbsp; I think a problem may be that the syntax
 being provided is only supposed to be used in an elevated PowerShell window.&nbsp; Otherwise it may also be possible to code the execution of the whole thing as a single (elevated) cmd window command.&nbsp; You can find other examples of this where the&nbsp;suggestion would
 be to start from an "Administrator: Command Prompt" (aka elevated cmd window) and there enter a command which starts with powershell.exe&nbsp; plus a command line for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

            <p>Hi, Robert, that was not a second example. That was just a clearer photo of the FIRST photo, where I was able to run the PowerShell.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open the Powershell as administrator, I only get an error. I can't open it at all. Repeat, I CAN'T OPEN this elevated PowerShell window you speak of AT ALL. I try to run it AS ADMINISTRATOR, and that's when I get little white error window.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you again,&nbsp;<br />
Joanna</p>
