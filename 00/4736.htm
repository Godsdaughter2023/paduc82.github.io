<p>Hi Lindsey,</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have removed the private message.</p>
<p>From the details of the bounced message, the recipient rejects your email address due to your SPF records.</p>
<p>Based on this message, here are two measures I suggest you try: <br />
1.&nbsp;Let the recipients add your email address or domain in their allow list.<br />
2.&nbsp;Let your domain provider change the SPF record as the bounced message recommend.</p>
<p>If you still run into errors after trying these measures, please let me know which measure you tried and provide the whole Non-delivery Report in
Private Message.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Sophia</p>

<p>2)contacted my network they suggested trying to use a packet geared towards iphones (downloaded the packet doesnt seem like it can be installed)</p>
<p>3) the network suggested that I enter the following settings manually:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; Use PEAP security type<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; User your NetID &amp; Active Directory (AD) Password<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; Inner link security: Auto<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; Token: None<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; server certificate: thawte premium<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; server subject: neauth1.cites.uiuc.edu<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp; server SAN: leave blank</p>
<p>How can I enter these configuration details I am having trouble finding wifi settings the wizard doesnt let me do anything and in the settings menu I cant get to wifi settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have another network without WPA2 but I need to setup the nokia vpn client for that(i have already installed it) The problem is I dont have policies installed and I cant seem to figure out how to enter specific settings for that either (for which
 I will post another topic)</p>

<p>If you are trying to access WPA/WPA2-EAP authenticated networks via "wizard" I think it tries to enable EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA authentication methods by default. This probably why your connection attempts against the WLAN network that requires EAP-PEAP authentication
 are failing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create / edit your WLAN connection methodd (IAPs) manually e.g. in a following manner:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Tools -&gt; Settings -&gt; Connection -&gt; Network Destinations</p>
<p>2. Check if wizard had already managed to create IAP named as your WLAN SSID (=WLAN network name). If so then it's most likely under "Internet" destination.</p>
<p>3. If you can see existing IAP named as your WLAN SSID then you can Edit that one. (skip to 7)</p>
<p>4. If you don't see any existing IAPs that are named like your WLAN SSID then go to the desired "Destination" (e.g. Internet) and select Options -&gt; Add Connection Method.</p>
<p>5. Assuming you are in the coverage area of your WLAN network you can let phone "Automatically check for connection methods" (i.e. scan available WLAN networks) and you should be able to select the correct WLAN network name (SSID) from the list. Once you
 have selected the WLAN network your "Destination" should now have been added with new Connection Method (IAP) named as your WLAN SSID. Note that at this point the particular connection method is still "incorrectly" configured (EAP-SIM &amp; EAP-AKA enabled) for
 your purposes.</p>
<p>6. Now you should manually Edit your new connection method (IAP) with required PEAP settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Edit / ensure following WLAN settings manually from your connection method (IAP):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- "Connection name" defaults to name of your WLAN SSID but you can also change this if you wish</p>
<p>- "Data Bearer" naturally needs to be "Wireless LAN"</p>
<p>- "WLAN network name" should match your WLAN network's SSID exactly (do not edit)</p>
<p>- "Network status" Public (if your WLAN network would be configured to hidden mode then set this to "Hidden" )</p>
<p>- "WLAN network mode": Infrastructure</p>
<p>- "WLAN Security mode": WPA/WPA2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; Go to "WLAN security settings"</p>
<p>- Ensure that "WPA/WPA2 mode is set to "EAP"</p>
<p>- Leave "WPA-2 Only mode" to "Off" unless you are absolutely sure that your WLAN network is configured to stricly pure WPA2 mode (i.e. network might be supporting both WPA and WPA2 security thus enabling WPA-2 Only mode on the phone will cause your connection
 attempts to fail)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; Go to "EAP plug-in configuration"</p>
<p>- Enable "EAP-PEAP" and make sure that "EAP-SIM" and "EAP-AKA" are disabled (via Options -&gt; Disable)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; Select "Configure" for EAP-PEAP authentication method</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Leave "Personal Certificate" to "Not defined"</p>
<p>- Select "Thawte Premium Server CA" as an "Authority certificate"</p>
<p>- Set "User name in use" to "User defined" (since there is no Personal Certificate where it could be read automatically)</p>
<p>- Enter your username (NetID) to "Username" field</p>
<p>- Set "Realm in use" to "User defined" and leave following "Realm" field empty.</p>
<p>- Note that in case your username (NetID) contains the realm (i.e. format&nbsp;is&nbsp;username@realm ) then you can enter realm part of your ID to "Realm" field and enter only the username part to the "Username"
 field.<br />
- Configure "Allow PEAPv0" to Yes</p>
<p>- Configure both "Allow PEAPv1" and "Allow PEAPv2" to "No"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; Go to "EAP's" tab to configure inner authentication method for the PEAP (go right on the joystick)</p>
<p>- Enable "EAP-MSCHAPv2" authentication method and Disable all other methods</p>
<p>- Select "Edit" for the EAP-MSCHAPv2</p>
<p>- Enter you username (NetID) to "User name" field</p>
<p>- Configure "Prompt password" to No or Yes depending on whether you want password to be prompted everytime you make an connection or if you prefer "saving" your password to following "Password" field beforehand so that it won't be prompted during the PEAP/EAP-MSCHAPv2
 authentication process.</p>
<p>- If you you selected "No" to password prompting then enter your password to "Password" field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; Exit the connection method configuration with "Back" (several times) and you should be good to go and give this new PEAP-EAPMSCHAPv2 configured WLAN connection method a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If needed you can also change the priority order of the connection methods within a "Destination" since your new connection most likely ended up being lowest priority WLAN connection within your Internet destination (or whatever Destination you created this
 new PEAP WLAN connection method to).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that these instructions are an example (somewhat guess) based on the your description of the network settings. There are some uncertainties like what is the "inner" PEAP authentication method supposed to be since your description says "Auto".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically PEAP is used with EAP-MSCHAPv2 or EAP-GTC inner authentication methods so you might have to try swithing to EAP-GTC in case above mentioned EAP-MSCHAPv2 does not seem to work. Note that you might also have to try changing "PEAPv1" to "Allowed"
 especially if you select EAP-GTC as an inner authentication method for PEAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another uncertainty is related to the "Authority Certificate". Your N85 probably already contains pre-installed "Thawte Premium Server CA" certificate but it's not possible to say for sure whether this pre-installed Thawte CA root certificate is the correct
 one to be used on your particular WLAN network. Most likely it is OK but if in doubt you could try consulting your network administrators if they are able to provide you the correct Authority CA certicate in "X.509 DER" encoded binary file format so that you
 can install it on your N85 and select it from the PEAP settings instead of the preinstalled Thawte Premium CA certificate.</p>

            hi there mate,<br />
<br />
have you checked if there are any firmware updates available for your device via Nokia Suite? if there are any, please update to the latest version offered. If there isn't any, try re-installing your current firmware thru Nokia Suite and if that isn't working,
 to perform a three finger hard reset.<br />
<br />
Failing that, you will need to take your phone to your local Nokia Care point for them to inspect:

    <title>Changing what Cortana calls me - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Changing what Cortana calls me</h2>
                    <p>In order to resolve an issue with Cortana responding with 'I didn't catch that,' I cleared the app cache and data and signed back into the app. Now instead of Cortana calling me by name, it only refers to me as 'my friend.' I've accessed the notebook and
 selected about me, but instead of being able to change anything there, it just brings me right back to the main menu (notebook, devices, settings, color theme, etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my computer, this worked without any problems - I went to the notebook, then to about me, and was able to change my name. Since Cortana is on my Windows 10 PC and signed in with the same account as the one I'm logged in with on my phone in the Cortana
 app, I figured that it would sync up. That's not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technical Info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone: Moto Z Force w/ Android 7.0</p>
<p>Cortana App: 2.91.1.1888-enus-release</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearing the app cache and data led to the issue I am currently facing. I have searched for information on how to change the name that Cortana calls you, and every single resource says the same thing -- go to notebook and select about me. This does not work
 on the Cortana app on Android.</p>

<p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be due to a compatibility issue with the app and your phone. In this case, you may need to clear app cache and app data. Afterwards, please uninstall and reinstall it and check if the issue still persists.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it works out.</p>

<p>I don't think this issue is related to compatibility with the phone. The whole issue started when i cleared the app cache and data to fix the original problem of the 'i didn't catch that' response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without having cleared the app cache and data a second time, i uninstalled it and reinstalled it. I still cannot access the notebook and change the default of 'my friend.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right before i uninstalled the app, there was an update for it. I installed the update, but it didn't fix the issue. I should point out too that I've signed up for the beta version of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something isn't working right, because I can change the name in the notebook on the PC version of Cortana, but it's not working on the Android version of the app.</p>

<p>Still looking for assistance with this issue. With each app update, i keep hoping that the issue will be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the latest app version i have (2.9.3.1913), i can get to the notebook, but there's no 'about me' section like there is on the PC. Is Cortana forever going to call me 'my friend' or will i be able to change the name at some point?</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t run, uninstall, or install BCM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg sheffield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t run, uninstall, or install BCM</h2>
                    
<p>I just got a new PC with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit preinstalled.<br />
<br />
I installed Office Pro 2007, then Business Contact Manager.<br />
<br />
BCM seemed to work OK for a few days, but when I tried to use the "auto-link email" function I got a very non-specific error message (couldn't perform the last action or something like that).<br />
<br />
Later when I tried to "manage database" or "import/export data" I got the same message, and eventually discovered that most BCM functions were failing with this error message.<br />
<br />
I tried to reinstall BCM by first uninstalling MSSQL Server then BCM. I uninstalled MSSQL fine, but when I tried to uninstall BCM I got a message that said something like "Setup Wizard Stopped Working". Neither can I run the BCM installer from DVD2 of Office
 Pro, I get the same "Setup Wizard Stopped Working" message immediately when I run setup.exe.<br />
<br />
I found a KB article that described how to manually remove BCM, which I have done and BCM no longer appears in Add/Remove programs. I still cannot run setup.exe from Disc 2.<br />
<br />
How can I get past this setup error?</p>

<p>Hello Reid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A phishing scam is an email that seems legitimate but is an attempt to get your personal information or steal your money.&nbsp;There are a lot of things that we can do to prevent this. It would be a great help if you take your time reading these articles:</p>

</p><p>If you're using Outlook app, you may block a sender by right-clicking a message from the sender, and then click
<strong>Junk </strong>&gt; Click <strong>Block Sender</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, you want to block the specific domain, you may add unwanted names to the<strong> Blocked Senders List</strong>.&nbsp;Messages from addresses or domain names in the Blocked Senders List are always treated as junk. Outlook moves any detected
 incoming message from senders in the Blocked Senders List to the Junk E-mail folder, regardless of the content of the message. For further instructions, you may check this article:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Antoneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me be more clear. I don't want to block a sender because the domain always changes (<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). Outlook will only let me block a domain using @domainname.com
 and what I need to block is at @anything.sharedentco.com because the @anything always changes but the .sharedentco.com does not. I'm looking for a way to block just .sharedentco.com but you folks say that is an invalid domain name. I am blocking *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 every day, many times and honestly, I wish you folks would just see it, figure it out and not allow any email from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** into anyone's inbox.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I know what phishing emails are and how to block individual people. You folks need your domain blocking tools to be more powerful to us, the end user.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reid</span></p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for clarifying, Reid. I totally understand that it's not easy to block emails since the domain name is always changing. In fact, spammers use this as their new technique so that their emails will surely reach your inbox eventhough you're blocking
 it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since you've mentioned that the only thing that does not change .sharedentco.com, you can create an email rule. This rule will automatically delete emails with .sharedentco.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so, please follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>For Outlook.com (Beta)</strong></span></p>

<p>Hi Antoneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .sharedentco emails just won't stop coming. Below are my two rules. Also, I would like to suggest a one click "block" button. It would be helpful as I try to block other domains and senders. I am not sure what site I went to a few weeks ago when all
 this happened but I see that sharedentco.com is a phishing site. Can't you folks just block the domain? Thank you for the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reid</p>
<p>
</p><p>My two rules and an example email address:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<p>It would be marvelous if these rules actually worked. But the problem is, they don't. I have tried all the above, still getting spammed. Also blocked the header "this message is from a trusted sender" and that doesn't work either. Curse the day I got involved
 using Hotmail.</p>

            To be fair the messages mostly got sent to junk. But I was getting around fifty a day mixed with legitimate messages in the junk folder. I tried various combinations in the senders address box including your suggestion. And instructing deletion. Strangely
 the filters seemed to work for a few days. Then the problem would slowly build itself back up. I would need to reset everything and start from scratch. I was also using strict safe sender features too. Thanks for the reply. But I have just set up a new Outlook
 address. I may keep the old Hotmail (problem one) just to experiment with. Fingers crossed they don't get my new details. Thanks again - Keith.

</p><p>Yes, Outlook is sending them to junk but they are not getting deleted. The rules seem to not work. I now have three that include</p>

<p>sharedentco.com and</p>
<p>.sharedentco.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just added the last one but the first two should have worked for Rules and blocking domains. I agree with Keith. They're just not working!</p>

<p>You must visit Nokia Care to get the code reset. The Nokia Software Recovery Tool will only reset the phone, not the Security Code.</p>

            <p>Because Nokia Software Recovery Tool does not support the Nokia-Dead-USB-Mode for neither Symbian or a Nokia Series 40 phone, you cannot bypass&nbsp;a&nbsp;screen/keylock which is protected&nbsp;by the security code. However, if the phone does not give that lock-screen
 – is booting up and your able to select the USB mode on the phone – then you are able to apply the Nokia Software Recovery Tool – which resets the security code back to its initial state (no value set or 12345).</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way: In Nokia Series 40, after entering a wrong code five times in a row, the phone does not accept any additional codes (even the correct code) for 24 hours. There is no visual indication of that blocking.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />If you think that those emails you are receiving are scam, phishing or spoofing or you do not trust the veracity of those emails, please do not open or reply to those emails, to avoid any attack on your computer and steal your credentials, I would recommend block that email address. Below is a link to the steps of how to block an email address:

    <title>Honest opinions about E6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gogogo_none  say:</h3>
<h2>            Honest opinions about E6</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, I've bought this phone regardless of those bad things that has been mentioned in those threads, because I want it and it relatively cheap anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My E6 is almost bug free, yes almost. How I do that?</p>
<p>1. After unboxing, I update the firmware to v22.</p>
<p>2. Quickly do "Delete Data and Restore"﻿.</p>
<p>3. Installing Remind Me.</p>
<p>4. Done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not experienced the self restart, the disfunctional pick call after screen lock, etc. My battery also lasted more than one day, it is almost 1.5 day now with 2 bar left in heavy usage (wifi, bluetooth, angry birds, fruit ninja, messaging, some calls).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what bugs left?</p>
<p>1. The keypad lights is turned off when the display brightnes is less than the mid point of the slider.</p>
<p>2. The notification lights in the middle of dpad is still barely visible even when I use the Remind Me, faulty design in my opinion.</p>
<p>3. The mail widget sometimes did not update the mails that displayed, even though the mail client is already showing the new mails. I need to remove then add the widget again to fix it or restart the phone..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that was all I can remember about this 4 days old phone. Hope it helps you or you can start flaming about this phone, I dont care.</p>

<p>Same here.</p>
<p>Have my E6 for a couple of weeks now.</p>
<p>Battery life is OK as I am a "moderate" user (1 to 2&nbsp;hr/day phone, some texting, les than 1 hr/day&nbsp;internetaccess of WIFI, no gaming, some mail-sync). Actual example : now 3 days without recharging and 3 bars left.</p>
<p>WIFI detection is very good.</p>
<p>The only real annoyance is the "dysfunctional call key when screen and keys locked".</p>
<p>The notification&nbsp;light issue&nbsp;doesn't bother me, but the vibration function might have been a little bit more powerful and the touchscreen seems sometimes to be a bit 'oversensitive' (A matter of getting used to it).</p>
<p>Some options are well hidden away deep in the menu(s), but as long-time Nokia user, I'm used to this.</p>
<p>So I would say : very good mobile for medium business use.</p>

<p>I own the E6 now for almost 3 months.</p>
<p>I totally agree with posts above. I'm getting 3 to 5 days standby of time and if I'm careful I can get a week!</p>
<p>On 2 nights the battery drained in less than 12h (probably the WiFi that didn't disconnect). The Wifi is using more power than the WIFI of my old E51 (I could leave wifi on for days so that a pity)</p>
<p>I'm not saying that this device couldn't be improved but with some tweaking it a pretty decent smartphone (especially typing is a delight).</p>

<br />
E6 always freeze when connected to my home Wifi, at first it doesnt, but now, almost everytime. I must turn off the phone or turn down the wifi to make e6 responding again.<br />

<p>Awesome design; but has problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biggest problem: random reboots during travel. Other than that, at home it is NOKIA durable! (never crashes etc)</p>
<p>Reboots happen with or without the gps in use; seems to have something to do with email; perhaps more specifically mail for exchange trying to update app on main home page. VERY IRRITATING. I even exchanged for another brand new one (thanks amazon!) and
 same exact prob.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, stupid bug that if you try to follow the first phone setup wizard and dont answer questions exacty the way it wants you will get error message everytime phone has to restart saying 'phone wizard doesnt exist' or something similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music player is **bleep** like the ipod; no folder management; only id tag (ver 3??) only. total inefficient **bleep**.</p>
<p>But it is one of the best music players on any mobile device. I have 11 nokia devices, starting with n810 to e6 and e7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e6 is my everyday do it all fast and efficient device. NOTHING can come close. It is a phone first, not a game p.o.s. and has nearly perfect amount of real buttons to command instant power for real smartphone intelligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minor other bugs/thoughtlessness buried; none that I can remember at this particular moment. Bluetooth rarely has any issue, unlike n97 series (which i have 3) &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camera SUCKS. I wish I had the n97mini camera on this phone so I can stop carrying my cool ol' n97mini</p>
<p>around. Why does Nokia go backwards? Why yes of course they are following microsoft! hahahhaha</p>
<p>A new leader must lead not follow, dear Elop.</p>

<p>when you said you installed "remind me", i guess you meant its a software. What is its purpose?<br />
and secondly could you help me with this one thing.. what if i do a system restore and format my phone's mass memory or even format the phone memory. Will i still have the softwares that i had when i bought the phone like the shazam, social, joikuspot, etc.
 I know we can get some softwares off the net but then i would need to pay to get their premium versions and since i already have them i dont want to lose it. So please tell me about this. I would be grateful for your help.<br />

<p>Well i've had my E6 since the middle of july, And to start with i was pretty underwhelmed, And slightly disappointed with the overall package. It's still not a patch on my trusty E63, But it does have a few things going for it that the E63 can not touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Good (+)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent GPS (Very accurate and quick to find a signal).</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Touch screen is an added bonus, Makes the user experience and access much quicker and more enjoyable.</li><li>The home screen/s, A huge amount of shorcut possibilities are available (Only 6 on the E63).</li><li>Photo viewer/gallery is much more usable and responsive.</li><li>Volume controls can be used when phone is locked.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bad (-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Music player is total pants.</li><li>Too many incompatabilities with current apps.</li><li>Notification light (as mentioned all over the forums) is totally useless, And having to pay for or use a third party app to get the functionallity that is meant to be a standard feature is frankly outrageous, And should have been picked-up and corrected
 at the development stage.</li><li>Battery life is pretty **bleep** (3 days normal usage) compared to the E63 (A week normal useage), But still better than most Android phones.</li><li>More quirks, Bugs and lock-ups than the E63, Had to power cycle it more than the E63.</li><li>Camera (EDOF), Need i say more. Passable for general shots, But total **bleep** for anything close-up or fine detail, Which is sadly not good enough for an 8 Megapixel camera.</li><li>Headphone socket is pretty pants, The backwards slope (~-20º)&nbsp;of the top of the phone, If viewed from the side does not allow the 3.5mm plug to sit flush with the top of the phones body, Thus allows quite a bit of play between the two parts, And causes
 the headphones to cut-out quite frequently if the phone is stored in a pocket (for example) and pressure is applied to the side of the jack plug (bloody irritating), The E63 gladly does not suffer from this.</li><li>Oh, And it's definitely not worth the nearly £300 i paid for it, Twice the amount that i paid for the E63 two and a half years ago.</li></ul>
<p>Possibly more to come.</p>

<p>Remind Me is an OVI store application that allow you to modify the light source(s) of the notification that the phone generate, to put it simple, it allows you on what lamp you want to be notified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I "delete and restore" my phone, all of the built in apps is still there, but not the built in wallpapers, or any other "not so important" stuffs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, the F-Secure is 90 days trial, so you still need to pay the license.</p>

<p>Here is my honest opinion;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought my E6 about a month ago, my previous phones were Nokia N70. Nokia E90. Nokia N900 (still own) and now the Nokia E6. I must admit that at first I was very disappointed with the performance of the E6. The notification light, the email app and the
 firmware seemed be laggy and it was the latest. I decided to reinstall the firmware via the ovi suite and now the phone works the way it should have in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few suggestions for Nokia though on how to improve this phone and really make the user experience better:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The drop down box in the email app that displays all the email accounts associated should indicate&nbsp; new emails. When I get an email alert I have to go through all 5 accounts to see which account has the new email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The vibration could be a lot stronger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Notification light could be a lot brighter(not sure if this can be addressed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Ovi social app is very laggy, maybe it can be modified so as not to require so much of the hardware resources (CPU, RAM) of the phone therefore allowing for smoother multi-tasking</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ovi Sync does not work, it gives an error "unable to activate service, try again later"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- E-mail notifications should be displayed in the notification widget on the home screens, not just SMS and missed calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Push notifications for facebook and twitter via the Ovi Social app would be a very welcomed addition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this was helpful.</p>

<h2>            Custom contact lists gone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just two days ago I was happily using the previous Skype version (the one with the blue interface). Yesterday though I ran it and was surprised to be facing a new version.&nbsp;I must say, I don't like the new interface. Neither I like the fact that Skype updated
 itself automatically without warning.</p>
<p>But putting that aside, the biggest thing I'm missing in the new interface is the custom contact lists. I used to sort my contacts by adding them to relevant set of lists ("Work", "University", "Family", etc.). Is this filtering gone now? Having hundreds
 of contacts how am I supposed to remember where do I know that person from? I'd really like to have this feature back.</p>

            Since the new version is half baked, can you at least provide a workaround to allow installing the "non-app" version? Whenever I try, it forces me to download Skype from the Microsoft store...

Amen, brother!!&nbsp; I can't believe they did this.&nbsp; I'm on a Windows machine, Win 7, and it seems to be the same story.&nbsp; I will try to revert to the previous version.&nbsp; And it was hard enough to adapt to the new version when it updated just as I was logging into
 a conference call.&nbsp; Would have been better to have a dialog window asking if I wanted to wait for an update, and advising that the new version would not have contact subgroups.

<h2>            excel chart -  align primary and secondary axes scales</h2>
                    <p>hey again guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>how to make correct lhs and rhs on chart if I have two different numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have </p>
<p>name A with rhs= 4%, lhs=9.5</p>
<p>name B with rhs= -5.2%, lhs= -16</p>
<p>name C with rhs= 8%, lhs= 3.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>the chart is bar chart and I want that my lhs overlap rhs, so that rhs will be thicker bar and lhs thinner bar. (lhs is in rhs)</p>
<p>
</p><p>the both side should start with 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I try I never get both side on a right scale. and chart looks ugly.</p>

            <p>Yes, it can be done. It's a little more involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need a stacked column chart and stack padding values below and on top of both the rhs and the lhs. The goal is to position the 0 in the middle of the axis. To do that, we will inspect the biggest number in the data set and make sure that that number
 is present both on the positive as on the negative side of the chart. That needs to be done with both axes. Look at this screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2908cf55-38cf-4b86-82e8-37d83c43fa54" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest value for rhs is 12%. It is plotted for category C. We need to make sure that the minus side of the chart also contains a negative number with that value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bigest value for lhs is -16 (we are looking at the absolute value only) in category B. So we need to make sure that we have a data point with that value on the positive side of the chart, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data source now contains a few more columns and the chart is a stacked column chart. Here are the formulas:</p>
<p>
</p><p>B2 (rhsmin)&nbsp;=IF(C2&lt;=0,-MAX(ABS(MIN($C$2:$C$4)),ABS(MAX($C$2:$C$4)))-C2,-MAX(ABS(MIN($C$2:$C$4)),ABS(MAX($C$2:$C$4))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>D2 (rhsmax)&nbsp;=IF(C2&gt;0,MAX(ABS(MIN($C$2:$C$4)),ABS(MAX($C$2:$C$4)))-C2,MAX(ABS(MIN($C$2:$C$4)),ABS(MAX($C$2:$C$4))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>E2 (lhsmin)&nbsp;=IF(F2&lt;=0,-MAX(ABS(MIN($F$2:$F$4)),ABS(MAX($F$2:$F$4)))-F2,-MAX(ABS(MIN($F$2:$F$4)),ABS(MAX($F$2:$F$4))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>G2 (lhsmax)&nbsp;=IF(F2&gt;0,MAX(ABS(MIN($F$2:$F$4)),ABS(MAX($F$2:$F$4)))-F2,MAX(ABS(MIN($F$2:$F$4)),ABS(MAX($F$2:$F$4))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need to copy the formulas down. The values only need to be stacked on the first data series.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Select A1 to G4 and create a stacked column chart. Send lhsmin, lhs and lhs max to the secondary axis. This should now look like the screenshot above. You can now format rhsmin, rhsmax, lhsmin and lhsmax to have no fill, and adjust the gap width of the visible
 columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you get on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can not open Excel files on my WINDOWS 10 phones</h2>
                    <p>My excel documents which I hold on OneDrive and phone SD card&nbsp;can not be opened on my Lumia 950XL or HTC&nbsp;ONE M8&nbsp;Windows, both on 586.36.</p>
<p>My own passworded&nbsp;file lets me enter the password but then tells me:</p>
<p>" This version of Microsoft Excel can't open workbooks with: Workbook sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other is my work schedule not created by me, is open to read but passworded for editing tells me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;" This version of Microsoft Excel can't open workbooks with: Password to modify</p>
<p>It don't think it is the version of the phone software as previous WIN 10 were the same.</p>
<p>I also have an Android HTC ONE M8 using Polaris Office and have no problems with these files.</p>
<p>I don't need an OFFICE 365 subscription to view, ,create or edit&nbsp;as this is free, according to the app info, only for advanced features is it needed. It's the larger devices and after March 2016 with Continuum that need Office 365 subs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            I agree I only require to view excel file on my phone, i have full office 2016 on my laptop and desktop already so do not want or need office 365. Seems daft that windows 8.1 phone version would open password to modify files but windows 10 preview does
 not at least allow it to be viewed. Ultimately it will be this short sightedness that will have me reverting back to my windows 8.1 phone. Microsoft please at least allow the same viewing ability as the previous version

            <p>Thank you for the feedback here and for bubbling this thread back up to the top.&nbsp; I just wanted to confirm things here so we can investigate the issue in a bit more detail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Your workbook is a shared workbook</p>
<p>- Your shared workbook couldn't be opened until they were upgraded to 2016.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean your workbook was an XLS file before or was it still an XLSX at that time?&nbsp; Also, if possible, can you confirm what version of Excel Mobile you are currently using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reporting the issue and for your help here.&nbsp; It is very much appreciated!</p>
<p>

    <title>Disappearing Header and Footer, unrelated to white space display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesseorsyang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disappearing Header and Footer, unrelated to white space display</h2>
                    I am trying to create documents with consistent headers and footers. &nbsp;In most cases, this is not a problem. &nbsp;However, in one particular file, whatever was in the header and the footer just keeps disappearing. &nbsp;After saving the file WITH the header and
 footer, they would sometimes disappear upon re-opening the file. &nbsp;Everything would be moved up by the space the header would have taken. &nbsp;The worst part is that this is inconsistent; the header and footer disappear only some of the time upon re-opening.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried to find an answer to my problem on this site, but all responses seem to deal with hiding/revealing white space. &nbsp;My problem is NOT related to this, since even printing the document after the header's disappearing act does not reveal it again.
 &nbsp;I need help to prevent this from happening my other documents.</div>

            I have already renamed the document, saved the file under a different name, copied the entire contents into a new document, and created the document from scratch. &nbsp;None of those worked. &nbsp;The document would seem okay for a while, but after a few times opening
 and closing the file, the header and footer would disappear. &nbsp;So far, the only thing that has worked has been saving on a different hard drive and/or turning the document into a read-only file. &nbsp;Neither is optimal as I will need to work on the document directly,
 and constantly downloading or changing the properties is not the best method.
<div><br />
<div>I will try troubleshooting using the link you gave. &nbsp;However, it directs me to use templates, which I have never before touched, and have never had problems. &nbsp;I will have to get back to you on that.</div>

            If you are copying everything from one file to a blank document, try using Select All (Ctrl+A) in the first document, Copy it (Ctrl+C), Open the blank document, and Paste (Ctrl+V). &nbsp;That should copy everything, including the headers and footers. &nbsp;I've
 done this before on my forms, since I need consistent headers and footers. &nbsp;That's one of the reason I needed to post this question in the first place.

Created the document from scratch and getting the same result makes no sense to me. Did you copy anything from the old document? If you did use anything from the old document, try, instead, saving the document as a plain text file - or copying to notepad. Then
 from notepad copy into a new document. Put in your section breaks and reproduce the document.<br />

 I tried to get rid of the dialog box it goes to the program not responding dialog box and I end up having to kill the program.&nbsp; I was then left with a black screen.&nbsp; I then pressed Ctrl + Alt + Dlt and I am able to get up the task manager from there I can
 start the command prompt that installed something before running, started the control panel and went to manage my user profile but got the dialog box Class not registered,&nbsp;started iexplorer but had no network so went to sort out network but again got Class

            <p>Thank you for all your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was the user profile that was causing the problem, I was a bit surprised it did seem worse with the class's not registered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I activated the guest account, used this to create a local administrator account (net work card not working at this time), used the new admin account to remove the initial user account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back the driver for the Ethernet port to get it working and internet access, then reinstalled initial user account.&nbsp; and got rid of other account and deactivated guest account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the issue was the way I had connected my SD card to the compressed drive SD card.&nbsp; In order to move my document locations and drop box to he SD card leaving the internal card just for system files I connected it as a subdirectory of the C drive
 and gave it its own drive letter.&nbsp; when I installed windows 10 it lost visibility of the document folders witch I believe corrupted the user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sorted out the WIF driver by downloading it again from the ASUS site and I am up and ruing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other issues but the will be on a different post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks, a bit of flying by the set of my pants</p>

<h2>            Onedrive with Office 365 not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got Office 365 for business. Installed the app's but I can't get OneDrive to work. I do have a folder called "OneDrive - Personal". Why personal? I 've got 365 for business? When I click on the folder it asks for the microsoft account. I use my username
 ("*** Email address is removed for privacy ***") and he asks me to give my password. And then I get a error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i go to office.com and click on the OneDrive button it sends me to "Delve". I've got no options (as far as I can see) to store files or something. What am I doing wrong?? Thanks for your help :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printscreen of error:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Creating a new group from a large number of &#40;new&#41; contacts</h2>
                    <p>I just imported about 1,500 contacts into my Contacts list and I want to make a new group of them.&nbsp; My list of Contacts is already big, so to make them easy to find I added text to "User 3."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try to add members to the group, I can't see my User 3 text and there doesn't seem to be a way to see more columns.&nbsp; When I choose "From Outlook Contacts," I only see Name, Display Name and Email columns.&nbsp; Isn't there a way to show more columns?</p>

<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your details. But it isn't feasible to add more columns when you add contacts to contact group. As a workaround, you can create a folder, then move your contacts to this folder, When you add contacts to contact group, you can choose the folder
 from your address book list. Then you can easily add contacts to your contact folder. To move contacts, you can hold the Ctrl key to choose multiple contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>
        </p>

<br />Isn't there a way to show more columns?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Short answer no:
<br />
<br />One way to deal with it would be to
<br />1 - create a new contact folder
<br />2 - open the folder where your current contacts reside
<br />3 - create a custom view to sort your contacts by the User3 field
<br />4 - copy the contacts you want to the newly created folder 
<br />5 - set the new contact folder to a be a member of the AddressBook - right-click on the folder --&gt; properties --&gt; click on Outlook AddressBook tab --&gt; check the box for "Show this folder as an email address book"
<br />6 - create your contact group using the contacts from the newly created folder
<br />
<br />Having said all of the above, if these are going to be large contact groups, you may want to consider adding categories to the contacts and using mail-merge as an alternative which would be the recommended approach.
