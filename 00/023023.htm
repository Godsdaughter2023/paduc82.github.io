<h2>            Winword.EXE - Bad Image Error Status 0xc00000d</h2>
                    Hello there!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to open the Office 2013 word application on my windows 8.1 rt system and it does not work it only gives me the error code from above. I do not have any add-ins or installed something weird. All the other applications (Excel,...) are working just
 fine and I have no clue why word does not work anymore. I tried to open it in safe mode, but that does not work either. I bought this tablet so that I can use it for school, but without word I am screwed.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for any help!</div>

            I think I fixed it through uninstalling the last Office updates for word (01/16/2014). That is not my favorite way of solving this, so if anyone has a better idea, I will wait for it!

            After you become insider on Lumia 535, the phone runs on Windows 10 Creators Update i.e version 1703 which is unsupported on Lumia 535. You should roll back to supported version i.e Windows 10 Anniversary Update by using Windows Device Recovery Tool.

    <title>Can&#39;t Delete an Appointment &#47; Event - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete an Appointment &#47; Event</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was modifying Outlook to fix a problem synching calendars with other devices (laptops and iphones).&nbsp; I got that all fixed - works great, but in the process I created some Appointments and Events that I would now like to Delete but can't.&nbsp; They seem to
 be locked.&nbsp; Outlook does nothing when I try to Delete the Appointment using normal methods.&nbsp; When I try to Edit the Appointment, I receive a pop-up window titled "Microsoft Outlook" that says "The item cannot be saved to this folder, the folder was moved or
 deleted...…"&nbsp; There are a couple of Yes and No buttons at the bottom of the window, but neither seems to result in deleting the items I want to delete. Everything else seems to be working fine, I just need to delete some extraneous appointments/events I created
 when setting up the synching.&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi MarkSBennett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to have a better understanding of your concern, we’d like to know more details about your issue. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When had the issue first occurred?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes before you encounter the issue?</li><li>Are you trying to access your own calendar or you are referring to a shared calendar where you enter the appointment/events?</li><li>Are you trying to access the calendar using the Outlook desktop app, Outlook.com or an email client app?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to access the Outlook desktop app to delete the appointments/events and getting an error, we would suggest that you try accessing it through Outlook.com. This will also let us isolate the issue if the same behavior occurs. You can also
 send us a screenshot of what you actually get when trying to delete the appointments/events for us to get a better view on your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the info you requested:</p>
<p>The problem started after I was traveling and my desktop computer was shut off for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; When I returned, I noticed the Outlook calendar on my desktop computer (Dell Inspiron/Windows 10)&nbsp; wasn't synching correctly with my laptop (HP/Windows
 10), my iPad, or iPhone.&nbsp; In diagnosing the problem, I created several phony events and appointments on all devices to see if they synched to all other devices.&nbsp; It turns out, the problem appeared to be an iCloud related add-in on my desktop that had failed
 to load during my absence when the machine was shutoff.&nbsp; Once I reloaded/re-enabled that add-in (not sure exactly what it was) everything works fine just as it did before shutting down my desktop for my travel.&nbsp; However, when I went back to delete some of
 those phony events/appointments, I could do that on all devices except on my desktop where I couldn't delete them because of the error noted in my original post.&nbsp; I am using Office/Outlook 365 and share my calendar across devices, but not with any one else.
 I tried the web app, but I couldn't get the calendar in question loaded into the app.&nbsp; The calendar that all the other devices use is fine, it's just the one on my desktop that has the phony events/appointments that can't be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

 personal or a company email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can try to create a sample Outlook profile to see if the same issue occurs. See this
 Create a new profile. Let us know if the events/appointments still appears on it and if deleting those items still prompt you an error.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your help with this.&nbsp; I tried creating a temporary profile in Outlook using the same data file and was able to delete the offending events.&nbsp; However, when I went back to my original profile using the same data file, the events were still there.&nbsp;
 I have uploaded a screen shot with the events I am trying to delete circled in red.&nbsp; Any thoughts you have will be helpful.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for isolating the issue by means of creating a temporary profile&nbsp;<span>using the same data file. Since you were able to delete the appointment in the temporary profile, possibilities that the old profile is corrupted.
 I highly suggest configuring your new Outlook profile as the default one. Here are the steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open the <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click
<strong>Mail</strong>.</span></li><li><span>You'll see the <strong>Mail Setup- Outlook
</strong>window, select <strong>Show Profiles</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, choose
<strong>Always use this profile</strong>.</span></li><li>Click the drop-down under <strong>Always use this profile</strong>, select the new profile.</li><li><span>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once done,&nbsp;</span><span>use the
<strong>Import</strong> and <strong>Export</strong> wizard to export your email messages to an Outlook Data File (.pst) from the old Outlook email profile. Then import the Outlook Data File (.pst) to your new Outlook email profile. These are the articles that
 can help you with importing and exporting your Outlook data files.</span></p>

            Thanks for helping me along with this.&nbsp; Even though I created a temporary profile, I don't really have any experience creating a profile for real.&nbsp; As was shown the screenshot I provided, I have multiple accounts and my calendar is linked to all accounts
 so no mater what system (MS or IOS) or device (Desktop, iPad, iPhone, laptop) creates, modifies or deletes an event, it shows up on all other devices.&nbsp; That was kind of hard to set up (needed some help) and I don't want to break those links by incorrectly
 creating a new profile.&nbsp; Big question: Do I need to export all accounts (I have both IMAP and POP) and then import them all back into the new profile?&nbsp; Any other advice you can provide will be helpful.&nbsp; Maybe a MS Technote on this process?&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>Thanks for standing by Mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old Outlook profile might be corrupted since you found out that after creating the new Outlook profile you were able to delete the appointments/events that you cannot remove on the old one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree to what <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5dc288a9-c32e-4943-be3c-f7cd0ca5f344">
Princess Mat</a> suggested where you need to perform import and exporting the Outlook data file from old to new. Take note that this process should be applied to all of the email accounts that you have on your old Outlook profile.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendar Name</h2>

</p><p>I have two calendar accounts - one with office 365 (i.e. work)&nbsp; and one with icloud&nbsp; (i.e personal) .&nbsp; Both are open in outlook and display fine either merged or as separate panels.&nbsp; However they both a have a generic title or label of Calendar which means
 I occasionally have to look the properties to see where the data is being pulled from.

<p>

            Do you mean OneNote (not OneDrive)?
<br />
<br />Yes, you definitely have to use OneNote from Office NOT the "new &amp; improved" one from Windows. 
<br />
<br />I still have the copy text option in my OneNote 2016. Try with a different picture, a JPG. I'm wondering if the problem is the file type of the image file you are using.
<br />
<br />Also in OneNote, go into File menu &gt; Account command. Next to "About", there is a Version and Build number. Tell us what they are.

<p>Hi, yes it is on Onenote. I was referring to being on office and not office365, a person can see that when they go into Onedrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it might be the file type because I checked now and its a PNG file, so can that be a reason why I cant copy the text from the image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see now though my Onenote is actually an April 2018 update, Version 17.9226.20641.0 (<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Build
 9126.2152)</span> and Not 2016. So I think the "new and improved" is also messing me around if I understand that correctly.</p>

            OneNote in Office 2015 or 2016 and Office 365 are essentially the same
<br />OneNote that comes with Windows 10 is "feature deficient" (dumber). 
<br />
<br />No, PNG does not appear to be the issue. I was able to copy text from a PNG in OneNote 2016
<br />
<br />" Version 17.9226.20641.0 " is the Windows 10 version NOT the Office version.  MS didn't bother moving all of the features in OneNote 2016 to the windows version  (very frustrating).
<br />
<br />You MUST use the OneNote associated with your Office license if you want to copy text from images (do "OCR").

            So basically the OneNote that comes out on the windows 10 is not able to do OCR. Therefor that's why I am not able to copy text from an image?

<h2>            Blank Emails in Outlook 2010 but message shows on Blackberry&#47;Webmail</h2>
                    A number emails I have received are appearing with a blank email body on Outlook 2010. &nbsp;When I check my email using Webmail or with my Blackberry, I can see the complete message, but it does not appear on Outlook. &nbsp;I know there are a lot of other users
 having this issue, and I have searched for hours on the internet trying every suggestion I could find, but none of them have worked. &nbsp;Here's what I have tried so far:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Changed font in "stationery &amp; fonts" --&gt; composing and reading plain text messages --&gt; from "Automatic" to black.</li><li>Completely removed Antivirus (both with Windows - remove program and with McAfee tool to remove virus software)</li><li>Started Outlook in safe mode - message still appears blank (even when I re-send from webmail)</li><li>Did a "clean re-boot", message still appears blank (even when I re-send from Webmail)</li><li>Archived messages over 1 year old, still appears blank</li><li>added "SaveAllMIMENotJustHeader" to regedit</li><li>Created new Outlook profile - message still appears blank</li></ul>
<div>This has happened in the past with at least 2 different senders. &nbsp;I have re-sent myself the email using webmail (moving to another folder, then back to inbox, thne hitting "send &amp; receive" again) and every time the message still appears blank, even though
 I can see the full message using webmail. &nbsp;I can't figure out what the problem is. &nbsp;Can anyone help me?!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

                    Im trying to install MS office 2013 Pro plus on a 32bit computer, it currently has 2010 installed, but whenever I try to go through the installation at the very end of it I get an error microsoft office pro plus 2013 encountered an error during setup"<br />
I have tried most if not all solutions I found online- deleting the Microsoft help folder, the file in it, the MS fix it program, task scheduler- enabling service and making sure its not corrupt... I cant seem to be able to fix this.<br />
I cannot uninstall MS office 2010 first as I dont want to take the chance of Office 13 not working, and me not having Office.<br />
<br />
This is the Log file I get, please download it- sorry I cant simply upload text to pastebin... but its about 60,000 Lines :S<br />

<p>
</p><p>Short answer: No. Adding 6 accounts really doesn't take that long and at least everything will be configured correctly by the version of Outlook you're using on your machine.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 8&#58; When home page is set to local file, clicking Favorites link opens in new tab.</h2>
                    I set my home page to a local file.&nbsp; Whenever I open the browser and click any link under Favorites, the link opens in a new tab, rather than the same tab.&nbsp; This is inconvenient for me, since I don't usually need an extra tab that shows the local file
 (it's a portal with a few links that are occasionally used).&nbsp; How can I get the Favorites link to open in the same tab?

    <title>PowerPoint found a problem with content - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> senatorjo  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint found a problem with content</h2>
                    <p>I received this error and clicked "Repair." PPT repairs the file then gives me this message. "PowerPoint removed unreadable content in [File Name]. You should review this presentation to determine whether any content was unexpectedly changed or removed."
 Upon review, some content was removed. On one slide an Excel chart that I had pasted as "Keep Source Formatting and Embed Workbook" was missing. In fact, the whole slide was replaced by the Slide Master title page template. I have pasted many other charts
 in this presentation in the same way, but this one is causing trouble. If I paste it as a "Picture" it&nbsp;works just fine. I'd prefer not to do that.</p>
<p>

            Most likely the issue is with the Excel file. It sounds like it may be corrupt, and this is creating the error message. You could try saving a copy of it back to
<strong>Excel 97-2003 Workbook (*.xls)</strong> format, then save forward again. If that doesn't fix it, you may have to re-create the chart in a fresh workbook.

<p>So does it still show in the list of installed software when you look in Remove Programs?&nbsp; What happened when you did remove it?&nbsp; I'm assuming you just did not delete it but rather used the Remove Programs option found under Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can perform a Hard Reset which will bring your device back to the way it was the day you walked out of the store with it.</p>

            Dear Jo-Jumble,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products. I am a user like you.
<br />
<br />If you have not accessed your account in the last 365 days, all emails may have been deleted due to inactivity.
<br />
<br />If you have accessed your account and you remember title of the emails that are missing or email address or even domain, try use search. In this article you will find all the suggestions and tips how to search for specific email <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search-mail-and-people-in-outlook-com-88108edf-028e-4306-b87e-7400bbb40aa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search...</a>
<br />
<br />If you will find those emails, you will see in which folder they are. Also, please check all the folders manually, especially archive and deleted items <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/working-with-message-folders-in-outlook-com-6bb0723a-f39f-4a8d-bb3f-fab5dcc2510a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/workin...</a>
<br />
<br />if you will find them in deleted items you can try to restore emails using suggestions in this support article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-email-messages-in-outlook-com-cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restor...</a>
<br />
<br />In order to retrieve the emails that were deleted more than 30 days you can use Email Recovery App <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380447?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/o...</a> First insert the Microsoft Account from which you want to retrieve emails (These instructions better to perform on PC in browser)
<br />For the new Outlook.com
<br />1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />2. Click the gear icon at the upper right side of the screens then click view full setting.
<br />3. Select Mail &amp;gt; Customize actions, then click “Get Add-ins” and hit save. 
<br />4. In “Inbox” folder, click an email (if you don’t have an email, please try to send a test email to your own email account, then once you received the test email, please click on it.)
<br />5. Click the “Gift” icon (Get Add-ins)
<br />6. Type and enter “Email Recovery” (without quote symbol)
<br />7. In the search result, under the “Email Recovery”, click “Add” button.
<br />8. Click “X” icon to exit.
<br />9. Go back to “Customize actions” page, click “Email Recovery” and hit save.
<br />10. Again, in “Inbox” folder, click an email, then the “Email Recovery” icon will be visible now, and click on it.
<br />11. Recover both Recoverable Items and Purges.
<br />12. Please do not do anything while the recovery is in progress.
<br />13. Once it’s finished, a folder will appear on the left pane which contains the emails that you recovered.
<br />
<br />Please note that there is no guarantee that those emails will be restored as it depends on server status and what happened to the storage space where they were stored.
<br />
<br />I hope these helped to recover your emails you’re looking for.

            I'd suggest to unlink and link again your computer from your your OneDrive account
<br />
<br />Go to the cloud icon  on the bottom right of your desktop, . 
<br />On the cloud icon, click the three dots, then Settings&gt; Account tab choose Unlink this PC and then Unlink Account. 
<br />
<br />Then sign back in on the app.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
For us to better assist you, we need to identify first as to why you can't send emails using your account. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your Yahoo account set up as an IMAP account in your Outlook app?</li><li>Were you able to send emails online through Outlook.com?</li><li>Can you tell us what Office version do you own?</li></ul>

<p>1. No. I send email from Yahoo! Japan website to Outlook.com directly. I am not using any app or email client.</p>
<p>2. The Outlook.com account is OK. It can send email to Gmail or others.</p>
<p>3. I am not using Outlook.</p>
<p>As they said, they have blocked your network. I guess they refuse to&nbsp; send emails to Outlook.com. Yahoo! Japan is a famous website in Japan. I think it's much better that you contact them. They will hear you.</p>

    <title>Outlook Mail Issue, Can&#39;t Send Email... HELP&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikren6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Mail Issue, Can&#39;t Send Email... HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Here is the issue, and I will explain it for the 8th time and after phone calls. chats, and emails, and checking online support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed up for Outlook Mail, the free online version, under *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, this was about 5-6 weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This account had a 50/day email limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After talking with support they had me sign up for AD-FREE Outlook so I could send 5,000 emails/day and I only do this once a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked fine, and then about 5-7 days ago I selected to upgrade Outlook when they sent a notice about opting in for a new experience and quicker and more functional Outlook, which was a mistake to do, as I'm not too happy about the format and looks
 of it, but I can work with it. After the upgrade (Preview) appeared in the banner after Outlook Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my email limit is now 300/day which is not good, as I need to get 5,000 emails sent once each week and can't do this over 17 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom Line, I went from 50/day to a paid service (AD FREE) which allowed 5,000/day, I upgrade the account to be kicked down to 300/day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I get rid of the "Preview" and revert back to my old Outlook Mail, or at the very least get the 5,000/day back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to send emails ASAP as I'm working on getting emails over to a mail service for more frequent emails, and this account would be 1-2 times a year.</p>

            Not true, I was sending 5,000/day once a week for 5 weeks and then, I think, after the upgrade to "Preview" I get hit with a 300 limit.

</p><p>You must be talking about MS Office outlook and not outlook.com (web based) where you posted this.&nbsp; If that is the case you need to repost this in the correct section for the version of Office you have by using the categories pull down at the top of the

            <p>Nope, it's Outlook Mail, I'm posting in the right place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got the free account, about 7 weeks ago, I could only send 50/day, then I contacted support and they said to upgrade to Ad-Free and could send 5,000/day once a week for 5 weeks.&nbsp; I was breaking the list down to 30 different emails, but they were all
 done back to back.&nbsp; Then, I received an update notice from Outlook Mail and went ahead and upgraded Outlook, which, by the way, I don't care for the new format.&nbsp; Anyway, once I did the upgrade "(Preview)" appeared next to Outlook Mail in the banner.&nbsp; When
 I went to send to my list I discovered I could only send 300 emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing something happened with the upgrade and want to revert back to the format prior to the change to see if I can email the entire list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other option is to open more email accounts, does anyone know if you get 300/day with new accounts?&nbsp; I also heard that Gmail allows 2,000/day for free.&nbsp; When I think about it 300 is not a lot when you factor in sending and responding.&nbsp; The downside is
 no one will know the new email addresses that I will send from if I open new accounts.</p>
<p>

</p><p>In more than 150,000 posts on this site I have NEVER seen anyone able to do what you suggest and there is absolutely no way to regain that ability.&nbsp; These are the email sending limits (current)</p>

<span>

<br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The sending limit for outgoing email messages is 300 (three hundred) messages per day.</span>

<br />
<br />
<strong>If you’ve been notified that you have hit some limit on a Microsoft product, it’s almost certainly part of an effort to reduce spam.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The send mail limit depends on your reputation within Outlook.com</strong><br />

            <p>I'm not making this up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For whatever reason I could send 5,000/day, actually it started at just over 5,500. &nbsp;When I contacted support they said I would need to go Ad-Free to send maybe 2,000/day which was fine, as I could send it out over 3 days, and only wanted to send email once
 a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did do the verify method in the beginning, that you mentioned, and started sending out the emails. However, I just kept sending the emails, as I thought, Outlook would just stop me from sending, since support didn't know how many I could send, and I didn't
 know...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up sending email to everyone on my list and did it that way for the next 5 weeks, I removed the emails that were no good and keep sending each week, the list is about 4,500 now. The only problem I had in the beginning, after calling support, was
 I tried to send an email to almost 300 people on my first try and received a notice that I had to many recipients. &nbsp;I cut it down to about 200 and got the same message, and then went to about 125 and it was sent, which is over the 100 people/email, but it
 worked. &nbsp;I figured the total for the day would be the same and would receive some type of message saying I was sending too many, the thing is, I never received a message, so I probably could have sent more than 5,500.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it sounds like I'm stuck at 300/day ATM. &nbsp;I read somewhere that this amount might go up as I use the account, which you kind of mention. I'm thinking the upgrade reset me somehow, and I have to build up to some unknown daily limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid the limit issue in the future I will contact 300 people each day and ask them to switch over to a mail server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I'm the only one that tried to send this many emails with Ad-Free and for whatever reason it worked??? But, I am telling you the truth, MS can even look at my send history to see for themselves. Maybe, since I contacted support after I discovered the
 50/day limit they gave me a higher limit with the Ad-Free account, and after I verified it???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did call support and am waiting on a response, but even the tech guy I talked to couldn't figure out how I was sending 5,000 per day, so you are not alone. He did think I could send more than 300/day, but not 5,000 and explained all the reasons behind
 it, the case has been elevated to a higher authority and I have to wait it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do appreciate the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
