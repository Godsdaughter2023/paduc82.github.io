<h2>            Can&#39;t boot Windows without second drive</h2>
                    Recently I have cloned my Windows 7 installation to a new hard drive (the C partition) and it works just fine. The only problem is, if I remove the old drive where its used to be, the Windows can't boot at all. Is it related to the EFI partition in the
 old drive? How can I move the EFI partition so that I can boot Windows without the old drive?&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab8cda69-43b2-47f5-ba22-3e9e0f6db889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab8cda69-43b2-47f5-ba22-3e9e0f6db889" /></a>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The problem is with the active partition. It is highly probable that the old drive is marked as active in disk management.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may check which drive is set as active in disk management. </span></p>
<p><span>For further information, you may refer the article:</span></p>
<p>

<br />
If the old drive is marked as active, you will have to set the new drive as active.
</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a thread link which you can refer to change the active partition to the new hard drive using the diskpart utility from WinRE (Windows Recovery Environment):

</span></p>
<p><span><br />
These steps are valid for windows 7 also.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once the new hard drive is set active, you could try to boot to it without the old drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you can run a Startup Repair (without the old drive connected to the system.)</span></p>
<p><span>You may try booting from the Windows 7 installation disc or from the inbuilt system recovery options and try performing a Startup repair:</span></p>

<h2>            Sound choppy and slow</h2>
                    I'm using Skype 8.12.0.14 on my Xiaomi Mi5 with lineage 20171226 and never had any problems. Recently Skype sound is choppy and slow like it's been interrupted. I have started to delete various app which eventually seems to remedy the problem but 30 min
 later the choppyness is back. Switching to&nbsp; Skype lite seems to work at first&nbsp;but here also the choppyness returns after a while although after installation the sound is fine. Other sound (w and w/o headphone) works fine. Only other app that has similar problem
 is Tuenti Voip app. Any ideas ??

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Make sure that you have enough bandwidth to make Skype calls. Try to reinstall the Skype app and try using a different internet connection and check
 on it again. Also, if its happening to another app, then it’s not an issue specific to Skype.</span></span></p>

<h2>            high cpu usage Microsoft Skype 32 bit</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Microsoft Skype 32 bit&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;a Compaq Presario laptop which I have recently upgraded to windows 10. Several times a day, a program called Microsoft skype 32 bit (I didn't even have skype) goes crazy and hogs all of my cpu usage. It goes up in the 90s percentage, and then my fans
 kick in and it sounds like my computer has become a mini airplane. This goes on for long increments of time, then just suddenly stops. When the program is not going crazy and is inactive, it still shows up on the task manager as using no cpu but about .1 mb
 of my memory. I have tried to uninstall this program. I first tried searching for it, to no avail. Then I opened task manager and found it running and opened the file location from there. But, windows will not allow me to uninstall it, even though I have administrative
 privileges. When I approached this issue a few weeks ago, I installed skype, but did not sign in. I thought the issue was fixed because it stopped happening for a few days, but then it started back up again. I currently have skype installed on my computer
 and the 32 bit version still goes crazy.</p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I tried what you did and found out that the program was SkypeHost.exe. I searched around and found something that said that the skype video app was causing the problem. I tired uninstalling the skype video app, which was default with windows 10 and I had
 never even opened it. Microsoft Skype 32 bit disappeared from the task manager list and so far has not reappeared to cause trouble again. The skype&nbsp;video app that comes with windows 10 was causing the issue. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to prevent multiple instances of an application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leetrengove  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to prevent multiple instances of an application</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with one of my applications..&nbsp; I use some CAM software to generate large text files (G code for machine tools). The CAM program then launches another text editor application that opens the text file created and allows me to hand edit it
 and then send it via RS-232 cable to the machine tool. </p>
<p>The problem is that the Text editor program is old, like Windows XP era old..&nbsp; It's propriety software made by the the machine tool company and it is the only thing i can use with this machine tool.&nbsp; I've set it to Windows XP compatible mode and it works
 OK, in the Windows 10 environment..&nbsp; The&nbsp; problem is that because it's launched by another program, if i forget to close it down before re-posting any changes in the CAM software,&nbsp; it causes another instance of the editor to be launched.&nbsp; In this situation
 i would expect the text editor to simply load the new text file, but instead it launches a whole new instance of the editor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to prevent multiple instances of the same program?&nbsp; Perhaps some kind of command line switch etc?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using a batch file that performs a "taskkill" operation to end the program if it's already running before launching it again, thereby preventing the multiple instances, but this seems to interfere with the COM port operation and causes it to
 lock up and stop working. &nbsp; Incidentally the same thing happens when multiple instances of the editor program are open. The only way to get the COM port to work again is a system reboot..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's getting really frustrating having to do re-boots just because i forget to close a program down.. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas how i can get around this problem? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Lee</p>

            the only time that works is when the program itself is written to prohibit multiple instances<br />
<br />
if the programmer didn't do that with this program <br />
then there really isn't any method to preventing multiple instances <br />

    <title>why does double tap via touch not work consistently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevefuchs  say:</h3>
<h2>            why does double tap via touch not work consistently</h2>
                    <p>In desktop apps I can double tap via touch and select a word to delete or replace, or just start my selection larger than 0 chars but in the metro UI I cannot</p>
<p>This is frustrating, especially since other touch interfaces support double tap (iOs for instance) in the same way Windows always has.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, why is there no "Select" option when I tap-n-hold?</p>
<p>There is a "Select All" but it would be even more useful to offer a "Select" option that selected the word under the finger.

            <p><span>Hi SteveFuchs,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Communities. It seems that you are not able to double tap via touch in the modern
 user interface (UI). Provide the following information:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span>
</li><li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Reduce the touchpad sensitivity. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open
<b>Control Panel</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click on the icon labeled "<b>Mouse</b>." The "<b>Mouse Properties</b>" window will open. Navigate to
 the tab labeled "<b>Device Settings</b>." Click on the button labeled <b>
Settings</b>, <b>properties</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Examine the left panel of the "<b>Properties</b>" window and expand the option labeled "<b>Sensitivity</b>."
 Click on the option labeled "<b>Touch Sensitivity</b>."</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Reduce the touch sensitivity setting by moving the slider to the right, towards the "<b>Heavy Touch</b>"
 label. Experiment with different levels of sensitivity until you find one suited to your needs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click "<b>OK</b>."
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> Update the latest drivers for the touchpad
 from the manufacturer’s website. If Windows 8 drivers are not available, you can install Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the ‘<b>Windows + W</b>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<b>compatibility</b> in the search box and then press
<b>enter</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “<b>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</b>” option from the
 list appeared in the left side.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the drivers and install.</span></p>

            <p>I think maybe you misunderstand me.</p>
<p>I'm talking about the behavior when using the touchscreen to position the cursor and select a word.</p>
<p>In desktop mode I can run an app like Word 2010 and easily place the cursor using my finger.&nbsp; I can place the cursor in the middle of a word, end of a word, or beginning of a word.</p>
<p>I can also double-tap with my finger to select a whole word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the modern UI, I car run the Mail app but only place the cursor at the beginning or end of a word using touchscreen, and I cannot double-tap with my finger on the screen to select a whole word.</p>
<p>As such, if I wish to delete a whole word, or fix 1 or 2 characters in the middle of the word, it takes quite a few touch genstures to place the cursor where I want it or select a whole word.</p>
<p>This is *less* functional than using a mouse or trackpad, and neither iOs nor Android have this limitation.&nbsp; In iOs I can double-tap with my finger and select a whole word, just like I can in desktop view for Win8.</p>
<p>It is especially frustrating that the functionality of touch works differently in modern ui vs desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Password protect purchases&#63;</h2>
                    What is the current best method for preventing unwanted purchases on a Gold account? I want my wife/kids to be able to access Netflix, etc; but I do not want them to be able to make purchases on the account. Previously, it was limited to the number of
 MS Points I had loaded to the account, but the new payment method changes that safeguard.

<p>Indeed, the best protection would be to limit or approve use. &nbsp;IF you are the account holder NOBODY can use it without approval just like always. &nbsp; &nbsp;The amount has NOT changed. 5$ still equals 5$. &nbsp;A debit or prepaid card still has the same function. &nbsp;Just
 load the amount as usual!!! &nbsp;NOTHING has changed for CC &nbsp;or prepaid purchases. &nbsp;GOOD LUCK!!!!!</p>

<p>My 3 year old shouldn't need to have their own Xbox Gold account in order to use Netflix on the Xbox since MS is moving towards a media consumption approach vs strictly a game console. &nbsp;All other media consumption devices that I use require a password confirmation
 for making purchase.</p>

</p><p>So please help us out and get this fixed asap. Age Of Empires III is on sale on Steam at the moment and will have a large amount of players buying the game, Microsoft/Ensemble should have been made aware of this and provided more Keys for Steam.</p>

</p><p>Given this is a known issue and happens regularly according to numerous online forums, I expect better from a company that states it has quality systems in place for its products.&nbsp; When an issue is both foreseeable and has happened before, there is no excuse
 for repeatedly letting down its customers.</p>

    <title>Disk Properties defaults to Sharing Tab instead of General Tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin789  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Properties defaults to Sharing Tab instead of General Tab</h2>
                    Hi, has anyone seen this issue? Steps to reproduce issue:<br />
<br />
Start Windows Explorer<br />
Local C: Drive<br />
Right Click on C: Drive<br />
Click Properties<br />
<br />
The Properties dialog box will default to the Sharing tab instead of the General tab. The order of the tabs from left to right is Sharing &gt; Security . Previous Versions &gt; General. The row above it is Tools &gt; Hardware &gt; Quota.<br />
<br />
It would seem somehow the tabs got reversed.<br />
<br />
This only happens when viewing the properties of the disk drive itself. (Note, can be a hard drive, CD Drive, Removable Drive, etc.)&nbsp;Does not happen on folders/files.<br />
<br />
Please assist in figuring this out. Thanks.

            I have found the solution to my own problem.<br />
<br />
In the registry I was missing the following value:<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Drive\shellex\PropertySheetHandlers]<br />
@="{5F5295E0-429F-1069-A2E2-08002B30309D}"<br />
<br />
I had no value set in there which caused the properties to always default to the sharing tab instead of the general tab. After entering the value {5F5295E0-429F-1069-A2E2-08002B30309D} all was resolved.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps anyone else that comes across this issue.

</p><blockquote>What provision is being made for the millions of Mac users who use Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion?
</blockquote>
<p>NONE WHATSOEVER!</p>
<p>And there is no MSN chat or email support, as falsely stated when you start Help from the My Account page. All you get is being redirected to the Community, which of course is us, suckers. MSN had managed to ruin the best app ever, as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using 10.6.8 on a mbpro 2011 and I got locked out of my continuously running Skype 6.15.0333 upon log out from Skype and relaunching, because some ***** has hacked my account (and how is that possible on the oh, so secure MSN site is still a mystery)
 and send spam to all my contacts, in Russian of course. </p>
<p>Skype now tells me that "We've signed you out because you're using an outdated version of Skype. Download the latest version" - which of course does not run on Snow Leopard. You still get directed to download the proper 6.15 version for Mac OS X 10.6.8 but
 it does not work!</p>

<p>Hi both of you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1b6fa11f-2dd8-42d1-9326-22703f41b447" title="AdminPromart"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">AdminPromart</span></a> for your very colourful explanation of the problems you are facing. I would just
 take a moment to remind you about the community code of conduct you agreed to when you joined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said I understand your frustrated. To say there is nothing you can use is not quite accurate, users on Mac versions below 10.9 can of course use Skype for Web for chat but calling requires that you have OSX 10.9 as well -

<p>Allen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was fast!</p>
<p>I knew that my colorful post will have an effect, so it was intentional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to direct the users of 10.6.8 to a web version of Skype - which BTW I tested and is awful -&nbsp; is an unprofessional and unsatisfactory answer to the problem faced by the huge amount of Mac users that stayed with Snow Leopard because of its reliability.
 This seem to me closer to an insult than to a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THERE IS NO ANNOUNCEMENT THAT Skype 6.15 DOES NOT work anymore! Don't you think that we, the users of Skype since it's inception, before MSN bought it and added it to the rooster, deserved that kind of statement spelled out clearly on the Skype pages? Or
 is it the corporate "political correctness" BS, the scourge of modern times, which stopped Skype short of such announcement that would have definitely upset the masses? Did you guys do some research before retiring 6.15 for 10.6.8, used by a majority of Mac
 pros that don't have time to waste on the latest and greatest Apple half-baked OS versions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my questions for you, dear Manager, as a paying customer for a Skype Pro subscription and purchased credit for years now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How was it possible that my 10 year-old Skype account, to which I change passwords regularly, was hacked by a Russian guy on your ultra secure site, with endless authentications protocols for signing in?</p>
<p>2. Why is the download page still showing Skype 6.15 available for download, with no warnings that it will NOT work anymore?</p>
<p>3. Why is your Skype site still listing Mac OS X 10.6.8&nbsp; as the minimum system required?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly suggest that this lack of transparency is consistent with Microsoft software blunders and shows a complete disregard for users of the product, whose popularity is based on its reliability and name established long before Microsoft got its paws
 on it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry you feel my reply was an Insult, it was not meant as such - merely a way to allow you to continue to use Skype on platforms we will no longer support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be unable to comment on how your account was hacked but I am sure you're aware of the most common ways, i.e. Same account details used on compromised site or using the same username and passwords accross services. We provide a
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA34711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
helpful FAQ</a> on account security and, <a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA34652/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
once you have converged your account to a Microsoft account</a> you can enable 2 Factor Authentication meaning any new device accessing your account will need to enter a passcode which we will send you to be able to complete login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer point 2 in your post - I can only assume you are getting some sort of caching error with your download and it will eventually update accordingly. We contacted all affected customers, who we had a valid email for, to advise them they would need
 to upgrade and we published <a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA12041/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this FAQ</a> a few weeks back ago. Some customers were also sent inclient messages to warn them of the deprecation.<br />
<br />
I suspect the answer to Point 3 is the same and point 2 - i.e. some sort of caching issue means your not getting the latest version of the site. We also updated the minimum system requirements for Skype a few weeks ago, in
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10328/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also didnt get a reply really quickly because of your colourful use of language, as you might expect I am watching for posts like this in view of the large number deprecations occuring today so that I can help customers as quickly as possible when they
 get stuck.<br />
<br />
I am sorry that you feel you have not been informed but the only option I have for you is to either update your OS, use a supported device or use Skype for Web.</p>

<p>Dear Allen, <br />
<br />
You are saying there is the possibility of using Skype for Web, however when trying to install the plugin to make audio/video calls (which I'm sure you'll agree is one of the main reason to use Skype), I get an error message telling me I need to upgrade to
 OSX 10.9. Since if I had OSX 10.9 I'd certainly use the desktop version, this kind of defeats the whole purpose of having Skype for Web, don't you think ?&nbsp; So my question is simple : is there a way around this ?
<br />
<br />
Also, could you please tell me why Microsoft decided to not offer Skype for OS X 10.6, 10.7 10.8 anymore ?
<br />

<p>Hello Allan it is not realy true what you are writing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I'm on the Skype-Site, it figures as the newes version for Mac the Skype 6.15 Version. But is not running with Mac. 10.6.8. But in no place it's mentioned that Mac 10.6.8. is not suported any longer.</p>
<p>This is realy very unpro and it's a little bit cinic from your part to mention the community code of conduct if the company you represent is not respecting no code of transparency&nbsp; an of customer friendliness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You say that we can go cloud: It is not true: When I log in in my Skype Account via Browser/Cloud (https://web.skype.com/de/) I'm forced to download a plug-in. OK: I do it.
<strong>But: This Plug in only works with Mac 10.9 or higher. </strong>(it's definitly not some catching error with download as you write below)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So: Dear Mr. Allen: Could you be so kind to explain step by step, what I have to do to use skype with my Mac 10.6.8. (Please don't answer with reference to FAQ.)</strong></p>

<p>My, my Allen, another one of your workaround "solutions" bites the dust, eh? For that matter, none of the stuff you mentioned in your reply to my rant makes sense or is true, you realize that, don't you? Cache-ing problems on&nbsp;the MS/Skype&nbsp;website, when launched
 from the main MSN page, after merging my account with MS, and same for download page for 6.15.... who do you take us for, some born-yesterday morons with no clue how things work? Why waste time insulting our intelligence&nbsp;by covering a planed but well-disguised
 corporate move with nonsense, hoping it will go away quietly? Well, it didn't and it won't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't you people be frank and honest and tell us straight up that&nbsp;(maybe) at Apple's request you have quietly retired 6.15 for 10.6.8, 10.7 &amp; 10.8 (since they've done their best to stop users from running those OSes and switch to their latest&nbsp;bug-ridden
 versions) or that it was an oversight of the programming cycle, or that (maybe) Microsoft doesn't really care about the legacy Mac users they made a ton of money from through purchases of the MS products throughout the years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please explain to&nbsp;us why, when the product still works just fine if you don't log out or update and re-launch the app, would you retire an excellent and stable desktop version when it makes hundreds of thousands of users happy? I would understand if for
 hardware/software&nbsp;inner works reasons that would not be possible anymore, but this is NOT the case, the app works just fine if you don't get out of it! And how can possibly keeping 6.15 alive may impact negatively your new 7.x version adoption if it fits the
 system is beyond my comprehension!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you guys not&nbsp;in the business of keeping your customers happy, as it normally should be the case. A sound business model does not impose&nbsp;such negative options - update your system or else - unless there is an ulterior motive, which I suspect is the case
 for this retirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, shame on you Microsoft for misleading and devious business practices!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Preinstalled Windows Store Apps Missing After Windows 8.1 Pro Pack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superuserdave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preinstalled Windows Store Apps Missing After Windows 8.1 Pro Pack Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 8.1 Pro Pack on my Lenovo Yoga2 Pro. Now many of the apps preinstalled by Lenovo no longer show in the Windows Store. The missing apps include Lenovo Companion, Lenovo Support, Yoga Phone Companion, Yoga Camera
 Man, Yoga Chef, Yoga Photo Touch, Yoga Picks, rara music with Lenovo, and Hightail for Lenovo. Curiously the tiles for these apps still show on the Start Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored my laptop back to the original factory image (i.e., back to Windows 8.1) and all of the preinstalled apps show in the Windows Store. I then downloaded and installed all Windows 8.1 updates and confirmed that after all the updates had been installed
 that the preinstalled apps still show in the Windows Store. I then installed the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack and now none of the preinstalled apps mentioned above show in the Windows Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on here? Is this a Windows Store problem or a problem with the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to restore access to the preinstalled apps after upgrading to Windows 8.1 Pro?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any assistance that can be provided.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, there are multiple reason why, you are unable to find certain apps on the Windows Store. To know the common reasons, you may refer to the article at the end of this post. As mentioned in the Lenovo Forum, the OEM apps are usually “<strong><em>Exclusive</em></strong>”
 apps and the others are “<strong><em>Non Exclusive</em></strong>”. Exclusive apps means, only the users having the Lenovo laptop can find these apps on the Store, the others cannot. However, the Non Exclusive apps can accessed by anyone on the Store. But,
 in this case, I am not sure why you are unable to find these apps even after having a Lenovo laptop.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Let’s try the following method and check if that resolves the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Clear the Store cache</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try these steps to clear the Store cache and check if that helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press the “Windows Logo” + “R” keys on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) Type “<strong><em>wsreset.exe</em></strong>” and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>c) Now, search for the apps and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information regarding this issue, I would suggest you to refer to the article given below:</p>

<p>I tried running wsreset.exe and that did not fix the problem. In addition I looked at all the possible reasons provided in the link you provided. None of these possible reasons apply to my situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran a test by restoring my Lenovo Yoga2 Pro back to the initial factory configuration. I confirmed that I had access to all of the "Exclusive" apps provided by Lenovo. I then ran Windows Update and installed all available updates. I confirmed again
 that I had access to all of the "Exclusive" apps. Then I installed my Windows 8.1 Pro Pack upgrade and rebooted. Immediately following that upgrade I no longer had access to the "Exclusive" apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition I looked at all the possible reasons provided in the link you provided. None of these possible reasons apply to my situation. I ran wsreset again and that still did not solve the problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since, I made no other changes and installed no other software except the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack upgrade the problem must be with something that the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack upgrade did to my system. How can this problem be fixed?</p>
<p>

            <p>1. I am unable to find the apps in the Windows Store. I can see all the apps from my start screen and from the all apps screen.</p>
<p>2. As I said initially, the apps were preinstalled by Lenova at their factory when they configured the laptop. So, I have no idea which account was used to install the apps. I do know that I could find the apps in the Windows Store when I initially received
 the laptop and again after I reset the laptop back to the initial factory configuration (i.e, I restored the laptop from the recovery partition installed by Lenovo).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately after installing the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack I did go to the Windows Store &nbsp;and checked to see if I could find the old apps. The old apps were no longer available from the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the "Date and Time" and the date, time, and time zone are all correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I would like to stress that I have confirmed that the problem was caused by installing the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchase a new PC with Windows 8.1 pre-installed and you later upgrade that PC with Windows 8.1 Pro Pack, you will no longer be able to install apps that are provided exclusively from your PC manufacturer through the Windows Store.</p>

            <p>Your answer basically restates the problem I originally asked. I would like to understand why am I no longer able to install apps provided by Lenovo. in my case I upgraded just a couple weeks after receiving my new laptop so, I have had no opportunity to
 take advantage of the apps provided by Lenovo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume that a portion of my laptop purchase price included the cost of these apps. So, why do I lose access just because I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 8.1 Pro? I see nothing explaining this at the link you provided. Please clarify.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same problem. I got with Microsoft chat and they said it's my problems because it's OEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some apps don't work. Example is Microsoft Windows Live Mail. I can click on it and a pop up appears reading "This app can't install" and to check the Windows Store for more info. When I go to the store, it reads that I already have the app.</p>

<p><span>Hi Cam65,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What exactly you mean by “computer all of a sudden goes into safe mode”? Do you mean to say that you get an option to boot into safe mode or the
 computer boots into Safe mode without your intervention?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Uncheck “Safe boot” option under Microsoft System Configuration Utility</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 will not boot into Safe mode until and unless it is forced to boot into Safe mode. There’s an option in the well-known System Configuration
 utility that will let you force Windows to always boot into Safe mode until you turn the option off.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 up the start menu search or run box, and type in msconfig and hit the enter key.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 the Boot tab, and then check the box for “Safe boot” and make sure the radio button below is set to “Minimal”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once

<p>Hi there Volcannon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with creating slots/profiles for the accessory device. What accessory are you working with? (Xbox One wireless controller, Xbox One Elite wireless controller,&nbsp;Adaptive Controller)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend taking a look at the following troubleshooting articles:</p>
<ul>

<p>I have a Wireless Xbox controller. The problem is not that I don't know how to remap (I know very well how to use the remap system) but the fact that the profile is not being assigned to slot 1 (which is my controller).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to assign the profile to slot 1 (I made a profile call Fallout 76 because that's what I am playing atm) the default profile (the one between new profile and your custom profile) would be renamed as profile 1 and the profile you selected to
 be in slot 1 would not be registered as slot 1.</p>

<p>Hey Volcannon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually when a custom profile is not being set to the desired slot location, which on a standard controller there is only 1 slot, it means that there was no change to the custom profile&nbsp;from the default profile that is set to profile 1, so if it recognizes
 no changes were made, it will keep the same profile it has on there since it technically is the same profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First delete any extra profiles that were created from your troubleshooting. You should be able to edit the default profile without it creating a new custom profile. I have an elite controller and have edited the default profile to make a custom one and
 it no longer appears in the list of profiles. There's a setting to restore to defaults so a default profile is not necessarily needed to stay on there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend to perform a complete hard reset and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a>. After the Xbox reboots, make sure you button map your desired set of buttons and make sure they are different than the normal button mapping. Keep in mind A and B needs to be mapped somewhere for a profile to be created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it's still not setting your custom profile to slot 1.</p>

<p>Hi Volcannon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tested it out myself with a standard controller and you can't edit the default profile but you can replace it and it should go away unless you delete your custom profiles.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you need to create your new desired profile with the button mapping you want. Once you make a profile that is different than the default setting, you will see if below not assigned to slot one. When you hover over your custom profile, select the drop
 down menu that says "No Slot" and then select "Slot 1". It should then replace the default profile with the name of your custom profile on Slot 1 and Default Profile should no longer be seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not doing that then either your custom profile does not have any changes made to it so it defaults back to the default profile, or your operating system is not implementing the changes correctly and would need to be reset. I suggest trying a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset </a>but only if you know your account information since you will need to re-download your account during the set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>So after doing the soft factory reset and the stuff required afterward, I went to the device and Accessories section. I created a new profile, renamed it Fallout 76, unmapped the right stick click and toggled the vibration to off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to set Fallout 76 to slot 1, the default profile renamed itself to Profile 1, but Fallout 76 would still be set as no slot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I aam getting rather frustrated with this because almost every game has something associated with that button and because I have tourette sydrome, I involuntarily press it whenever I press the RT (shoot the weapon) button.</p>

<p>Hi Volcannon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying. I wasn't aware that you were trying to un-map the right stick and I wasn't even aware you could un-map buttons as this may have been implemented recently. I recreated your custom profile on two different Xbox's and I believe the issue
 is related to the un-map feature. I did multiple tests and any profile that I made with a button un-mapped ended up&nbsp;recreating the exact scenario you are describing. I believe this is a bug and is not how it should be since the renamed Profile 1 in slot 1&nbsp;doesn't
 show the change you make which is just blank where the symbol of un-mapping is of a straight horizontal line. Button mapping any other way does not seem to recreate this issue, it only happens when you un-map something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By any chance is your Xbox enrolled in the Xbox Insider Program? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if a preview update would be causing this but it could be a possibility. Either way I highly suggest to report this problem through the reporting feature on the Xbox. You need to have the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub-report-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Insider Hub app </a>installed and then hold down the Xbox button on the controller to bring up the power menu and "Report a Problem" should be selectable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll continue to track this but need help from users to report problems like this when they happen to acknowledge the issues as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<br />
I would say the issue isn't lasting. After one of the recent Patch Tuesday updates (Feb or Mar), I noted a significant drop in writing to disk, sufficient to no longer create freezes. There is still significant writing making the computer hot, but at least
 it doesn't make it temporarily unusable as before. Of course, this issue should still affect battery time and whatnot. Might it be a Lenovo issue? I haven't seen others complain about this. (Lenovo still hasn't fixed the poor battery time with upgrading to
 Win8, but other manufacturers seem to have done so.)

            <p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you boot crash the PC to get to the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). While your computer is turned on, pull out the power plug, then this should immediately shut down the PC. Do this at least three times until you get the blue screen
 giving you options to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

Creo Parametric is not currently available on the Surface with Windows RT. You can get in touch with the developer and see if they are creating an app for Windows RT.

<h2>            Photo Gallery &#34;Dates Taken&#34; Changed to all one Date</h2>
                    In my thumbnail views suddenly all my photos have the same date taken, and I didn't change them (on purpose!). They are the correct dates in the folders, but all wrong and all the same date&nbsp;on the thumbnail screen/view. What did I do to cause that and
 how do I fix it? I see&nbsp;the same&nbsp;date in their properties that they were all modified, if I system restore before that will it fix it&nbsp;but will I lose all my stuff I've put on since then? I don't have much experience with system restore. Any ideas?

<p><span><span>Hello NanElan,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should try to check if you can changed to date to the date taken by following the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open Windows Photo Gallery by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs, and then clicking Windows Photo Gallery.
<br />
2. If you don't see the Info pane on the side of the window, click Info on the toolbar to display it.<br />
3. Click the picture that you want to change.<br />
To select several pictures, hold down CTRL, and then click each picture that you want to change.<br />
4. Click the date at the top of the Info pane.<br />
5. Click the arrow next to the date, and then click the correct date on the calendar.<br />
6. Click the time at the top of the Info pane.<br />
7. Select the correct time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is a link that you refer that will give you more information about this:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-the-date-and-time-a-picture-was-taken" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-the-date-and-time-a-picture-was-taken</span></a></span><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Prior to doing this, you should try to do a Malware scan on your computer as suggested by Sreekanth in the previous post.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also go about doing System Restore on your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>System Restore uses restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point in time, without affecting personal
 files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This means that you will not lose any personal files added to your computer recently. However, the recently installed updates would
 be undone. This can be installed again from the Windows update.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have installed any software for your recently installed battery, you might have to reinstall the software again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If System restore does not fix your problem you can always go about undoing the System Restore.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is an article that will give you help with ‘Undo System Restore’:</span></span></p>
