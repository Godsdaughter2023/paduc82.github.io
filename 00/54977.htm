<h2>            Game Pass redeemed but not working.</h2>
                    I ordered a new a controller and was pleasantly surprised with a 14 day Game Pass code, however after activating said code i realised it hadn't worked and tried to enter the code again thinking i did something wrong, code has already been redeemed. i have
 checked my order history and it says that the code has been redeemed but i do not have access to anything Game Pass and i am lost on what to do, any ideas anyone?

Thank you for reaching out. I understand you are having some trouble with your brand new Game Pass subscription. Since this might be just a simply syncing issue, go ahead and try performing a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a> on the Xbox by doing the following:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>Unplug the console's power cable. Wait 10 seconds.
<p><strong>Important</strong> Be sure to wait 10 seconds. This step resets the power supply.
</p>
</li><li>Plug the console power cable back in. </li><li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button on your console to turn on the Xbox One.

            Today I bought the $1 xbox gamepass and after paying for it it gave me an error saying “we couldnt get authorization for this purchase” but i had 3.32 in my account so i tried it again on another one of my xbox accounts. But still gave me the same error.
 I thought well third times a charm and made a new account in hopes this would solve my problem and yet it still didnt work. I began to get frustrated and tried once more on my main account and then it said. “Insufficient amount of funds” and i checked my account
 and poof now i have .33 cents and no game pass. I chatted with customer support for 2 hours. They didnt help much it was very confusing having to use 3 phones one for the website one for the chat and one for the call with them to give them my card number so
 they could check the billing. But they called and couldnt hear me on my phone. So i sent them my girlfriends number in the chat. And they called that but still couldnt hear me. I vould hear the woman just fine. She wasted 2 h

            I'd recommend you do a power cycle, by holding down the Xbox Power Button for 10 seconds. If that doesn't work, try to remove and then add your Xbox Profile back, then power cycle again.

<p><span>Hi Davidstipek,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for taking the time to post.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Product_Filter.aspx?ProductID=922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Product_Filter.aspx?ProductID=922</a></span></p>
<p><span>This link above from Intel with the chipset you posted does not offer any Vista Drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;product=443395&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;product=443395&amp;</a></span></p>
<p><span>The above link, if you select Microsoft Windows Vista only shows a download for HP Quick Launch Buttons. They do not offer any other downloads for your motherboard/chipset.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you already are trying to install the XP drivers in compatibility mode but they are failing, there is not a lot that can be done. Since this is OEM (HP hardware) they would supply the drivers
 needed to run on Windows Vista. If you have not already I would contact HP and Intel to see if they have Vista drivers for your model that are not listed on the HP or Intel website. Other than that, you could search the internet for other drivers for different
 HP models that support Vista and try them on your computer but I would strongly suggest asking HP first before doing so as that might cause more harm than good.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>That would be very frustrating! This does tend to happen a lot when a game is released due to the large number of players jumping on and playing. Are you getting an error message when you are kicked?</p>
<p>Here are some troubleshooting tips... i know you said you've been through them, but thought I'd post them to make sure these are the ones you've checked :)

<p>Also make sure to check at the bottom of that page for additional links to other Halo 5 support pages :)</p>
<p>Let me know</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Thanks for confirming that :)</p>
<p>Have you tried hard resetting your console? I've actually had it fix a few of these kinds of issues for others, so there is a chance that it could work for you too. With the console on, hold down the power button on the front of the xbox for 10seconds until
 the xbox switches off. Wait a minute or two then switch it back on. You should see the green xbox screen when it turns on, which shows its been hard reset correctly. Then try it again and let us know how you go :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hey MurkinYoFace!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about those frequent disconnects you`ve been having.</p>
<p>One thing worth looking into (again, if it hasn't already been done) is to change your DNS settings (Settings/System/Network/Advanced Settings/DNS Settings). Make the primary DNS 8.8.8.8 and the secondary one 8.8.4.4 &nbsp;After making the changes, apply them
 and perform one hard reboot please.</p>
<p>Hopefully that will make a difference, again, if it wasn't been done.</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p>XB1R Crius</p>

<p>Since you deleted the recovery partition (why?) you need to order a Factory Restore DVD from your laptop's distributor.</p>

<p>I just explained that above. Whatever I deleted the recovery partion from computer manager then can not relocated back as recovery partion. If I used the advanced reset in recovery and update tab in windows settings, will that fix the issue? Or I have to
 reinstall from DVD drive.</p>

<p><span>Hi Gene,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that the Virus or the malware is not completely removed from the computer. I<span>would
 suggest you to first try to run an online virus scan and remove the infected items on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run a online Virus scan using live one care utility.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
&nbsp;Also follow the steps mentioned in the link below as well to get rid of malware.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>How to get rid of malware</span></strong><span>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may also download Windows Defender on your computer and try to scan the computer using Windows defender and remove the infected items.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/defender/scan.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/defender/scan.mspx</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After running the online virus scan check if you can start the Windows Security center service. You may also check the dependency of the Security
 Center services and check if they have been set to automatic and started. You may restart all the dependency services for security center and check if it helps you fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t add my friend who I deleted on xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p><span>&nbsp;Hello everybody. I discovered yesterday that I cannot re add people who I recently deleted on the xbox 360. I accidentally deleted my friend and he tried re adding me but I never got the friend request from him even though
 it appeared pending on his friend list. So I sent him a friend request and he said he didn't get it. So we both had pending friend requests for each other. When he tried cancelling it he got an error message but I didn't get any error message. I know this
 is something to do with adding people who were my friends because I tested it with someone else and the same thing happened. We tried to block each other in an attempt to fix it but we then realised we couldn't block each other and were both greeted with an
 error message. I added my second account and then accepted the friend request from it and then I deleted my second account from my friends list and when I added it back the request still went through. I did the same thing with my friend using my second account
 as well so I figured this only happens with long term friends. I don't know how long this has been going on because I only just discovered it so its possible this is happening to friends added before&nbsp;this started happening. Is it possible someone is in my
 account glitching it? Also friend requests sent to me have been randomly erased simultaneously in the past few weeks and also one was erased about the time I tried re adding my friend. I also could not find this problem anywhere on the forums. I could find
 lots of people getting error messages when they try adding people but that is not the problem I have. So could I have been hacked if it is only me? I don't really know what is happening and I know how long these problems can take to fix as something similar
 happened to me last year that took 3 months to fix that I posted about and I was on the verge of quitting xbox. Also I contacted xbox support about this and they say it has been escalated but I know how long it takes so I am posting here as well. And before
 you ask I have checked NAT/privacy settings/friend list space/done troubleshooting and tried to refresh my profile and lots of other things to try and solve it. So has anyone got the same problem as mine with adding recently deleted people where you don't
 get any error messages but you can add them and they don't receive it and they can add you but you don't receive it? Please help me!</span></p>

<p>I wouldn't let this bother you, I really think its unlikely that's what has happened, i have gone through it all like others, even with the problem you and he is having now, and my account wasn't compromised, just hang in there bud, hope things get sorted
 real fast there us not much more that can be said, I do think before I sleep that we bar thus as answered as I honestly don't think anyone could add much more to the advice I gave, if you want to continue talking to me feel free to add me on xbox or message
 me in PM. I'll suggest this as answered because sadly none if us can fix server side faults but Microsoft :(</p>

            Thanks Charianne for trying, but that is far too complicated for me to try. It's Greek to me... the problem seems to have stopped (or maybe I just haven't turned off the laptop). Any rate, thanks for trying. I hope it's not archiving my icons or something
 weird like that. I'll write again if it does it again. I'm pretty sure it was an update of some sort. Bye

<h2>            Computer keeps restarting and wont stop.</h2>
                    We play World of Warcraft and we were in the middle of a group activity when she gets disconnected.&nbsp; We assume it's a switch on the side we bump from time to time.&nbsp; But before we had a chance to mess with it, her computer starts to shut down.&nbsp; It gets
 to the screen where it's installing updates, but it last for a few seconds and fully shuts down and restarts.&nbsp; Now it loads and gets to the screen where it's supposed to finish the updates and it sits there for about a minute at 0% and then starts to shut
 down again.&nbsp; It repeats this over and over and over.&nbsp; I've tried restoring it to befoer this happened, doesn't let me.&nbsp; We have not backed-up the computer so we can't restore it that way.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure we could reformat the whole computer but my wife has
 lots of pics she has on her laptop she doesn't want to lose.&nbsp; Let me know if anyone has any ideas.&nbsp; Thanks!

<p>dancindave,<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
The first thing that comes to mind is a virus, spyware, or malware.&nbsp; I have seen them do this many times.&nbsp; Run a full system scan on it, if you can get it to stay up long enough.&nbsp; Try booting into Safe Mode and see if it will stay alive long enough to scan
 it.&nbsp; If you don't have updated anti virus and spyware software installed, here are a couple of good online scanners:&nbsp; Microsoft OneCare:http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm?s_cid=sah/?s_cid=sah&nbsp; and Trend Micro Housecall: http://housecall.trendmicro.com/<br />
<br />
The other thing you can do, if it won't stay up long enough to try and fix it, is to run Startup Repair.&nbsp; That will not delete her data.<br />
<br />
If you have a Windows Vista installation disc, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the installation disc. If you do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to repair your computer will not appear.</p>
<p>If you have a Windows Vista installation disc:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Insert the installation disc.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Restart your computer.</p>
<p>Click the Start button , click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</p>
<p>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp; Choose your language settings, and then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5.&nbsp; Click Repair your computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6.&nbsp; Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
7.&nbsp; On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Startup Repair is a preinstalled recovery option on your computer:<br />
&nbsp; <br />
1.&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</p>
<p>Click the Start button , click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Do one of the following:</p>
<p>• If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Two keyboards on one machine</h2>
                    I have windows xp and would like to have the abililty to have two people view the same screen or have dual screens where they can see the same info and have two keyboards set up for data entry.&nbsp; How do I do this.&nbsp; I know it seems awkward but it is beneficial
 for our office.

            <p>You can certainly plug in two keyboard and they'll both work, but you can't have two active programs at the same time or have two different spaces in an entry form at the same time either. I don't quite think this will work.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use remote desktop (the w8 metro version) but cannot figure out how to get the soft keyboard to appear. Do I need to open the soft keyboard on my server? Neither I can't pinch , but maybe that is not a feature?</p>

            <p>No, that is not what Magnus is asking:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scenario is very simple:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run Remote Desktop (Metro)</p>
<p>Connect to a remote machine (none Metro)</p>
<p>Go to a filed where you need to type text.</p>
<p>Assuming you are connecting from a tablet machine with no Keyboard, how do you get the virtual keyboard to show up for data entry?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the Beta, there was a way of getting the keyboard to work. Since the RC, I am missing that feature. its either that it was cut or there is some special trick to enable it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is it?</p>

<p><br />
For Metro apps (e.g. IE) I have found that the Touch Keyboard pops up when needed for my pen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually then it is either the TIP or the full Touch Keyboard, depending on how much input I need to make.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, sometimes it is&nbsp;more efficient to leave the
 OSK up, either minimized to a&nbsp; Nav strip or hidden by Fade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither feature is complete so you end up transitioning between them a lot.</p>

<p>Note that I was puzzled by the inclusion of F6 in the Nav strip?&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it have a use for Remote Desktop?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>

</p><p>The skype icon disappeared from my taskbar and desktop, and the only version was in the apps list and I don't know what to do with it. There is just a black box saying hello (my name) and no contacts list or anything. I have only one account, and I am signed

<p>

            Solved problem-turns out Skype "proper" got deleted by a windows 10 update so had to reinstall the thing again. What I was seeing in my apps list was some other weird latest version.&nbsp; Will not use Windows 10 on next computer; getting Linux instead because
 I've had it with having to fix things after every major update messes things up. Life is too short, and MS support is almost non-existent.

            This one works much better than the one MS forced us to use with win10 updates. That one disappears when closed and shows only handful of contacts. This one is the best version we've been using for years. Shows full list of contacts whether you've been
 in touch with them or not in many years. But this version shows msg that it's gonna be discontinued soon.&nbsp;IT's like MS wants to push us for a substandard product and force us to pay for better version.&nbsp;

<p>Here's an upate for Skype disappearing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time it happened, I found Skype for web &amp; used that so I could chat with my mother. Then I reinstalled Skype proper to my desktop. Guess what? Another Windows update came along &amp; it disappeared again! So I got through to MS chat (miracle there
 in of itself) &amp; the silly boy said, "Oh, you don't have skype on your computer..." Duh! So I said it WAS installed, but Windows deleted it, to which he replied he didn't see how that could happen. Oh, seriously?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has got to be the biggest boondoggle going -get everyone to update for "free" and then make us all feel trapped by a defective inferior OS. The worst bit though?&nbsp; Some of the best bits of Windows 7 and/or 8 were not included so we are expected
 to pay more money for apps we previously had included. Media player, included in Windows 7 was dropped in Windows 10, so I went with open source software VLC media player for free -because I'll be damned if I'm going to give MS any more of my $. I also chose
 Apache Open Office -open source software for free- because it's plain ridiculous to pay every single year for temporary access to MS Office when I had a permanent version previously that I owned but that no longer gets updates. Actually, I like Apache much
 better, and they have more stuff. If you want to purchase a permanent MS office version, well, you can, but there are no updates, it's expensive, and it's old already.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, don't blame me for feeling the Windows 10 free update -that has been plagued by so many problems &amp; cost me so much time fixing it &amp; reinstalling it 3 times now that it's actually not free- has been one massive boondoggle. To top it off, my Photoshop
 will no longer open, and there is no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...Skype: Once a lovely way to talk to family &amp; friends face to face, it has now become completely b^@@ered up by MS. I don't want another social media platform, I don't want to use it to phone anyone, and I will NEVER pay any money to use anything on
 it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time there is a Windows update now, Skype gets completely uninstalled from my destop so I have to waste more time reinstalling it, &amp; then I get a message telling me I have to update it, which I do, and then of course it still gets uninstalled with
 the next Windows 10 update.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The day MS starts charging money to use Skype is the day I will uninstall it myself and use Facebook Video Chat, which is free and works without all the drama. My mother doesn't have FB, but I think she may soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to all the Skype users who are just fed up with the hassle, and who already have a Facebook account, go use the Video Chat in the upper right corner of Messenger for each contact. It's simple &amp; easy. I'm not a huge fan of FB, but if you keep your settings
 to the strictest privacy, it's OK. Alternatively, Google has video chat on Google Hangouts.</p>

    <title>Incompatible Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnschnellptsdvet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incompatible Updates</h2>
                    <p>I just updated my video driver (GeForce 560Ti with version 378.92). I have winders 10 64 bit version 1511 because your anniversary update crashes my system.&nbsp; I tried to turn off my computer but it kept running for 10 minutes. I then hit the power button.
 I then tried 3 times to start it and it went to a diagnostic mode that should be gotten rid of because as you can see I do have a keyboard but winders 10 can't find it. I finally got in and everything was running extremely slowly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I going to have to reinstall other software each time I update my computer (really annoying)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I going to have to go to an actually reliable operating system (windows 7)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what program is causing the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how I can get rid of this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know someone will say this isn't for microsoft but it is moderated by them.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we get your concern correctly, after updating your video driver, your PC is now running slow. Is that correct? If yes, we can start troubleshooting the issue by performing a clean boot. This will eliminate software conflicts caused by installed programs
 or updates. To do that, refer to the article below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing a clean boot and the same issue still persist, we suggest running an SFC scan. It is a utility that checks for any corrupted system files. To run SFC scan, kindly click on this

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Actually, I couldn't start my computer. After 3 power button shutdowns, I would get the screen asking about my keyboard but that was useless so I hit the power button again. I then got into windows, uninstalled my video driver, had windows search for it
 and install the drivers I just uninstalled, then I uninstalled my antivirus (AVG Free). I then had to restart and do it all over again since a restart messes with something on my video driver. I then went to sleep. Then when I started it in the morning, the
 same problems happened and I also had the problem of windows saying I wasn't on the internet but I had a connection. I have since fixed all that. Then I tried to answer this post and there were problems with logging into my account (I hope that is fixed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you see why I am getting frustrated with windows 10? Since I fixed this problem and it was the same as the 1607 version, I may update to that...But I will discuss it with my brother (he is in IT).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why restart messes with my computers video driver so much?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I ask many questions.</p>

                    I Just woke up to find out my E-mail account has been hacked (removed by the moderator) I already tried retrieving it but my secret question and alternate E-mail adress has been changed. I also tried filling out the form for if you cant use any of the
 other options to retrieve it but it did not work, so I'm guessing my contact info has been changed aswell. I have some important stuff linked to that account so I would appreciate any kind of help and willing to provide as much proof as possible or maybe just
 an IP check, looking forward to hear from you guys,<br />

            I think you were using Calender from Sidebar that located mostly in Right Side of Desktop.....to restore it<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Click on Start -&gt; All programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt;Windows Sidebar </li><li>click on the ' + ' sign found at the top-right corner of the Desktop </li><li>then add Calender </li></ul>

    <title>Windows 10 Cannot start Applications with exe &#40;0Xc00000e5&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> onetonbunny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Cannot start Applications with exe &#40;0Xc00000e5&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have had a look through all the other posts on this and similar but cannot find any thing with a proper answer or that is anywhere near a similarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This refers to Windows 10 64 bit&nbsp; on Asus X550C laptop originally with Windows 8.&nbsp; Upgraded to 8.1 and then 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Comodo Dragon on my machine though not running.&nbsp; However the updater is running and it&nbsp;installed Comodo Cloud Antivirus even though I run AVG as my anti-virus software and didn't want it to install.&nbsp; During the install all my open apps closed.&nbsp; Immediately
 after this the latest updates for Windows 10 started to install. This took a couple of hours or so and needed two reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then no app will run as you get the following message ""The application was unable to start correctly ()xc00000e5). "&nbsp; The only way out onto the Internet is via "Edge" as that is part of Windows 10. Firefox, chrome, etc has the same issue. (There is
 also an issue with Windows Sticky Notes.)&nbsp; I initially though that this was all due to Comodo Cloud AV but when I try to uninstall either via the uninstall feature in Comodo when I get "RuntimeBroke.exe the server execution failed" or via the&nbsp;other method
 Comodo&nbsp;state&nbsp;via programme and features it states that the program may already have been uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other things that I have done:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Run&nbsp;SFC and get a no problem with integrity message.</li><li>Ran a complete scan with Comodo Cloud AV to see if it needs to identify the files that are OK, but that hasn't worked.</li><li>Checked&nbsp;via Services&nbsp;that Windows Installer is running and it is set to enabled and manual under system account'</li></ul>
<div>
<p>Restarted in Safe Mode with Networking.&nbsp; All apps run, except Edge which is disabled in Safe Mode.&nbsp; I can get out onto the Internet with Thunderbird, Firefox, etc.&nbsp; Tried to uninstall Comodo Cloud AV while in Safe Mode, but that doesn't work with a message
 about Windows Installer not working though it is showing as enabled in services, Manual, and again running&nbsp;under the System&nbsp;Account.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;assume that this is disabled under Safe Mode which is a pity as it was one of the ways we used to get nefarious software
 of Windows machines in earlier incarnations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am wondering if this is also part of a bad Windows 10 update that happened as Comodo Cloud AV was installing at the same time.&nbsp; It certainly wasn't as long as some to install and only needed two reboots where some have had far more.&nbsp; The other interesting
 thing is that even though I have had regularly Windows Updates installed under the "Installed Updates"&nbsp; There are only 16 from Microsoft and bar two they are all this year.&nbsp; I would have thought there would have been more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I have a back up of the laptop&nbsp; I would really like to find out what has happened and the best method to recover from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last full bzckup was a couple of months or so ago and since then incremental twice a week, the last one being early Friday
 morning before this happened.&nbsp; (This problem occurred late Friday night. )&nbsp; I also don't want to restore from the backups and the same happens again.</p>

            <p>My apologies as I never got back to the community on this one,&nbsp; and thanks to Mark Keys for his input though that was not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was in fact what I thought and the Comodo Cloud Anti-virus though the way it handled AVG being installed may have had something to do with it.&nbsp; You may not get this issue if you had removed AVG as you had intended to install Comodo Cloud AV, which I hadn't.&nbsp;
 Once I had enabled windows installer to work in safe mode I was able to remove Comodo Cloud AV and after a reboot everything went back to how it should be.</p>

<h2>            How to change the bright white Windows explorer to a less bright or a pale color</h2>
                    <p>With age vision suffers, I found the bright white background of explorers (W and I), Word, etc intolerable; changes in monitor settings and video card do little to help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to change it to a less bright white, a very pale yellow, blue, green does not matter which and hopefully without messing up (or not much) with register ( I tried online suggestions of changing H_C_User/Control Pannel/changes (but had some unexpected
 issues).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? programs?</p>

            <p>Thank you for the suggestion; unfortunately it does not answer the specific point, how to change display settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using high contrast and have wasted hours modifying colors as well as installing themes recommended in different sites, but the results have been simply awful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I use high contrast for e-mail and some pages, switch to regular for others (alt-LtShift-PrtScn), modified other programs with visual settings, and suffer with the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be soooo simple if Win 8 and 10 would just simply restore access to those settings.

    <title>driver power state failure&#47; driver irql not less than equal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lesleycelliott  say:</h3>
<h2>            driver power state failure&#47; driver irql not less than equal</h2>
                    To anyone who can help me!<br />
<br />
I have had my Dell Inspiron 1525 for just over a year now and have not had issues with it. However, about three weeks ago I started to randomly (about 3-5 times a day) get the blue screen/driver power state failure message and my computer would immediately
 restart itself. Like another person's post, this would happen while many different programs were open - firefox, internet explorer, excel, microsoft word. I have not found any single pattern to why this is occurring EXCEPT for the fact I just added a wireless
 router within the same last 3 weeks. Anytime my computer is using the wireless in my apartment, the blue screen appears. I have recently used other individual's wireless signals in different cities nonetheless and have had no problem/i.e. there has been no
 occurrence of the driverr-power-state-failure message. I wanted to know why this would be happening with a specific wireless router, or if that is the case at all? Please help! It's driving me nuts!<br />
<br />
Thank you&nbsp; - Lesley<br />
<br />
6 hours later...<br />
<br />
Ok, now my computer did it again! But the message this time was "driver irql not less than equal" - seriously, please someone help!<br />
<br />

            Hi Lesleycelliott,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
There are a number of causes that could be contributing here, but for starters verify if the router needs a firmware update.&nbsp; You can check the manufacturers website for that model of router and see if there are any updates that need to be installed to the
 router.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If this is not the case, your power options may be causing some of this status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Verify&nbsp;whether this update is applied on your system.<br />
<br />
