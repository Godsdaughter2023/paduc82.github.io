Where does it go to now?&nbsp; The screen with your wallpaper and various icons arranged on it is the desktop and that is probably where it is going to when you start it.

<h3> myhst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7&#58; Can&#39;t play full screen games</h2>
                    <p>Now I know this is a very common issue but so far I have found nothing like what I have an issue with. First of all:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acer Aspire Z5600 </li><li>Windows 7 Home 64x </li><li>Intel Pentium Dual-Core E5400 @ 2.70GHz </li><li>3.00 GB Ram </li><li>500 GB Internal Hardrive, 1 TB External Hardrive </li><li>Intel G45/G43 Express Chipset </li><li>Native resolution 1920 x 1080 </li></ul>
<p>Okay roughly 3 months ago I had no issues with full screen and every game worked perfectly. Now there are no games I have that will play in full screen without the screen going funky on me. By funky I mean it turns black, white, grey, (quarter segments Blue/Red/Green/Yellow)
 then black again and continuously go through this cycle. I have uninstalled the chipset and reinstalled with all new drivers. I have changed and Tried all resolutions in all games with always the same effect and this also happens when I try to change the native
 resolution. Nothing works but 1920 x 1080.</p>
<p>If anyone can help me that would be great. My luck it's just something simple but I have exhausted my brain on this matter for some time and I would like some help.</p>

<p>(This is written for anyone who doesn't know Windows 7 too well. Windows Vista should be the same fix. If there are any Windows XP issues like this, Post it and I will do what I can)</p>
<p>Ok I am back after a very busy holiday season and I have fixed the issue (of course it was so easy). All I did was go into my START menu, click DEVICES AND PRINTERS. Depending on what device your video card is under (Mine is in the all in one image of my
 computer) you'll want to double click that one. Move over to the HARDWARE tab and scroll down until you see your video card you have installed (You might see many options pertaining the card as well. This is fine). You're going to go into PROPERTIES of any
 and all topics containing your card and ROLL BACK THE DRIVER on the DRIVERS tab. This will take away any updates Microsoft has put onto your card thus finally allowing you to play games in full screen (resizing your resolution).</p>
<p>I checked any and all Microsoft websites/blogs/affiliates/ or even any help sites and the sad part was, there was no help to this issue. I did however find a certain little blip of info that triggered my mind to this fix. Microsoft had stated there were
 a lot of issues with updates that came out recently. That was all they said. Nothing to try and help and no info to how their going to fix this with a new update. As far as I know there will be no updates to fix this issue for the ACER Z5600 Media All In One
 Touch Screen PC.</p>
<p>If rolling back all your drivers causes any issues for any other software you have (no issues for me) then I suggest update all your drivers again and do trial and error with rolling back and updating until you have all programs happy. If they all can't
 coincide then I suggest replacing one of you're games/programs (whatever software is giving the issue) to a more reputable one.</p>
<p>Well I really hope this fix helps everyone with this issue. My life has become just that much easier and no more mind frying times, lol. If this did work for you then please click "Mark as Answer" so others can also enjoy their time again. :D</p>

<h2>            Unable to add PayPal as a payment option</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I try to add PayPal as a payment method to my account, I receive an error - see below.&nbsp; I used to have it added, but removed it&nbsp;yesterday because I didn't want my niece and nephew buying content when they were playing games unattended.&nbsp; Later that
 afternoon I tried to add it back and haven't been able to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've verified all my billing information is ithe same between PayPal and my XBox Live account.&nbsp; I have a positive balance with PayPal.</p>
<p>I checked the billing.microsoft.com site and everything looks fine there.</p>
<p>On May 10 2012 your Chat support suggested waiting 24 hours and trying again, but still no go.&nbsp; The service request number from that chat was 1176625029.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What type of payment method are you trying to add?</strong></p>
<p>PayPal</p>
<p><strong>What error code or message are you receiving?</strong></p>
<p>"Can't retrieve information from Xbox LIVE.&nbsp; Please try again later.&nbsp; Status code:&nbsp; 8382025C"</p>

<p>Hey there Bailey! I've checked into that error code and it is suggesting that your PayPal account may not meet some of the requirements set up by Xbox LIVE. Can you confirm that your PayPal account has an attached credit card, confirmed bank account, or
 positive money balance on it? Do you have another PayPal account that you could try linking to the account, just to test with? Let me know, thanks!

<p>To successfully use a Paypal account as an Xbox Live payment method, you must have a billing agreement ID from Paypal, which will set permissions to allow reoccurring payments... the issue, usually, is that Paypal may be ready to accept the charge, but won't
 authorize it for automatic renewal... this kind of block can occur if you have previously used it, removed it (thus ending the agreement), and then attempt to start it again... I would suggest contacting Paypal to check if they have a block in place and ask
 them to remove it!</p>
<p>Hope this helps your situation, if not let us know and we'll see what other options we have!</p>

    <title>Installing IKEA Kitchen Planner Tool - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariedawn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing IKEA Kitchen Planner Tool</h2>
                    To Whom It May Concern:<br />
I&nbsp;have Windows Vista Operation System.<br />
<br />
My problem is this:<br />
<br />
I had&nbsp;&nbsp;previously installed 2007 &amp; 2008 versions&nbsp;of a program titled IKEA Kitchen Planner Tool.
<br />
When I wanted to install the new 2009 version of this program, I first followed the Uninstall directions in the Vista program to remove the previous versions.<br />
After they were uninstalled, I downloaded and installed the 2009 verision.<br />
When I proceded to open the 2009 version of the IKEA Kitchen Planner Tool, the previous versions keep appearing.<br />
I believe these files are stored somewhere on my hard drive and I cannot find and permanently remove them.<br />
<br />
Everyone I know who has Windows Vista is having this same problem.<br />
<br />
I have tried System Restore and nothing I do seems to help.<br />
<br />
Could you please advise!<br />
<br />

<p>Hello Marie,<br />
<br />
In looking at the Ikea download site it does NOT state that the Kitchen Planner tool is compatible with Vista.
<br />
See the following site:<br />
<a href="http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/complete_kitchen_guide/planner_tool/download/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/complete_kitchen_guide/planner_tool/download/index.html</a><br />
<br />
At this point, if you dont know what the files&nbsp;are called it will be difficult to locate them&nbsp;as well as to uninstall them.<br />
<br />
I would suggest downloading the&nbsp;Windows Installer Clean Up Utility&nbsp;tool to uninstall ALL versions of the Kitchen planner, then create a restore point and reinstall the 2009 version.<br />
<br />
Install of&nbsp;Windows Installer Clean Up Utility&nbsp;tool:<br />
<br />
Find the tool here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</a><br />
<br />
When you install the tool you will have to be logged in as administrator of the machine.
<br />
<br />
After you download the ms1cuu2.exe to your desktop you will need to right click on it and&nbsp;select "Run as Administrator"&nbsp;and you will need to
<br />
<br />
Run the&nbsp;Windows Installer Clean Up Utility from the start menu. It will be under Programs and it will be called "Windows Install Clean Up".<br />
<br />
Create a restore point:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Select “All Programs” </li><li>Select the Accessories folder </li><li>Select the System Tools folder </li><li>Click once on the System Restore icon. <br />
After you click on the icon, if a User Account Control window opens you should click on the Continue button.
</li><li>At the bottom of the System Restore window you will see a hyperlink that says "To create a restore point open System Protection" Click it.
</li><li>This will open a "System Properties" Box. At the Bottom of the screen click the "Create" button.
</li><li>Type the name of the restore point and it will select the current date and time.</li></ol>

<p>&nbsp;In addition to dax's suggestion above,&nbsp; I would suggest going to the manufacturers website and confirm you are running the latest updates for chipset, firmware, drivers and BIOS updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also, what antivirus software are you currently running and when have you ran your last full scan?&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest if you haven't done so run some type of malware/spyware removal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. When does the clock pop up?
<p>2. Does the clock appear on the desktop or the Start menu?</p>
<p><br />
If this is from an app installed, then uninstall the app. <br />
a. On the Start screen, swipe down on or right-click the app you want to uninstall, tap or click
<span>Uninstall</span>, and then tap or click <span>Uninstall</span>.<br />
<br />
If you wan to hide the clock on task bar, then I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
a) Press “ Windows + W” key to open charms bar with settings option<br />
b) Type System icons in search field<br />
c) Select customize icons on task bar<br />
d) Select the date option and then select hide icon notification<br />
It will hide the notification from the taskbar <br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Do get back and let us know the status of the issue, I will be glad to help you further. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span><br />

                    Hello,

</div>
<div>Does Windows 7 offer a way to securely wipe a SSD? Or is there any software that I can use to do this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know that wiping an SSD is different to wiping a HDD but unsure what is a secure way to do this. My SSD doesn't have an OS on it but I do have Chrome installed on it and not sure what type of information that has.</div>
<div><br />

<div>I would be grateful for any help or advice.</div>

<h2>            New Skype for Windows 10 - prevent requirement of Admin rights</h2>
                    <p>I won't turn this into a mud slinging post about the new "improved" version of Skype that Windows 10 seems determined to force us to upgrade to, but the issue I need addressed is how to disable the local admin requirement to install the updates for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our users do not have local administrator rights, but this new Skype needs that in install, and then also requires it for any updates.</p>
<p>This is very annoying for our CEO who travels remotely and uses Skype to talk to his family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple of questions:</p>
<p>1. Can we force Windows 10 to use the old version of skype, and not try to upgrade to the new one?</p>
<p>2. if we do upgrade, how can we configure Skype to not require admin rights for further upgrades?</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can use the classic version, however there's no option to disable the message that prompts you to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are using Windows 10, I highly suggest using the UWP or the pre-installed Skype version. You can have the administrator&nbsp;disable the admin rights after updating or enabling&nbsp;your pre-installed Skype (UWP).</p>

<p>How to we prevent the updates needing admin rights?</p>
<p>Several times now, our CEO has been overseas, and Skype has tried to install an update, which then asks him for admin credentials, which he does not have.</p>
<p>We have tried the Classic Skype, but the prompt to upgrade annoys him as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft may have forgotten that organisations use their products too. Generally, staff do not have admin permissions, for security reasons. Updates to installed software (at least Microsoft branded ones) should not require admin rights.</p>
<p>Upgrades to a new major version, perhaps. But in that case, the Upgrades should be optional, not mandatory.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, Skype doesn't have any control regarding the admin rights as the restriction is set on the workstations by the ones whose controlling the network which I guess is your local ITs. You may communicate with them for further assistance on installing

<p>Thanks for taking the time to respond Sergei_P</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, that is not the answer to this question.</p>
<p>I am the IT department in my organisation, and there is no way that we are giving local administrator rights to our staff.</p>
<p>It goes against all the Security Best practices out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above, the main issue here is the admin rights required for UPDATES to Skype.</p>
<p>Installing the software for the first time, yes, admin rights should be required. For Updates, no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype does control this, the same as they control the previous version of Skype, which did not require admin rights for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many applications out there, Microsoft and otherwise, that allow updates without admin rights.</p>
<p>Skype should be the same, ESPECIALLY if it is forced upon us, as this new version is.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Sergei_P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is fine for initial installation, but very inconvenient for updates.</p>
<p>This has happened several times now for our CEO, and twice he was overseas, which made updating very difficult (I had to arrange a time where we were both available, and remote control his PC - which happened to be 9:00PM. I'm not always available at that
 time.)</p>
<p>Updates should still be able to be installed without admin approval.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft are going to force this upon us, then they need to make the updates available through Windows Update and/or WSUS, or redesign the program so that it doesn't require admin rights (which can be done, as it used to be that way)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, there needs to be an option in the previous version of Skype to prevent automatic Upgrade to the new version. In my opinion, the new version is horrible, and I know many other people would welcome that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this is within Microsoft's control, not something local IT departments should have to manage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;rant&gt; Ever since Windows 8, Microsoft seem to have forgotten that businesses use their products too. The operating systems and application changes are fine for Home users, but very restrictive and hard to manage for businesses. Even Enterprise level OSes
 are very restrictive in customisations. Apologies for vent. :) &lt;/rant&gt;</p>

<p>Microsoft with such nonsenses is pushing users to use other messangers, such as viber, facebook messenger or others.</p>
<p>Skype was perfect program, until Microsoft bougt it. It was light, fast, with minimum hardware requirements, and could run even without installation, everybody loved it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the future of skype will be the same as NOKIA.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Microsoft, you spoiled perfect program.</p>

<p>I agree with everyone else here. Skype was great, and now I have to run around reinstalling it for every user as an admin. I just did it a month or so ago, and now I need to do it again.&nbsp; In the meantime, my employees can't communicate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is supposed to be reliable and useful, right? Should we all just switch to Facebook messenger or Google chat? It is absurd that Microsoft, who makes the OS and the software, can't figure out how to let people install it without admin right... Fix it,
 or you will lose lots of customers.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Canadian French Keyboard &#40;CFR&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cemo98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canadian French Keyboard &#40;CFR&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I was forced to restore my computer to factor settings (because Windows 10 corrupted every file and app on my computer!) and now I'm trying to do my French homework but I don't know how to get the keyboard that I used to have. I have the English US keyboard
 and the Canadian Multilingual Standard (CMS) keyboard. I believe the one I had was Canadian French (CFR). I know how to add languages, but in the choices of French keyboards, the selection of Canadian French gives you CMS, not CFR. I have Windows 8.1 now,
 and when I got the computer, I don't ever remember having to change the keyboard to CFR, it was already there, which is why I'm confused as to why it isn't there after I've restored it to the factory setting. Even more, I can't add it manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, this is the keyboard that gives an apostrophe (') when you press [SHIFT][,]. As well, you have to add the accents manually except for [é]. Does anyone know how I can get this keyboard back?</p>

<h2>            New Windows installed won&#39;t connect to internet.</h2>
                    <p>I just installed a new Windows 7 Pro on a Dell Optiplex 3010.</p>
<p>Now, it won't connect to wired internet. It says it needs an updated driver installed, which would be fine if the wifi would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a usb Wifi adapter, and Windows says it's connected to the internet. Unfortunately, I can't get anywhere on Explorer because I keep getting the 404 ERROR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's not a problem with the Wifi, because I'm using the Wifi on my MacBook as I type this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it matters, I'm using CenturyLink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and suggestions would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>ReadyBoost on a BitLocker encrypted drive in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> volkerkleinhenz  say:</h3>
<h2>            ReadyBoost on a BitLocker encrypted drive in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have encrypted my 1TB USB flash drive with password-secured BitLocker. After unlocking it I set up ReadyBoost which indeed gives me a performance boost on my W7 64 bit notebook which has (only) 8GB of RAM. It works perfectly, however, after every reboot
 or removal of the flash drive, I have to re-activate/set up ReadyBoost. The ReadyBoost file is on the drive and never gets deleted but Windows 7 doesn't seem to detect it. I guess it's because the file only becomes "available" to W7 after entering the password
 to access the BitLocker-secured drive. Is there a work-around like leaving the ReadyBoost file on an extra partition which is not BitLocker-protected?

            <p><span>Hi Volker,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately, it is not possible to put the ReadyBoost file on another drive which is not BitLocker-protected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>BitLocker helps keep everything from documents to passwords safer by encrypting the entire drive that Windows and your data reside on. When you restart the computer or remove and re-add the BitLocker flash drive the BitLocker will automatically lock’s
 it. This feature is by design. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information on BitLocker and ReadyBoost refer these Microsoft articles:</span></p>

<h2>            Hi I&#39;m hoping someone can help me figure out my ongoing problem.</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to get help for months now without any real help. I have been in contact with HP, my internet service provider and Best Buy where I got my notebook and so far none of them have been any help. I am having problems with expired security
 certificates, Windows Update components and my network. </p>
<p>I guess i'll start with my network, when I have Windows create a network map I have a blue question mark after my computer named Unknown then my router then the internet.I have several files or folders that open with an Unknown application. I don't know
 if there connected to each other or not. </p>
<p>Now the security certificate problems start with the crudential manager there is a generic cert. thats name is virtialapp/didlogical . There is a password I did'nt create . When I view the certificates in the certmgr there are several certficates that say
 FRAUDLENT NOT MICROSOFT. I don't know how to fix this. I can't change my device instalation settings to only install the best drivers from Windows Update. I have tried countless times but it just changes back to yes automaticly. When I install a new program
 or down load anything It will have an expired security certificate. </p>
<p>I had 14 Windows Updates yesterday that I down loaded and installed but when I checked to see what updates installed there where only 10 that installed. They installed successfully but where did the other 4 go? When I run a troubleshooter on Windows Update
 it will repair Windows Update Components two some times 3 or 4 times in one troubleshooter. Every time I run the update troubleshooter it has to repair Windows Update Components.
</p>
<p>i have taken my notebook to Best Buy and they said it was infected with rouge software. They ran a recovery and as soon as I got home and connected to my network a window poped up on the screen that said it was installing something It happens so fast that
 I could'nt read it . Sense then I had my internet service providers computer tech come to my home and he was going to check my computer but all he did was formate the partitions and install Windows 7 pro. He said that the Intel graphics download was huge and
 when he clicked to install nothing happened. He was here 2 hours and when he left my computer in devices and printers still needed trouble shooting becouse of some Unknown device. I am very disapointed with them. i&nbsp;had bought a new router and you have to go
 online and set up your network well all I did was plug in the router and it already had my networks name and security key.
</p>
<p>If I can get some detailed instuctions I will post any logs or reports that will help identify what the problem is . I am running Windows 7 Professinal (64 bit) with AVG internet security 2012 (paid version). I have also recived the Blue Screen several times
 sence the clean install of Windows 7 pro. </p>
<p>I have been reading the more info option when I get windows updates and the RPC in running I also get error messages about the remote desktop connections and I have never set up remote connections on my computer . The info says that if I where to visit a
 specially designed web page that a hacker can do something with the RPC. I don't understand alot of the terms. I hope someone can please&nbsp;help me. Thank you

            <p>Virtualapp/didlogical is used by Windows Live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The list of fraudulent certificates is there to stop them being used. Most of them are there because of&nbsp;security breaches at Certificate Authorities in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may get more updates detected as needed than are installed. This is usually because some of the updates are superseded by other ones. Windows Update detects this when it starts installing the updates and skips the unnecessary ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that eliminates some issues for you.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for answering that question with just the answer and not the long confusing explantion . I end up more confused than befor I asked.
</p>
<p>The reason I know something isnt right with my computer is most of the programs( Windows Explorer, Internet Explorer. AVG, Intel Wifi adapter , Intel Rapid Storage) and others will show (not responding)&nbsp;next to&nbsp;the name above the menu bar. Then a window
 will pop up that asks me if I want to wait for the program to respond or close the program. Alot of the times the window will open and befor I can select an option the program will close on its own.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was finally able to log into my Windows Live account yesterday after about 3 weeks of resetting my password and then being told that I did'nt have enough disk space to open the application.
</p>
<p>When I check my email there were messages from Facebook to someone that I do't know and messages that were all these strange symbols. I have emails of 2 other people having a conversation about DHCP and DCOM servers? I don't understand how to configure a
 computer but I've learned way more than I thought sence january when I got my first computer.
</p>
<p>I have seen and read several things about Shared User accounts and Linkd IDs. The reason I am asking about this is when I view the advanced tab and click find in User's and Groups there was 31 one my last count. There is the user (pla) and (sta) . Why are
 some names capital and others are spelled properly? Also I can't keep Windows Time service running if I don't manually go and start the service it does'nt run and it set to start automaticlly. I've seen in the Event Viewer events that say Windows Time service
 Winows Time state changed then there's the time it was and what it was changed to . Last night it was 4 min and 28 sec change. I don't understand the whole import and export option otherwise I would post the logs. But thanks again for your answer you did help.

<br />
This question goes along with the post from last night. I also was able to create the remote access report. If that would help Icould post it. I also see that my network setting have a vpn as default.I connect through a router but can't seem to access any of
 those network settings. Winows Driver verifacation certificate are also all but 2 either revoked or fraudulent. Any thing you can tell me about this will be helpful . Thanks</p>

            Please help, and thank you was enough.<br />
<br />
First off, if your OS and all data is on one hard disk break it up.<br />
<br />
Let's say 10-15 gig for MS or Linux each.<br />
<br />
Another for your programs. (not your programs data)<br />
<br />
Another for your safe zone, and another for your program data.<br />
<br />
So, four PARTITIONS per hard drive. ewwwwwwwww...........every&nbsp; time........ every drive......<br />
<br />
Without doubt since 2000 Pro &amp; Lindows I have not lost any bookmark or any other data.<br />
<br />
Linux wants a separate swap, but no biggie. It will adjust and be good without.<br />
<br />
In other words. The OS needs 10 gig, use the rest for your stuff.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Stereo Mix Device Missing - But Not in Vista - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Stereo Mix Device Missing - But Not in Vista</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
When I had Vista I was able to right click inside the "Recording" tab and check "Show Disabled Devices" and the Stereo Mix recording device would be shown as grayed. After enabling the device I was easily able to record from stereo.<br />
<br />
This is no longer the case with Windows 7. I right click on "Show Disabled Devices" as well as "Show Disconnected Devices" yet **nothing** appears. I'm very very upset and disappointed.
<br />
<br />
One would think that "drivers" might have something to do with it... If so, then Windows 7 is lacking the drivers that Vista had? super counter-intuitive. This is an issue with Windows, I'm 100% sure of it.
<br />
<br />
I've done a Google search for possible solutions and a lot of people are having the same problem and yet there is not a single solution to this problem. I'm 100% sure it's not the drivers b/c it worked great on Vista.<br />
<br />
What can I do please?

<p>Unless you can get help from that website you will probably not be able to solve your problem.&nbsp; It's their software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen similar batch files on the internet so I suppose it is possible that another source will provide enough information for you to figure out what has gone wrong.&nbsp; You could try searching for
<em>lock folder without special software</em> or similar.</p>

    <title>windows 10 upgrade freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> druidar  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 upgrade freezes</h2>
                    <p>I have tried twice today (july 30th 2015)to upgrade windows 10 it gets to 71% a blank screen comes up with an arrow in the middle &amp; my whole computer freezes nothing works at all.</p>
<p>I have to unplug it from the mains &amp; reinstall windows 7 64bit, this is just not right &amp; microsoft should have got windows 10 set up better to upgrade no wonder it is free its rubbish and impossible to install.</p>
<p>my computer is an HP i5 with 400gb of free space &amp; 8gb memory so no excuse for this not to install.</p>
<p>does anyone know why this happens &amp; how I can install it without it freezing.</p>
<p>if not I will stay with windows 7 64 bit it has been no trouble at all, I was hoping windows 10 would be a good upgrade it seems I was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are numerous suggestions by people on here on what to do but none of them work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>still waiting for some REAL answers to this problem which I have noticed thousands of people are having the same problems so it is obvious that there is something wrong with the windows 10 upgrade software, so microsoft should not have released it until
 it was perfectly safe to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now tried to upgrade over ten times, a complete waste of time &amp; effort its disgusting that microsoft have caused customers all this hassle.</p>

<p>
</p><p>After successful install and installing Intel MEI drivers it would enter the infamous 20 minutes boot then BSOD loop again just like during upgrade.</p>

            Uninstall the software.<br />
Restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Open the PrintMaster 2012 installation disc or point to where the installation files are located.<br />
<br />
Right click the setup file and click Run as administrator. <br />
<br />
See if you are able to enter the activation code again when prompted.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 8 to 8.1 Lock Screen picture won&#39;t change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fred lr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 to 8.1 Lock Screen picture won&#39;t change</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded/updated my laptop from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; After the upgrade/update, I am unable to change the Lock Screen picture.&nbsp; Although I browse system picture choices and my own saved pictures, click on the one I want (change image), the
 rotating dots continue to rotate but the lock start preview does not display my selection nor does the lock start screen change from the factory/default 8.1 rainbow.&nbsp; Detailed instructions to change the lock start picture, not the desktop back ground, will
 be appreciated.</p>
<p>Help and Thanks,</p>
<p>Fred LR</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is the issue specific to that picture?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As it is taking long time to display the preview, suggest you to
<span>boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include
 antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></span></span></p>
