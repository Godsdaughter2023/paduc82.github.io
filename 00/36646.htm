    <title>Screen Shaking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viviansmith1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Shaking</h2>
                    <p>I purchased my Surface Pro 4 through Microsoft 2 years ago and had it delivered to Canada as I live in Costa Rica 10 months out of the year.&nbsp; I did not get extra warranty as I cannot get it repaired in Costa Rica and if I try to ship it for repairs, it will
 in all likelihood disappear.&nbsp; For the last 2 months the shaking of the screen has gotten noticeably worse and now I can hardly read anything on it.&nbsp; It is noticeably worse when the tablet is hot.&nbsp; I have tried all the updates, diagnostic tool, deleting and
 installing device manager...etc.&nbsp; Still doing it quite badly. &nbsp; Any new solutions?&nbsp; Because I live in a tropical country it heats up really quickly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had my old Samsung device for 5 years and perhaps should have gone with another Samsung product as the Surface Pro was a lot more money and this is only year 2 and I will probably be looking for another tablet.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried any workarounds?&nbsp; E.g. in case the heat problem is confined to a particular area of the tablet you could try an appropriate orientation to try to keep it at the top.&nbsp; Also, do you have a second screen you could use the Surface with?&nbsp; Some
 say that there is no shaking on it and if you were using it as Second Screen Only surely there would be less heat being generated anyway.&nbsp; You would need a mouse and keyboard to try a different orientation but you would need that anyway to use a second screen
 (unless you used the Tablet's screen for a Touch keyboard and mouse pad.)</p>

            Thanks for the response.&nbsp; It is the whole screen.&nbsp; Sometimes stops if I touch the screen. Works good if my Surface Pro is not warm/hot but really bad otherwise.&nbsp; No second screen as I am usually sitting in the living room on a sofa.&nbsp; Too much paraphernalia!&nbsp;
 &nbsp;We have ceramic tile floors so it resides flat on the tile and off unless I want to use it.

            1 Smart TV + husband and Netflix!!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; So not likely and I am techy challenged in any event!&nbsp; I have deleted all Apple apps that I could see and turn my Surface Pro off between uses making sure it doesn't get too hot and so far......fingers crossed.....!!!!&nbsp;
 &nbsp;No shaking screen!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I can only hope!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Well if the TV is ever free for you to use, try it.&nbsp; It's pretty easy.&nbsp; Press Win-k and see if your TV is found by the Connection dialog.&nbsp; Other methods of reaching the same thing include swiping from the right (to open the Action Center) and tapping Connection.&nbsp;
 Then you could use the same dialog to change the display configuration (if desired) by using its Change projection mode link.&nbsp; Also note that you could do this with your tablet having a different orientation from the attached screen, which could allow you
 to direct the heat up to a particular edge while still seeing and using other things in a normal landscape orientation.</p>

            I have done everything as suggested including all updates and removed all Itunes and Icloud apps on my Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; Instead of leaving my Surface Pro 4 on Sleep, I do a shutdown when not in use and do not let it get too hot and all my problems seem
 to have disappeared!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Fingers crossed!!!!

    <title>Ownership Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliemeier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ownership Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I messed up. I was trying to alter some folders, run some commands and such. I was getting notifications that I needed permission from the administrator (despite being the administrator). So my dumb self decided to go in and give my account ownership
 of C: drive and all subfolders. Well, shortly after that process began, I realized it was probably a bad idea so I cancelled it, however there were some folders that had already been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I had a system restore point from yesterday that I was going to restore to. However, when I try to restore, I get "System Restore could not access a file". I am suspecting it's because I changed ownership and now system restore needs elevation to make
 the changes. So I have shot myself in the foot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next thought is to create recover media and reinstall OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a step I can take prior to doing that? I am currently backing up my files to Google Drive/Onedrive in preparation for reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

<p>that will not hurt taking ownership, but I would also then look in the list of users on the ownership page and make sure your user account name is there with full permissions. Probably not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>even though you take ownership of an item, you may not be in the list of users&nbsp;with permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>first select disable inheritance, then&nbsp;select "ADD"&nbsp;in the list of users, and add your user account the same way you took ownership and select full permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then administrators may only have select permissions in the list. so after you disable inheritance, delete admins user. then select add again and select admins in the list and select full permissions</p>

<h2>            Cannot install KB2919442 because &#34;It is not applicable to &#91;my&#93; computer.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Since I cannot install KB2919442, I would not be able to install KB2919355.&nbsp;<br />
Despite me being able to see KB2919355 available in Windows Update, it shows nothing for KB2919442...which is odd because I checked the Microsoft download center and it clearly says I need that update as a prerequisite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I tried the following things:<br />
• I ran the Windows Update troubleshooter several times. (It says it fixed the problems including error 0x80070057, but it clearly hasn't. I ran the troubleshooter multiple times, and at the first time, it says the problems were fixed. If these problems truly
 were fixed, I shouldn't be seeing them in the second and following times I ran the troubleshooter.)<br />
• I ran all my security software if something else was involved like a virus. I ran Spybot, Adwcleaner, Malwarebytes, and Norton Internet Security. Still, nothing.</p>
<p>• I downloaded the standalone update for KB2919442 on the Microsoft download center, temporarily disabled my internet connection and security, and ran the .msu. Still, again, nothing.&nbsp;<br />
• I guessed that the update probably was already on my computer, so I ran Command Prompt as admin and tried to uninstall KB2919442. It replied by saying that the update was never installed on my computer.&nbsp;<br />
• I guessed that, since it said it was inapplicable to my computer, I can go ahead and try to install KB2919355. I tried with the standalone installer and with Windows Update. At restart, the updates would stop at 30%, crash my computer, and try to restart
 sporadically. It went to fast that I couldn't see an error code, either. I had to run a system restore in order to make my computer stable.<br />
• I tried installing both KB2919442 and KB2919355 with a clean boot, and I got the same results as the above points.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked other topics in the Microsoft community regarding this problem, and I have yet to find a solution.</p>
<p>Is there any updates I need as prerequisites to these? Or just suggested ones that happen to help?</p>
<p>Or just any help in general? Please and thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run an HP Pavillion TS 15 Notebook 64-bit operating system with 12 GB of RAM on Windows 8.1. I have had this laptop for only a couple of weeks. So, I highly doubt age is an issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Lea,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may face this issue if Windows files are corrupted. Let’s follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>It is not recommended to use multiple antivirus program on the computer. It may cause system stability. I would suggest you to temporarily disable antivirus program and firewall and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Warning: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This article describes how to run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files. If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave
 as expected.</span></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>You can use DISM restore health command to fix Windows 8.1 update issues. Refer this Microsoft article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System Update Readiness Tool fixes Windows Update errors</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

            <p>Hello CLockeryby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your password is not working for your Surface Pro 3. I'll help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what exact error you are getting, but it can take a few moments for the internet connection to establish a link to the authentication system for your Microsoft account. If you type in the password during this time, you can receive an erroneous
 password error message. You should wait a few moments and try again, perhaps a couple more times to make sure that establishing a connection with the authentication system is not the issue in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the lag when restarting, did you have any open programs that had to close? Also, was your system preparing an update for installation? Finally, do you have all updates installed? We recommend checking this through Control Panel. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Desktop</span></li><li><span>Swipe from right and&nbsp;select&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span></li><li><span>Choose&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Control&nbsp;Panel</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows&nbsp;Update</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Check&nbsp;for Updates</span></li><li>You may find that there are other updates to install. If so, install them and restart your Surface.</li></ul>
<p>Let us know if that helps. We're here to help with any problems or questions you may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Wishes,</p>
<p>Zack_T</p>

    <title>White patch on the screen - bottom middle - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            White patch on the screen - bottom middle</h2>
                    I noticed that there is a white pale patch on the bottom middle side of the screen. The touch is still sensitive. But the patch becomes evident when the screen is black. I read on the internet that it could be a pressure point from the keyboard or something.
 How do I remove it? I wonder if it would grow and make the screen obscure.

            What is "disabled all the boots in Msconfig"?&nbsp; You mean all the Services or Startup entries?<br />
<br />
When the computer boots tap the F8 key after the BIOS POST screen and before Windows starts to boot to get to the Advanced Boot menu and select the "Last Known Good Configuration"<br />

    <title>Subscription is the way to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gameshoes3003  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subscription is the way to go&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>So I'm sure that many of you have noticed, our technology has been moving from hard copy to personal digital, and then now from personal digital to subscription. There's also microtransaction but I believe that it falls under the subscription based category.
 We all understand that all of these models have existed alongside each other for over 7 years. An example that demonstrates this is music. You can buy a CD, or you can download it online, or you can now pay a music streaming service for that song/album.<br />
<br />
Another example would now be Microsoft Office (a biggy for many of us). This is also the example I will use moving forward. I believe that you can still buy a box from the store shelf of the latest version of office, but now you can also purchase a digital
 copy (Office Home $220 / Pro $400). Okay, that's great, you can get Office 2013 for three to five computers and all of the updates for them over the years. Here's the third model. Buy Office 365 for $100 a year (personal home use up to five devices) and not
 only do you get Office Pro, but you get other services, such as an expanded SkyDrive cloud drive, but you also get the latest version of office. That means when say... Office 2016 comes out, you will get Office 2016.
<br />
<br />
<em>NOTE: There are student prices, but I'm not going to use those values. Also when my currency is USD.<br />
<br />
</em>Okay... looking at those prices, the subscription based model seems a bit pricey over time, however the upfront cost isn't as much. The subscription model also guarantees that you will be up to date as well. Compare the two costs: until Office 2016 would
 come out, you would pay the flat $220 for Office 2013 until you need (we all know you don't really need to) to upgrade whereas you would pay $300 for Office 365 - an $80 difference. On the other hand, Office 365 is cheaper than getting the Office Pro version;
 so if you need Access and Publisher, office 365 is probably the way to go. <br />
<br />
Okay, okay, I think I've explained enough. Here's the question:<br />
<strong>Would you pay for games that use a subscription based model?<br />
<br />
</strong>Yes, I know such games already exist. There's World of Warcraft, EVE Online, etc, etc. And yeah, their model is basically what I'm after.</p>
<p>Let's make a hypothetical scenario:<br />
[quote user="Hypothetical Scenario"]<br />
Okay, here's the deal. A new game is coming out but it has a subscription based model and the cost shall be $50 yearly or $8 monthly. With this, you will get all of the add-ons (DLC) - sounds like season passes, eh? - and whatever other feature there is. However,
 to please the masses there will also be a hard/digital copy that will be sold for $60 but all DLC shall cost $15-20 each and there shall be four of them (total $60-80) in one year.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Let's compare our options here. Starting with the hard copy you get the base game for $60, but then if you want to stay up to date you will need to spend additional funds. If we say the DLC was $15 each, and you buy all of them, you spend a total of $120.
 But you keep it FOREVER (hopefully). For one year, you can spend $50 buy say that you really like that game and you didn't get enough time to play that last DLC since it came out at the end of your subscription, you spend $100 for two years. But after those
 two years, if you do not put more money in, you no longer have the game. Then you have the $8 per month model which is more along the lines of, "hey, I just want to try the game with all of its bells and whistles" (bye bye Gamefly).</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Now then, <strong>Would you pay for games that use a subscription based model?</strong> I think it would be rather tempting. Some games I play don't even last a month for me such as, Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I only played that game for 3 weeks to beat it
 once and have never touched it again since. So in my case, I would throw in $8 for that one month. But say the game was Call of Duty: Black Ops (which I actually liked, thank you) but I'm skeptical of it since I had a sour MW2 experience. I could then throw
 in $8 and play it, then if I like it I'll pitch in the $50. <em>Then let's assume that MW3 doesn't roll out the next year for this next part.</em> Then because I liked BLOPs so much, I go for another year for a grand total of $108 but I've been able to enjoy
 all of the DLC in the meantime. <em>Then now we can say MW3 came out and then I dropped BLOPs only to hate MW3 and regret paying $50 for one year, which is still less than the $60 hard copy, and then I'll throw another $8 at BLOPs just to enjoy it for another
 month ($116 total).<br />
<br />
</em></p>
<p>So over time I have paid more for Black Ops than just buying the base hard copy and I've come close to that $120 mark (the cost of game + 4 DLC at $15). But then now I no longer posses the game. I can't resell it for the $5 it's worth by then.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I know that this isn't exactly the best example because DLC falls more under the subscription based model (you want to play longer with new content? Pay $15, bam, that's subscription based). So I'm almost comparing apples to apples. Maybe using the Sims
 3 and their $400 worth of DLC (I have no idea what it actually is, I just know it's high) would have been a better example.
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, <strong>Would you pay for games that use a subscription based model?</strong></p>
<p>You know what? I would.</p>

<p>Just to add onto this. I understand that there are subscription based games out there currently such as World of Warcraft. However, these games require much investment to advance into the end game. Here, I am talking about only applying the subscription
 based model onto the games we play on the console. It doesn't take 1000 hours to get to level 80 in Call of Duty. Sure maybe 15th prestige, but that's not needed to have access to all of the items. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Developers cry so much that they are losing money to used games sales that I think if you buy a game "new" you should get all the dlc anyway and not pay extra. I wouldn't like subscription based games tbh.</p>

<p>Or that haved compatabletiy DLC only haved one out ____ of the dlc. Like in HALO 4. You only get one map. And paid version get all the maps. But you might do it better by making the map pak free over time.</p>

<p>I would rather have a hard copy than digital or subscription based, least I will be able to play the hard copy when I want and the hard copy is mine, with digital copies they can withdraw there availability at any time and that is it, gone for good. &nbsp;If
 all full games become digital downloads only then I will be done with current and future gaming, plenty of old games on older machines for me to play and at a fraction of the price.</p>

<p>I read most of your post. I wouldn't play subscription-based games, which is mostly the reason I haven't played some of the best MMO's (because of their subscription costs!)</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">--</span></p>
<p>Though sooner or later I do need to try FF XI on Xbox 360, especially now with a new expansion pack out...</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">--</span></p>
<p>Subscriptions are a waste of money, because you're paying a fee assuming you have time to play the game. Unless you have s rock-solid schedule and time to spare, then subscription-based services may be okay for some people.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">--</span></p>
<p>I had Playstation Plus for 2 years, at first I thought it was cool, but then I realized I'm getting overloaded with too many games that I have no interest in playing. I let my subscription expire and then had fun deleting over 85 GB worth of games. They
 just turned into trials once the subscription expires. (Much like a subscription to a game service, it's only worthwhile if you have a subscription, which makes you want to constantly pay for it)...</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">--</span></p>
<p>I like hard copies of games. If I'm going to have to do a subscription, let me customize the subscription to my choosing. Similar to cable companies, they want for me to pay $150 for a premium bundle channel for channels I don't even want just for one channel
 I do want. I would never do that.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">--</span></p>
<p>Even the season passes sound ridiculous. We live in a world where capitalism has taken over, it's more about money than ever before.This started with the cool concept of downloadable content, only to find out that much of the DLC is actually already on the
 disc (or where they already have it ready but wait to release on the marketplace instead of including it on the disk!! Soon we are going to buy a game with hardly anything on it, and the rest will be DLC.) Now it's gotten to worse levels than that...consumers
 did speak about Sim City though, finally people are waking up :D</p>

<p>I think I need more coffee, but the idea is that you pay a flat fee for the game plus all DLC for that year? Then after the year if you don't want to play it anymore, you cancel the subscription, and lose access to everything, even the core game?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I would go for that for certain games, but I like the idea that in 20 years I can go back and play my hard copy of a game. There's no longevity with a digital/ subscription model.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can see here that you want to add or change the current administrator name as well as the email but retain all your files and programs. To answer your question, there’s no way we can mirror your current account to the new account that you want to add.
 However, you can add a new user account and grant that account to have access to your files by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on the file that you want to share.</li><li>Click on <strong>Share with</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Specific </strong><strong>people...</strong></li><li>In the <strong>File Sharing</strong> window, select the user whom you want to share the file with.</li><li>Click on <strong>Share</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back should you have further concern.</p>
<p>

<p>The Account is the Security ID not the name. If you change the User name at a system level then because the SID remains the same it still has access to the same files and programs because it still points to the same user profile folder (changing the user
 name does not change the name of the user folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is the user management screens in Windows 10 do not allow you to change the name directly. There is no dialogue to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you logging in as a Microsoft Account or a Local Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you create a new user with Admin privileges apart from files actually stored in the original profile is there something the new user loses? If you were then to copy all files from the old Admin user to the new and they could access all programs you could
 delete the old admin account and&nbsp;you have essentially changed the Admin Account name.</p>

    <title>Need help choosing which version of Word to buy.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cheri1957  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help choosing which version of Word to buy....</h2>
                    <p>Due to a recent crash, I lost the Word program I had. So now I have to buy a new one. I Prefer to stick with Word as I know it (I think version I had was 2009).&nbsp; I started this PC 2 years ago brand new with Win 7 and then did the free upgrade to&nbsp; Win 10
 this past september. </p>
<p>I need help choosing which version of Word to get. Good grief there are so many versions and options!&nbsp; I am a PC novice and just on a home PC that only I use. I will mainly use the program for word processing and things related to that. I know some about
 downloading and all that, but the technical details, not so good knowing about! I don't do games or download tons of stuff and am not all over the internet etc, and I use an external hard drive for saving things as opposed to saving everything on the C drive.
 I prefer to not get the most current as they always have bugs to be worked out and I am not good at dealing with the bugs! So I think to stick with a more current previous version.
</p>
<p>In looking, which do you think is the best or would serve me best? I have read all that they both do, but...what is the difference between them besides the price? And...I don't know about the 32/64 - License- 1 PC thing.. I assume the 1 PC means it can only
 go on one PC where others can be used on multiple ones.</p>
<p>

            Will it work with the current documents I have (saved on external HD)&nbsp; that I created in Word? And also, I email things often to others, and in the past when I had a non-Word software/program, they told me it didn't come through as they had Word and I
 didn't. Is that an issue with the program you mention?

            <p>It will read all of your present documents, and It should do everything well. It is worth a try at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember basck in the good old days of WordPerfect for Windows and AmiPro/WordPro that 'converted' documents didn't always fare too well, and that is also true of different Word editions too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do try it, and you should, when first opened in Writer, go to TOOLS &gt; OPTIONS &gt; LOAD/SAVE &gt; General and change the default file format to 'Microsoft Word 2007 - 2013 XML'

<h2>            Controller randomly not working for Sonic &#38;amp&#59; Sega All-Stars Racig</h2>
                    
<p>When playing Sonic &amp; Sega All Star Racing, randomly the controller won't respond to the green A button, which allows you to use the very important power ups.&nbsp; I say randomly because it is literally a guessing game as to which of my 4 controllers is going
 to work.&nbsp; I've tried restarting the system to see if it would reset them, but all it does is change which controller will work in the game.&nbsp; Outside of the games all the controllers work fine.&nbsp; This is a problem even when only 1 or 2 controllers are&nbsp;turned
 on&nbsp;as well.</p>

<p>Greetings, AlienRose! If I understand correctly this issue only occurs when playing this one title, correct? It also seems like you have tried using different controllers. Are they wired, wireless, or a combination of both? If you attempt to play the game
 using a different console does the problem reproduce? Keep me posted! :)</p>

<p>So far it seems to only be for this one title. &nbsp;I only have wireless controllers and don't know anyone with an xbox 360 to try the game on. &nbsp;There was only the one controller activated and not working for the one button, after restarting the system it did
 work again, but the next time we tried to repeat it, it didn't work. &nbsp;It seems to be a game of roulette as to which controllers are going to work every time the xbox is turned off.</p>

<p>So it is now seeming to be the one sign in. &nbsp;If a control isn't working for the power ups, by simply signing out of my son's account, the same controller now works. &nbsp;So it looks like we are starting over and hoping the same thing doesn't happen after we
 have unlocked and accomplished as much as we have.</p>

<p>Another useful tip for all games is to make sure that none of the buttons or joy sticks are being pressed when the game is cut on. Sometimes this changes their 'Default' positions and can cause issues during play. When this happens, a simple reset is required.</p>

    <title>What is &#39;System Reserved&#39;&#63; Why does it appear as a Hard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What is &#39;System Reserved&#39;&#63; Why does it appear as a Hard Drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>I've just re-built my gaming PC, and as a result, it features 5 HDD's.</p>
<p>It's now showing a 6th Disk, called 'System Reserved' (70.3MB free of 99.9MB)</p>
<p>Checking Disk Management, I see this is a partition(?) on a 75Gb HDD from my old PC, that has Home Premium version of 7 64bit OS installed.</p>
<p>My new system has Ultimate 7 64bit OS installed, which is the actual OS I'm using.</p>
<p>I read in a linked question, that System Reserved is usually a partition containing files needed to boot up.</p>
<p>Does this suggest that this System Reserved contains the boot files for my old OS? As it's only 29.6GB, is it large enough to be that? When I 'open in new window' it's saying empty, but I gather it's really files I can't access.</p>
<p>I'm quite happy to leave it alone, but am curious as to why it's listed as another disk?</p>
<p>Also, if it is boot files, and I chose to format the rest of the disk it's on, what would it boot?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Phil :)</p>

<h3> nealbonner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidently clean installed Win10 Pro instead of Home edition. Do I need to clean install again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently Upgraded one of my Windows 7 PC's to Windows 10, though after some crashes i decided to create a usb installer and&nbsp; clean install the OS. I then accidentally chose Win10 pro rather than Home Edition and now it won't accept my PC's&nbsp; activation
 code.<br />
<br />
I'm sure if i clean install again i will be able to choose home edition and activate it as normal, but is there a way to just down grade to Home Edition without without deleting everything again? Took me ages to install all my games and programs again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I would like to inform you that there is no such option to down grade from Pro to Home Edition without deleting everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer to the suggestions provided by Andre Da Costa replied on January 30, 2016 in the below link.</p>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/downgrade-from-windows-10-pro-to-windows-10-home/f3f813d8-4b5c-4415-bb4d-a5b281d9cabd"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/downgrade-from-windows-10-pro-to-windows-10-home/f3f813d8-4b5c-4415-bb4d-a5b281d9cabd</span></a></div>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;you have not upgraded the Windows previously and the Windows is not activated, you cannot perform clean installation. However, if you perform clean installation there will be an activation issue or&nbsp;you have&nbsp;to buy the Windows 10 activation key. To get
 the Windows 10 free upgrade, first upgrade to Windows 10 either through Windows update or using Windows 10 ISO. Once you upgrade to Windows 10 and the windows is activated you can perform clean installation there will be no activation required, since the activation
 key will be injected to the motherboard. </p>

<h2>            Dell Latitude 3540 not proceed to hibernate or stand-by state completely in Win-10, 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10, 64-bit in my Dell Latitude 3540. When I put my laptop to hibernate or close my lid to put it on stand-by it closes the screen and other IO devices but do not go to the selected stage. Fans and power light keep showing as it is halt
 in some state. Then I have to long press the power button then it goes to the selected state. For example, I selected hibernate option and after few seconds all the IO devices goes to hibernate mode except fan and power light. Then I have to long press the
 hardware power button to put it in hibernate mode and it goes to hibernate not force shutdown. Is this a bug or I am missing something? Please help.</p>

            Thank you for your response. I was having this issue from day first when Win 10 got released. Previously, Win 8/8.1 works very well without issues. Yes I already have the latest drivers and windows updates installed. Tried all your given steps already
 but no luck. According to my knowledge this is a bug related to power state which don't put the power to hibernate or stand-by state in this model of laptop. I have same 10 laptops (Latitude 3540) in my organization and all are having same exact problem. &nbsp;

            I am sorry but the problem still persists. There is no issue in power management at software level I believe. It won't give proper instruction to the power state to go to hibernate or stand-by mode. Please note it as a bug.

            Hi. I am from Brazil, and I have a Latitude 3540 too, with the same problem you have described, that has started on the same moment: the Win10 update. All of my drivers are updated, but the problema still persists. In my case, the wifi and power lights
 remain on, but if you hit some key, or touchpad, nothing happens, unless you press the power button for 5s, then the laptop turns off, and I have to press power button again to go on. I haven't found any solutions yer, even on Dell's website. Boring, too boring
 this issue...

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will need a codec to play the video file. A codec is software that is used to compress or decompress a digital media file, such as a song or video.<span>Windows</span> Media Player and other programs use codec to play and create digital media
 files.<br />
You may refer to the below link for further guidance on the issue-</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You may use the below provided link and check if you get the required codec to download as per the file type you are trying to play -<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also use your favorite search engine to download and install a codec as per the file type you need to use.<br />
