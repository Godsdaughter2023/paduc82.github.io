<h2>            Questions about using the Twitch App on the Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>..........</p>
<p>Hello everyone&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>I have some questions about using the Twitch App on the Xbox One</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Can the viewers see the player check / send messages?</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Can the viewers see / hear the players Party chat text messages / voices while playing the game?&nbsp; Can the viewers see the player respond by text message / hear the player's voice&nbsp;responses?</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; Can the viewers see the player navigate the Xbox One dashboard?</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>The reason that I'm asking&nbsp;these questions is&nbsp;because I don't use Twitch and I am curious about it&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>...........</p>

<p>Hello Lei Fang :)</p>
<p>I've unlocked a few achievements by simply viewing Twitch (although sadly none of these are worth any points), and unfortunately I don't engage with the platform as either a "user" or "subscriber" because this requires signing up with Twitch offsite. It's
 baffling, because there are plenty of other [viewer] settings, but not the most important one... *if* you want to post comments to User's channels.</p>
<p>When a Twitch User is streaming, you can view other people's comments in a chat window, but the Twitch User can only reply to comments from other "users" or "subscribers". Sorry that I couldn't be more specific, but since Twitch is a free app, what's the
 harm in trying it out for yourself, Lei Fang?</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night :)</p>

<p>Oh wait, I missed the part where you're asking if viewers can see *your* dashboard and settings if in fact you're streaming? Well, the majority of Twitch Users have dedicated apps that run independent of the platform - usually from a high-end PC - and they
 can set their own parameters and UI, so sometimes you might see an Xbox One dashboard or other personal settings. It all depends upon the User :)</p>

<p>Hi Lei,</p>
<p>Reading back on my post it comes across a little short which it wasnt meant to (typing on a phone rather than standard browser).</p>
<p>As bluswirl pointed out, most big streamers tend to use others apps on their PCs to limit what can and cant be seen but in general, here are the answers that i know:</p>
<p>1. by default, yes they can see the messages sent and received</p>
<p>2. yes, if the party chat users select their audio to be heard (they receive a pop up to let them know a party member is using twitch and they can opt in or out of being heard</p>
<p>3. Yes by default they can see you browsing the dashboard.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>Twitch is very easy to use.</p>
<p>You go in and select broadcast.</p>
<p>You can then see the options you have when broadcasting.</p>
<p>If you have Kinect you can show yourself playing or not do so.</p>
<p>If you're in a party you can make that available to the people watching or do not do that.</p>
<p>Before you start broadcasting you can preview what people are seeing.</p>
<p>Also there is a chat function that you may participate in or completely ignore. &nbsp;You don't even have to look at it as you play.</p>

<p>Actually with the Xbox One Twitch app viewers can't see you navigate the dashboard, it pauses the stream when you back out of the game and they also cannot see your messages, notifications or snapped apps. If the game happens to crash, it completely stops
 the stream as it seems to be directly tied to the game you're streaming and not the console itself.</p>
<p>I've had a lot of personal experience with the Xbox One Twitch app which is complete trash. I now use a capture card to my PC and run OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) which shows all activity on the console, like dashboard navigation and messages. Also if
 the game crashes the stream continues to run.</p>
<p>You can also set constant keyframe intervals, bitrate and resolutions which again the Xbox One Twitch app can't do. Well I mean there are settings for a few of those things, but when you check the Twitch dashboard the app really doesn't do its job.</p>

<p>The app on the Xbox One is OK for streaming. You can voice chat with viewers by starting a private party and selecting it in the app so the players you are playing with can't hear your stream.</p>
<p>The text chat interface is pretty much useless. I use a twitch app on a tablet if I decide to text chat with viewers.</p>

    <title>How do I turn automatic emoticons OFF in Windows Mail&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I turn automatic emoticons OFF in Windows Mail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using the Mail desktop app that came with my Windows 10 laptop. It's perfect for me in every regard, except that it keeps automatically converting my text into emoticons, which I DO NOT WANT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can click 'undo' after each smiley face to unmake the emoticon, but that is time consuming and fiddly and I just want it to not auto-convert by default. How do I switch this off?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>For better assistance, we'd like to ask the following: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How do you access your e-mail? Is it through web or desktop application? </li><li>Are you using Outlook.com or Outlook desktop application? If you are using Outlook, can you provide the Office version?
</li><li>Did you make any changes in your e-mail's settings prior to this issue? If yes, please provide more details.</li></ul>
<p>We are looking forward to your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>I'm using the desktop application. It is not Outlook. The app just calls itself Mail, and came with the Windows 10 installation on the computer. Outlook is also installed on the computer, but I don't use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think I've made any changes to the settings, no. I only set up my account with this app yesterday and I haven't done anything strange with it.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the information. To turn-off your emoticons on Windows Mail application, we suggest following the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch your Mail application. </li><li>Press <strong>ALT + F+ O + M</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Compose </strong>tab, uncheck the <strong>Convert special keystrokes to emoticons.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Apply </strong><strong>&gt; OK.</strong></li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

I'm sorry but you're an idiot. All you do is suggest to submit feedback. MS wants all of us to buy into their ecosystem and then they turn around and force us to have auto-emojis on by default with no way to turn this off. Nobody wants this feature but MS is
 turning into Apple, so that means we can't have choices. <br />

<p>Just chipping in that this behavior is indeed absolutely annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Auto-Emojis shouldn't be activated by default -- when the recipient isn't on a Windows System he/she can't see them and just sees a single pointless character (if you ever wondered, that's why so many people write a single letter "J" in e-mails).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again: this is annoying and there shouldn't any feedback to Microsoft necessary. This "feature" is nothing but annoying and pointless and shouldn't even be a thing.</p>

            Yeah this is a terrible feature and not being able to disable it is pretty annoying. It does follow the trend MS has had with W10 with removing choice though so I guess it's not surprising.

<p>Yeah I don't know. &nbsp;When making a new tag, a bunch of names I wanted weren't visible when I searched for them, but I wasn't allowed to register the name. &nbsp;Makes me wonder if they were users that ended up getting banned.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure if the "deleting old tags" things helped. &nbsp;I haven't logged onto my first tag (from when Halo 2 just came out) in years (the email and password combo is long forgotten) but it was never deleted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[/quote]<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">If it's a "GFWL" or "Zune" tag it will still show up as a used tag.&nbsp; I think the problem is spacing in the words. If I wanted to change my name to "TripleAitch" (no spaces), or "Man Handler" (with a space), I couldn't
 use them because you already have them in a different configuration.<br />

<h2>            Movie Maker in Windows Essentials 12</h2>
                    Every time I try to upload a video to Youtube through Movie Maker, it asks for my username and password (to sign in). So I type in my password, and I guess it is too long, because I try to type the last digit and it won't let me. However, when I type it
 into Microsoft.com, it works fine. How do I make it work??????? :( :( :( :(

                    <p>I would have thought this would be very simple, but this is becoming very difficult. This is for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The stability of Computer A is becoming more and more questionable. I decided I should keep backups of my files. I was able to copy a sample batch of files using filehistory (which was very glitchy) and now my files are in the drive with a date appended
 to each file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To experiment, I plugged my external drive into Computer B and attempted to copy the sample batch. However, the filehistory program insisted I turn on backups, which later resulted in creating a backup for Computer B. It didn't even recognize my files from
 Computer A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I otherwise could manually copy each file, but it would require an extraordinary effort as there is a date appended to each individual file. Who programmed this kind of behavior? I am not willing to change the file name for 10,000+ files. Especially when
 it comes to program files, which probably would no longer work if the file name has dates appended to its file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this can be done. If not, I find filehistory useless as if the computer crashes, it would not be able to restore files to the original computer. Maybe if I can turn off that appending nonsense, I could manually copy the files from the drive?</p>

            See Glen Gailey’s reply here:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/file-history-and-restore-to-another-pc/fb69aacd-eac7-41fe-869d-a7000b0e21f8">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />The answer is still good for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />He states:
<br />I just had to try to do this, and I was able to (on a new Win8 machine) point at the previous backup by clicking Drives and then selecting my backup drive (a network share in my case). Then I was able to check "I want to use a previous backup on this File History drive" and it displayed my existing backups on that drive. Finally, I was able to do the regular (if not very intuitive) restore files by clicking the settings icon in the upper right of File History.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<h2>            windows 10 fails to boot with error c0000428, critical service failed</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, i launched the disk cleanup tool, available from C: drive contextual menu.</p>
<p>The tool showed that my temp folder was nearly 50GB in size, (it was tomcat server temp folders, oracle extracted install files, npm, and other build files, etc...).</p>
<p>I also checked the option to clean system files too.</p>
<p>Then i clicked ok, after a moment, the progress dialog window disapeared before the process completes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I relaunched the tool a second time, without checking the option to clean system files but i got the same result, the window disapeared before completion.</p>
<p>I, then tryied to reboot windows, thinking &nbsp;perhapse there were some files in use inside the temp folder.</p>
<p>But unfortunately , windows crashed during boot with a blue screen and a smiley :(</p>
<p>It showed error c0000428 and "critical service failed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It tried to reboot but in vain, it crashed. And then, the automatic startup repair beguins, but it too, fails stating it wasn't able to solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used tools like chkdsk /F /R /X &nbsp;but it fails with error 50 (i think).</p>
<p>SFC /scannow fails,</p>
<p>SFC /verifyonly gives this log:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjctI-XUYN6oh1ndoOP7915pVmAx</p>
<p>here is the last and only minidump i found in C:/windows/minidump: &nbsp;https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjctI-XUYN6oh1i-F-lQoloclAt_</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently i'm using a linux install &nbsp;to post this message, i used it to manually delete aford mentioned temp files (tomcat, oracle..), but i can use my windows drive as an external one.</p>
<p>Sorry for any english mistake i might have made. Please help me solve the boot problem</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED</strong> is usually caused by missing or corrupted device drivers or newly installed hardware drivers that are not compatible with current operating system. As an initial recommendation, we suggest disconnected external peripherals/devices
 except for the mouse and keyboard and check if it helps to boot the PC normally.<br />
<br />
If it still does not work, since you have already performed basic troubleshooting, we suggest performing a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO. We also suggest that you do so in
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>. Refer to this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">Wiki
 Article</a></strong> by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> for steps on how to perform a repair upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you encounter any further issues, let us know. We'd be more than glad to help you out.</p>

<p>Ok, by the way it's a laptop (Dell xps l14z) if it may be a missing driver problem then i'll try to boot in safe mode first, if it doesn't work, i will follow your suggestion and try the repair upgrade method.</p>

<p>Hello NickEngland,</p>
<p>The link you provided was not a good link for me. I did find this link which states it is not Windows Vista or Windows 7 compatible.<br />

<br />
Did you install the product in Compatibility Mode? <br />

<p>Thank you for that. I would like to ask if you've already tried all the suggested troubleshooting steps that I've posted above? Since you did not make any changes on your PC prior to the issue nor tried connecting other Bluetooth device to check if you will
 get the same result, I suggest that you upload your <strong>DMP</strong> files. These logs contain record of events leading to the crash, loaded drivers and what was responsible.
</p>

</p><p>I'll wait for your reply.</p>

            <p>I assume that you are referring to the search box in Windows explorer.</p>
<p>The entry "Add a search filter" is&nbsp;not active.&nbsp; It is just a heading for&nbsp;the predefined search filters shown underneath it.</p>
<p>To check that you can see all the predefined search filters, drag the left-hand edge of the Windows explorer search box to the left &amp; it will widen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you are in a Library folder then you will see more predefined search filters than the two that appear if you are in, for example, a folder within C:Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Documents\...</p>

If it happens to be an XviD file...you probably need <br />

                    <span>

<p><strong><span>I am currently running Windows 7 with Microsoft Office Professional 2003, which was working fine until about 3 weeks ago; when it started closing whatever
 office program I had open randomly. &nbsp;It says "(insert name of office software here) has encountered an error and has to close", and I have no choice but to close it &amp; restart. &nbsp;It even "checks the web" for a solution, but never finds one. &nbsp;Does anyone have
 a solution for this? &nbsp;I have done system restore back to before this started, and it&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;make any difference,&nbsp;I've&nbsp;even tried a few different restore points. &nbsp;It seems to be the worst when I use copy &amp; paste, but it doest it for no reason when I’m not even
 using my computer as well. &nbsp;Please help, my job depends on my computer working correctly!</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hello msmain_va, </p>
<p>You can try a clean boot to see if there are any other software programs out there that are conflicting with your office programs.
<br />
</p>
<p>KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135I</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will Disable all startup items and third party services when booting. This method will help us determine if this issue is caused by a loading program or service.
</p>
<p><br />
The steps below will place your computer into a “clean boot”, meaning using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that we can determine whether a background program is interfering.
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start on your Desktop<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the computer is back to your Desktop, check to see if you are still having the problem.
</p>
<p>If the issue is resolved by placing the machine in “clean boot” then we have some sort of third party application and or service running that is possibly interfering. To determine which program(s) and or service(s) that is causing this, we would need to
 go back into “msconfig” and start to enable programs and services and reboot until we see which one causes the problem.</p>
<p>If placing the computer in “clean boot” does not fix the issue or after the troubleshooting is done, follow the steps above “To return your computer back to normal boot”.</p>
<p>How to set your computer back, to boot normal: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start orb on your Desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
Click the General tab. <br />
3. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.
<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p><br />
Let us know if a clean boot helped to identify the conflict. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

The printer is connencted to parallel port LPT1 Bios mode ECP.<br />
Prozessor is a intel E6500<br />
<br />
I sucessfully updated the microsoft windows 7 database with printer drivers.<br />
After installing the HP 4L driver sucessfully I was prompted to make a test-Print.<br />
<br />
This test print resulted one page that is not perfectly readable.<br />
I can recognize the windows logo and the big cahracter Windows but many confusing pixels around.<br />
I can also recognize the text in german (rows and lines) but only some characters are&nbsp;shaped correct:<br />
Example T charcter or W or is clear.&nbsp;<br />
But " HP LaserJet 4L&nbsp;&nbsp; looks like H_ L_____ _L"&nbsp; Teh symbol _ represeents that the caracter is scrambled"<br />

<p><span>It is possible that your toner cartridge is not full.</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried printing any document in English?</span></p>
<p><span>You may have to change the language settings in the printer or the printer software.</span></p>
<p><span>Connect the printer to a different computer and check if it prints properly.</span></p>
<p><span>Also check the printer toner cartridge.

<h3> lukesnowcat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 32-bit randomly restarts with no bluescreen</h2>
                    
<p>My computer will randomly restart for no reason.&nbsp; It is especially frequent when I play games or do anything graphically demanding (especially Youtube or watching movies).&nbsp; However, the computer will also sometimes restart when I have just cold-booted the
 system, and the computer has been only been on for a minute or two.</p>
<p>I have windows advanced options set to disable automatic restarts if a bluescreen happens, but the computer doesn't actually display anything when it restarts.&nbsp; It will just hang up for a second, and then restart itself.&nbsp; I've checked for temperature issues,
 however this doesn't seem the case.&nbsp; Even under heavy load, I'm still running well within reasonable range, and unexpected restarts don't seem to be heat-related since it also happens immediately after a cold boot.</p>
<p>I checked my minidump file, and it seems to be a hardware-related issue (possibly my processor?), however I'm not tech savvy enough to make sense of what it's trying to tell me.&nbsp; I've included the file, as follows:</p>

<p>I've talked to a couple tech-heads, and they all said that random restarts without a bluescreen are usually power-related.&nbsp; I'm running a 750w power supply, and according to Antec's demand calculator, my system should onyl be drawing about 440w.&nbsp; I have
 an RMA authorized for my PSU, but I don't want to use it if that isn't the issue.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>[EDIT]&nbsp; I should also note that this was also happening in Windows XP SP3.</p>

<p>The STOP 0x124 error is an error that's discovered by your CPU.&nbsp; Then CPU then reports it to Windows.<br />
This is not necessarily a CPU problem - rather it's most likely a hardware problem of some sort.&nbsp; But it can also be a compatbility issue (more common in newer OS's) - or it can be a number of other, less likely things.</p>
<p>The information passed by the CPU doesn't contain much in the way of readable information, so the diagnosis is primarily involved in ruling out different things.&nbsp; This means removing programs and/or devices and/or using replacement parts to rule out different
 hardware/software scenarios.&nbsp; Eventually you will stumble upon the problem part/software.</p>
<p>This is the best advice that I've seen on STOP 0x124 errors:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/crash-lockup-debug-how/35349-stop-0x124-what-means-what-try.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/crash-lockup-debug-how/35349-stop-0x124-what-means-what-try.html</a></p>
<p>I would also research the maximum temps for your processor.&nbsp; I recently read that the Phenom II is supposed to shut down on it's own at 62ºC (~143ºF) - but wasn't able to find the official AMD specifications.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Could this timing out issue be caused by heat?&nbsp; While the PC claims my heat is within tolerances, while I was running the torture test my CPU was running around 155F, and I did a little housekeeping.&nbsp; After blowing the dust out of the CPU fan, the temperature
 immediately dropped, and has since actively been hovering around 125F.</p>
<p>My question is this.&nbsp; If this is happening from a cold boot, after the computer has been off for several hours, could this be caused by a failing processor instead?</p>
</blockquote>
this looks like a CPU error. Replace it.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 computer does not show up under HomeGroup</h2>

<p>I have a new windows 10 machine and an older 10 machine. Both machines work fine on the &nbsp;WiFi internet connection. Both have successfully joined the home group, but I cannot see the other computer from either machine. When I run the home group trouble shooter,
 it says I have a network problem. When I run the network trouble shooter, it says there is a network protocol problem. When I view the network devices connected, the other computer does not show up under computers, but both computers show up under media devices.
 &nbsp;They are both set up for sharing and both computers work fine with my network printers. What's going on?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for replying! In this instance, no, you would not be deleting your account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To clarify, what XBF Lance is suggesting is removing your profile from the console, restarting the console, then adding your profile back onto the console. In order to do this, you must know your email address and password to the account. This is not
 a permanent deletion of your account, but the first troubleshooting step in this case to try to get your achievements to be recognized.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you perform this step and the achievements still aren't showing, I recommend following the solutions available in our support article entitled&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-achievements-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Problems
 with Xbox One achievements and challenges</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give the troubleshooting a try and please let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps a bit more!</p>

    <title>Thumbnails for pdf files not all showing up in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danae72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thumbnails for pdf files not all showing up in Windows 8</h2>
                    The title is a bit misleading, but I didn't want it to be too long. I have one particular folder where I save some PDF files. In this folder, some of the thumbnails are blank. For example, today I have 11 files in there, and 10 of them are blank, while
 only 1 has the PDF thumbnail. The problem also seems to only persist in the "medium icons" view. If I change to any other view size, the thumbnails come back. They do come back if I then change back to medium view, but if I refresh, or go to another folder
 and come back, they are back to being blank.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have unchecked the "always show icons, never thumbnails" option. I have also gone to "Performance Options" and made sure the 'show thumbnails' is checked. If I save a new PDF file, it's a 50/50 chance on whether it will save with the thumbnail showing
 up. I have also tried copying and moving the files to another folder where I don't have this problem, and they move and copy WITHOUT the thumbnail showing up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope someone has some ideas on how to help this. OH, and I have run 'sfc' and there were no problems. All my drivers are up to date. My computer is new from January of this year.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>**Added**</div>
<div>I have discovered that if I change the view to either "content" or "list" the thumbnails also go blank when I refresh the folder. The other views do not.</div>

            <p><b>Do you face any problem in opening the file?</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;No problems at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have included that in the original post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Any error messages while opening the files?</b> &nbsp;No error messages. I would have included that in the original post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Is this only with PDF?</b> &nbsp;As far as I know, this only happens with PDF in this folder. The thumbnails are completely blank, but not all of them. There's always at least one that has the pdf icon and NOT the thumbnail. In other folders, even when instructed
 to show thumbnails and not icons, it is the pdf icon that shows up. I have not yet seen any other instances of blank thumbnails for pictures, videos, other documents at all, and they all have thumbnails rather than icons.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Additional info:</b> &nbsp;As mentioned, the blank thumbnails only occur in the 'medium', 'content', and 'tiles' views of one particular folder. I created a new folder, deleted the old one, and it still happens only in that folder. I've compared all the boxes
 and info in properties for the folders and files that work properly and the folder that doesn't work properly and can't see ANY difference. Note that 99% of the files in the other folders were originally in the folder that it becomes blank, so I really don't
 understand.</p>

            By searching, I've found that this seems to be a problem for people running Windows 8 64-bits. Even though Adobe Readers says it is compatible, this seems to be an ongoing problem.
<div><br />
<div>Anyone that can help with this new info?? Or even just to tell me it also happens with Windows 8 32-bits?</div>
<div><br />
<div>OH, and now my problem is with other views as well, and spread to other folders. I must have done something, or maybe I'm just going into the other folders more often than before. It has definitely gone to the other views tho. Large Icons would show the
 thumbnails (when working) and icons even when I refreshed, but now they go blank as well.</div>

            <p>I have the same issue on Win 8.1 - 32Bit for all sorts of file types as well as pdf, jpg, avi, mp4, flv, tiff, bmp, mpg you name it, none of these show thumbnails in windows explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got the jpg and image file thumbnails to appear, under control panel -&gt;System -&gt; Adjust performance and Appearance of windows - &gt; Performance Options&nbsp; :: Check the box nextd to "Show Thumbnails Instead of Icons"</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this only resolved my issue with image files, .PDF Files still showing only a generic ICON with no preview and no thumbnails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have a solution for this issue? besides installing adobe reader and or Foxit Reader?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Siska Microsoft have released version 1809 of Windows 10, click the link below, then click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1809 and bring your new PC right up to date
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have any trouble with the above method, with these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Updating to the latest feature update 1809, should resolve this.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

            Before you learn how to get rid of the Windows 10 update error 0x800f0922, it is best for you to understand what causes the issue to appear in the first place. This way, you can prevent it from occurring again. In most cases, the error shows up because the computer is unable to connect to the appropriate update server or there is not enough memory in the system reserved partition.
<br />
<br />If you encountered this problem, do not worry because we have prepared some workarounds for it. 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Disabling your VPN
<br />
<br />One of the first things you should do is check your Internet connection to see if your VPN is causing the problem. To do that, just follow the steps below:
<br />1.Open your Internet browser and check if you can open any web page. If no connection is established, proceed to the next step.
<br />2.Restart your computer and your router.
<br />3.Instead of connecting via Wi-Fi, try using a wired connection.
<br />4.If you are using a VPN, disable it.
<br />5.Try running Troubleshooter.
<br />6.Disable bandwidth-hogging applications such as download managers and torrent clients.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Checking .NET Framework
<br />
<br />One of the possible culprits behind this problem is .NET Framework. So, one of the ways to get rid of the Windows 10 update error 0x800f0922 is installing the latest version of .NET Framework. Moreover, you should activate it in Windows Features. You can do those by following these instructions:
<br />1.On your keyboard, press Windows Key+S.
<br />2.Type “Windows Features” (no quotes).
<br />3.Select ‘Turn Windows Features on or off’ from the results.
<br />4.Select the options related to .NET Framework.
<br />5.Click OK to save your selection.
<br />6.Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />Make sure that you perform these actions with caution because there are crucial features you might touch. If the error persists, try our next solution.
<br />
<br />Method 3: Switching Off your Firewall
<br />
<br />Sometimes, your Firewall interferes with the updates and prevents them from getting installed successfully. It may sound strange, but it does happen on certain occasions. So, it is advisable to disable Windows Firewall when you’re attempting to download the updates again. Of course, you should not forget to enable the feature again before you install the updates. To switch off your Firewall, follow the steps below:
<br />1.Press Windows Key+S on your keyboard.
<br />2.Type “Firewall” (no quotes), then select Windows Defender Firewall from the results.
<br />3.Go to the left-pane menu, then select ‘Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off’.
<br />4.Disable your Firewall for both Private and Public Network Settings.
<br />5.Click OK to save the changes.
<br />6.Try downloading the updates again.
<br />
<br />Do not forget to enable your Firewall before you install the updates. You would not want to endanger your security, so make sure you perform this step first.
<br />
<br />It is worth noting that your third-party antivirus may cause the error to show up. To resolve the problem, we recommend disabling certain features of your antivirus. On the other hand, if the issue persists, we advise removing your antivirus entirely. If you are able to get rid of the Windows 10 update error 0x800f0922, using this method, then we recommend switching to a different security program.
<br />
<br />There are many antivirus tools out there and we recommend using a reliable Anti-Malware program. This provides top-notch protection against data safety threats and viruses. Aside from that, it is designed to be compatible with Windows 10. So, it will not interfere with the updates or your main antivirus. Therefore, you can conveniently install the updates and still have the security you need.
<br />
<br />Method 4: Changing the Partition Size Via a Third-Party Tool
<br />
<br />You can extend your system partition space, using a third-party tool. Remember that you must always have at least 500 MB of free space to be able to install updates successfully. You can try deleting some files to regain some space. You can also use the built-in system tool to clean up junk files. On the other hand, you can try extending the space via a third-party partitioning program.
<br />
<br />Method 5: Removing Certain Registry Values
<br />
<br />Some registry values can also cause the error 0x800f0922 to appear. So, you must look for these entries and remove them. However, before you proceed, you must know that the registry is a sensitive database. Even the smallest error can cause system instability issues. So, you must only try this solution if you are confident with your tech skills.
<br />1.Open the Run dialog box by pressing Windows Key+R.
<br />2.Type “regedit” (no quotes), then press Enter.
<br />3.Navigate to this path:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Publishers
<br />4.Right-click Publishers, then select Export from the menu.
<br />5.Choose the location for exporting this key, then type your preferred file name. Click Save. If you make any mistake, you can run this file to restore the key to its original state.
<br />6.Look for the following keys, then remove them:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Publishers\{e7ef96be-969f-414f-97d7-3ddb7b558ccc}
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Publishers\{8c416c79-d49b-4f01-a467-e56d3aa8234c}
<br />
<br />Once you’ve deleted those keys, check if the error persists.
<br />
<br />Method 6: Removing Temporary Files
<br />
<br />Sometimes, the temporary files that your PC has accumulated interfere with your system, causing the error 0x800f0922 to show up. You can resolve this issue by deleting all temporary files in your computer. To do that, follow these simple instructions:
<br />1.On your keyboard, press Windows Key+R. This will bring up the Run dialog box.
<br />2.Type “%temp%” (no quotes), then hit Enter.
<br />3.Once the Temp folder is up, remove all its contents.
<br />4.Open the Run dialog box again, then type “TEMP” (no quotes). Click OK.
<br />5.Remove all the contents of the TEMP folder.
<br />
<br />Once you’ve done that, you should be able to install the updates without any hassle.
<br />
<br />Method 7: Disabling Secure Boot
<br />
<br />Windows 10 computers have a built-in feature that protects them from common malware. This feature, Secure Boot, can sometimes cause update issues. So, if you encounter the error 0x800f0922, we recommend disabling the feature temporarily. You can do this by entering BIOS. Make sure you check your motherboard manual to get detailed instructions on entering BIOS and disabling Secure Boot.
<br />
<br />Once you’ve disabled Secure Boot, try downloading and installing the updates again. Check if this fixes the error.
<br />
<br />Method 8: Repairing your Installation
<br />
<br />It is possible that your Windows 10 installation is corrupted, which is why you can’t install the updates successfully. You can resolve the issue by performing an SFC scan. To do that, follow these steps:
<br />1.Press Windows Key+X on your keyboard.
<br />2.Select Command Prompt (Admin) or PowerShell (Admin) from the options.
<br />3.Type “sfc /scannow” (no quotes), then press Enter.
<br />
<br />The SFC scan will now start. The process may take several minutes to complete. Once it is finished, try downloading and installing the updates again. Check if the error is gone. If it is still there, we recommend running a DISM scan. You just need to follow the same steps as running an SFC scan. However, on the third step, you have to type “DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth”. This process may take even longer to complete. So, just be patient and do not interfere with it.
<br />
<br />Good luck !

    <title>Windows Live Mail Sent Folder and Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyndim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail Sent Folder and Settings</h2>
                    <p>Sorry this is long, I want to be perfectly clear about my issue.&nbsp; I have been using Windows Live Mail for many years.&nbsp; Earlier&nbsp;this year, I was one of those who was affected by the DeltaSync "no mail" issue.&nbsp; Could read online at Outlook.com, but my Windows
 Live would not update.&nbsp; This had happened before, but usually resolved itself over a day or two.&nbsp; The last time, I was desperate because it was dragging on for a long time before being fixed.&nbsp; I followed instructions to&nbsp;add the account&nbsp;as IMAP, which worked.&nbsp;
 I did not remove the regular account, kept both of them, and&nbsp;after the server&nbsp;reset,&nbsp;the original account started working again.&nbsp;&nbsp;From then on, I&nbsp;kept both copies of my account in WLM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In setting up the IMAP account, the system created a new folder called "Sent Items", and my IMAP copy of the account did not have the "Sent" file included.&nbsp; From then on, some of the mail I sent went to the&nbsp;original "Sent" folder (visible in my DeltaSync
 version, not in IMAP), others to the "Sent Mail".&nbsp; I still do not know what the defining property&nbsp;was&nbsp;that sent outgoing mail to one folder or the other.&nbsp; I dealt with it, because I had my "backup version" and could search the original "Sent" folder there.&nbsp;&nbsp;My
 "Sent"&nbsp;folder also still shows and is active on Outlook.com.&nbsp; I tried several times to delete the IMAP account in WLM&nbsp;and reinstall to reset all folders, and this did not work.&nbsp; I was too afraid to delete the original copy of my account because I didn't want
 to lose access to that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skipping to now.&nbsp; I had a fatal hard drive crash and lost everything on my laptop.&nbsp; I just bought a new computer, Windows 8.1, and installed the latest version of WLM.&nbsp; Imported my account through the&nbsp;regular methods (regular account setup, not IMAP)&nbsp;...
 as with the IMAP version, my "Sent" folder is missing, but it still shows on Outlook.com.&nbsp; I'd really like to have it back!&nbsp; Does anyone know how I can get that folder to sync with my computer?&nbsp; All other folders sync fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next issue, the new install of WLM.&nbsp; I have set up the views I like ... no reading pane, folders in a particular order on the status bar, etc.&nbsp; Every time I close the program to reboot the computer (with a new machine and software installs, this happens
 often), the settings go back to default.&nbsp; How can I make them "stick"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!!</p>

            <p>Good morning!&nbsp; After my all-nighter adventure, I can tell you that I now have all my messages.&nbsp; However, in WLM, I've got "Sent Items", "Junk email", "Deleted Items" ... whereas the corresponding folders online are the single-word version.&nbsp; As I send mail,
 will all messages be copied&nbsp;to "Sent Items" in WLM, but to "Sent" on Outlook.com?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say not to look for a "Sent" folder in WLM after the configuration.&nbsp; Up until 6 months ago, I never had this conflict.&nbsp; That was an odd turn of events for me.&nbsp; As long as all messages go&nbsp;to the same folder, I guess I'm okay with that.&nbsp; But I never did
 figure out before why some went to "Sent" and others went to "Sent Items".&nbsp; Guess time will tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention registry changes and third-party performance enhancing programs.&nbsp; Would there be something pre-installed on a new Win8.1 computer that might do that?&nbsp; I'm still getting used to the OS.&nbsp; I've only had this&nbsp;laptop since last week, and have not
 installed anything but essentials -- basically, WLM, Office, and my financial software.&nbsp; And several applications that are directly related to my business, which are very specific and I truly doubt would be problematic.&nbsp; I haven't tried rebooting yet this
 morning, since&nbsp;the computer&nbsp;worked all night to download all my messages ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I'm just thankful to have my archives back!&nbsp; As long as I continue to build into the same folder, all is good ... I'll deal with the rest!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I appreciate your help!!</p>

<h2>            How to transfer emails from one account to another account&#63;</h2>
                    Using Windows Live Mail 2012 on Win 7 HP. I would like to transfer all incoming emails from one account "A" to another account "B". This is allowed in Gmail and I wonder if WLM will do the same. I am getting unwanted emails from an unknown source and have
 blocked those emails from the server by selecting a key subject word.&nbsp;However, I get these emails on my Nook Color with no way to block&nbsp; ( Using account "A" on both&nbsp;Nook and on WLM). If I can transfer the emails from "A" to "B" I can establish "B" as my account
 on the Nook and the unwanted emails should not to loaded..&nbsp;

            <p>Hi JRHoot,<br />
<br />
I'm glad to help you with your concern on Windows Live Mail about transferring/forwarding emails on the other account. I suggest you create your Message rules in Live Mail. To do this follow the steps below.<br />
<br />
1. Sign in to your Windows Live Mail.<br />
2. On the header beside Home tab click on <strong>Folders.<br />
</strong>3. On the toolbar click on <strong>Message rules.<br />
</strong>4. On the pop up window for creating rules, <strong>1st </strong>select one or more conditions, tick on the check box for the condition you want to apply.
<strong>2nd </strong>select one or more actions, again&nbsp;&nbsp;tick on the check box for the actions that you want to apply the condition.<br />
5. On the <strong>3rd</strong> option edit the rule description, for example for forwarding emails click on the underline words in the box and a pop up window will appear for you to choose the contact/email address you want to forward the emails.<br />
6. On the last option you can enter the name of the rule you created.<br />
7. Click <strong>Save.<br />
</strong><br />
Hope the solution above resolves your issue. If you have&nbsp;additiona&nbsp;query, feel free to post your questions and we will be glad to help.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>
