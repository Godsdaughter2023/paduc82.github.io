<h2>            Zoom level in PowerPoint 2016 have stopped working - how to restore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Problem: The zoom bar in PowerPoint 2016 (Windows 10) &nbsp;has stopped working. Instead of going to a specific zoom level when you click anywhere on the zoom level bar in the lower right corner, PowerPoint will only move it down/up 6% for each click regardless
 of where you click - and is not moving the tick mark to the specific zoom level where you click. The only way to quickly zoom in or out is to actively drag the tick mark - which is much slower than clicking on a specific spot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be connected to installing the Duet Display app to use my iPad as a secondary screen for a project. I did the same for both my stationary workstation (regular screen) as well as my laptop (touch screen but no issues with zoom level before)
 - and both PowerPoint programs immediately got the zoom issue. Duet Display has been uninstalled - but the zoom issues persist. It seems as if PowerPoint now think I have a touch screen - and I'm unable to get it back to "normal".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm scratching my head and I've tried to understand what is going on and how to restore it. I'm not sure uninstalling and reinstalling Office would help - because maybe this is something that is a W10 issue rather than a Office/PowerPoint issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can you tell PowerPoint to zoom to click as is the original default and not zoom in "increments" of 6%?&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi JRehnvall,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have the latest updates for your Office 2016 applications? To update, go to File &gt; Accounts &gt; Update now. Provide the current version of your PowerPoint 2016.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can you confirm if you are adjusting the view by clicking View &gt; Zoom? Do you encounter any error on using the Zoom feature? Can you provide a screenshot of the error? As well as
 the steps, you did on how you encounter it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try starting up your PowerPoint 2016 in safe mode. Check if there are improvements. To start in safe mode, follow the steps on this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Yes!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I do have the latest update of Office (Office 365 Business) -&nbsp;Version 1702 (Build 7870.2031)</p>
<p>2. I'm using on the zoom bar in the lower right corner (not the View Tab -Zoom)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcf5bce0-236f-4f25-b742-c01ae3e47e02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcf5bce0-236f-4f25-b742-c01ae3e47e02" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When you normally click on the zoom bar in PowerPoint, your zoom level will go to that exact level where you clicked - that is a quick way to zoom in or out. However, when I now click anywhere on the bar, PowerPoint will just move the tick mark up or
 down a couple of % (depending on if I click on the left or right of the middle), regardless on where on the bar I click. I can click at the very end (-) or at the very top (+), PowerPoint will only zoom a couple of % for each click. &nbsp;Let's say I'm at 100%
 and want to zoom in - for each click (regardless of where I click on the bar), I will zoom in a couple of percent. To zoom in / zoom out more more with one click, I have to actively drag the tick mark up or down. The normal zoom bar stopped working after I
 added the touch screen (iPad) drivers - it is as if PowerPoint thinks I'm now using a touch screen where I would "drag" the bar up and down, rather than using a mouse to click exactly where I want to go. &nbsp;Same issue happened on two of my active machines after
 installing the touch screen (iPad)- a third workstation that did not have the touch screen (iPad) installed still works correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I've repaired Office (Repair Online) which fixed the problem - however after restart, problem is back. I also get a touch numerical keyboard up on my screen when I log on to Windows - as if Windows think I'm using a touch screen and I want to use my fingers
 to type in my Windows password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I've tried opening PowerPoint in Safe Mode - same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I succeed - below here is a gif showing the zoom issue:&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Effect options greyed out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Effect options greyed out</h2>
                    <p>I've used PowerPoint for years and this has never been a problem... but when I am trying to animate a list of bullet points to come in one at a time I am having trouble. I know that what I need to do is select the animation and then choose "by paragraph"
 from the effect options, but when I choose "appear" the effect option button remains greyed out as if there is no option to do that. On&nbsp;<em>some</em> slides I am able to get it to do it by using the "fade in" animation instead, but sometimes that isn't working
 either. What on earth is going on? On the slides that are not working it does show a 1 next to each bullet as though I had the option to change it... but no luck.</p>

            You might like to take a look at FindRecord.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates various ways of navigating to a record, or filtering a form to one or more records.&nbsp; The option to 'Open form to go to a record' should suffice in your case.&nbsp; This form includes an unbound combo box in which an existing contact
 can be selected, or you can select &lt;new contact&gt; to enter a new record into the table.<br />
<br />
If you have a large number of clients it might be better to amend the combo box's RowSource to:<br />
<br />
SELECT ContactID, LastName &amp; ", " &amp; FirstName, 1 As SortColumn, <br />
LastName,Firstname &nbsp;<br />
FROM Contacts &nbsp;<br />
UNION <br />
SELECT 0, "&lt;New Contact&gt;", 0,"","" &nbsp;<br />
FROM Contacts <br />
ORDER BY SortColumn, LastName, FirstName; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
This would enable you to go to a contact by typing in their last name.&nbsp; The AutoExpand mechanism would progressively go to the first match as each character is entered, e.g. in my demo, once 'Br' had been typed in the combo box would select 'Brown, John' and
 you'd just have to press the Enter key to go to that record.<br />

                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 just did an update where you can insert 3D models. Using SOLIDWORKS, I convert the files into STL files for it to work with Outlook. Attaching the 3D model is easy and I can rotate it and all, but after I send the email, the model just becomes
 an image and is no longer able to be rotated. If anybody can help me this, that would be great!</p>

<p>Hi Jilltheengineer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the 3D image would turn to be a normal image after insert it in Outlook and send it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a normal behavior that Outlook would convert a 3D image to normal after send it. Regarding this feature, you may submit feedback in

            Assuming you're using PC Suite 6.84, the online help in the PC Suite backup/restore program (Nokia Content Copier) says under the heading "Defining where to back up" the following:<br />
<br />
To define where to back up<br />
<br />
1. Define a name and a storage location for the backup file. Here you have two options:<br />
<br />
- You can use the default file name (consisting of the backup date and phone model) and location.<br />
<br />
- You can click Browse to save the backup file with another name or to another location.<br />
<br />
2. Click Next.

    <title>How do I force exclusive access&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I force exclusive access&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I need to force exclusive access to my access database.</p>
<p>I asked all users to log out, but the ldb file is not releasing them.&nbsp; it shows me logged in 3 times as well as a couple other users.&nbsp; the database is located in a shared folder in sbserver 2008.</p>
<p>Is there a way to delete the ldb file or force access to log everyone out so that I can access it exclusively.&nbsp; I've found a number of articles on google suggesting to create a hidden form that acts as a timer to log people out, but that doesn't help me
 now.</p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>

            that is the code for the log off form.&nbsp; I understand the need for that, but I doesn't say how to get exclusive access in the first place.&nbsp; everyone is logged off of the database, but it thinks they are still logged in.&nbsp; seems like there should be a way
 to force access to log everyone off so that I can get in and make those changes.

<p>Everything is there!&nbsp; A hidden form is launched with a timer event that does the checking every ...&nbsp; The explanation is very clear in the sample database.</p>
<p>This is the only way to boot people off.&nbsp; Access does not have a built-in method to do this.&nbsp; You can't just delete the ldb file, actually, as long as there is one person in the db, the file will be locked, you won't even be able to delete it.</p>
<p>So copy the logoff example, and you will then have the ability you seek.</p>

<p>thanks, I think I got it figured out.&nbsp; I was a little confused on the ontimer sub.</p>
<p>I'm made a back up of the database and will use that to work out the details, then implement it if the other DB ever magically becomes unlocked.</p>
<p>sure would be nice if they would make it possible to automatically kick people out in access.&nbsp; based on the articles I've read, this has been a problem since at least access 97.&nbsp; you would have thought they would take the hint after over a decade of complaints.</p>

<p>Okay, I ran into another problem.</p>
<p>I used the code and it worked fine while with in the database, but if the settings table is a linked table I get an error.&nbsp; do I need to change something to the code, or does it just not work with linked tables?</p>

<p>I use it all the time on a linked table.&nbsp; Actually, it would only work if the table is linked, otherwise it would defeat the whole purpose.&nbsp; Very confusing!</p>
<p>I'm not sure what else to say.&nbsp; Double check your setup.</p>
<p>I see you are using Access 2010 perhaps there is some limitation or a bug.&nbsp; Maybe someone else might have an idea.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> possible for a user to be in the .ldb file, and lock the database, even though they are not actually on the computer. This can happen if their computer crashes, or they reboot while Access is open, or in certain corruption situations (as I
 understand it, it's a bit obscure!)</p>
<p>You can resolve this situation by brute force: reboot the server containing the .ldb file, or use Windows administrative tools to clear the Windows system locks on the file, and delete it. You should then be able to reopen Access "clean". I'd suggest compacting
 the database after you do so just in case.</p>

<p>Thanks I may need to try that if the file doesn't unlock.&nbsp; If I can get this code installed it will save me a lot of headache in the future.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why its not working on my linked table.&nbsp; I got the example to work with linked tables in the same folder, but when I link it from my FE to my BE&nbsp; (thankfully the FE is not locked, even thought the BE is) I get an error in the script on the</p>
<p>set snp = db.openrecordset ("settings",dbopensnapshot)</p>
<p>line.</p>
<p>Is it because the Back End is still locked?&nbsp; I can open the linked table and view the contents, but for some reason it doesn't like the code or its not returning what it thinks it should return.</p>

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
You can remove old credit card, as long as you don't have an outstanding balance on the credit card and you’re not using it to pay for an active subscription.<br />
<br />
Please change/replace the old credit card with new credit card that you're using to pay for the subscription and then try removing the old credit card to check this issue.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think you need to get Adobe Reader as the default program for opening PDF files.</p>
<p>Let's uninstall/reinstall Adobe Reader. Go to <br />
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/?promoid=BUIGO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://get.adobe.com/reader/?promoid=BUIGO</a><br />
Note the "Install Google Chrome" checkbox. I would uncheck it for now, just to avoid additional complications. Download Chrome later, if you want.</p>
<p>Download Adobe Reader, but Save it, don't Run it. From Start&gt; Control Panel&gt; Programs, uninstall Adobe Reader then restart.</p>
<p>Right-click the Adobe Reader download and run as administrator.</p>
<p>After installation, see if Adobe Reader&nbsp;is available as a default program&nbsp;for PDF files.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment Windows Mobile devices are only allowed to sync with up to two PC's, so if you want to use a third&nbsp;computer to sync&nbsp;you will have to delete an existing partnership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or else&nbsp;you&nbsp;might want to&nbsp;use a third party software in order to get it done:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laplink&nbsp;claim their software <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-410873-10390686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Laplink PDASync 4</strong></a>&nbsp;can sync with multiple PC's, so you want to give it a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Nuno</p>

<h2>            MS Word rejects a known document password</h2>
                    I have password protected a document in MS Word (Office 2003). When I try to open the document and input the password, I get the message that the password is incorrect. I have tried this several time with different documents and different passwords and

    <title>Outlook 2016 - Move messages in search results actually copies - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Move messages in search results actually copies</h2>
                    <p>Messages are copied (rather than moved) when a move is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search for messages, and then move them to a folder by right-clicking and selecting Move and a location, or Right-dragging a message and in the pop-up menu selecting Move rather than Copy, the item is not removed from the search results (Current Folder
 is selected for the search and the items are being moved to a different folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message is copied to the new folder, but not removed from the search results until after a period of time I search again and they re removed from the current folder (inbox).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've confirmed this bug on 3 different installations of Outlook 2016. Outlook 2010 worked well and was real time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is in cached mode (has to be with Office 365) and its set to download all messages. Mailbox is very large.</p>
<p>

            <p>This is expected since in Outlook 2016 you are making use of the Exchange-level search index&nbsp;of your mailbox instead of your local search index of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you move a message from these online search results to another folder, it could take up to a minute before this change has been completely synched&nbsp;between Outlook and Exchange. Until then, it could indeed look like you made a copy of the item instead
 of moving it.</p>

    <title>Similar to another Question&#58; Re&#58; Personal and Business Office - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Similar to another Question&#58;  Re&#58; Personal and Business Office 365 on same system</h2>
                    
<p>After reading another user's post and replies along these lines i wanted to either report something different or maybe clarify the situation I am in.</p>
<p>In this case specifically: &nbsp;the issue is with a User having a Personal Copy of Office 365 as well as needing to have a copy of Office 365 Small Business Premium where we will be deploying the "Next Generation" Sync for the Business Client. &nbsp;IT has so far
 been my experience that unless you start out with nothing but the Business 365 until after the setup of the Next Gen Sync Client, if you have the Personal already installed that even wit the use of the supplied registry modifiers the files end up in their
 Personal Onedrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be something wrong on the systems themselves rather than in the manner &nbsp;of installation. &nbsp; If this should work regardless of the order of installation, I may need to investigate further.</p>
<p>As I saw posted elsewhere, there is also the caveat of as long as both are of the Office 2016 variety. &nbsp;I have a few where this is not the case with one User even having some portions installed from Office 2007, 2010, 2013 and now I am adding 2016. &nbsp;In this
 specific case, I sincerely believe this is not a good idea and I am not sure i even believe it is there, yet i can see the banner displays as she opens the varis modules as to which "Version" of office they came from.<br />
In her case, I suggested holding off on trying to ad 2016 until I could get someone at MS to confirm this would work or even if it did, would it be in her best interests or a recipe for disaster down the road?</p>

<p>Hi Questor,</p>
<p>For your concerns:<br />
1. <em>I "believe" that even once they leave and their company email address is closed,&nbsp; they will receive a message when using Outlook or other Office "Desktop Apps"&nbsp; telling them that their product is not authorized and&nbsp; that it needs to be attached to a
 "Working" account to be able to continue using it.&nbsp; </em><br />
<em>Is this the way it would work?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Yes, you are right.</p>
<p>2. <em>If so, can they then enter their previous email address attached to the license they purchased for Office 365 Home Premium?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The answer is no. As Office 365 for Home and Office 365 for Business are two different plans, and the Office for these two plans are different, we cannot use our Office 365 for Home account to sign in or activate the Office in our Office 365 for Business
 plan. A similar scenario for your reference: <br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/-Account-Notice-appears-in-Office-after-switching-Office-365-plans-857dc33a-1efc-4ce7-ac3f-ef616314e27d?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">“Account Notice” appears in Office after switching Office 365 plans</a></p>
<p>3. <em>I do not want them to think they "lost any value" but I am certain that if the "clock has run out" on their "personal" copy of Office 365 while they were using our Small Business license, they are not going to believe this.&nbsp; They will "think" that
 Microsoft has put their Office 365 Personal Product is "on hold" for that time.&nbsp; If they only used it for 3 months before installing the Business version, they will "Think" that they should still have 9 months left&nbsp; "already paid for"&nbsp;&nbsp; in their original One
 Year Subscription.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Yes, Microsoft will not extend our Office 365 subscription expire date if we do not use it after buying it. It starts with the date we bought it.</p>
<p>4. <em>The Business onedrive does not seem to work correctly when used with the "Next Generation Sync Client" deployment package unless only the Business version is installed.&nbsp; I have found this to be the case "Even When" I have install both registry keys
 supplied with the deployment package.&nbsp; I can add the Personal Onedrive access back afterward but it does not seem to default to business as it should otherwise.</em></p>
<p>Generally, the Next Generation OneDrive for Business sync client and Office desktop client are two different products, it does not matter which Office desktop client installed on our computer. Regarding the issue, yes, we need to add both the registry keys
 (<strong>Default to Business</strong> and <strong>Add an Account</strong>). If still don’t work, we can manually re-add the configuration settings registry keys to our computer to see whether it works. For your reference:&nbsp;

<p>Work for a couple of days then stated with the no internet connection error which seems to be common in the support pages if you delete the app and reinstall it works again for a while. Latest version of IOS as well but also did it on the last 2 versions.</p>

            <p>Hi Dusty,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming you're using MSE and that the icon you mean is the MSE icon and not the Security Center icon (or possibly both are there and red).&nbsp; If not using MSE, contact technical support for the AV product you are using for assistance.&nbsp; If using MSE, read
 on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Run and type regedit.exe and enter. Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\DisallowRun and see if it has msseces.exe in it. If so, delete that particular entry.
 Reboot and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that isn't it, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</p>
<div>add quotes to the MSE key so that it looks EXACTLY like this <strong>"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Client\msseces.exe" -hide -runkey
</strong>(including quotes, spaces, and dashes).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Reboot and the essentials program should properly execute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that doesn't work, then we need to start over from scratch as there are too many things that could cause this. Please proceed as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This means not only current ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:
<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:
</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Do not yet remove the one primary AV program you are using until you have downloaded the MSE file so you are protected while doing so – then uninstall and remove that program after the download but before beginning to install MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).<span>&nbsp;
</span>If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once
 done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a> and
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<div><span>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully with a reboot you'll be up and running just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>

    <title>how to copy a OneNote notebook from personal OneDrive to local - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnfullerton2  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to copy a OneNote notebook from personal OneDrive to local instance of Sharepoint OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I started a OneNote notebook on personal OneDrive (the access I have with my Microsoft account) and later found that I have a lot of file space on my Office 365 account from work. I'd like to copy my notebook from personal OneDrive to my work Office
 365 account on SharePoint. (I'm not sure that my wording is exact regarding the Office 365 account.) I've been able to download the sections from my personal OneDrive copy of my notebook and copy the sections into a new folder in SharePoint, however, OneNote
 online (part of the SharePoint Office 365 service) cannot open them, though it does list the sections together where the section names usually appear in OneNote online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first start signing on to my work access to Office 365 in general (not trying in OneNote) the login part happens at my local internet domain (still within the university's website) and then the browser transfers over to Microsoft's website to access
 Sharepoint. The email address and password that I sign on with locally is what is not accepted when I try to sign on to Sharepoint with OneNote 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I copy the notebook from personal OneDrive to my my work access to Office 365? When I try to have OneNote 2013 add Sharepoint as a Connected service, the system is not recognizing the email address and password that I originally signed on to the
 Sharepoint account with at my university (my workplace).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I suppose you want to move the notebooks in your personal OneDrive to OneDrive for Business.
</p>
<p>First, you mentioned that you are using OneNote 2013, it's an out-of-date version of OneNote, we suggest you use OneNote 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you are using OneNote 2016, you can move the notebooks to your OneDrive for Business, but before that, you need to sign in your Work or School account in OneDrive to sync your OneDrive for Business
 folder to your local disk. Then please follow the steps below to move the notebooks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open your notebook in OneNote 2016. Click
Settings </span>next to the notebook you want to move &gt; Click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Properties</span>.</p>
<p>2. In Notebook Properties, click
<p>3. Click your OneDrive for Business sync folder, choose a location to place the notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this, sign in to portal.office.com with your Work or School account, go to OneDrive for Business, check whether the notebooks are in the right place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

<h2>            &#8216;Chart Area&#8217; Bubble won&#8217;t disappear in word 2016 &#40;365&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have been struggling with this for a long time. I’ve had a chat with Microsoft tech support and cant find anything online about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I paste a graph in to word from excel, I move my mouse over the graph and as it should, when I have my mouse in the chart area, a ‘Chart Area’ bubble follows my mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13039190-e25f-468e-874d-dceb846c578f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13039190-e25f-468e-874d-dceb846c578f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I move down the page and it is persistent on the screen, in the same spot. Clicking on it or changing to a different window and back doesn’t help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/012a02b9-743c-4d58-9b9d-3c2442366a76?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/012a02b9-743c-4d58-9b9d-3c2442366a76?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Quitting word and reopening removes the bubble, but it then appears again when I move the mousse over the chart again. Notably, this also happens across word documents. If I open a second document, even a blank one, the bubble still persists across to that
 document too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using word 16.12 on High Sierra.</p>

<p><span>Hi H.T.L,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my test, the issue may happen in the current version 16.12 of the Word 2016 for Mac application.&nbsp; The issue may be fixed in the later version. I suggest you wait for the release
 of the version such as 16.14 or do a test on another Mac installed with the version of the Word 2016 for Mac application to check the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>Hi Vicki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. It is my honor to reply to your case here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your concern, I have done a lot of research and test, I have found that we can change the default "Show As" in the older version, ie Outlook 2010. However, Office 2010 is not supported by Office 365 in the early time. In the current Office 2016 version,
 I haven't found a solution regarding changing the default "Show As".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, if we change the default "Show As" for the "All day event", then, how could we ensure it is shows correctly for another single appointment (ie, from Fri 8/31 2018 12;00 to Fri 8/31 2018 12:30)? We still need to pay attention to the default "Show
 As" for the single appointment. So I am afraid the creator of the appointment may need to be more careful for the "Show As" while creating appointment. Thanks for your understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<h2>            &#34;this pc&#34; icon getting duplicated on desktop &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've had this strange bug for a while now. The "This PC" icon get duplicated on my desktop and I have no idea of what trigger it or how to fix it. Sometimes I'm just doing casual stuff and Bam! When I close my window I realize I have duplicated "this
 pc" icon on my desktop. It can get duplicated a lot of time (I've seen over 20 once) and they are all fonctionnal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A refresh of the desktop fix it but it always come back. This is the only icon being duplicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I you know how to fix it please help! ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I did find a way around it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of using "/personalize/change desktop icons/" to put "This PC" on your desktop, make a shortcut of it on your desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do so by opening This PC </p>
<p>then drag his icon from the adress bar on your desktop. </p>
<p>Then go to&nbsp;"/personalize/change desktop icons/" and remove "This PC" from your desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will be left with your new shortcut that you can rename, and without the annoyance of the duplicating old one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not perfect but it work for now!</p>

</p><p>Your concern about about adding contacts on your Nokia 206 is out of Microsoft Community's scope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description however, it appears that you are storing your contacts to your SIM instead of the phone memory. Try changing the contact storage settings on your phone to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend that you post your query to the appropriate support website.</p>
