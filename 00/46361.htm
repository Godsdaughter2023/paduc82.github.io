<h2>            Does anyone know how to enable a Thrustmaster Joystick&#47;Throttle Controller to free-trial flight simulators &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I've installed a Thrustmaster Joystick/Throttle Controller to a Hewlett Packard Pavilion 15z laptop running on Windows 10. &nbsp;I've also installed several simulators and games, but cannot get the controller to communicate with the simulators and games. &nbsp;I've
 worked with AOL &amp; Microsoft Tech Support and tried all kinds of procedures which took half of the day, but we could not figure out how to get anything working...AOL told me to contact Thrustmaster directly...I will try contacting them tomorrow, but in the
 meantime I was hoping that someone might know how to get the controller and programs to work together....

<p>No...I don't have access to another PC to try the joystick on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up in the hospital for pneumonia and just got out 2 days ago...Before that, - I installed several programs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1) Steampowered.com</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2) Warthunder</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't figure out how to configure either one...But then I noticed in the Thrustmaster Menu that it seems to be compatible with a program called:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;3) Microsoft Flight Simulator X</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bounced around in MS Websites, but couldn't figure out what to do ???&nbsp; Then I ended up in the hospital...So now I'm back at preparing to try to learn what to do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to try a free simulator trial to make sure the joystick, PC, and simulator work together...After reading up some on Flight Simulator X, - it seems that there is a free-trial version...My next step is to try to find it...</p>

            <p>I have almost exactly the same problem, with one difference (and the reason I'm posting here is because of that difference).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not installing the "app" from the "Windows Store" I have Skype installed as a Windows 10 programme. Skype loads, demands an update, then gives me the same message.<br />
<br />
The solution listed by Skype does not work.,<br />
</p>
<p>[quote]</p>
<p>To end the Microsoft Installer process manually:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Ctrl+Alt+Del and start Task Manager.</li><li>In the <strong>Processes </strong>tab, select MSIEXEC.EXE.</li><li>Click <strong>End Process</strong>.</li><li>Install Skype. {/quote]</li></ol>
<p>It would blooming help if "MSIEXEC.EXE." was actually listed in the process tab.</p>
<p>I tried shutting down the Windows Installer Service, it won't let me.</p>
<p>Tried rebooting, tried safe mode with networking.</p>
<p>

I have no idea what else to try now, perhaps the only answer is to dump Skype? As nothing else is refusing to install.</p>

<h2>            sleep&#47;hibernation issues after upgrade to 1903 &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the windows 10 pro 1903 update in May I am having issues when my dell e7250 system goes to deep sleep.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>System:</p>
<p>E7250</p>
<p>Intel HD Graphics 5500</p>
<p>Docking Station</p>
<p>Dell 2405FPW</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an external monitor connected to the system through a dell docking station.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system goes into light sleep (Docking station power light flashes), the monitor comes back normally after you hit the docking station power switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when the system goes into deep sleep (Docking station power light off), the monitor does not come back after you hit the docking station power switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did not have this issue before the 1903 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions welcome.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can be an issue with the Power Plan. You can follow the steps mentioned below and see if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1: Try to reset the power plans:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Then click on <strong>Change plan settings</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Then click on <strong>Restore default settings for this plan</strong>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Please follow the steps mentioned in the article: Windows 10:
</span><a href="https://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/sln309800/windows-10-troubleshooting-sleep-hibernation-issues-on-your-dell-pc?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Troubleshooting sleep/hibernation issues on your Dell PC</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft
 cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above does not help, then we will need to further research on this. We would like you open command prompt (Admin) after the PC wakes up. (Type in Windows search
<strong>CMD</strong> and then right click on it, select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then type the command as mentioned in the
<strong>/lastwake, /energy, &amp; /batteryreport</strong> section from this </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/powercfg-command-line-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Powercfg command-line</span></a><span>
 options article. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kindly send us the report of the above command lines so that we can help you further.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We await your response.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards, </span></p>

<p>We think we can confirm that this is an issue/bug within the Windows 10 1903 operating system specifically, not power plans, fast startup, Hybrid Sleep or any hardware (possibly not even drivers as we isolated those too).&nbsp; We have been troubleshooting this
 issue since the initial release of 1903 across several Dell systems/peripherals within our environment (both clean installs and upgrades), including a latitude E7250, E6430, E6420, and in a very similar peripheral configuration to the OP's here.&nbsp; We've got
 these attached to Dell E-Port II legacy docks, using Dell U2412M monitors attached via either DVI-D or DisplayPort connections.&nbsp; Both connection types exhibit the same behavior under Windows 10 1903.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have carefully isolated the hardware and troubleshooting, and attempted in order ALL the troubleshooting recommendations provided here by Naresh_K, by Dell, and by other experts across the internet.&nbsp; Nothing worked under 1903, and the only way to resolve
 the issue completely and permanently in our hardware environment was to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>clean reinstall Windows 10 1809</strong></span>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we did not capture any of the diagnostic information requested by Naresh_K above, and we don't have any further time to commit to troubleshooting the issue.&nbsp; Our opinion is that 1903 is
 definitely not yet ready for "widespread use in organizations," as undoubtedly many enterprise users still have very similar hardware setups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the bug report we finally submitted to Microsoft:&nbsp; "Dell Latitude E7250 and E6430/E6420, Dell E-Port II legacy dock, DVI-D or DisplayPort connections, to Dell U2412M external display.&nbsp; Under Windows 10 1809, fully updated, fully updated drivers,
 system resumes from both S3 sleep and deep sleep hibernation with NO ISSUES.&nbsp; Under same fully updated Windows 10 1903 system and peripherals, clean installs all around and fully updated drivers via Dell Command | Update, the system video "hangs" upon resume
 from hibernation ONLY, external dell monitor briefly wakes to display UEFI access while resuming the system from disk, then just prior to arriving at login screen, the Dell monitor reenters its own sleep mode as if it sudden lost signal from the PC.&nbsp; Upon
 opening the lid of the notebook PC still connected to dock, we find the internal display working, but in a compromised display quality.&nbsp; troubleshooting suggested here https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/sleephibernation-issues-after-upgrade-to-1903/cfd84ab2-20
 no effect."</p>

<p>Thank you T TrentQueen- [O365] for reporting that behavior here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I filed a bug report on the same as noted above, but I did it using the Feedback Hub App in a clean installed version of 1809.&nbsp; I labeled it "Windows 10 Version 1903" in the subject line of the bug, but I don't know if Microsoft accepts bugs from one version
 reported in another, or just dumps them as inappropriate.&nbsp; I filed it under "Power-Battery" &gt; "Hibernation" I think, or else "Display-Display Drivers" &gt; Black Screen.&nbsp; Either way, I stated it's "Critical" and "Renders Device Unusable."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you still have 1903 installed on one of those machines, you might want to also file the same bug using that version's Feedback Hub App.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those of us on this thread can't be the only ones affected by this, and perhaps as enterprise testing moves forward this bug will become more widespread.</p>

            I have a older desktop PC that has never had a issue with sleep, well until 1903 release. I feel like Windows is going backwards in time. I used to have sleep issues all the time in like Windows 95. I ran power troubleshooter and reset balanced power profile.
 I even ran System file checker which did detect issue but that was related to yet another issue with Windows 1903 which is well documented. Its just another reason I won't be replacing this PC with another Windows PC.&nbsp;

<p>I also have this problem. Before installing 1903 sleeps worked perfectly. Now when I put the pc to sleep manually it goes to sleep. I can wake it with a keyboard stoke after 5 mins ok,&nbsp; but after a long time ( as yet undetermined - overnight) it will not
 wake and I have to use the power button to restart it. Then it restarts from scratch as if I had powered it off.&nbsp; I have tried all the different power settings to no avail. I also think this is a bug. I have also experienced the odd video seizing up when they
 it used to play ok. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a Dell 690 quad core</p>

<p>Yeah, that is a good idea for those who live on campuses, prisons or some other public places. I am not a prisoner. I live alone with my husband. I don't have to hide anything from him. USB might work fine until I don't get a virus. I used that Gmail address
 also for my Android device as a main account for purchases and apps. I didn't set any app specific passwords. Unfortunately the contents of the USB can be hacked, cracked, copied, erased too. This has happened to me once when I was moving files from Android
 through USB cable directly do the USB drive plugged in to my Windows 10 device. I can't imagine the situation when the hacker gets access to all my accounts and passwords just by copying one single Notepad file. For this reason I've always used a paper and
 a pencil or a pen. It's easy to create IP masks but it's not easy to break the door lock of the house that has many floors and&nbsp;apartments.</p>

<p>The best security that you have is your fingers.&nbsp; Do not click on a link that you do not know.&nbsp; When downloading a program make sure that all of the other things are unchecked so you just get the program that you are asking for and not a lot of junk that
 may come from a hacker.</p>

            I just wonder if there is any way how I can change my email address inside my security settings of my computer without losing access to that same&nbsp;Microsoft account. I have done this already on my
<a href="http://www.smule.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sing Smule</a>&nbsp;app account inside my Android. So now I can access my account on Windows too. Would it be possible to keep that same Microsoft ID and add one more email and set it as a main recovery
 email?

<h2>            Windows wont start, repair, not even able to restor to the factory setting</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have HPxw 4600 workstation. Quite old but still does the business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is made to have up to 4 screens connected, which I use for my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back nearly 6 months ago, or even longer, windows 10 got updated automatically, as always, and since then, two our of four screens stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was the Nvidia quatro 720 something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to say that I have two graphic cards installed at my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update, the Nvidia stopped working and I used only two screens, I tried countless repairs, uninstalls, reboots etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But nothing helped. In December 2016, one day my PC asked for update, &nbsp;so I did it and believe it or not, all four screens lighted up, until I realised that it was only the begining of problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it looked like that the Nvidia driver was updated, but it didn't allow to start my PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was playing whole day and the only thing I was able to do, to bring the PC to the stage it was before the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So had again, only two screens. Than I went on Christmas break and on my return today, I checked if there is any update for windows required and saw that Nvidia again wasn't updated, plus some error number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went online, read some discussion and installed the latest Nvidia software for my graphic card.</p>
<p>Since I installed it, roughly at 10.30am (now is 5pm), I am trying to reboot the system, restore it to the manufacture setting, and NOTHING works, &nbsp;I simply can't start the PC. What ever I did - restore to manufacture, return to last saved point, repair
 and you name it from the list, it always says, that I can't be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, not only the update 6 months ago, put one of my graphic card out of order, but today, the whole PC wont start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like that I have to take it to the service to repair...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not an expert on PC, so I am not able to do any programing or changing of spec. I am simply just user!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start the PC, a windows logo appears and than the thinking circle starts and is running around for hours and hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, when I unplug the PC, I manage to get in to the mode, where I can try to recover the PC,but it is only every 5-6th reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the errors appeared on my screens was - 0x800703f1 and second was D:\Windows\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>I once managed to open the Windows in a Safe Mode and only one screen worked, but what I can do in safe mode? As neither the network or internet worked.</p>
<p>It kept asking me to Reboot the PC to get the internet and than I was back to the begining, wathing dots running in circle :(</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to log into my PC under Save Mode with Networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to update all my drivers, even though I wasn't sure how to do it. So I typed into Settings driver update and an option with Device Manager has opened. I could see two triangle errors there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One under Generic PnP Monitor and one under HP Colour LaserJet 5500.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to update both, it said that all software is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to uninstall them but unsuccessfully, as both triangles were still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After then, I installed the Windows Update Troubleshooter as suggested, run the troubleshooter and after a while, a message appeared on my screen that Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I rebooted the PC and had the same result, windows won't start only a running circle on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But few more things I can now say, being on the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The graphic card, which stopped working two of my screens is NVIDIA Quadro NVS 290.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other one, on which I can run the safe mode is NVIDIA GeForce GT 630.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So not sure where to go from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ludek</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update from 9.1.2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I managed to log into my PC via Save Mode, I deleted all NVidia drivers, also downloaded a tool called Driver Talent, who helped me to get few drivers right.</p>
<p>But, the problem is still here. After about 40 reboots, 10 save modes I managed to see two screens and the save mode is no longer needed until I am forced to reboot or switch OFF the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After than, I am at the beginning. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, it took me nearly two hours to get back to where I was yesterday after nearly 20 hours of trying to get where I am now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't spend every morning two hours to get my PC working!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I go to Device Manager, I still see there an error with the&nbsp;Generic PnP Monitor and one under HP Colour LaserJet 5500.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the Driver Talent, it keeps saying that both Nvidia cards need&nbsp;new software, but I only update the one which runs the two screens which worked before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update the NVIDIA Quadro NVS 290 couple of times too, but it crashed again the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention, that since the update back six months ago, my Logitech HD Webcam C510 stopped working and I can't simply make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Sunday, I can't also use Viber Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the main issue is how to make the PC work, without wondering what will hapen&nbsp;the next time, when I reboot my PC.<br />
</p>
<p>It's simply a Microsoft Update issue, as before the update 4 or 6 months ago, I had four screens working, including my webcam...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            <p>When you are done with your editing of your project, first save the project file (.wlmp) with File &gt; Save project. That will save the current state of your project in case you want to make further edits later and/or want to save the movie in a different
 format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, you want to save your movie. This is a separate option called File &gt; Save movie. When you select that, you'll be given a choice of output formats. Scroll down through the list until you get a format you like (e.g. Android (large) or Android (medium)
 or perhaps Android 720p or Android 1080p.</p>

</p><p>The result will be an .mp4 file saved on your PC. Preview the results to confirm the movie plays as expected. The next thing you need to do is to get this onto your phone. You'll want to refer to other sites on how to do this. You could, for example, put
 the file in your Google Drive and then retrieve it from there on your phone. You could then choose to download it directly to your phone.</p>

    <title>RDP sessions freezing and entering down status - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            RDP sessions freezing and entering down status</h2>
                    <p>Terminal Services on Windows 2008 R2 Enterprise</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The KB2383928 article&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2383928#appliesto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2383928#appliesto</a>&nbsp;almost fits my situation exactly. But the trigger for RDP session to end is actions by users working in our Electonic
 Health Records system. The EHR program is resource intensive, but this problem seems to be new after more than a year of operation. Users are running RDP session from a thin client station and will attempt open a template or other action and the session locks
 up. I think at first the session will appear as diconnected in the Remote desktop services manager but it enters a down state and two processes from the session become stranded, csrss.exe and the EHRProgam.exe. If this happens to enough sesssions, the server
 stops responding and a restart by physically holding down the power button becomes neccessay. As I write this it fits the KB aticle so well I think I have to try the HotFix. Just looking for reassurance that the HotFix is not out of date for our server running
 Windows 2008 R2 Enterprise.</p>
<p>Also, for full disclosure, I have been making adjustments to GP regarding "active but idle sesssion time outs"&nbsp;and "end disconnected sessions"&nbsp;but I have undone the change I made in that regard (both are currently set to time out never).&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other
 thing I can think of is that we hit a level of use that brought the issue up. The article describes one cause as heavy use. I mention this because I am trying to understand why this started out of the blue? Thanks for any and all help.</p>

<p>This problem is not related to IE. You should take your laptop and go to <br />
the next T-Mobile shop where you bought it and ask them for help. If you <br />
bought it online then contact T-Mobile support. You could also search for <br />
a forum that discusses issues with that particular stick.</p>

<p><span>Hi Gary,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>1.
 Does the modem work if you boot the machine with the USB modem attached to the USB port?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 the phone getting detected in device manger?</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if the services ‘<strong>Telephony’ and ‘Remote access connection manager’</strong> started and running?</span></p>
<p><span>To check for the same, follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type&nbsp;<strong>services.msc</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>C.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check&nbsp;
 ‘<strong>Telephony</strong>’ and&nbsp;<strong>Remote access connection manager</strong> (or Remote access conn)</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure they are both started. If they are not, start them by selecting start up type as ‘manual’ and pressing the ‘start’ button.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>a. Click on Start, got to Control Panel – Hardware and Sound – Phone and Modem Options.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In Modem tab, right-click the modem and select Properties</span></p>
<p><span>c. If the default speed is not already set, set the Maximum Port speed to 57600</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click the Diagnostic tab</span><span>－</span><span>Click
 Query Modem If the modem responds and it is functioning, the system displays the modem information.</span></p>
<p><span>If the message "No Hardware ID Found" is displayed, or if you receive an error message, then contact the manufacturer of your computer for help
 with troubleshooting the modem errors.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Install Stuck at 64&#37; Boot Loop</h2>
                    <p>I was having trouble with windows 10 so I decided to format and go back to Windows 7, but dell doesn't support that anymore. Since, I already upgraded to Windows 10, they advised me to download the windows 10 free install. But, for some reason I am stuck
 at 64% and I cant find anything on this forum&nbsp; on how to correct it. Yes, Andre's information is great, but there is no evidence of how to get to the Windows setup screen. If I reboot, I go right back to the same screen of 64% loop after putting in the boot
 disc and restarting. I reset my bios to reboot from the windows 10 download and rebooted. But, it still goes back to the 64% installation screen. So now what? I can't get to the Windows setup screen? Help please, its been 3 days......</p>

    <title>Xbox One will not turn on after shutting off unexpectedly. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vehnymm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One will not turn on after shutting off unexpectedly.</h2>
                    <p>I have been consistently having this problem for the last year and a half after purchasing my Xbox One two and a half years ago. The following issue happens once or twice every few months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Xbox One has been shutting itself out randomly without any warning. No notification comes up about the system overheating, and it does not appear that the system is overheating (though it is still a possibility). When the problem started, I could turn
 the system back on within a few minutes. Over time, this increased to a few hours. Yesterday, my system did this again and shut off. I left it off for the rest of the day and tried to turn it on today, and it will not turn on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the forums, unplugged all my cables and plugged them in again, reset the power strip my Xbox One is hooked up to, and nothing has helped. Do I need to send my Xbox One in for service or repair? Do I need to get a new system altogether? Any
 help would be very much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This might be a problem due to power brick.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong></p>
<p>Your Xbox One console may unexpectedly turn off under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>The console is too hot.</p>
<p>There's a problem with the power supply.</p>
<p>Reset your internal power supply</p>
<p>The Xbox One S and Xbox One X have an internal power supply that works in all regions worldwide. If your console won't turn on, it may simply need a power reset. Often, power issues are due to the power supply resetting after a power surge.</p>
<p>To reset the internal power supply, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Unplug the power cord from the console.</p>
<p>Wait 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Plug the cord back into the console, and then press the Xbox button on the front of the console.</p>
<p>or perhaps your power supply is clogged and overheating...</p>
<p>Solution 2:</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I upgraded my Windows 7 to Windows 10 around 6 months ago.&nbsp; Everything was good until two months ago.Now,&nbsp; however, it is&nbsp; I see a message right bottom of the screen, indicating that the Windows is not activated.&nbsp; The windows 7 was originally pre-installed
 on my laptop when I purchased it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I several times restored and updated the Windows, but I cannot active the windows. This is indeed a persisted error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is Samsung, and since I upgraded to Windows 7, I also lost the recovery partition, so I cannot run "Samsung Recovery Solutions".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the error that I receive:</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot correctly . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to

<h2>            Headset mic picks up audio playing through the headphone</h2>
                    Hello! My issue at the moment is on my old PC, I had a B&amp;O Play control center with my realtek HDA card, which had an option for acoustic echo cancellation. Normally this should be found in the enhancement tab, correct? The problem is, on my new PC I have
 Realtek HDA(SST) and it opens a seemingly different B&amp;O Audio Control center. On there, the only option is HP Noise Cancellation. Where is the option for acoustic echo cancellation? I've already checked in the properties of the recording device- there is no
 enhancements tab there! The echo cancellation helps cut down on the headset's microphone picking up the same audio that is being sent to the headset. Without it, when I am in a call with someone, or am recording audio, there is an awful echo with the microphone
 picking up what I'm hearing. Thank you for any insight!

<p>Hello SachetSachdeva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To address your concern, kindly help us with the following questions: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer? </li><li>Which build of Windows is installed on your machine? </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Type <strong>winver</strong> in the search window and press <strong>Enter</strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try with few troubleshooting steps and see if it works. Kindly check with the steps listed below and do the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to disable Microphone from the Settings and see if it helps. To disable, go to
<strong>Settings</strong>&gt; click on <strong>Privacy</strong> &gt; Choose <strong>Microphone</strong> from the list and
<strong>disable</strong> it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once after disabling it, <strong>reboot your machine</strong> and check if it works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Restart the service. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could be occurring due to the service responsible for audio as well. I suggest you to restart the service by following the steps listed below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Search for <strong>services.msc</strong> in the <strong>Start</strong> <strong>
menu</strong> and double click on it. </li><li>Narrow down to <strong>Windows Audio</strong> from the list, right click on it and choose
<strong>Start</strong>/<strong>Restart</strong> option. </li><li>Once after restarting the service, check if the issue persists. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the above method doesn't fix, try method 3. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Uninstall the Audio drivers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could be occurring due to the outdated drivers that are installed on your machine. Hence we will try updating the drivers and check if the issue persists. To do that,
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Right click</strong> on the <strong>Start</strong> <strong>menu</strong> and click on
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. </li><li>Narrow down to <strong>Audio inputs and outputs</strong> and expand it. </li><li><strong>Right</strong> <strong>click</strong> on the driver and choose <strong>
Update driver</strong> and proceed with the onscreen prompts. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us with the results, we are looking into this for you and we will be glad to assist you if the issue persists.</p>

<p>Hello SachetSachdeva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To address your concern, kindly help us with the following questions: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer? </li><li>Which build of Windows is installed on your machine? </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Type <strong>winver</strong> in the search window and press <strong>Enter</strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try with few troubleshooting steps and see if it works. Kindly check with the steps listed below and do the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to disable Microphone from the Settings and see if it helps. To disable, go to
<strong>Settings</strong>&gt; click on <strong>Privacy</strong> &gt; Choose <strong>Microphone</strong> from the list and
<strong>disable</strong> it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once after disabling it, <strong>reboot your machine</strong> and check if it works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Restart the service. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could be occurring due to the service responsible for audio as well. I suggest you to restart the service by following the steps listed below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Search for <strong>services.msc</strong> in the <strong>Start</strong> <strong>
menu</strong> and double click on it. </li><li>Narrow down to <strong>Windows Audio</strong> from the list, right click on it and choose
<strong>Start</strong>/<strong>Restart</strong> option. </li><li>Once after restarting the service, check if the issue persists. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the above method doesn't fix, try method 3. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Uninstall the Audio drivers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could be occurring due to the outdated drivers that are installed on your machine. Hence we will try updating the drivers and check if the issue persists. To do that,
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Right click</strong> on the <strong>Start</strong> <strong>menu</strong> and click on
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. </li><li>Narrow down to <strong>Audio inputs and outputs</strong> and expand it. </li><li><strong>Right</strong> <strong>click</strong> on the driver and choose <strong>
Update driver</strong> and proceed with the onscreen prompts. </li></ul>
<p>

<p>Hi Mala! Thanks for the response! Before I reply to it all, I actually downloaded a different version of the realtek audio driver to fix my issue. For some reason the version I had didn't allow me to change the enhancements tab or alter the echo cancellation
 settings. I already tried to update it to the latest and that didn't do anything. I found the version on my PC that had the option, and it was compatible with my laptop too! I installed that instead. I'll respond to each of the things you suggested in case
 there's a better solution :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Make and Model:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">HP ENVY Laptop 17-ae1xx</span></p>
<p>- Windows Version: 1803 (OS Build 17134.799).</p>
<p>- Method 1: I've tried this before changing the audio driver, and it was the same result. The main problem was that the enhancements tab wasn't available for some reason on the other audio driver. I changed it from&nbsp;Realtek High-Definition (HD) Audio Driver
 (Windows 10 v1803)&nbsp;6.0.1.8437 Rev.C to&nbsp;6.0.1.7796. The latter changes the audio control panel which it uses and has the echo cancellation on there.</p>
<p>- Method 2: I haven't been able to test this since I've solved the issue sort of. As mentioned, the version of the driver that I was using for some reason restricted the enhancements tab and the issue was with that itself. Even after updating it to the latest
 it wasn't fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Method 3: As mentioned, the driver update page had actually determined windows was running the best version for it, but when I went to HP's driver selfservice I found a more current version. That one, too, failed to return the enhancements tab so I went
 to the version my PC had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thank you for your response! If you have any suggestions/thoughts on why the driver version would prevent the enhancements tab I'd love to hear it.</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for the reply, SachetSachdeva. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The issue could have occured due to the latest drivers that were installed on your device. We will have to check with the compatibility of the driver before installing them. If the driver isn’t compatible, its functionality reduces and gradually
 stops the device from working. Hence, it’s always recommended to check for the compatibility before installing any driver or software.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In this scenario, you were able to resolve the issue by installing the old driver that was compatible to your device.

            Thank you for your response.<br />
I cannot start in safe mode. I cannot get beyond the blue screen other than Dell set up screens which do not<br />
offer safe mode, only enabling and disabling options for hardware. Note I have no media disks or<br />
documentation which helps.<br />
I used "errorlive" website which offers a solution, but requires a copy of "Media C reation Tool" to be down<br />
loaded, hence my initial question. Where and how do I down load ? Microsoft site sends me in circles.<br />
1 C omputer purchased May 2017 with Windows 10 ready installed.<br />
2 Had McAfee Antivirus software installed. I uninstalled this some time ago using uninstall software.<br />
I installed Avast system and computer has been operating for several months without problem. (<br />
Previous experience shows both Norton and McAfee slow system)<br />
Problem has only occurred this week since microsoft auto update.<br />
3 I am sure it was the McAfee uninstall that I used<br />
4 I cannot get beyond the Blue screen and error code to get the windows key.<br />
Re-starts do not give any system repair options or boot options.<br />
Only F1 and F12 keys offered<br />
regards<br />
JimmyHS

<p>Assuming you can start the computer now, in Safe Mode with Networking if need be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall Avast per the exact&nbsp;instructions on <em>this page ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="https://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Download/run the <strong><a href="http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool
</a></strong>&amp; reboot. [Ignore the log.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot start the computer at all, use F12 to do a full factory recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: Once the factory recovery's completed, the McAfee free-trialware will be installed again. You MUST (a) uninstall the free-trial AND THEN (b) download/run the McAfee removal tool (c) BEFORE you install or attempt to install any updates!</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIP =&gt;&nbsp;Steer clear of Avast (especially), AVG, Norton &amp; McAfee applications. Windows Defender &amp; Firewall is really the only protection you need.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Following discussion with supplier support I have returned computer under the warranty and they will repair or return to Dell for re-load/re-boot.</p>

<p>Hello PA Bear</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had my computer returned to me fully operational with all my data and loaded files intact.</p>
<p>As suppliers support people were unable to resolve other than ensuring there was no hardware fault, (as I had already proved) , it appears it was returned to Dell for re-booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The saga is not yet complete as I await the opportunity to discuss with supplier technician on Monday to determine
<strong>if</strong> possible, how recovery was eventually made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>
<p>JIMMYHS</p>

<p>Your computer might have one or two options for creating recovery media. Use the option that works best for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
To determine which options are available to create recovery media, click Start ( ), click All Programs , and then click Recovery Manager .<br />
</p>
<p><br />
If Recovery Disc Creation displays in the list, you can use discs only.<br />
<br />
<br />
If Recovery Media Creation displays in the list, you can use either discs or a USB flash drive.<br />
Depending on the media options that your computer provides.<br />

<p>Ive bought the game and 3 map packs so far which does add up and when&nbsp;MW3 comes out&nbsp;I'll have to spend that at least again and more ££ for Elite!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes I have a choice not to buy it but lets be honest , if people you played with bought it then its likely you would get it too so you can stil play with your friends.</p>

<p>Honestly this is a slippery slope. &nbsp;The day will come when you want to play online you will be charged above the price of the game and Xbox Live Gold. &nbsp;You have been warned. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, common sense will no longer be common. &nbsp;It is one thing for a company to make money but to charge for every thing will only slowly kill a company. &nbsp;Sadly that will not be acknowledged as a problem seen through the eyes of "corporate rose coloured
 glasses". </p>

<p>I want more maps but boy its expensive hobby this CoD. BFBC2 annoyed me at times due to lack of maps but was easy on the wallet. Knowing that everyone is playing larger playlists , feels like its forcing me to shell out for more maps. Plus I am not overly

    <title>Windows 7 suddenly cannot connect to internet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wrg2012  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 suddenly cannot connect to internet&#63;</h2>
                    I have two desktops and two laptops running Windows 7 and two wi-fi routers. One of my desktops, desktop no. 1, was in use yesterday then turned off. When I turned it back on today, I can connect to router no. 1 but not to the internet. I did the following:<br />
1. Connected and installed a USB wifi adapter.<br />
2. Ipconfig indicates valid IP assigned by router no. 1<br />
3. Executed ipconfig /release<br />
4. Executed ipconfig /renew<br />
5. Still not connected.<br />
6. Connected to router no. 2<br />
7. Ipconfig indicates valid IP assigned by router no. 2<br />
8. Executed ipconfig /release<br />
9. Executed ipconfig /renew<br />
10. Still not connected.<br />
11. Uninstalled USB wifi adapter.<br />
12. Connected desktop no. 1 to router no. 1 via CAT 5<br />
13. Still not connected.<br />
14. Note: Laptop connects to both routers via onboard wifi and via CAT 5<br />
15. Note: Desktop no. 2 connects to both routers via USB wifi and CAT 5.<br />
16. Uninstalled LAN adapter through Device Manager.<br />
17. Rebooted and allowed Win 7 to reinstall adapter.<br />
18. Still no connection.<br />
19. Disabled Firewall.<br />
20. Still no connection.<br />
21. Disabled Anti-Virus<br />
22. Still no connection.<br />
23. LAN properties = "Obtain IP address automatically"<br />
24. Although routers are assigning IP addresses, I cannot PING either router.<br />
25. Windows Network Diagnostics reports "Your broadband modem is experiencing connectivity issues" yet my other PCs work fine.<br />
26. I have turned off my modem and both routers and back on.<br />
27. No new software was installed on desktop no. 1.<br />
<br />
My first thought was a firewall problem. I have McAfee on the problem machine. I disabled it and disabled Windows firewall also.<br />
I have two other laptops running XP Pro and they connect without issue.<br />
I need help! Please!

<span>Hi WRG2012,</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s unfortunate that you are unable to connect to Internet. Do not worry; let me see what best I can do for you
 to get the issue fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform the following methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Reset Winsock</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. Click the
<b>Start</b> button.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type
<b>cmd</b> in the Start Search text box and press <b>Ctrl-Shift-Enter</b> (keyboard shortcut to run Command Prompt as Administrator). Click
<b>Continue</b> to allow elevation request.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Type
<b>netsh winsock reset</b> in the Command Prompt shell, and then press the <b>Enter</b> key.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type
<b>netsh int ipv4 reset</b> in the Command Prompt shell, and then press the <b>Enter</b> key.</span></p>
<p><span>e. If you use ipv6, type
<b>netsh int ipv6 reset</b> in the Command Prompt shell, and then press the <b>Enter</b> key.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> You may need to run Network Diagnostics afterwards to repair your connection after
 this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Reset TCP/IP settings
</span></b></p>
<p><span>You can try manual steps provided in the link mentioned below to rest TCP/IP settings<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</b></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: This applies to Windows 7 Operating System as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Perform System Restore</span></b></p>
<p><span>System Restore can return your PC's system files and programs to a time when everything was working fine, potentially preventing hours
 of troubleshooting headaches. It will not affect your documents, pictures, or other data.</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the link:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore</b></a>
 and follow the steps mentioned in the link.</span></p>
<p><span>If the above methods don’t work, I think the problem is with a setting on the router. If you have MAC filter configured
 on the router I would suggest you to disable it and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be glad to help.
</span></p>

            <p>Hi Abhinav,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>2. Have you try to update the drivers from manufacturer website? </p>
<p>3. When do you get this error message? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like&nbsp;Windows could not install the latest driver to the device and&nbsp;it&nbsp;is trying to install&nbsp;generic Windows basic&nbsp;display driver. I would suggest you to download and install the latest driver for the graphics device from the manufacturer website.
 You can locate the driver using the model number. I would also suggest you to download and install the essential drivers&nbsp;of other device which is not working.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Provide more information so that we could help you further. &nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Winston, Many thanks for your advice. I managed to trace the issue to NVIDIA graphics card. Once I updated its drivers manually, the issue with PnP devices disappeared. I am still having trouble with Bluetooth though. I have now updated all the drivers
 including for Bluetooth and yet it is inaccessible. After the 8.1 update was completed, I was advised to re-install the drivers for Bluetooth specifically which I did but it has obviously not worked. I still can't see Bluetooth radio button anywhere and it
 doesn't appear in device manager list too. My system has built-in Bluetooth. My WNC spec is</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>WNC: Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced-N 6235 - 802.11A/B/G/N 300Mbps Dual-Band Wi-Fi + Bluetooth Combo [Intel WiDi Ready] [+5] and&nbsp;I have a Clevo notebook model W251ESQ/W270ESQ.

            <p>Hi Abhinav, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good to know that you were able to resolve the issue regarding graphics driver. It looks like you may have to download and install the bluetooth drivers in Windows 8 compatibility mode.

            <span>Hi Winston,</span>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried what you suggested and discovered a few things more</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. A little search on the net revealed that at least one more person has reported a similar problem as mine (on a Toshiba system though). Please see Toshiba's response too and you wouldn't find it convincing. Go to the link:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20131019003853AA12G6P" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://answers.yahoo.</font></a>.
 I had a similar fsquirt.exe error too. I have two Bluetooth processes(32 bit only) running in &nbsp;the background (appearing so in the task manager) but to no avail. Also, there is no Bluetooth radio button in the Networks that could be switched ON
<br />
<div><br />
<div>2. There appear to be some distinctions in the hardware requirements between Win 7(64 bit) and Win 8(64 bit) which wasn't supposed to be because the Intel&nbsp;WiDi software for Windows 8 doesn't work on my machine. This is where I believe that Microsoft and
 Intel have gone wrong. I request you to fix it at the soonest possible becasue it is unfair that Windows is flashing a message that I will have to upgrade my system to run WiDi 8. I was informed by my vendor (CyberPower) in last August (when I bought my system)
 that my system was Win-8 ready and no upgrade will be required once Microsoft releases 8. I have WiDi for Win-7 (64 bit) (experiencing compatibility issues on 8.1) because unlike the upgrade from Win7 (64bit) to Win-8(64) which possibly allowed me to use the
 WiDi (and associated My WiFi utility-fsquirt.exe) in compatibility mode, when I received the 8.1 update, I was prompted by the system specifically to upgrade the Bluetooth drivers. I now realise that Win8.1 doesn't have My WiFi utility required by Intel WiDi
 for Win 7 and WiDi for 8 wouldn't install on my machine. fsquirt.exe is not to be found on the system too. When I run the Intel drivers update utility, it recommends updating the WiDi software which is unfortunately not possible on my machine.&nbsp;This probably
 isn't Microsoft's problem but my machine has a very high spec and I specifically bought a Win-8 (64 bit) ready machine on an Intel platform and it is Intel's&nbsp;drivers that&nbsp;are not compatible on it now. My system spec once again for your reference:<br />
WNC: Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced-N 6235 - 802.11A/B/G/N 300Mbps Dual-Band Wi-Fi + Bluetooth Combo [Intel WiDi Ready] [+5] and&nbsp;I have a Clevo notebook model W251ESQ/W270ESQ.
<br />
<br />
Kindly note the [Intel WiDi ready] bit in the specs. I have reported this issue to my vendor in the UK and they lament it on to you. I have been told by the tech support that it is Microsoft's responsibility to fix this and they are helpless.
<br />
<div><br />
<div>3. Result is that after having updated all the other drivers Bluetooth still doesn't show up in Device manager and hence, it is not available for use. It doesn't stop me from using the system and WiFi in general but I would like the system to be working
 to its max capability.&nbsp; </div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Kind Regards,</div>
<div>Abhinav</div>
