<p>Hi,</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>I would suggest you to perform a system restore to an earlier date when it as working fine and check if that helps.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you installed any new hardware components on your machine recently?&nbsp; If so, then this would certainly be one of the factors behind the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). More often than not, BSOD is related to incompatible driver removing which fixes the
 issue. <br />
You may refer these methods:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Please check the device list in Device Manager and verify if there’s any error reported by device manager.<br />
<br />
To go to device manager:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to start and type device manager.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select device manager from the control panel list.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the device list, see if there’s any exclamation mark or error reported.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You can either try with the&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;driver that is available or let Windows find driver for you. Refer this link for detail.<br />
<br />
<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, please try updating your BIOS for optimal performance. See if this helps in resolving the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
I’d recommend you to update BIOS with the help of the Dell technician to prevent any further concerns.<br />
<br />
See if this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            WIN 10 locked me out of my computer&#47;desktop</h2>
                    More of a comment&nbsp;-&nbsp;but would like answer from MSFT&nbsp;why this happened.&nbsp; &nbsp; On Monday I had changed my settings? (still not totally familiar with accessing new features of WIN 10) as I did not want to have to sign in as I am the only one who uses&nbsp;the computer.&nbsp;
 It did not occur to me that I would be deleting pw for my account&nbsp;if that is what happened,&nbsp; Once I shut down some change occurred where I could not access my computer at all A full screen(no taskbar or desktop visible)&nbsp;came up asking me for my PW&nbsp; I had a
 PW that I had created in WIN 7 and used that- it would not work&nbsp; Because it would not work I could not access my desktop or taskbar &nbsp;to view websites or use my computer in any way.&nbsp; I immediately called Microsoft Help desk Tech who answered said she could
 not help or connect me with anyone!&nbsp; Hysterical now I demanded help and thank goodness I got a senior technician to help.&nbsp; Luckily I could use my roommates computer to access my email so could give permission for him to access my computer.&nbsp; What would have
 happened if I had no other computer access?&nbsp;&nbsp; He "fixed" problem by telling me I would no longer need to sign in - but also removed the temporary pw he had used while working on my computer&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;no PW&nbsp; Well it seems I do need a PW to access this forum&nbsp;
 so now I needed to set a new one.&nbsp; This incident was very stressful - I would like to know why no warning was given if I was going to be denied access to my computer.&nbsp; Anyone here know why this happened?&nbsp;&nbsp; One other thing related to this&nbsp; I also use Firefox
 in conjunction with IE. I am now getting a pop up from Msft?&nbsp;when I try to send link by email&nbsp;&nbsp;"ACCOUNTS First things first let's add your accounts" choose an account&nbsp; where I see Outlook Exchange and a host of others to add&nbsp; WHAT IS THIS??&nbsp; never had to go
 through this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sooooooooooo sorry I "upgraded to 10"&nbsp; bullied really as I could no longer get updates in 7&nbsp; Interesting article today International Times "<span>Consumer rights group Which? has called on Microsoft to compensate PC users who
 were forced to have their computers professionally repaired after downloading Windows 10."

            Hi, <br />
<br />
We got you. First, about Windows 10 asking you a password to login to your computer, do you remember signing up for a Microsoft account when you have your Windows 7? Because if you sign up for a Microsoft account automatically it will ask you a password when
 you upgrade your computer. If you locally sign up then it will not require a password. Since it is asking for a password, please recall if you have signed up for a Microsoft account online. Second, about you sending a message to your Firefox, you will be asked
 to sign up to your default account like (@yahoo.com, @gmail.com, @hotmail.com). If you have one of that, all you have to do is just sign in and then send.
<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<p>My account was hacked tonight and 10000 points purchased and used to buy fifa 12 stuff.&nbsp; Recovered my gamertag and even though I never play fifa I have got achievements for FiFa 12 which was only out today.&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft and like most have been
 informed that my account is frozen and it will take up to 21 days to sort.&nbsp; Surely if this has been going on now for a while Microsoft should've put some security on their system to flag anyone purchasing similar amounts of points.&nbsp; I await the outcome.&nbsp; But
 for now I am £85 out of pocket..</p>

<p>Same here. They said it would take 25 days to investigate and my account will be locked in the meantime. I did some investigating of my own and found articles and posts about this happening with FIFA 11. Back then, it was apparently a loophole in EA's account
 system where people can get info via EA's support and use that info to recover your account via MS or something. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but EA made a statement saying it would be fixed in the next FIFA. This is the next FIFA and due to charges
 to my card I may not be able to get my car fixed in time to avoid a $1k registration citation. The charges when through on my birthday. Le sigh.</p>

<p>Same here. &nbsp;Something HAS to be going on, as again my account was moved to another console, points purchased using my console for FIFA 12. &nbsp;When reported, have been told it will take 30 (!) days to investigate, but in the mean time I cannot use my profile
 to log in, so i'm penalised for my account somehow being hacked. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So no, online Gears 3, no loading my save game profiles or earning additional gamer points for a month! &nbsp; Why does it take so long to just give me my account back and still go on and investigate
 the fraud too...</p>

<p>Just to join in. I too had my account hacked in the exact same manner. They purchased 6000 MS points and then made Fifa 12 purchases.</p>
<p>This all happened on Monday 3/10/11 and i contacted the telephone support immediately. I too have been told the same 25 days to sort and i would not have access to my account.</p>
<p>Today i have managed to log in and im actually recovering my Gamer Tag. surely i should not be able to do this as it would suggest that they have done nothing about it ?</p>
<p>Fifa appears in my recently played and so do the achievements</p>
<p>Confirmed just recovered my gamer tag and have full access !!!! i cant remove my credit card so what the hell are MS playing at ?</p>
<p>- Some one could easily abuse the system again</p>
<p>- im still £51 down from the thieves who stole my account.</p>
<p>Gonna call them again</p>

<p>This is all too common my account was stolen and migrated to Russia. &nbsp;I got the account back but now am being told there is no way for them to bring it back to an American account thus losing most of it's functionality. &nbsp;As an 8 year loyal subscriber i'm
 shocked that my only option is to start from scratch.</p>

<p>I spoke to support who informed me that they had put a block on any live purchases. This means that i still have access to x-box live.
</p>
<p>They did say however that the likely hood of the account being completely suspended when they start the investigation is very high.</p>
<p>The thing that bugs me is they appear not all interested that this had happened to a number of people.</p>

<p>I got hit on the 29th and was on the phone with support when the were trying to add more points but were blocked. I changed my id password and tired to recover my gamertag but now its not there and a new gamertag for a silver membership is. I am going to
 call support again tommorrow and see why this is and also find out why they refunded the second purchase but not the first 4000 point one.</p>

            <p><em>Hello Palcouk,</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well you are correct in saying that&nbsp;my McAffee Anti Virus and Malwarebytes programs are "Supposed" to keep me safe and sound and virus free&nbsp;while I traverse the internet, but nothing's perfect and the SpyweareBlaster program was installed as a sort
 of redundant line of defense against the viral nature of the wondrously vast world wide web, as Maverick might say "It's a target rich environment" and our computers are the targets. And yes conflicts between programs is possible but if that happens the&nbsp;Program
 Pugilist's can easily separated, or deleted from the system.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact I have one example to justify&nbsp; the redundancy&nbsp;of online protection that I employ. A few months ago I was downloading videos via YouTube.com and had&nbsp;installed a download accelerator program to make the downloading process more speeedy and
 pursuant to my time constraints but to my dismay I found that this download accelerator program was downloading more than videos into my computer right past the nose of my daunted and purportedly ultra&nbsp;protectively capable McAfee Anti Virus program, to which
 they basically told me "You can't catch em' all." So like Gene Simmons once said "If you're going where it rains, wear a raincoat!"</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now as for your opening statement&nbsp;"&nbsp;</em>If you purchased the Pro version, it would be added to your startup and would auto update its definitions<em>." I must take acceptation with because I've downloaded many "Free" programs that added themselves
 to the start menu without so much as &nbsp;permission from me, no matter if&nbsp;I wanted them to do so or not.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yes Palcouk&nbsp;my friend it is "</em>OK to manually run the program.<em>",&nbsp;which is&nbsp;what I do,&nbsp;at least when I remember to do so which is why I asked if anyone&nbsp;there amoungst you&nbsp;knew if and how to add this program to the start menu. Thanks ever
 so much&nbsp;for answering my question!</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely yours, Tiffany A Snow esq.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>To add the program to your auto-run simply add its shortcut to the StartUp Folder, however that wont help as the free version will not run automatically in the background, the program will simply open for you to then manually run a scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you are running the Pro Version of malwarebytes, ie that runs in the background and auto scans on the fly, then by installing multiple scanning software your are not protecting your self, but likely causing the scanning programs to conflict, resulting
 in niether functioning correctly.</p>

<h2>            How do i restore files from &#36;INPLACE.&#126;TR</h2>
                    Had major issues upgrading Windows 7 from Vista. I lost my OS and didn't have a back up copy of Vista. So I bought a new copy of Windows 7. Windows 7 has put all of my older files into the $INPLACE.~TR folder. I can see these files, I can even move the
 files but, I cannot open/use the files. Is there a way to retrieve these files?

<p>My suggestion, don't delete the folder until you access the files you still need, browse to the folders that contain the files you need, copy the files from the folder to a temporary folder on your desktop, name it whatever you want and then make sure you
 have installed the applications that open these files. IF they still won't open&nbsp;then they could have been damaged.</p>
<p>What is the exact text of the error message recieved when trying to open these files?</p>

<h2>            Missing emails in Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8.1 and have downloaded Windows Live Mail as my email program.&nbsp; I receive messages to my inbox, but shortly thereafter they disappear and a message appears which says there is nothing to view as it may be hidden.&nbsp; I have checked my View
 settings versus other email accounts I have (where the emails are not being deleted) and even in this account my Sent emails are not being deleted, only my Inbox and my Deleted items.&nbsp; This is an IMAP account.&nbsp; I have also gone to the internet and accessed
 my email account via their webmail and there is nothing in my Inbox.&nbsp; I have been on the phone several times with my email provider and they basically say it's because it's an IMAP account rather than a POP, but that doesn't make sense to me because my sent
 messages aren't disappearing and this isn't happening in my other email account.&nbsp; Please help.</p>

</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We apologize for the untimely reply. Let us help you on your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear what happened to your emails. I understand that your emails have disappeared from your account. Have you checked the Deleted folder for that account in Windows Live Mail and in your webmail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to check your email account's Deleted folder for the deleted emails by going to this path using Windows Explorer: %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\&lt;Email account name&gt;\Deleted Items</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what you'll find.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Speedlink Xeox SL-6566-BK Wireless Gamepad Connection Issue</h2>
                    <p>Good day all, have had the Xeox SL-6566-BK wireless gamepad for a few years now and it worked fine on Windows 10 but, as of the middle of this year, it has now stopped connecting to the dongle. It first started with connecting only after a few attempts of
 plugging out and in, including different USB ports but eventually that didn't help anymore. I did troubleshooting and the message it gave was to plug the device into an available USB 2.0 port yet it had worked before on this very notebook so how could it have
 suddenly stopped working now? By the way, I did contact customer support twice and eventually received no more feedback. Anybody know of a fix?</p>

            Hi Gu1t4rDud3, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />What we need to work out here is whether the gamepad is at fault or Windows drivers are. The easiest way to check this would be to plug the gamepad into another Windows 10 PC to see if it works just as it used to on your PC.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't work, then we know it's a problem with the gamepad, otherwise I'll give you further options to troubleshoot drivers. Let me know how you go!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone creates a document on a computer with a Chinese font, the document might look different when shared with someone else who does not have Chinese fonts installed on their computer. Office programs will substitute the original
 font with the closest available installed font, which may result in odd spacing between characters. You can add the language you need for the fonts to display correctly. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the Windows <strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>Settings</strong>, and then click
<strong>Time &amp; language</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Region &amp; language</strong>, and then click <strong>Add a language</strong>.</li><li>Click the language for the font you want to add. Any fonts associated with that language will be downloaded, and your text should display correctly.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Let us know if the solution above works for you.</span></p>

</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion, but the real situation is we have thousand computers and users don't have permission to add a language by themselves. we need to install those fonts during system installation. and even we had installed chinese language package
 previously, but the chinese supplemental fonts like Fangsong, Kaiti still are not installed, so we want to find a way to install those fonts like install additional update package or add parameter during install language package. do you have any idea for this?</p>

<h2>            Your PC can&#39;t project to another screen. Try reinstalling the driver or using another video card.  After Windows updates KB4048954 and KB4049001</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo T430 laptop running Windows 10.&nbsp; I have used this for doing presentations with an InFocus LCD projector for the last several years.&nbsp; It worked fine a month ago, but today it will not connect to the projector once Windows 10 has completed
 loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed all of the updates available from Lenovo for the T430 and Windows 10 (64 bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connect the projector (using a VGA cable) to the laptop before powering up either of them.&nbsp; In the past, when I have had the projector powered up, the laptop would connect to it automatically when it was powered up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, the laptop connects to the projector while it is booting, but loses the connection once the Windows logon screen appears.&nbsp; That is, while Windows is loading, the "rotating string of pearls" displays on both the laptop screen and the projector.&nbsp; But
 as soon as Windows completes loading and the logon screen is displayed, the projector loses the image.&nbsp; Any attempt to connect to the projector (either Fn + F7 or WinKey + P) results in the error message:&nbsp;&nbsp;Your PC can't project to another screen. Try reinstalling
 the driver or using another video card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop worked fine a month ago.&nbsp; Windows updates were installed on the laptop this past weekend.&nbsp; Those updates included a bunch for Office 365, and two Windows updates:&nbsp; KB4048954 and KB4049011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the KB4048954 patch, but that did not resolve the problem.&nbsp; Windows will not allow me to uninstall the KB4049011 patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above, I have installed all drivers available from Lenovo, including the most current video driver.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that did not solve the issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did a re-install of Windows (from settings =&gt; update and security =&gt; recovery =&gt; reset this PC).&nbsp; I let it wipe out all of my files, so it should have been a pretty clean installation of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to the Lenovo site and reinstalled any driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop now works with the projector once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, the laptop is now behind on updates.&nbsp; I will try to install them in a controlled fashion, creating numerous restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for now, it is working fine and I am in the process of reinstalling all of my software programs.</p>

<p>Hey there Isaac!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention, this&nbsp;was a known issue and a Service Alert. The best thing to do at the moment would be to clear out the consoles caches since&nbsp;after a service alert the information needs to&nbsp;be cleared out.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How to clear Game Cache on the Xbox One:</span></p>
<p><span>Settings</span></p>
<p><span>System</span></p>
<p><span>Storage</span></p>
<p><span>Clear Local Saved Games&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yes and Restart&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p>To clear the Network Card Cache (alternate MAC address)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Settings</p>
<p>Network</p>
<p>Network Settings</p>
<p>Advanced settings</p>
<p>Alternate MAC Address</p>
<p>Clear and restart&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>IF THE CONSOLE IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET</span></strong><span> no progress or purchase data will be lost, what we accomplish by doing these steps would be to resync the profile to the cloud
 getting rid of any corruption as a byproduct.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Give these steps a shot and let us know if we can further assist in this or any other issues or inquiries!!</span></span></p>

    <title>Where is the Edit tab in Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peteharris48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the Edit tab in Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>I have just purchased a new PC with Windows 10 and I am using WLM as my mail tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my old PC I used Outlook Express 6 and used to find the Edit tab most useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know most of the features of the Edit tab are elsewhere on WLM but Select All is not available as an icon anywhere. I know /i can select all items in a folder by highlighting the first and holding down the shift key whist highlighting the last item. I
 have also just found out about Ctrl A.</p>
<p>However it would be most useful to have a facility similar to the Outlook Expess Edit facility. Is there any way this can be implemented in WLM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Pete</p>

<p>
</p><p>I guess I was expecting there was no Edit tab. But to be more specific is there an icon or any selection to Select All as opposed to the methods I referred to in my fist post. In other words can I Select All buy just using the mouse rather than using the
 keyboard?</p>

<p>mine disconnected during a game of Fifa and cost me a goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems Microsoft have missed out some key basic features. Would also like to have a invite party button back instead of it doing it automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that the console is great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Jenks,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the disconnect issues while playing your game. Its not a fun one to experience. As of right now there is no battery display yet on the console. I believe the illuminated Xbox home button will flash when the battery is low but that is still a theory.
 I have mine charging after I am done playing for a day or so.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reach back and let us know if this works and if you have any further questions we can help with. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            laptop no speakers or headphones are plugged in error message</h2>
                    I have Toshiba Qosmio F60 laptop and I am receiving an error message saying no speakers or headphones are plugged in. When I try the problem solver it says the problem could not be identified. When I go into device manager, the speakers are not listed.
 I can however hook my laptop through hdmi, to a television, and audio is then working correctly. How do I get audio back on my laptop?

<p><span>I would suggest you to try performing system restore to a previous time where the computer was working fine.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: system restore will put your computer back to a previous time.
 So the programs installed recently in the computer will be lost</span></p>
<p><span>If system restore fails to fix the issue, then please get in touch with Toshiba Support.</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It depends on what program you are trying to copy and paste in.&nbsp; You are able to select multiple, non continuous, lines by using the Ctrl Key and clicking or highlighting the line you want.&nbsp; For example, I held the Control key then, using the mouse, highlighted
 several different sentences in different paragraphs and could then copy them.&nbsp; This functionality has been available for several versions of windows.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are not able to perform this action then post what happens when you try and what program you are trying it in.<br />

            Great feedback, however, I am not interested in downloading another program. This seems to be a trend, but I feel, they gave us 10 for free, they should be in control. I would gladly pay for a version with my need to control my display. It is frustrating
 that too much automation is the focus, I like to think, keeps my brain sharp, but this is crazy to take a simple right away, but feed me Cortana and link this account to, sign in to do this, create an account for that.&nbsp; I just want to compute, Will Robinson.
 Thanks for the discussion floor.

            <p>My take on this is that MS is more interested in cloud, Windows / windows software as a service, and apps for phones. There are many of us that use Windows for business purposes and not&nbsp; being able to read or adjust fonts is absolutely insane. Who in the
 world decided a 9 point font is fine for everyone to use? My guess is it is some kid straight out of college that has no idea how the business world works. Someone who is more interested in silly little icons instead of user friendly productive applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating stupid application buttons that you can't even sort and icons that initiate apps maybe fine for phones but for those of us that use desk top and lap top PC(s) that do not employ touch screen technology this solution doesn't fit period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has come to the point that I wonder if Mr. Gates uses his own software.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program should be safe. I scanned it and found no malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I think that Windows SmartScreen would like to inform you that the file isn't signed by a certified author but this doesn't mean it is&nbsp;necessarily dangerous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to click "More info" and then "Run anyway".</p>

            this is dumb. instead of making it easier to change the font size, and being able to change more of the font sizes across each of the menus/dialogs/taskbars/start menu/etc they just get rid of it? i have a 4K display, and i do not want to scale everything
 to make it bigger, as that scales EVERYTHING. i just want my fonts bigger so i can read things without having to be 4 inches from the screen, and not have all the video and pictures enlarged as well. that kinda defeats the purpose of having a high resolution
 display. i might as well go back to having a 400x600 tube monitor if that is the case.. and i tried that stupid winero program, you have to log off every time you make a change, so stupid.... and it rearranged all my desktop icons.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you so much for your suggestions. &nbsp;I have a 23" high def monitor sitting on an armoire cabinet desk with a pull out work pad and keyboard holder, which basically put my screen about 18" away from
 my face. &nbsp;Not being able to change the 9 pt font to something readable was driving me crazy. &nbsp;I installed the WinTools Advanced System Font Changer as you suggested, changed and enlarged the font on all options. &nbsp;SOOOOooo much better. &nbsp;It is unbelievable,

<p>How absolutely ironic&nbsp;is it, that in the "Creators" update, you remove the ability to change fonts. That is absolutely moronic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess&nbsp;is, Microsoft is either an affiliate, owns the additional software, or is getting a kickback from "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">WinTools". Maybe one in 10,000 is going to even try to make changes to the registry, and probably
 95 percent of the ones who do try, are going to screw it up and need support. That is why you do not mess with the registry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">There is a saying MS needs to learn. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It worked fine for those who wanted those changes to be made. So bring it back or fix it!</span></p>

                    I have purchased Hitman 2 Silver. I downloaded it *and all the maps/content packs*. I played through the prologue, but now it says I don't have access to the story missions, like Finish Line. It says I have to visit the Xbox Store. I do this, but I already
 own it and have already downloaded it. I can't fix it. I uninstalled all 90 gigs of everything and reinstalled it all again. Same issue. I am seeing this reported on other forums and sites as well. No solutions proposed anywhere that I have found, but many
 people asking.

<h2>            power save mode</h2>
                    Just rcvd new computer couple of days ago.dell studio with windows vista wich is new to me.<br />
A couple of times already in the middle of using computer i get a message saying the following:<br />
<br />
WARNING MESSAGE&nbsp;&nbsp; ENTERING POWER SAVE MODE<br />
<br />
<br />
no matter what i do after this it will not unlock it self and need to do a manual shutdown and re boot to get going again.<br />
<br />
Why does it do this?<br />
<br />
When computer is idle it will go to power save mode automatically however in this situation when you hit a key on the keyboard it comes back as it should.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts!

            Hi tomras,<br />
<br />
Is this a brand new computer or just new to you? The reason I ask is that many of the "unwanted" power save problems have to do with accumulated dust inside or worse, a bad motherboard. When it enters power save mode, can you press the Numlock or Capslock keys
 and see the light toggle on and off?<br />
<br />
<p><span>Sometimes when you cannot get a computer out of "power save mode", the culprit can be an empty battery on the motherboard of your computer.</span><span>
 Not the “main” battery, but the CMOS “coin-sized “ battery.</span></p>
<p><span>Typically, this happens on a computer which is a few years old, since its batteries will have run out after such a long time.
</span></p>
<p><span>The motherboard battery is used to store various settings, such as date and time, when the mains power is off. When your computer detects an empty
 battery, it goes into a low-power mode. </span></p>
<p><span>The computer will then display as message, like "Power save mode - press any key on keyboard or move mouse". However, in certain circumstances,
 doing so does nothing. </span></p>
<p><span>The solution is to replace the button-cell battery on the motherboard of your computer<br />
</span><span><br />

            When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. You can see the signatures that have been set up on the
<em>Signatures</em> tab. Select the one you want to edit; if it's a plain text signature, edit it there in the box. Otherwise, note the path and file name in the box, then open that file, edit it in Notepad and save it.
