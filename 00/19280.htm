<p>First of all, unless you can guarantee the physical security of your PC you shouldn't do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Start, type <strong>netplwiz</strong>&nbsp;then press Return. At the top of the resulting screen is a checkmark next to the option 'Users must enter a username and password to use this computer.' Select the&nbsp;relevant username, if necessary, remove the checkmark
 and click Apply. You will be prompted to enter your password and confirm it and that's it. The next time you start your PC you won't be asked for your password.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply , but this formula works only &nbsp;in case that the data in cells (i,13) is value ; in case the data in cells(i,13) is text this code returns wrong date, because in those case the month and the day are not in correct order</p>
<p>
</p><p>for example </p>
<p>I have 2 type of data in the file:</p>
<p>data in number format: 6/12/2008 ---&gt; in This case the month is inverted with the day and it should be converted in 12/06/2008</p>
<p>
</p><p>data in text format: 22/04/09 ----&gt; &nbsp;i have to convert it in date format</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!!!</p>

            <p>If this data came from an external source (which seems likely as it does not conform to your system date format) then I would suggest reimporting the data using the Text Import tool and specifying whether the incoming data is MDY or DMY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a mashup of dates where some *may* have been converted by Excel to m/d/yy from d/m/yy (and vise-versa) then nothing other than manual examination of the data can reverse the process and even that is unreliable. (see

</p><p>I had the very same happen to me. I am following to read the answer. According to what is written under "What is live chat support?" there is a live chat representative who can help. I was unable to figure out how to request a live chat however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am tempted to abandon Skype and lose the credit and the contacts and opt for Whats App. I don't like spending so much time trying to navigate a site in search of how to speak to a person about a relatively simple issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Having problem with Windows Defender Security Center</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi guys, I am having a strange problem with Windows Defender Security Center in Windows 10 1709 (Build 16299.98). When I click on "Home"
 or "App &amp; Browser control" WDSC will closes itself. No problem when click on "Virus &amp; Threat Protection", "Device Performance &amp; Health" &amp; "Firewall &amp; Network Protection". I am also able to run virus scan with Windows Defender. Event viewer log will shows error
 id 1000 (refer to attachment) when WDSC closes itself. I have ran SFC scanner &amp; DSIM restore health with no error. Can't find any solution to my problem on web search. Hope some experts here can help me, thanks.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you’ve encountered regarding the <strong>Windows Defender Security Center
</strong>on your <strong>Windows 10</strong> computer may be caused by some files or components that are broken or missing on the system. To sort out your concern, we suggest that you perform a
<strong>repair upgrade </strong>on your PC using the <strong>Windows ISO file</strong>. This process will reinstall Windows over its existing installation to repair any broken operating system files and it also keeps your personal files, settings, and installed
 applications. To do this, you may follow the steps provided on this <em><strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085" title="How to perform a Repair Upgrade Using the Windows 10 ISO file">link</a></strong></em>,
 created by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong>. Once you’re on the page, you may proceed with the steps and complete the process. After completing the steps, you may check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated about your concern for additional assistance.</p>

Hi&nbsp;<span>GreginMich, thanks for showing me the root cause to my problem. I believed there is no solution yet. I can't turn off the "High Contrast" theme
 either due to my poor eyesight. Hopefully MS will release a fix soon. Thanks...</span>

 10 1709 (Build 16299.15) using my backup image and the problem remains. Any further suggestion?</span></p>

</p><p><span>1.) Open the <strong>Windows Defender Security Center</strong> app.</span></p>

</span></span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">High contrast settings</span></strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3.) Click the down-arrow in the drop-down list box and select
<strong><span>High Contrast #1</span></strong> and then click the <strong><span>Apply</span></strong>
<strong><span>button</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4.) Close and reopen the <strong>Windows Defender Security Center</strong> app, and then click on the
<strong>Home folder icon</strong>.</span></p>

 submissions on the basis of intrinsic merit, as opposed to upvotes. So issues that don’t impact a large segment of the Windows user population tend to get ignored. That’s been the fate of all of my previous bug reports, with the exception of the 0x80029c4a
 error bug, which affected an extremely large population of users.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But it does look like the issue goes away when we set the mode to
<strong>High Contrast Black</strong> – so maybe that would serve as an acceptable workaround:</span></p>

 Black mode for time being. Thanks again...</span>

<p>I had a keystroke assigned to the command <em>NewComment</em>&nbsp;in Word 2003. That keystroke did not get moved over to 2010. To the best I can do, I have determined the replacement command is<em>ReviewNewComment</em>. However, I cannot assign a keystroke to
 that command, because it does not appear on the list of available commands. It is not under the Reviewing Pane commands and it is not under "All Commands". I determined which command it was by assigning it as a custom quick access toolbar command (yes, it
 is present for those and then exporting my customizations. Am I missing anything? Must I create a macro to call the command and then assign the keystroke to that macro?</p>
<p>By the way, does there exist any documentation for each of the entries under All Commands (keyboard/ribbon/quickaccess variations acknowledged)? A nice little command dictionary would be helpful.</p>

    <title>Birthdays Disappearing From Outlook.com Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Birthdays Disappearing From Outlook.com Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I have been having the same trouble with the Outlook.com birthday calendar that many users have reported.&nbsp; I just wanted to add my findings to the discussion.&nbsp; Here are some details that might be helpful</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. All the contacts listed in "People" for which I know their birthday have their birthday listed as Other Information.&nbsp; I only use month and day, not the year as I don't ask for this. (some people are sensitive about their age)</p>
<p>2. In the past this has worked fine.</p>
<p>3. Recently, about 2 months ago, I noted that birthdays had disappeared from the calendar.&nbsp; I added back the missing birthdays and verified these against an address book I have for a card site I subscribe too.&nbsp; Both the People listing and my card Address
 book were identical for people with birthdays</p>
<p>4. I again discovered a problem beginning with January 2015.&nbsp; All of the previous entries for that month were now gone!</p>
<p>5. I checked through all months of the calendar and 37 of 47 birthday entries were now missing.</p>
<p>6. I decided to re-enter every birthday manually, using by Clicking on "New" in the calendar display and selection "Birthday" from the drop down dialogue box.</p>
<p>7. I manually re-entered all 47 birthdays that way.</p>
<p>8. I verified each month after this was done and every birthday I entered was displayed.</p>
<p>9. About an hour later I checked again and all the birthdays were there.</p>
<p>10. Five hours later only 10 of the birthdays displayed.</p>
<p>11.I went back to the People option and decided to see what would happen if I elected to clean up contacts.</p>
<p>12. For each of the people that I had manually entered a birthday, a second contact appeared in my People list, with only the name and the birthday.</p>
<p>13. I elected not to clean up the contact list at this time</p>
<p>14. I refreshed the birthday calendar three times.&nbsp; On the second attempt to refresh, I removed the calendar item.&nbsp; I was originally using the little birthday cake.</p>
<p>15. The refresh had absolutely no effect on the calendar display.</p>
<p>16. I am going to look back tomorrow and if the birthdays are still not displayed I will delete the birthday calendar and in three days I will recreate it to see if any of the birthdays sync from my people's list.&nbsp; Before I do that I will delete the duplicate
 contact created by the manual addition of the birthdays that I did today.</p>
<p>17. I only offer this information in an attempt to solve this bug.&nbsp; Its obvious from the posts that many people are pretty ticked off by the lack of action in resolving this issue.</p>
<p>18. Its rather sad that you can't rely on the outloook.com calendar any more.&nbsp; If there has been a solution, I&nbsp; would appreciate knowing it.</p>
<p>19. FYI I do not use any social networking sites, so I have no other birthday data stored anywhere else.</p>

            <p>Im Just adding additional information to the above report.&nbsp; This morning I examined my calendar.&nbsp; There are the same 11 birthdays (out of 47) in the People list.&nbsp; I checked each of those records in "People" and there is nothing significantly different about
 them.&nbsp; Each have the e-mail address, the name of the person, a note, and the birthday.&nbsp; Though all months have birthdays if they were displayed. One or more birthdays only appear in Feb, April, June, Aug, Sept, Nov and Dec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I scrolled through the months rapidly backward to January 2012 and then rapidly forward to 2015 by clicking on the arrows next to the month.&nbsp; Suddeny, all the birthdays that were displayed now disappeared.&nbsp; I refreshed the birthday calendar and the same
 11 re-appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeated this test by scrolling foward rapidly from 2015 to 2018.&nbsp; The same thing happened.&nbsp; This time I did not refresh the calendar, but logged out of my e-mail and then signed in again.&nbsp; Again the same 11 birthdays were there.&nbsp; I was able to reproduce
 this action 2 more times.&nbsp; Hope this is helpful</p>

I am happy to respond to your questions.<br />
<br />
<br />
 designation "@sympatico.ca". Some time ago, my understanding was that "Hotmail" was taken over by microsoft.&nbsp; At that point the sign in page changed a little and it became the sign in page for outlook.com.&nbsp; The "@sympatico.ca" never changed.&nbsp; Its the same
 sign in page that can be found at <a href="https://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.outlook.com</a>.&nbsp; I never store passwords on my computer, so each time I log into one of my e-mail accounts,&nbsp; I enter both the e-mail address and password.&nbsp; I have the
 sign in page set as a bookmark in my browser's Bookmarks Toolbar,&nbsp; so I just click on it and it takes me right to the sign in page.&nbsp; When I finish an e-mail session I always click on my name in the Outlook Bar next to wheel cog, and I always exit, before closing
 my browser. I use 10 character passwords which are different for each e-mail account.<br />
<br />
<br />
 of the threads, I closed my firefox browser and opened internet explorer.&nbsp; I went to the outlook.com sign in page as noted above in my first response.&nbsp; I clicked on the small boxes to the Left of the words Outlook.com and opened my calendar.&nbsp; The calendar
 opened through that browser and had the same 11 birthdays that were present when I opened the calendar through my firefox browser.&nbsp; I repeated the test by advancing the calendar months quickly forward from 2015 to Jan 2018, and then rapidly backward again
 to January 2015.&nbsp; After that procedure, I reviewed the calendar months slowly one by one for 2015 and the 11 previously displayed birthdays were missing.&nbsp; I waited a few minutes and repeated the review of all the months for 2015.&nbsp; Still no birthdays.&nbsp; I closed
 out the browser completely.&nbsp; I then opened Internet Explorer again and selected calendar and all 11 birthdays were displayed again.&nbsp; I do not own a mobile phone, so I do not use any mail apps and I do not belong to any social networks.</span><br />
</span></span></span></span><br />
 case, please check if all your calendars are ticked just like in the snippet below:</span><br />
<br />
<span>Yes, it is the same calendar as indicated in your link.&nbsp; In fact I opened the calendar using your link and repeated the test with fast foward and reverse of the months and all the 11 birthdays disappeared again.&nbsp; I closed the tab for the link.&nbsp;
 Went back and accessed your link again and low and behold, all 11 birthdays were there again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I have 3 calendars: "Bruce's Calendar", "Birthday Calendar" and "Canada Holidays" Calendar.&nbsp; All three have the check marks as indicated in your snippet.&nbsp;
 I un-checked the birthday calendar and then checked all the months for 2015.&nbsp; All showed
<strong>no</strong> birthdays.&nbsp; I then did the forward and reverse month review from 2015-Jan 2018.&nbsp; I reviewed 2015 and there were
<strong>no</strong> birthdays.&nbsp; I then re-set the checkmark for the birthday calendar and
<strong>all 11</strong> birthdays were displayed.<br />
<br />
I hope these responses are satisfactory for your needs.&nbsp; If you require any other information, please do not hesitate to contact me.&nbsp; ~~ Bruce Z.</span>

            <p>I have been having this same problem since forever, no matter what I do the calendar randomly deletes birthdays, which are about the only events I have in the calendar.</p>
<p>I tried sorting the problem on this forum and eventually the support people stopped answering my messages, so I figure even they have no idea how to fix this or what is going on.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, this put me off completely from what once was my beloved WindowsPhone, no using **** Android which at least works at the very basic level, like remembering darn birthdays.</p>

</p><p>Although Microsoft has asked permission to access my account, after careful consideration, I have
<strong>declined </strong>that request.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have spent some hours reviewing many posts regarding the disappearing birthdays and the outlook.com birthday calendar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>From my review, it would seem that the some of the initial reports came through as early as May 2014.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Eight months have passed by and still there is no solution from Microsoft.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are a lot of notes saying it’s with the software engineers etc etc, but still no resolution. I also see repeated comments from a few users expressing their dissatisfaction with the lack of response or action from Microsoft to correct the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I doubt access to my account would result in any solution.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am sure other users have allowed Microsoft access to their accounts and in the end I have seen no solution from Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, I belong to an inexpensive commercial card site which has a great address book for birthday information.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The site sends me an e-mail notification of an upcoming birthday event about a week before the actual day.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The reason I used the outlook calendar as well, was to facilitate sending cards out.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would sit down and do all the birthday cards for the month at one go and simply set the send dates for the cards as the actual birthday of the person.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now I will do this when I am notified of the birthday.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize this is not a solution for many users out there, especially if you are using social networks or a cell phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have neither, so the loss of the birthday calendar is only a minor inconvenience to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree with several other posters that the issue relates to the syncing of the birthday information in the People Hub (contacts list) and the calendar itself.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also, the 24-48 hour time frame for syncing seems snail slow given today’s technologies. There is neither rhyme nor reason for why some are there and some have faded away.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have several people in “groups” in my People Hub.<span>&nbsp; </span>I checked to see if this was an interference, but all the people whose birthdays still show are in one or more of my groups so that’s not it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The same is true for the missing birthdays.<span>&nbsp; </span>So far the calendar has remained static.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The same 11 birthdays that showed up after the loss of 36 birthdays noted in January 2015, have remained on the calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As time permits, I will do a little experimenting on my own.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I discover a way to restore the birthdays so that they no longer disappear I will post that in the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>I unfortunately started this new thread because I was unfamiliar with how to use the forums.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I will keep an eye on the relevant threads to see what transpires but I am not holding out any great hope that this issue is of enough significance to Microsoft to get resolved any time soon.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have posted this information on two of the other threads about this issue so other users can see my comments.</span>

            Just wanted to report any interesting event with the birthdays and the calendar.&nbsp; From my previous posts you will know that consistently since I first noticed the problem in early January, my calendar has shown the same 11 of 47 birthdays it should show.&nbsp;
 I had not touched anything in the calendar since reporting on this site in anticipation that I would give microsoft access to my account.&nbsp; However, after making the decision to deny access, I went back to the calendar to clean up one of my small groups of
 10 members.&nbsp; Six members were to be deleted from the group.&nbsp; I called up the group in the People Hub, I did not put a check mark next the group name, but simply clicked on the picture icon next to the group.&nbsp; I then clicked on edit in the coloured bar that
 runs across the top of the screen.&nbsp; This allows the group members to be displayed individually on the right of the screen.&nbsp; I then went through the group clicking on the "X" for the members I wanted to delete.&nbsp; When I finished I wanted only 4 names in this
 group.&nbsp; I was a bit hasty in doing the delete option so I kept deleting&nbsp; one of the names that should have been one of the final 4 members.&nbsp; When I finished and only had 3 in the group, I had to hit the cancel button at the bottom of the page instead of the
 'Save' button. I actually did the same error twice more and had to hit the cancel button twice more.&nbsp; Finally, I got it right (I think I was a bit tired it was 2am my time).&nbsp; Once I hit save, the calendar went a little nutty and began deleting 10, then 20
 then 30 contacts.&nbsp; I hit the stop button not knowing what was happening since only 6 had to be deleted.&nbsp; The calendar went into some kind of crazy loop "Saying we are going as fast as we can".&nbsp; It hung up at 30 contacts deleted.&nbsp; I had to close down my browser
 and come back into my account a second time.&nbsp; I thought half of my contacts from my People Hub were going to be gone.&nbsp; But no, they were all there.&nbsp; But the group only contained 3 of the 4 that should have been there after I deleted the correct six.&nbsp; Guess
 which one was missing?&nbsp; It was the one I had kept marking for deletion that should not have been deleted and as a result cancelling the operation before it could happen.&nbsp; I put that person back into the group and then decided just to take a look at the calendar.&nbsp;
 Another revelation:&nbsp; the six contacts whom I had deleted from the group all had birthdays in their People Hub records and magically, they all RE-APPEARED on the calendar.&nbsp; That made me think of a hit song after WW2 "Its Been a Long Time"--- The first line
 of which goes: Kiss me once and kiss me twice and kiss me once again...its been a long, long, time"&nbsp; I think I will make it the theme song for the outloook calendar, only we will change the word kiss to "touch", because every time you touch the calendar something
 marvelous happens to the birthdays.&nbsp; Stay tuned, I'll be doing a few more things with my calendar and I will report in.&nbsp;
<strong>Don't delete your groups just yet.. I think thats a red herring right now.</strong><br />

            <p>This will be a long post, but again some marvelous things are happening with the birthday calendar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the morning hours of Jan 9th, I began looking at the calendar again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At this point, I know that I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">had duplicate contacts</span> that were created when I had gone back in December and entered several birthdays manually by going to the calendar hub and selecting the down arrow in
 the “new” tab.<span>&nbsp; </span>That allowed me to click on ‘birthday’ and then enter the person’s name and birthday information manually into the calendar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, if a record already exists in the People Hub for the person I was manually creating the birthday for, this manual input method created a second record in the People Hub with just the name and the birthday but without any e-mail address
 information.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had several of these to clean up.<span>&nbsp; </span>I went to the People Hub and clicked on the down arrow for the “Manage” Tab.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This allowed me to select the “Clean up Contacts” option.<span>&nbsp; </span>All the duplicates are displayed and each record has a check mark in a box at the upper left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You have to be careful here, because the instruction is “<strong>Clear the Checkbox for any</strong>
<strong>you <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">don’t</span></em> want to combine</strong>”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have 4 contacts who do not have e-mail addresses, so I have given each one of them THE SAME e-mail address.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is actually one of my own out-look addresses that I reserve for special use.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That way, I could put them in my card site address book and I would get a notification when their birthday came around and I would send them a regular ‘mailed’ card.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To make things simple, I also used this e-mail address in their People Hub records.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When these records come up in the “Clean Up Contacts” I leave their checkboxes alone, so they are never combined.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Besides these 4 that I did not want to touch there <strong>were 10 contact names whose records I did want to combine.<span>&nbsp;
</span></strong>Nine of these individuals had only 2 records each, their original hub record and their new record from manual creation of the birthday in the calendar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One individual had 3 records.<span>&nbsp; </span>After I did the clean up process, I went back to the calendar and to my great surprise, all of the cleaned up records were now listed in the birthday calendar. I was stunned!<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was one other peculiar observation.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you first access the People Hub, you get information about social networks and skype.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I use none of these, but the Hub would list 4 of my contacts found on skype.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The person with the three records would always appear here, but after the cleanup, she no longer appeared as a person found on skype.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Earlier that evening I had gone to one of my other out-look accounts that I never use for outgoing mail so it has no contacts in it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I decided to add all the contacts with birthdays because I was going to create a calendar in that account and see what happened.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In that account this person is listed as being found on skype.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I assume that when the records were combined, the skype information was somehow lost for my usual outlook account, the one where I have been having all the trouble with the birthday calendar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It still is not listed as a skype participant even today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this exercise I learned that out-look considers creating a birthday record manually as a new record.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It apparently makes no comparison to an existing record even if the name and the birthday are identical. All the individuals for whom I created manual birthdays on the calendar already had birthday information in their people hub record.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Apparently outlook considers records as possible duplicates only if they have the SAME E-Mail address.&nbsp; Stay tuned more results to come.</p>

            <p>Now for the last piece of this puzzle.<span>&nbsp; </span>After dealing with the record clean up described in the last post, I decided that I probably could not rely on the outlook birthday calendar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then used the data of my card site address book (which I had previously verified as being equivalent to my People Hub records) to create an excel spreadsheet where I could prepare a simple sortable birthday list.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I could then sort this list by birth month so I would always know how many people I had to send cards to in any particular month. (The main reason why I used the birthday calendar). There were 52 names on this list.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had added 3 new individuals to my card site address book, but had not updated their People Hub records with this information because of the on-going investigation into the calendar non-performance.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once I sorted this list by birth month, I went back to the People Hub <span>
&nbsp;</span>to add the birthday information into the 3 hub records that needed to be updated.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My next step was to review the calendar and compare it to my excel report.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here are the results:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 records that had just been updated with birthday information were not in the calendar.</p>
<p>7 records which already had birthday information were not on the calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then decided to examine each of the hub records separately for these 10 discrepant birthdays to see if I could find any type of a pattern.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The three that were newly added looked fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>I reasoned that maybe the calendar had not synced them yet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However the other 7 provided some startling information.<span>&nbsp; </span>There were three married couples in these seven records.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Each couple shared the same e-mail address.<span>&nbsp; </span>The birthday records for two of the couples were missing from the calendar. However, for the third couple only the wife’s birthday was missing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the case of the first two couples, I looked at the husband’s record in the Hub.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only one record was listed for each husband in the Hub list. <span>&nbsp;</span>Clicking on the image frame for the record in the hub causes the record and its details to be displayed to the right of the listing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The image frame is enlarged and right underneath the image is a blue outlook symbol and the word “Outlook”<span>&nbsp;
</span>For some records you might also see the notation “found on skype”.<span>&nbsp; </span>
There might be others for other social networks but I don’t use these so they don’t appear in displays.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the case of the first two married couples, each husband’s record had not one but 4 notations for outlook.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>There were obviously 4 outlook records for this person yet in the Hub Listing only one was visible.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For some strange reason, and not by my doing, the husband and wife’s records got merged together because when the record displayed the birthday information was shown for each partner.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I unfortunately did not think of creating a screen shot when I noted this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Instead I clicked on “Delete” to get rid of the records.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I entered the wife’s first name in the Hub Search Box, a single record came up showing the Husband’s and the Wife’s first names together opposite the image frame.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once I deleted the record for the husband, the wife’s name could no longer be found.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The last married couple was a bit of a puzzle.<span>&nbsp; </span>There were 4 outlook records under the wife’s name.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The record contained the birthday information for both partners.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Her birthday did not show on the calendar. The husband’s birthday did show.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After I deleted the wife’s record, the husband’s record disappeared as well, but his birthday continued to show in the calendar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Two of the other records appeared to be corrupt. I do recall that initially I made an error in adding the birthday in both of these records, but I did go back and edit my error when I did the comparison with my card address book. (this was done some
 time ago even before I had trouble with the calendar). I ended up deleting these records as well.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Next I went back and added new records for all 8 individuals.<span>&nbsp; </span>
6 of them share a common e-mail and the two others were from previously edited birthday records.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Why these records got combined I will never know.<span>&nbsp; </span>I certainly did not combine them when I was cleaning up my contacts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can only assume that something happened at Microsoft to cause this to occur.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After all of this manipulation I again went back to the Clean up Contacts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The 4 records that I deliberately do not want to combine (the unrelated people without their own e-mail address) and the records for the 3 married couples who share an address are shown.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I combined none of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I went back to the calendar and began to compare each month to my excel listing and now miraculously
<strong>ALL 52 birthdays are displaying in the Calendar.<span>&nbsp; </span></strong></p>

            <p><strong>CONCLUDING POST</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big Question is:<span>&nbsp; </span>Did the Microsoft engineers do something to solve this problem almost simultaneously while I was doing my own sleuthing, or did I end up correcting things in my outlook account outlook which were interfering with the calendar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note, <strong>I do not subscribe</strong> to any social networks and my calendar in outlook is not synced with any other device such as a cell phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I use a stand-alone lap top.<span>&nbsp; </span>But here is a summary of what has happened over several days:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>When I first noted I was missing birthdays, I entered all the missing ones directly on the calendar, despite the fact that their hub records already contained birthday information.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After this manual entry, I verified that my Hub records matched my card site address book.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All looked fine. <span>&nbsp;</span>This was done in December 2014. A review of the calendar showed that all birthdays were now being displayed.</li><li>In January 2015, all birthdays for that month (5 of them) had disappeared.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That’s when I contacted my internet service that offers support for e-mail problems etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They could not help and told me that the forums were reporting similar problems.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then reported my problem on the forum starting a new thread.<span>&nbsp; </span>
At that point only 11 of 47 Birthdays appeared on the calendar.</li><li>After several discussions with Microsoft, I elected not to give them permission to access my account as I did not believe this would help.</li><li>The next step I took was to remove 6 contacts from a group which contained 10 contacts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had created this group at the end of November for a special e-mailing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Six of the members no longer wanted to part of the e-mail program so I wanted to remove them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly, these six names appeared on my birthday calendar. Becoming more concerned about the reliability of the calendar<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also started a project of entering contact and birthday information into another outlook account that I do not use for sending out mail.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This account had no calendars and I thought I would try creating a new one from scratch.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That was not going to happen until mid January.</li><li>I went back to the original account which had the birthday calendar and I executed a “Clean up Contacts” because I knew duplicate records had been created in the People Hub when I manually entered the birthday information using
 the New Birthday Option in the Calendar Hub.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eleven more birthdays appeared.</li><li>When the calendar was examined a few hours later, more birthdays had appeared, but I knew some of them were still missing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At this point I had created a separate birthday list in excel using my card site address book.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I updated 3 Hub records with recent birthday information that I had just acquired in January 2015.</li><li>I decided to compare my excel report with the calendar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At this point only 10 birthdays were missing.</li><li>On examining each of these records in the hub, I noted that 6 involved married couples who shared the same e-mail address, 3 were from the new birthdays I had just input into outlook and 2 were from persons whom I had at some
 time in the past entered the wrong birthday information and subsequently corrected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>With the exception of the 3 new ones, the other 7 all had a number of duplicate outlook notations that were not visible in the Hub listing for contacts.<span>&nbsp;
</span></li><li>I deleted each of these “bad” records and added the individuals back a second time with all the correct information.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A final comparison of the excel report and the calendar showed that the two were equivalent and all 52 birthdays showed on the calendar.</li></ol>
<span>I don’t know why the records of the 7 people got strangely combined.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I never did this.<span>&nbsp; </span>I also wonder if once a record is supposedly deleted, it is not actually physically deleted, but is just “flagged as deleted” but still lurks in the background.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Could this ‘unseen’ record influence the calendar performance if a new record containing some info from the deleted one is updated or touched in any way again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I guess I will leave that to the software engineers.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s why I think the theme song for the calendar should be:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Touch me once and touch me twice and touch me once again.. its been a long long time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Look at your calendars again and see if they are working as expected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you want to try manipulating your records the way I did, I strongly suggest that you download the information from your People Hub into an excel sheet so that you will have a hard copy of the records before you go messing about.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Good Luck.<span>&nbsp; </span>I will keep you posted if my birthday records start to magically disappear again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So far the calendar has remained stable for about 10 hours.</span>

    <title>No error e-mail notifications from Azure Active Directory Connect. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No error e-mail notifications from Azure Active Directory Connect.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Dear Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>I have just installed the latest version of AD Connect (version 1.1.180.0 as an upgrade from AAD Sync on a new server)</span></p>
<p><span>During setup there where some sync errors. This was OK and all problems was solved (we enabled Exchange hybrid and there was some access right problems in the local AD)</span></p>
<p><span>In the past there was send mail notifications to the technical contact address specified in the Account details in the Office 365 portal. This time there was none (this also used
 to work for this client)</span></p>
<p><span>I can see that there has been introduced a new service for AD Connect “Azure AD Connect Health for Sync” (</span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-aadconnect-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-aadconnect-health/</span></a><span>)
 I can see that it is possible to manage e-mail notifications and other things using this. This service requires AD Premium and there is no mention anywhere that AD Connect still supports the “old” default style of notifications.
</span></p>
<p><span>Can you confirm that this is the case and we must have AD Premium in order to get e-mail notifications for AD Connect?</span></p>
<p><span>Regards.</span></p>
<p><span>Thomas Nielsen</span></p>
<p><span>Adactit.</span></p>

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>As far as I know, the “old default style of notifications” is still supported by the Azure AD Connect tool. If you don’t need the Azure AD Connect Health service, you don’t need to buy Azure AD Premium licenses.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>hi peter,<br />
<br />
to further investigate this issue, i’d like to collect the following information for further research:<br />
1. the screenshots of the scenario on your computer.<br />
to upload screenshots in this forum, please click use rich formatting and insert/edit media. browse the picture to upload and then click insert.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=390ff63f-83fb-424e-98b4-2585c96ee680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d390ff63f-83fb-424e-98b4-2585c96ee680" /></a><br />
2. does anyone else in your organization encounter the same issue?<br />
3. as you are using browsers to access your office 365 mailbox, that means you are using office 365 owa (outlook web app). could you let us know the owa version.
<br />
you can check it with the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) right click the owa page, and select view page source/view source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) find the item like this:</p>

<h2>            My PC crashed after installing Build 14361</h2>
                    When I did the update and installed the latest build 14361, my pc's performance slowed drastically. Then, I noticed lots of webpages I tried to open, wouldn't. Then some of the apps would not work, either. Eventually, my pc crashed and I went back to my
 previous build and now it works much better. I liked the idea of having that newer build, but I cant with all the crashes it offers....please correct this build, so I can enjoy it as well.

<p>Hi Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that Microsoft will only charge the paid subscription service and the customer whom receive the bills state with an actual request amount.<br />
If your subscription service renewed automatically and the billing notification showed 0, please do not worry about money. Microsoft will not charge you unless any further billing notification send to update you.

            <p>Are you referring to Details view in Windows Explorer ("Computer") or Word's Open or Save dialog? If so, then it can be edited. Right-click on any of the column headings and you will get a dropdown list showing&nbsp;checked and unchecked items (the checked ones
 are the ones already displayed).&nbsp;Click More... to get an extensive checklist. Unfortunately, I don't see a "Modified by" or "Saved by" entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can, however, get one-click access to the Properties using Customize Quick Access Toolbar. In the "Commands Not in the Ribbon" category, select and add "Advanced Document Properties."</p>

            I believe I am having a related issue. My issue is when I share a file I have made multiple saves to, it only shows people the file of the first save even though I am sharing the most recent update. I've replicated the issue. It started happening 4 weeks
 ago. I am an experienced user. I think the last update messed with the save capabilities in Microsoft.

<p>On my Omnia (WM6.1), the quality of video playback on something like youtube is appalling.&nbsp; When I use CorePlayer the quality is 100 times better! Even though I've changed the file associations for 3GP, mpeg4, etc. the system still runs the default Streaming

<p>How do I change this to make Coreplayer the default?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sreaming link in internet explorer is not pointing to a file but to a streaming link which is still associated with Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see if there are more settings available in the core media player to change this. Otherwise you need to do some registry editing. Which I don't know where this registry would be</p>

<h2>            Arabic Language pack after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I got a message to upgrade to windows 10 for free. After finishing the upgrade successfully, I found out that I can not open my word documents in Arabic. I tried to set up the language through the options on Word but it required that I buy the Arabic
 language pack for word 2013 which I did. Still I can not find the Arabic language pack I bought and I can type in any other language than English on Word. Please any suggestions on how to get the downloaded paid for pack and how to fix the Language issue on
 Word as I usually use the English, French, Arabic in my editing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried contacting the Microsoft support by clicking it Icon but it does not respond so contacting MS customer service seems hopeless.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Defender not running on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to run Windows Defender on my Windows 10 Home machine, but it won't start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to start defender (by going to settings-&gt;update &amp; security-&gt;Windows Defender) the settings screens closes. If I search for defender I also get a "desktop app" as a result, but it won't run either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get Defender to work, or is there a way to reinstall Defender on Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Hindi font file displays square brackets in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a file which is written in Hindi font (AAAlka) - a type 1 font file. &nbsp;When I open this file in word 2013 it only shows up with square brackets. &nbsp;The same file opens fine inWord 2007.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recognize that the type 1 font is not supported in Word 2013. &nbsp;I am looking for ways to either get the type 1 font to work in Word 2013, or a conversion tool so I can covert hundreds of files I have in the type 1 font file to a supported format. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I achieve this?&nbsp;</p>

            The simple solution is to use a suitable Hindi font that <em>is </em>supported. For example, if there's a truetype or opentype version of the AAAlka font, you could install that. Alternatively, you might try Times New Roman or Arial or any other font that
 supports an extended character set.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is how to open the file. The existing font font AAAlka of the file&nbsp;is not convertible in any other font&nbsp;available with&nbsp;2013 program. Hope you will revise your answer. The problem is not as simple as presumed.</p>

<p>Your first post in this thread indicates quite clearly that you <em>can </em>open the file, so that is not the issue. The issue you said you were having trouble with the is font, for which I have provided appropriate advice.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;ve sent a support request to the Microsoft Escalation Team and now I&#39;ve received a Support request number. What do I do with the number&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys. I've been trying to access my other Microsoft account for the past 2-3 days now. I've updated the security info (a.k.a. the phone number), so that I can get a 7-digit code if I haven't already accessed the account by 11th June. 11th June is the
 day the 30-day waiting period ends... so 4 more weeks to go. I've also tried filling in the account recovery form several times, and I've also spoken to two live agents. The live agents that I've spoken to were Jenieloo Q and Joseph V.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to Jenieloo Q yesterday, and she tried to help me recover my account via the account recovery form. However, recovering my account with the account recovery form was completely unsuccessful. I spoke to Joseph V about an hour ago. At the end of the
 chat, he suggested that I fill in a Support Request that will be handled by the Microsoft Escalation Team. After filling in the form, it said that the request has been submitted, and I was given a Support Request Number along with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do with the Support Request Number?</p>

<h2>            Shares keep disappearing</h2>
                    
<p>I'm sharing some folders with some colleagues and they keep disappearing.</p>
<p>I add them to various folders, we can then all see shared folders in <strong>Shared with me</strong>, OneDrive For Business iPhone app etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within a few hours all those shares have disappeared. This has been happening since I started testing sharing a few weeks ago, I've tried the below 6 times or so, sometimes with days in between with the same result each time.</p>
<p>I go into each shared folder,&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; ... &nbsp;&gt; &nbsp;Share &nbsp;&gt; &nbsp;Shared with</strong> and all the users that are supposed to be there are showing up. Click
<strong>Advanced</strong>, all users listed as expected. <strong>Check Permissions</strong>&nbsp;for each user, all as expected.</p>
<p>Delete all users permissions, add them again and everything works fine for a few hours again, then shares all disappear again.</p>
<p>If I login as one of the other users and navigate to&nbsp;<a href="https://name-my.sharepoint.com/personal/the_user_who_shared/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://name-my.sharepoint.com/personal/the_user_who_shared/</a>&nbsp;I can also see all the shares.</p>
<p>Bug or am I doing something wrong here?</p>

<p>Hi Iris,</p>
<p>I PM'd you the requested details and I've not had any feedback from your escalation team, any chance of an update?</p>
<p>The shares disappeared again the next day, shared again and gone again this morning.</p>
<p>I'm beginning to lose patience with OneDrive For Business, months of re-development time and other drive services
<strong>still</strong> beat the business product on features. Even your own OneDrive Personal is better than this trash, there are so many bugs with this product it's not even funny. Rubbish sync speeds, delays in syncing, files that just won't sync with no
 feedback as to why, ridiculous restrictions on file names that no other service seems to suffer from.</p>
<p>I appreciate your help on this, I know it's not your fault and I'm more than happy to help and donate my time to improve ODFB, but MS should be embarrassed at how bad this product is.</p>

<p>Hi JJB72,</p>
<p>Before moving on, could you reproduce the issue and capture the clean trace logs for analysis? (catch the logs when&nbsp;affected user access his OneDrive for Business library and&nbsp;open&nbsp;"Shared with me" section. If convenience, please&nbsp;also catch the logs when
 "shared with me" work well&nbsp;as a comparison)</p>
<p>To protect the privacy, I have sent you a private message with the steps to capture logs. You can reply to it via the steps below:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Go to the Your details section on the right side of the community site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Click Private messages.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Click the subject title of the response to read the message.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Frank</p>
