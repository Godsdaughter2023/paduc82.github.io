<h2>            Outlook account setup in Lumia 520 Phone</h2>
                    I've an email account in Gmail and I've set up it in my Lumia 520. Now I want to link it to the Outlook in the phone. How do I do so? Also, Can I keep both Microsoft and Gmail accounts in Outlook in my phone?

And, even when I check for new mail, I still get the same message, repeatedly.
 I minimize the message I want to send, click the send/receive button, and then send the email. But, it almost always come back with this same error message.

    <title>text disappears between pages in Microsoft Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> - lori -  say:</h3>
<h2>            text disappears between pages in Microsoft Word 2007</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I am experiencing an odd issue: At the bottom of one page and carrying over to the top of the next one, several lines of text "disappear." I can get the text to reappear by inserting a&nbsp;page break&nbsp;above it, but I'd really prefer not to leave nearly
 half a page empty for no apparent reason. The text is not hidden, the orphan controls and "keep with next" are deactivated, there are&nbsp;no margin buffers&nbsp;or footers&nbsp;that would&nbsp;obscure the text,&nbsp;and I just cannot seem to find a reason why this is happening. This
 issue has also been encountered by at least three other co-workers, and despite some intense Googling, we&nbsp;are unable to resolve the problem. (The only semi-related topics I've found deal with line spacing and tables, but&nbsp;neither&nbsp;seems to affect this issue.)
 Strangely, this does not happen in every document; there is&nbsp;no consistent pattern of when the error occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for&nbsp;any help you can provide...</p>

            Thanks for your reply, but this error actually occurs when we're just typing along, though it has occasionally happened when pasting text from one Microsoft Word file to another (and in those cases, both the source and destination files are set up to utilize
 identical formatting through .dot templates). We've even tried cutting and pasting back and forth between Notepad files, which would obviously strip out all formatting, and the same error occurs. Weird stuff!

            I think I have been seeing the same sort of thing in Word 2010 when I'm working in "Web Layout" view. Most of the time it affects just one or two lines, but yesterday I noticed it affected about a dozen lines. It was very disconcerting to see, or not see
 &lt;grin&gt;, that many lines of text.<br />
<br />
I don't think it is a matter of formatting in Word, for me it seems to be a video display issue.<br />
<br />
I have found 2 workarounds. One is to switch to page layout view and back (I use keyboard shortcuts). The redraw seems to take care of it.&nbsp; The other I just found yesterday so I haven't tested it very much is to take the window out of full screen view.&nbsp; Instead
 of letting Windows maximize the Word application window, I drag the window to ALMOST full screen.&nbsp; That
<b><i>seems</i></b> to have fixed the problem, but I've only been using it for a day so I'm not positive it is a thorough "fix".<br />

            <p>Thanks for responding. We tried both workarounds today, but neither seemed to have any effect on the problem--the text stayed "disappeared" no matter what view we tried. (And for what it's worth, we virtually always work in Print Layout.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other detail that was brought to my attention today is the fact that sometimes, even putting in a page break doesn't help; in one instance, it simply moved the "invisible" text to the next page and made a few lines above the break insertion point disappear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're stumped! &lt;=\</p>

<h2>            Alarm Volume too low  and Disappearing Breakthrough List Lumia 735 &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I can't believe that I am writing this. &nbsp;I just bought this week a Lumia 735 phone. &nbsp;I have a couple of issues with the phone, but like the Windows 10 features. &nbsp;I would hate to have to go back to my HTC One M8 with 8.1 OS, but I may have to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the Quiet Time breakthrough list doesn't work and now you can't hear the alarm. &nbsp;I could hear the alarm from my HTC in another room. &nbsp;With the Lumia 735 sitting right next to me, I can't hear it. I searched online and apparently, this is not uncommon.
 &nbsp;I tried setting different ring tones and that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a viable solution other than reset the phone? &nbsp;I have a feeling that's not going to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I was FINALLY able to solve the problem with the disappearing Breakthrough List (BL)--at least I think. It's been working for two days now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I neglected to mention in my original post that I have Verizon. &nbsp;Verizon has Backup Assistant Plus. &nbsp;I am not sure if other phone companies have this. Backup Assistant Plus was the key to my solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I add a contact on my phone, I am given the option of adding the contact to Outlook or Backup Assistant Plus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I printed out a copy of the contact listings/profiles of the people that I wanted on my Breakthrough List (8). Just in case. &nbsp;I didn't want to lose any information.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Solution #1</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I tried deleting the contact from Outlook (not Outlook.com) on my PC . &nbsp;Then I added the contact (all information in the profile) back on my phone, selecting Backup Assistant Plus. &nbsp;Then I added the contact to the BL. &nbsp;This worked. &nbsp;The contact did
 not disappear from the BL. &nbsp;However, when I looked at my list of contacts on my PC, the contact was not there. &nbsp;So, I added the contact back to Outlook on my PC. &nbsp;The contact remained on the BL and is now in both places (phone and PC). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Solution #2</span></strong></p>
<p>Add the contact again using your phone (leaving the original contact in place), selecting Backup Assistant Plus. &nbsp;For this option, the only thing I added were name and the phone numbers. &nbsp;I didn't add the other information in the profile.
 Give it a few minutes to sync and then add the contact to your BL. &nbsp;The contact remained on the BL. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me. &nbsp;I hope it works for you.</p>

    <title>PowerPoint 2016 Presenter View - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bosik mosesjang  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2016 Presenter View</h2>
                    <p>I am using PowerPoint 2016, one dual monitor (one is the extended) in&nbsp;windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press F5 to begin a slide show, I can see the presenter view screen on one monitor and the slide on the other monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also able to see thumnails of slides at the bottom part of the presenter view screen when I checked "Use Presenter View" in PowerPoint 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in PowerPoint 2016, the thumnails of slides miss, just I can see "next slide". Of course I can access all thumnails of slides if I click the "see all slides" button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you know, it closes itself once I click a thumnail, which means I have to re-open the "see all slides" window every time I need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to jump here and there among the slides very often. I can not follow the flow if I use "see all slide".</p>
<p>I need the old thumnails of slides back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any method to use it? If not, how can I ask Microsoft to add this feature back?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>N-gage software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gimzo  say:</h3>
<h2>            N-gage software</h2>
                    I managed to dig up my old n82, all factory reset as I usually do before I store old phones etc. But I figured ahh what the heck, I fancy a blast on Pathway to Glory, but I cannot access the nokia store on the phone, fine, but I cannot actually get anything
 onto the phone anyway at all with the PC, bluetooth, anything!! So I am trying to find someone with the software or the know how to help me out. I realise that the actual support here went in 2016 if there was any support back then anyway. But I don't believe
 that the actual software has just vanished from all of existence... It does have the N-gage demo app, but that's not exactly helping either as it's not the correct app. Any help here would be appreciated, or failing that - Nokia/Microsoft (whoever is in charge
 now) Get savvy and port PWTG on android or something so you can make some money and we can be happy... lol

<p>This did not work. A friend received 210 of the same e-mail yesterday and the same has happened this morning. I get an error message saying that the message could not be sent as I'm not connected to the internet (but I am) and the message will be sent once
 I regain connectivity. In the meantime hundreds are sent and continue being sent. I have recently returned to using this laptop after a month of not using it and wonder if that has got something to do with it?</p>
<p>Hope you can help as my contacts are getting proper fed up with me!</p>

<p>Ok, you hit on many subjects.&nbsp; Looks like you have 1 PC and 2 hard drives, a locked up drive and a working drive.&nbsp; I reply on this assumption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think that the locked up drive is a functioning drive that was killed by insiders?&nbsp; If so, then that is a start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I often run across a dead PC with a good hard drive that is full of un-backed up data and folk with a long face.&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, they have been 2 1/2" drives, common to a lot of laptops.&nbsp; On the shelf, I kept a little harness that hooks to the hard drive and
 the USB port.&nbsp; The drive is then just another USB storage device and take off what you want.&nbsp; This harness can be drive specific but look on Ebay and sells for $10 to $20.&nbsp; When the task is done, you end up with a very large USB storage device worth about
 $1 per MB.&nbsp; I have several on the shelf from dead HPs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You speak of Pro and Home on this PC.&nbsp; What is the history on this PC?&nbsp; Did it start life out as a Home?&nbsp; If so, then you can only expect to have a fully activated W10 Home on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the early days of Insiders, you were even offered Pro and Enterprise on Home PCs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I selected&nbsp; Enterprise on a Pro and I had to deal with this issue at activation time.&nbsp; An Insiders Pro build on a Home did not translate to W10 Pro activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kick around to see how you fit in here.&nbsp; I never saw a mechanically functioning hard drive that could&nbsp;be brought back to life by just installing on O/S through BIOS.&nbsp; It is then just like a blank canvass.&nbsp; You are subject go losing the contents to gain a
 hard drive.</p>
<p>

            <p>Even if you could unlock the drive a two years old version of the insider preview will have expired and likely wouldn't even boot up. Have you tried the bcd repair to access that drive?<a href="http://www.easeus.com/storage-media-recovery/unlock-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 See this.</a><br />
Try 'Method Three" in the article.</p>
<p>You could at least rescue your files. Music, videos etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick and dirty, you could install a pro version on another partition or separate drive and see if it will activate. Not too likely, though.</p>
<p>If it activates you can then upgrade your home version to pro and not lose programs or files (I think).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the media player I'd imagine is the same in the up-to-date home or pro. So what are your exact issues with your version? Many recommend using VLC (downloaded from the webpage, not the store), I use MPC-HC for video and Foobar 2000 for music.</p>

    <title>Toolbar for IE 11, Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

 F11, tried pressing the Start button, tried pressing the Alt button, and nothing works to install the toolbar. &nbsp;I am 61 and not all that computer literate. &nbsp;Please advise. &nbsp;Thank you

            <p>Hello again Mr. Kumar of Microsoft:</p>
<p>I am still unable to find and upload the toolbar/aka command bar or whatever it is called in IE11, for Windows 10. &nbsp;Your solution is the Alt key, which does nothing. &nbsp;I see no Menu bar or View-- and absolutely no toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives? &nbsp;I need this for my online class in PowerPoint. &nbsp;I saw on the Discussion page for my online class that someone in class is having the same problem, they pressed FN +Function Key 5 + Alt, and this worked once for them, and once for me. &nbsp; However,
 this does not install the toolbar/aka command bar on my IE11 opening page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have to lose $158 for this course I am trying to take online from Pearson if you cannot find a solution for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disappointed Microsoft does not have a toolbar/aka command center that is easy to install.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office for Mac 2011 import to Office 365</h2>
                    I have used Office for Mac 2011 for several years and have a lot of data stored, in particular in Word and Powerpoint. I purchased and installed Office 365 a while ago. There was no obvious opportunity to import data from Office for Mac 2011. As Office
 for Mac is no longer supported by Microsoft I wish to safeguard my data by importing it into Office 365. Advice as to how to do this would be appreciated, please. &nbsp;

            Office 365 for Mac is backward compatible with older versions such as Office 2011 and your Word 2011 and PowerPoint 2011 files will open just fine in the new version. There is nothing to import, just open the files, view, edit them as normal.

<h2>            Imported Outlook 2007 .pst files not showing up in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    I was running Outlook 2007 on my old laptop that recently crashed.&nbsp; I bought a new one with Outlook 2016.&nbsp; I had the Geek Squad transfer all my data files from the old hard drive to my new laptop.&nbsp; I tried to import the Outlook 2007 .pst files to Outlook
 2016 but they are not showing up.&nbsp; The Geek Squad told me that Outlook 2016 is different enough from Outlook 2007 that it causes some issue with getting your Personal Folders to show up in the 2016 and that I need to call Microsoft Support.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have several
 years of critical emails that need to access.&nbsp; Can anyone help me?!&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any workaround for me to access those .pst files?

</p><p>Starting in reverse order</p>

</p><p>#2 - Will be polite and not comment on the lack of "subject matter" expertise </p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - All comes down to what exactly it is that you want to do/have at the end of the day. The generic answer is you just need to "open" the PST files to have them in your Outlook profile. Go to File --&gt; Open &amp; Export --&gt; Open Outlook Data File --&gt; browse
 to where those pst files are located. Once that's done, everything will be accessible to you just as it existed in '2007</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are however more broader questions that may well result in a better approach</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) what type (IMAP, POP etc) of email account is configured? More importantly, what type of account were you working with in OL'2007. Primary reason for the question is that if someone is not familiar with the terrain - they might have configured your account
 using IMAP be default without checking if that's what you needed / wanted to do</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not sure, in OL'2016, go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Email tab --&gt; show all email accounts configured in your profile with the "type" (protocol used) in the right-hand column. Your description indicates you have multiple PST files (...................I
 tried to import the Outlook 2007 .pst files). If your email account in '2007 was configured as an IMAP account, that would have involved 2 pst files, one of which is essentially irrelevant while the other will contain your default contact/calendar data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather then drag this out - summary of questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) How many email accounts do you have and how is each configured if more then one?</p>
<p>d) How many &lt;Inboxes&gt; do you have in the Outlook Nav Pane</p>
<p>e) While in Account Settings, how many data files are configured under the Data Files tab</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is relatively simple, just need to know the state of your universe in order to provide the right instructions</p>

    <title>Best Access 2007 Book for advanced programmer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich cohen in md  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best Access 2007 Book for advanced programmer&#63;</h2>
                    I've been working with Access since 1992 and I guess I'm familiar with most of it's basics. &nbsp;I transitioned to Access 2007 in 2008 and I'm still using it since the client where I'm using it has not yet moved to 2010. &nbsp;After all these years I've finally
 decided I need to buy a book! &nbsp;In 1992 the book came free from MS, but times have changed. &nbsp;My concern is that most books seem to be aimed at novices and I'm afraid they will drop the subject before getting into material I'll find useful. &nbsp;On the other hand,
 I am interested in going over the basics. &nbsp;There are probably some really simple things I've never learned by trial and error. &nbsp;But, mostly I want depth, details and a very good index. &nbsp;Any suggestions? &nbsp;Buying the wrong book doesn't bother me as much as spending
 3-4 days reading it before I discover it lacks the depth I need.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For me Access is mainly a tool. &nbsp;Most of the code I write is for tools to do my work as an enterprise level data modeler and architect. &nbsp; Right now I'm working on a simple metadata repository because the commercial products I've seen don't do many things
 I need. &nbsp;My client previously paid $10,000 for a heavy weight tool that didn't work out.</div>

            <p>It's hard to beat Getz et al.'s massive _Access &lt;ver&gt; Developer's Handbook_ published&nbsp; by Sybex. Alas, they stopped with version 2003, but the vast bulk of the two volumes is still applicable.</p>

            I recommend Access 2007 Inside Out by Viescas and Conrad.&nbsp; It covers just about everything, but it's been out for 5 years now and you may have to hunt around to find it.&nbsp; Conrad's A2010 version of the&nbsp;covers so much more material with all the new web stuff,
 that some chapters could not fit in the printed copy and are only available on the accompanying disk.

            Thanks for the information. &nbsp;Since one of my main concerns are the differences from 2003 to 2007, a 2003 book won't do for me. &nbsp;It's a shame they didn't update it for 2007. &nbsp;It sounds like the kind of book I'm looking for.

            Thanks for the recommendation. &nbsp;I checked it out on Amazon. &nbsp;It looks good and I ordered it from one of their alternative venders. &nbsp;There were about a dozen vendors still offering copies on Amazon. &nbsp;I'll let you know what I think about it in a few weeks.
<div><br />
<div>If anyone else has other suggestions, I'm still open to them. &nbsp;I don't mind buying more than one book to find what I want. &nbsp;My problem is that Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is sh*t.) applies to technical books in spades and I'm trying to avoid the
 drek.</div>

Re:&nbsp;How are your SQL skills?
<div><br />
<div>Mixed. &nbsp;For about 4 years I made extensive use of SELECT statements and designed whole families of views. &nbsp;However, I'm not a DBA so there is a lot of SQL I've never used. &nbsp;Also, I haven't used Oracle in about 6 years. &nbsp;Does Access count?&lt;grin&gt; &nbsp;I have
 written some pretty complex SQL in the Access dialect recently.</div>

<div>Great guy, great book and great title. &nbsp;For about 10 years in the 1990's we were both active members of the Compuserve CASE forum. &nbsp;He gave me an autographed copy of his SQL Puzzles and Answers book and I've bought a few of his other titles including Smarties.</div>

<div><br />
<div>I bought it about 3 weeks ago. &nbsp;At about 1400 pages, it's not a light read, but that's what I was looking for. &nbsp;I intended to use it as a reference and that's what I've been doing. &nbsp;I haven't loaded the CD yet and I probably should. &nbsp;When I've been able
 to find the discussion of a topic I was looking for the material has been useful &nbsp;I've seen bother that makes me think the authors don't know what they are talking about. &nbsp;My only complaint so far is that the massive index some times lets me down by not providing
 an easy to find path the the subject I'm researching. &nbsp;The problem that I know most of the basic so the subjects I'm looking for are the odd or seldom used items and ideating a book like this is almost as hard as writing it. &nbsp;I think this book is a keeper,
 but I'm not as eager when jumping into its index as I am with some other references on different subjects.</div>

<h2>            Mail App Account settings out of date</h2>
                    I associated my BT mail account with the Mail App but keep getting the message "Your btopenworld account settings are out of date" - when I click "fix it" it presents an opportunity to add a new password - I did this putting in my e-mail password - it
 initially accepted it and I could see the sync icon turn - but quickly the exclamation triangle appeared with same message. So I logged on to my native e-mail using same password and got on no problem. It is not a certificate issue as was suggested so what
 can I do? Not sure if this is a Mail or Outlook problem or if&nbsp; they are the same thing?

            <p>Front camera or secondary camera of Lumia 640 XL can capture 5MP photos. However, the primary camera is made by Carl Zeiss which it can capture good quality photos better than the front camera. You can suggest your feedback through

    <title>OneDrive for Business - deleted files still seen. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive for Business - deleted files still seen.</h2>
                    
<p>Our company has been paying for and using OneDrive for Business for over a year now.</p>
<p>We are Microsoft's gold certified partner.</p>

<p>The problem I've been facing recently is as follows:</p>

<p>A. The owner deletes the shared folder(containing files), but the folder is still visible from my side. Yet when I try to access it it'd show a 404 Not Found (which is very normal since the file's been deleted by the owner). What do I do to make that folder
 disappear? It's very annoying.</p>

<p>After the above issue,</p>

<p>B. The owner tried a different way: he/she removes the permissions(stops sharing) on the shared folder first, then deletes it. Yet the outcome is the same - the deleted folder is still visible in my drive.</p>

<p>For some folders, luckily, it took two days approximately for them to disappear permanently from my drive.</p>
<p>But most of the deleted folders are still there, and has been there for over a year.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to solve this issue?</p>
<p>My OneDrive for Business is getting more and more cluttered with deleted-but-visible folders, as more and more people share and stop sharing their things with me.</p>

<p>Hi Kyung,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, if the folder was deleted by the owner, the related item will be automatically removed from our&nbsp;<b>Shared with Me</b>&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, could you please provide your tenant information for us? So that we can check if it is stuck at the backend. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message. Please access it via the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Go to the <b>Your details</b> section on the right side of the community site.&nbsp;
<br />
2. Click <b>Private messages</b>.&nbsp; <br />
3. Click the subject title of the response to read the message.</p>

<p>Hi Kyung,</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarification. We've escalated the case to the related team for further investigation. They may directly contact your global admin via the email address law***@gra*** you provided. Please let him pay attention to the mailbox and keep working
 on the issue with them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, given your question about why the file of a deleted user is still accessible, I'd like to explain that, after an account is deleted, the profile will be preserved in the databased in a deleted state for 30 days. in this period, his personal site
 (that is, the OneDrive for Business site) is still accessible if you've the proper permissions for it. Then, it will be sent to the site collection recycle bin, and will be deleted from the recycle bin according to the site collection recycle bin retention
 policy, which is 30 days.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the deletion schedule for OneDrive for Business via the article below:<br />

<h2>            pc suite for 6555b Question on viewing and editing content</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my nokia 6555b charger slot malfunctioned or overused will not allow recharging of battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>got pc suite for it.&nbsp; downloaded info to file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to manage the saved downloaded phone files, etc. but dont want pcsuite connect to phone AFTER I already saved info to my PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot access content unless I reconnect mobile phone.&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; I thought the purpose was to check content etc.
 before reconnecting it to new nokia phone for download.or to download corrected info back on a phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when phone is connected, am I viewing what is in phone, or do I actually see the items saved on my PC for correction, retreaval and view for use later to download on phone which will bw sent to me as replacement?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If phone is connected and I select: restore the desired phone content from a backup file to my phone.&nbsp; WILL irt allow me to check all, make changes, save then download nselected items or save and cancel action till later.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or does it just force me to delete
 phone content and be downloaded with PC saved content?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help as you can on each of te questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks,&nbsp; jerry</p>

<p>1. PC suite will not automatically backup the content of the phone. When plugged, it'll just a phone content browser.</p>
<p>2. When backup/restore, PC Suite provides checkbox to select data categories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hotmail application is the default configuration process for Microsoft accounts so that they can be synchronized properly on Android devices. If you do not want to use that, please provide the&nbsp;exact steps on how you set up your account on your mobile
 device. Also, can you please confirm if the same issue happens when using another account (Microsoft - Outlook or Hotmail) on your phone? This will help us isolate the possible cause of the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Tylers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read your post carefully and I want to share with you my idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word online is designed for users to edit documents anywhere without installation of office,<span>&nbsp;
</span>as long as you have a browser and network. So, I suppose the browser is more likely the root cause. There are some basic troubleshooting steps for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Open <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://www.office.com/launch/word?ui=en-US&amp;rs=US&amp;auth=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.office.com/launch/word?ui=en-US&amp;rs=US&amp;auth=2</a>​</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span>by another browser like Chrome, Edge, Firebox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.Try to create a new document in Word online, check if the issue happen in all documents or a specific document to except the reason from the document itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Clear your browser cache (method is depend on which browser you are using that is easy to search)</p>
<p>
