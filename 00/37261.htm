<h2>            Advice on how to Silence a controller...</h2>
                    
<p>I now play late at night when the house is dead silent.&nbsp; TV turned down to near mute (just loud enough to hear a Creeper's fuse)... the only sound, the clickety ckick of the controller.&nbsp; The sticks smacking the controller casing is the loudest, but for some
 reson my 'Y' button clicks louder than the other buttons, which is hella annoying playing Castle Crashers.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So that's my problem.&nbsp; I know several of you know the innards of controllers pretty good and I was curious if any of you have ever tried to silence a controller.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to affix rubber washers or o-rings between sticks and case?&nbsp; Can the click-back
 (ie. the button popping back up and loudly smacking the case) be muffled?</p>

<p>Perhaps with the new 720 that has been mentioned they will have a controller that is touch sensitive much like touch pads?</p>

            <p>just try this,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today Finally I got answer to this solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to get back srevice files?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>before this I have also tried varoius methods mentioned on various posts like using
<strong><em>Fixit, MSRT, changing Update settings, sfc.exe</em></strong>, also some methods suggested on other posts by "<strong>Maurice N",</strong>&nbsp; It may have worked for others, but for me they all
<strong>didn't worked</strong> at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried<strong><em> system restore but that also failed with error</em></strong>, But later I found that System restore srevice was also missing from Services.msc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""<u>Today I tried booted my system using Windows 7 OS DVD, there I used option of "Repair"</u> , where it has various others option like
<em>Start up repair, System restore, sys image recovery , commnd prompt</em>"" </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>I used System Restore &amp; this time system got restored successfully &nbsp;to previous best configuration. :)</strong></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this resore using Windows OS dvd, I can now update my system , also antivirus running well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So finally I am happy.&nbsp; :) This community page Really helped me a Lot.</p>

    <title>Cannot Re-Download Age of Empires III Which Was Originally Purchased - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot Re-Download Age of Empires III Which Was Originally Purchased Through Games for Windows Marketplace</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new computer (running Windows 10) and have been trying to figure out how to re-download Age of Empires III.&nbsp; It was originally purchased back in 2010 through the Games for Windows Marketplace using the Games for Windows Client when it was being
 offered for sale at the amazing price of $0.10 (10 cents).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried downloading the game through the Games for Windows Client (which I'm surprised is still available given Games for Windows was closed down a couple years ago).&nbsp; When I log into the client it results in an error saying "There was an error retrieving
 your purchase history.&nbsp; Please sign out and try again later."&nbsp; My thoughts are that this error resulted because there isn't a server to connect to anymore but I really don't know for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Age of Empires III is still in the purchase history of my microsoft account (the same account used for all my Xbox Live marketplace purchases) and I have the order number and purchase date so I'm left wondering...How do I download it again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I paid for the game so I expect to be able to download it.</p>

    <title>Dissapointed with Xbox dealing with someone hacking an account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> specialfxcustom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dissapointed with Xbox dealing with someone hacking an account</h2>
                    
<p>I just wanted to give people some insight into a small problem with xbox live account services.&nbsp; Today at 2 pm i recieved an email showing I purchased a 6000 ms points bundle for 74.99 knowing that I hadn't done it or been on my xbox since the 16th I immediatly
 turned on my xbox.&nbsp; It came up with a message saying that my account had previously been accessed on another console but it did log me in.&nbsp; The first thought I had was change the password and get credit card info off the account.&nbsp; Well this wouldn't work on
 the xbox because as soon as it logged me in and tells me the previous statement then it tells me im disconnected from xbox live and my account is active on another console.&nbsp; So I turn to their website I am able to log into my account and try to remove my credit
 card info, but it tells me I can't delete it because it is linked to my account which by the way is paid yearly and set up to NOT auto renew.&nbsp; So next step call xbox live im obviously a little pissed at this point because I know the person on my account is
 going to bleed it dry.&nbsp; Well I get ahold of someone and they have to transfer me then I get a guy and somehow I get disconnected, so I call back then I get a messege about a high call volume and to try the chat feature on their website.&nbsp; After doing this the
 person on the chat feature after 5 min of back and forth question and answer tells me you have to call we cant do anything here.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I get off chat and get another email stating that I have purchased more ms points this is after I have told two microsoft
 employees that have taken all my account info that my account is hacked and I want my credit card info removed immediatly.&nbsp; So I call my bank and cancel my card to prevent anymore charges.&nbsp;&nbsp; So then back to xbox I call in again and get a employee that looks
 into my account and says he will have to lock the account and send it to a specialist to see what is happening I say fine because the person is still using my account.&nbsp; So after 35 min on the phone he tells me it could take up to 20 days to remedy the problem
 including me getting my account back to use and or my money back.&nbsp; Im not happy but its what has to happen so I head back to work, well I get home and at 9pm I get a call from a freind asking why im playing FIFA 12 soccer which I don't have nor wish too.&nbsp;
 So it turns out my account that is hacked is still being used by someone else 6 hrs after it was supposedly locked.&nbsp; I call back to customer service and they have been to busy for the account specialist that had to have 50 different ways of proving its my
 account hasn't had the time to lock the account.&nbsp; So guys be carefull even when you follow all the rules and do what you should in a bad situation the people at xbox may not have the time for our problems.</p>

<p>i just got my account hacked on monday night but i was lucky to catch it before they charged anything to my stored credit cards. they just used all my ms points. i was lucky to get my account back to normal earlier today, which suprised me because the person
 on the phone told me it would take about 15 days. yours might take a little longer because the fact that they used your credit cards and its probably going to take more time for it to get reimbursed. also when they email you they will give you a 1 month gold
 membership to create another account to play on for the time being, or you can save it and add it to your account when you get it back. after you get your account back they will probably give you another month or more depending how long your accounts compromised.&nbsp;my
 account was suspended for two days and they gave me 2 months total so they are trying to make up for any downtime. i've actually had a harder time trying to get money back from my own bank after someone got my debit card info and used it on a bunch of itunes
 crap and other online sites. this ordeal was a breeze compared to my bank.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;You have to call support for any billing/account related issues. &nbsp;Chat support cannot help you there.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;If you didn't get a billing agent on your first call, you navigated the wrong menu on the phone. &nbsp;You shouldn't have to be transferred if you selected the correct option.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;You can't remove a credit card paying for an active subscription regardless of whether auto renew is on or not.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Locking an account prevents charges from going through, not from allowing the person on the account. &nbsp;If you have a gold subscription, call and ask to have that suspended while the UA is being investigated. &nbsp;This will prevent the account from going online.
 &nbsp;However, if you lack the information to verify the account they won't be able to lock the account or suspend the subscription.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;All cases are different and how they are handled will be different based on the circumstances. &nbsp;You can't throw out a blanket statement that you did everything right and you got nothing in return because we have no way of knowing you did everything right.</p>

<p>Well the next morning after them telling me my account is locked down, I log in to see if its shut off and same thing my account is on another console and someone appears to be on fifa 12 still. &nbsp;I called back to customer support and they said they havn't
 had time to shut it off. &nbsp;I did finally get a ticket from MS support showing my case was opened and a 1 month subscription to use till they fix it only problem is it was a family account with 4 gamertags as we have 4 xbox's in the house with 2 kids and me.
 &nbsp;I am asking xbox to please send codes for the 2 boys also but havn't heard back yet.</p>

<p>And as far as Gob1zku's post goes</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Called and person hung up on me so tried chat ( I do belive that it was an accident on his part)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;I didn't hear an option that said someone is using your credit card to purchase points over and over and over.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;So im just supposed to be ok with not removing a card that they have already charged for a whole year of subscription already while someone else is spending my money</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;That was what i wanted was the account locked to prevent further charges and after providing all info they asked for twice they still hadn't locked account read my previous post about the account still active the next morning and the original call was
 around 3pm</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Well this one you are right but I do believe there is some work to be done by microsoft to allow an account holder to prevent faudulent charges on their account when they know it is happening &nbsp;there were several charges after the time that my account
 was supposed to be locked so explain what I could have done wrong there.</p>
<p>I am just putting info up for others to see I don't want to start a bicking war as I see others have had it far worse than me I would hope in the future that there is a way to prevent your gamertag from being recovered on another account or to remove your
 payment info when not needed.</p>

<p>Here's what I did:</p>
<p>1) Cancel the bank card (which it looks like you did)</p>
<p>2) Ask the bank if they can refund the money, mine did right away and said the MS problem is big right now.</p>
<p>3) File a fraud alert with the credit agencies (one should do since they all talk to each other)</p>
<p>2) Don't update your account with any new payment info unless you use the prepaid MSP cards</p>
<p>3) Change your password (which I hope you did already)</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>As long as your account hasn't migrated, it should go back live quickly. &nbsp;Mine only took 7 days. &nbsp;Unfortunately I didn't get the $20 in points back because I they needed to forward that to some other investigation branch or blah blah (baffling with BS again)
 before they can figure out if the points used were unauthorized. &nbsp;I'm not holding my breath, at least I got the account back on.</p>

<p>I guess I made a mistake by not putting a credit card on file. &nbsp;It seems the people who are getting helped by Microsoft are the people who have financial institutions (read: banks) backing them up in case Microsoft refused to refund your money. &nbsp;My microsoft
 points were stolen and its been 47 days since I reported it, I've had 2 hour long conversations with microsoft, I've been hung up on, yelled at and now worse yet: A MANAGER has told me that since I keep calling Microsoft will delay my account even further.</p>

    <title>Extreme Boot Time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryce tienter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extreme Boot Time</h2>
                    Recently I was looking at my start-up settings in the task manager and saw that the BIOS boot time was a whopping 139 seconds! I proceeded to look at enerything that was being run on start-up and everything that was enabled was low or no impact. Any Help?
 I have a Windows All in One machine running Windows 10 with the April 2018 security update.(The PC was having the long boot even before the April update.)

<p>You call 139 seconds "whopping," but I wouldn't. call it that.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div><span>My personal view is that the attention many people pay to how long it takes to boot is unwarranted. Assuming that the computer's speed is otherwise satisfactory, it is not generally worth worrying about. Most people
 start their computers once a day or even less frequently. In the overall scheme of things, even a few minutes to start up isn't very important. Personally I power on my computer when I get up in the morning, then go get my coffee. When I come back, it's done
 booting. I don't know how long it took to boot and I don't care.</span></div>

</span><span>Right click on msnmsgr.exe-&gt; Select Properties -&gt; Go to the compatibility tab and choose Windows Vista option.</span></p>

            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community. I would be happy to help you in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 you may create up to two types of Accounts. A Local Account, which is a standalone account not tied to anything, and of course a Microsoft Account (which is what you have that ties everything together and allows you to manage, setup and control
 from your account dashboard).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways Lets get on to resolving the problem. Please follow the below steps to remove the MSN account and add a Local account instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Go to Start (a windows logo on the bottom left or on your keyboard), click settings, or you can simply type it in the cortana search box and hit enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - &nbsp;Once you reach Settings, click Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - Under Accounts screen, the first tab you'll see is the one that says "Your info".</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 - Click sign in with a local account instead. You will need to confirm your Microsoft Account password one last time before doing this, do that and it will ask you to choose a desired username, password and a custom hint for the Standalone account. Once
 you proceed with this it will sign you out and you will need to log back in with your new Local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5- Once logged into your Local account, go back to Settings using the Start menu the same way as before. This time you have to select the Email &amp; app accounts tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6 - Once you reached the corresponding tab, select your Microsoft Account and click remove. Do the same thing, under Email, Calender and contacts under the same tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>7- Restart the computer and you are completely done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have any further questions or concerns, please do reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>At this point, I would suggest manually resetting the Windows Update related folders in your computer and see if that lets you install this update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: Performing these steps would erase the Windows Update history from the computer, but will not uninstall any updates.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>R </strong>keys together on your keyboard,then type in
<strong>Services.msc </strong>in the Run box and hit Enter. This should open up the Services windows for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Then find the following three services in the Services list and Stop them <em>
(by right clicking on them and clicking on <strong>Stop</strong>)</em> one by one:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background Intelligent Transfer service (BITS)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cryptographic Service</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Open Windows Explorer and go to the following location:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\</p>
<p>
</p><p>and rename the <strong>SoftwareDistribution </strong>folder to <strong>SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Go to the following location:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\System32\</p>
<p>
</p><p>and rename the <strong>Catroot2 </strong>folder to <strong>Catroot2.old </strong>
</p>
<p><em>(be careful here, do not rename the Catroot folder, you need to rename only the Catroot2 folder)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Now, go back to the Services window and Start the three services that you had stopped earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, close all open windows, restart the computer and try checking for updates and installing them. If it fails again, please reply here so that we could assist you further.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 Closes Immediately After Opening</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
WMP11 closes immediately after it opens. I have been using it for a long time with no problems. The only thing that is new is that I just installed a new 25" LCD monitor (I-INC) but I wouldn't think that would cause any problems.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have McAfee suite and scan for problems regularly with no problems.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any help.<br />
<br />
My PC configuration is:Dell Dimension 3000<br />
Windows XP SP3<br />
2G Memory

<p>I can open WMP 11 either manually and I'll get an error just pointing to the .exe and some memory location and it closes.&nbsp; If I double click a file it opens for a second or two then just closes with no error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've uninstalled and reinstalled, did all updates and still no luck.&nbsp; It worked fine a few weeks ago and nothing on the pc has changed.&nbsp; Any ideas to fix this?</p>

            <p>Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this exact problem recently. I'm not sure what caused this back in 2010, but in 2013 the installation of Microsoft kb2670838 made it so that certain AVI files would insta-crash WMP. I'd get the 0xc0000005 / Event ID 1000 in the event viewer, but I
 wouldn't even get a crash notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstalling kb2670838 solved the issue for me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2670838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2670838</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this updated affected certain video decoders, I assume that's what broke it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>-Shawn</p>

<h2>            this app cannot run on your pc</h2>
                    <p>Since the 8.1 upgrade I have been unable to open any apps.</p>
<p>I always get the titled message.</p>
<p>I have spent hours trying various on line 'solutions' but to no avail.</p>
<p>One thread lead me to looking at my .net framework 3.5.</p>
<p>I went to the programmes file to see if it was turned on or off&nbsp; but it isn't even showing in the list. (see screen dump below)</p>
<p>I looked to try to download it but the Microsoft site explicitly states that&nbsp;you cannot down load it.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1 on a Dell tablet XPS 10 which seemed to be fine until the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be appreciated.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried them all &amp; the only problem shown is a yellow triangle against ‘apps store may be damaged’ as shown in the screen dump below but I don’t know if this helps.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The problem seems to be with desktop apps although I cannot seem to initiate new apps from the apps store either.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>As in my original question I don’t understand why my system doesn’t have or show

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After continuous searching for an answer to my problem I&nbsp;deduced &amp; have now confirmed I have a tablet with only windows 8.1<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">RT
</span></strong>installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading the info on Cnet it says:- Windows RT only runs the apps available in the Windows Store (which, confusingly, is available in both 8.1 and RT).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence I haven't been able to get apps other than those in store. I assume this is also the reason I don't have '.net framework 3.5 installed'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi Paola,</p>
<p>Please see my comments in line</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of the following application was not syncing? None of the settings can be synced</li><li>Have you tried logging into a different device using the same Microsoft account and check if the settings were not synced? Yes, still not able to sync</li><li>Have you tried disabling the program then enable it again? If yes, are you still experiencing the same issue? Yes, I tried switch to local account, and switch back to Microsoft account</li><li>Have you made any changes or update to your Microsoft account before the issue occurred? I didn't notice this issue until I have the need to setup a new device recently.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Further to that, I have tried below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in my family member's Microsoft account on the same device (Surface Book with Performance Base), they are able to sync settings</li><li>Sign in my Microsoft account on another Windows 10 device, still not able to sync</li></ul>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description provided, it looks like you are trying to find the knowledge of sub keys from registry.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\LowRegistry\Audio\PolicyConfig\PropertyStore” is user for
 the audio settings of Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would be great if you could answer this question.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you facing any issue with Internet Explorer Sound?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reference:</span></p>
<p><span>Windows registry information for advanced users:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: I would suggest you to create a registry backup before editing or making any modification on registry
 settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However,
 serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more
 information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<br />
No, I'm not having any sound problems, I'm just trying to clear some junk out of the registry.&nbsp; I just want to know if it's safe to delete these subkeys or if there are any dependent keys I need to look at as well.<br />
<br />

            Your best bet would be to leave the registry alone if everything is working correctly. Don't try and registry cleaners as they can cause more issues then they might fix. Most are considered snake oil. If you are really determined to delete things, make
 sure you have a backup of the keys you are going to remove in case you cause yourself grief.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

It's a computer.&nbsp; If you know what you are doing, keep good backups/images of the system and follow some basic precautions, it's safe to try just about anything.&nbsp; So if you fall into that category - go for it and tell us what happens.<br />

            <p>The registry is massive.&nbsp; I guess about 10,000 pages long.&nbsp; Finding and cleaning that up would be a massive undertaking.&nbsp; Also, some keys need other keys and you really don't want to be playing around in there.&nbsp; Some obscure thing that looks like junk might
 be needed to get windows booted up...</p>

I also tried blowing out the ports with air and restarting my Xbox multiple times, i also tried switching controllers and headsets yet my Xbox still cant detect&nbsp; them. this problem started two days ago when i updated my controllers, my Xbox is 3 years old and so is the controller (execpt for the second one wich is a xbox one s controller.) whatever the problem i just need to know if i can fix this without getting my xbox one replaced.</p>

            <p>The "last item copied" is all that is available in Win7.&nbsp; There is no Clipboard viewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a Clipboard viewer in earlier versions that allowed selection of several copy operations but there is no such utility within Win7.&nbsp;
<em>I think that viewer was actually a part of earlier versions of MS Office rather than WinXP itself.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might be able to find a Win7-compatible utility by searching on the web [not that I have seen one].</p>

    <title>Camera app in Windows 10 Preview build 14295. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesmickler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera app in Windows  10 Preview build 14295.</h2>
                    On my Dell PC the camera app will only detect and use the integrated webcam. I have an Ausdom USB webcam that works with all other applications and websites, including Skype, but not with the Camera app. According to a Microsoft page it should be possible
 to right click inside the app and get a drop down menu to select which camera to use, but I get nothing when right clicking in the app and the regular menu and settings gives me no ability to change cameras. Is there a way to fix this problem so I can use
 my USB camera in place of my integrated webcam?

            Tried adding a local account but there was no change in camera app operation. I had to use the settings screen to change my account, the mentioned method showed that it had created the account but no second was available to log in with and the Microsoft
 account I normally use wasn't changed.<br />

            <p>I had this problem as well and think I may have discovered a workaround. The issue seems to be that the camera app supports a maximum of two different cameras at a time.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;disable one of the cameras on my Surface, the Camera app picked up my USB webcam.
 If you have two cameras on your Dell, try disabling one through the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sucks, but it seems to be all the app can manage right now. I did submit a suggestion on Windows feedback, but we shall see if they do anything about it.</p>

            I only have the one camera built in and one USB camera. The camera app picks up the built in camera but not the USB camera. When I try right clicking in the app for a selection menu, I get no reaction at all so have no option to select a second camera.
 I do have a universal control app for cameras called AMCAP and it will select either one of my cameras as will online sites which use a camera.<br />

<p>
</p><p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>

<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the

<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>
</li><li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to contact your PC manufacturer.
