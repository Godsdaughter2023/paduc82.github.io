<h2>            BBC Iplayer on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Since I upgraded to Windows 10, I haven't been able to download from BBC Iplayer. I can watch programs on BBC Iplayer but when I click on download, the download window opens, the program appears, and then it gets stuck with Pause button showing but the downloading
 doesn't start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've hit pause and then resume but no joy. I've also uninstalled and reinstalled BBC Iplayer but still nothing happens. I was always able to download when I was using Windows 8.1.&nbsp;

    <title>Per-application sound output - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josh liu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Per-application sound output</h2>
                    Is there anyway for Windows 7 to have a per-application sound output control. eg. I have a laptop and i want to output music thru those speakers( youtube thru firefox), while editing videos (afterfx/premiere)&nbsp; with my headphones.
<br />
<br />
If not, is it in the works? or should I change software to Linux that support ASLA. I have tried various third-party software, but found it too cumbersome or too long to fiddle with.

            <p>If you have multiple sound devices yes. If you have one on-board device no. </p>
<p>So, the solution :&nbsp;if you supplemented your on-board with a cheap USB audio device then you would have to route Firefox through the default device (no options within it to choose an output device) and route your video editing software through the USB device
 (supposing you can do this from WITHIN said software.</p>
<p>Linux cannot help you&nbsp;- you' would&nbsp;&nbsp;still limted by&nbsp;only having a&nbsp;single physical sound device !</p>
<p>Just to satisfy my curiosity, which fiddly 3rd party software are you talking about ?</p>

    <title>Problem with Gateway Factory Restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordanmorrisxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Gateway Factory Restore</h2>
                    So I have a Gateway laptop that I'm guess has a hard drive problem. It's windows 7. When ever I boot up the computer it says insert a boot disk and press any key. Basicalky i have no access to the computer. So I insert the first disk and a screen will
 come up saying Windows Is loading files... After that it'll say starting windows. Next Its a screen that says Gateway etc. I choose english and push next. Then it gives me 3 options #1 "Completely Restore Systems to Factory Defauls." #2 "Restore operating
 system and retain use your data." And #3 "Exit" I choose completely restore system to factory defaults because that's what I want the hard drive to do so I can have basically a working laptop. When i click It'll give me notices so I push next. Then the screen
 "restore destination" pops up. It tells me my hard drive name and my partition label which is blank and partition size which just says GB. I push next and a notice pop up and says it'll erase all data on partition label blank etc so

<p>
</p><p>If it comes up OK and as you are having trouble with the disks, use the Recovery partition to reinstall:</p>
<p><span><strong>Gateway</strong></span><span>: Press Alt + F10 Keys at Boot&nbsp;- As Acer owns them: press Left Alt + F10 Keys as per Acer eRecovery</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Hard Drive fails the test, buy a new Hard Drive and attempt to&nbsp;use your Recovery disks, or use this method:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or download the correct ISO file and make your own disk and use the Product Key that is on the COA Sticker.</p>

</p><p>Using the downloaded ISO file Method may require phone Activation.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Just putting few more words to Malkeleah sound advice.</p>
<p>Imagine that someone is sick and he/she happen to have some old medication that does not help with the current problem.</p>
<p>Would you insist to let them suffer rather than getting anew medication?&nbsp; (*_*)</p>
<p>In any case assuming that you have your own Wireless Router that the laptop is connecting to.</p>
<p>Configure the wire network cards on both computers to a static IP that is on a different subnet than the Wireless connection.</p>
<p><br />
Make sure that there is a functional network across the wire, and then Bridge on the laptop the Wireless to the wire card.</p>

<p>BTW. Wireless is just a replacement to a wire, otherwise it is Ethernet too.&nbsp; ◕ ‿ ◕</p>

    <title>ADDING Prepaid subscription card issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ADDING Prepaid subscription card issues</h2>
                    
<p>I added a 3 month subscription update to my account, then wife noticed on my bank account that i've been charged 24.99 and 9.99 fees from xbox and my credit card into was supposed to have been removed where only prepaid cards can be used due to past issues
 with xbox. I call xbox and the lady tell me they are having issues that when you add a prepaid card then it is reactivating my old credit card that was on file and that she would refund the 24.99. After speaking with her my entire service was shut off where
 I could not use xbox live at all. I call back and a fellow tells me that its all cancelled. I explain situation and now im told that 24.99 was error and will be refunded but I will have to wait up to 3 days to get resolution from trouble ticket he filled out.
 I also find out the 9.99 charge was for some unknown account that I dont know and that its like a possible fraud deal or something and that I will have to wait up to 15 days or so for a possible resolution on that one. So now I have no freakn service and I'm
 worried that my credit card info has been jacked. Hella lame because now im going to have to have my bank not ever allow xbox to charge me anything ever again( block them) and probably get new bank info or somthing to protect my money. Thanks xbox for not
 even letting me play the xbox dispite all your *** ups.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about the billing woes, mate. In order to get to the bottom of that $9.99 charge, I suggest visiting
<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://billing.microsoft.com</a>. It sounds like phone support is doing what they can to refund the charge, and to get you back on LIVE, correct? If you have any issues with that process, please call phone support, or
 post back in this thread.</p>

    <title>Downloading Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itsthehappypanda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloading Apps</h2>
                    <p>So here's my problem:</p>
<p>I just bought a laptop that runs windows 10 S and it won't let me download any apps other than from the app store. I can download a program's installer, like the FireFox installer, but then when I try to run it, I just get messages about how Microsoft is
 secure for a reason, edge is better, and I can only download applications from the Microsoft Store. But, when it gives me the option of "Still want to download apps from outside the app store?- See How" I click the See How link which takes me to the App Store,
 but never loads. It just sits in a blank app store screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been looking into how to solve this, and the main solution I see is to go to settings, and open Apps and Features. The problem is, when people show screenshots of what that screen looks like, it shows options that I don't have on my new small laptop
 that runs windows 10S. The only options I have are to "Manage optional features" or "Manage app execution aliases" but neither gives the option of allowing applications to be downloaded that are not through the windows app store.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi ItsTheHappyPanda,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />S means Store. Windows 10S will allow you to download apps from Store only.
<br />Windows 10 in S mode is designed for security and performance, exclusively running apps from the Microsoft Store. If you want to install an app that isn't available in the Microsoft Store, you'll need to switch out of S mode. Switching out of S mode is one-way. If you make the switch, you won't be able to go back to Windows 10 in S mode. There's no charge to switch out of S mode.
<br />
<br />You should move from S mode to either Home or Pro. 
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi ItsTheHappyPanda 
<br />
<br />To switch your PC out of S Mode, please follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />In the Switch to Windows 10 Home or Switch to Windows 10 Pro section, select Go to the Store. (If you also see an "Upgrade your edition of Windows" section, be careful not to click the "Go to the Store" link that appears there.)
<br />
<br />On the Switch out of S mode (or similar) page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.
<br />
<br />After you see a confirmation message on the page, you'll be able to install apps from outside of the Microsoft Store.

            Thank you. I was able to switch from S mode and am much happier now and I realize what happened. The problem I was having which I did not realize until working through this is that Microsoft has the windows store update absolutely everything in their store
 when you start a new computer. This freaked my out, so I paused all downloads, which meant that even the main windows store application was not working properly. I had to let it update itself before I could see the "GET" screen that I was hearing about. But
 once I figured that out, it worked. Thanks for the help in navigating the Microsoft bootup chaos.<br />

 sound quality (2ch, 32b, 192kHz, Studio Q) in the Advance tab of the Properties of the Headphones output (righ click on the volume icon of the taskbar and then click on Playback Devices.&nbsp;</p>

I also see video files for&nbsp;a split second before getting the 0xc00d36b4 error. YouTube and facebook video plays just fine. But all video files on my&nbsp;hard drive refuse to play.&nbsp;Doesn't matter if they are *.mp4 *.mov or *.avi

            "Windows+W" brings up "Windows Ink Workspace" - One thing that I nboticed is the audio quit a while after I upgraded to Win 10. The audio continues to work fine in professional audio programs such as Soundforge or Cakewalk etc but the Windows Media Player
 comes up with the error code mentioned above. The problem must have been introduced via an update. I've hardly used this machine since upgrading. Only to turn it on and keep it up to date.

<h2>            Windows 10 unable to add work account &#40;Office 365 w&#47; ADFS single sign-on&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 on a work laptop, installed all updates, and noticed that the Mail app doesn't let me add my Office 365 email (w/ single sign-on). It'll take me to my organization's single sign-on page. But after I signed in, it'll redirect to
 a blank page except for a # at the upper left corner. If I tried to add a work account (Settings -&gt; Account), the same error occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to outlook.office365.com, I can sign in using my org's single sign-on page just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: after comparing installed Windows Updates, it turned out that KB3081444 was the culprit. Uninstalling it resolve the problem. This is definitely a temporary workaround, but hopefully this helps someone before MSFT fix this.</p>

            <p>I had this same issue and figured out a solution yesterday.&nbsp; In order to work around having to go through a login page at the account creation, in the account set up, select advanced option at the very bottom.&nbsp; If we put in the right incoming and outgoing
 server manually, it works just fine.&nbsp; My email is through GoDaddy, but I believe this info is standard across all Office365 email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>inbound-&nbsp; outlook.office365.com</p>
<p>outbound- smtp.office365.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leave all the boxes checked below the info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your username is your whole email.&nbsp; The First two boxes don't matter.&nbsp; It's simply what you want the mail program to name the account when you look at it and then what you want people to see your name as when you send email.</p>

    <title>Migration to Skype for Business Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prashant_dv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migration to Skype for Business Online</h2>
                    
<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>We are in the process of finalizing the project to migrate all users to Skype for Business Online. This also includes a few hundred users using PSTN Functionality.</p>
<p>I have performed migrations to Skype for Business online using the Lync 2010 and Lync 2013 hybrid, but those deployments were without Enterprise Voice Functionality.</p>
<p>What i need help on is to know the migration path for the users who are enabled with Enterprise Voice on the on premise platform and the sequence that will follow a migration. To start with:</p>
<p>1) Will i have to first port the numbers before the i migrate the users ?</p>
<p>2) Should i migrate the users to S4B Online only after &nbsp;the porting has been successfully completed by Microsoft ?</p>
<p>3) How to go about adding additional Numbers for new users requiring the voice functionality ?</p>
<p>4) How to migrate and update all existing meetings that are already scheduled in Lync online with the new Conferencing service numbers from Microsoft ?</p>
<p>Any articles or white papers on the microsoft best practices is highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi PrashantDivakaran,</p>
<p>Based on my research, Microsoft has not published any official article regarding the specific answers to your questions. My personal suggestion is that you port the numbers after successfully migrating all users.</p>
<p>For the question about additional numbers, as far as I know, one PSTN user can only have one phone number.</p>
<p>As to the last question, I may need to confirm it clearly. Do you mean there are already some online meetings scheduled using Skype for Business online services, and the migrated users would like to use PSTN calling for these meetings? I didn’t find official
 information about this part either, and I will try to consult our relevant team. Once there is an update, I will let you know.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Hello Allen,</p>
<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>I am looking for best practices which in the form of KB or Technet can be showcased to customer if necessary.
</p>
<p>I think the point about additional numbers have been misunderstood. I did not mean that any one person will need more than one single PSTN Number at any point of time. My question is the following:</p>
<p>- Assume the customer has 100 DID numbers with their current service provider and 70 of them are in use.</p>
<p>- After migration of all the 100 Numbers to Microsoft, the 70 users continue using the same number but provided by MS.</p>
<p>- Over a course of time the remaining 30 numbers are also consumed by users within the organization.</p>
<p>- What or how do i go about getting the 101th Number for a new user in the company who wants PSTN ? Will Microsoft be providing numbers to the customer.</p>
<p>For the Meetings, what i intended is the following:</p>
<p>- The customer has presently implemented Lync 2010 and is using Lync online meetings.</p>
<p>- There are several scheduled meetings for all the users which are mainly recurring and not one-off instances.</p>
<p>- During the migration of the user to the Skype for business online, will these meeting instances be updated automatically so that they dont have to send out updates with new updated information in them ?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I have Windows Vista,&nbsp;and would like to remove the "Public" folder. When I right click on it, there is no option to do so.<br />
I don't share&nbsp;my&nbsp;computer, or files&nbsp;with anyone, so....I have no use for an empty folder. Can it be deleted? If so, I would sure appreciate some help with how.<br />

</p><p>I have never changed my password,&nbsp;and always had the box checked, to remember it.&nbsp; I was sending and receiving email until early October, when I began to receive this error message once or twice a week.&nbsp; Since late October I have received this error message
 every time I tried to log on to Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now however, I checked my Windows Live Mail and did not receive&nbsp;this&nbsp;error message.&nbsp; So what is happening that I am receiving this error message off and on?</p>
<p>Since using Windows Live Mail with AOL&nbsp;starting in&nbsp;June of 2017 I never received this error message and now since October 2018 I am receiving it.</p>
<p>I look forward to your help.</p>

<h2>            Cannot run Windows6.1-KB958559-x64.msu</h2>
                    I tried to install Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC on my 7 Pro 64 bit system by downloading two files from the following website:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Download Windows XP Mode</span></a><br />
<br />
I can install WindowsXPMode_en-us.exe fine as it is an executable file however am stuck with what to do with the second file, Windows6.1-KB958559-x64.msu<br />
<br />
First it tells me it doesn't know what to do with it - needs to select a program to run it. When I install Universal Extractor and try to extract the contents, there are not executables inside of the&nbsp;MSU file. Thought I was decent with computers but this has
 me stumped. I even tried saving the MSU as MSI and running it but that doesn't work either.<br />
<br />
My hardware supports virtualization and it is enabled.<br />
<br />
Can somebody educate me?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help,<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Hibernates automatically ONCE after login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ehsanhaq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Hibernates automatically ONCE after login</h2>
                    <p>My laptop hibernates (saving exact state of the system) ONCE after logged into Windows in following two cases:<br />
<br />
<strong>First Case:</strong> After waking up from sleep and log into Windows, laptop will hibernate automatically within approximately 30 minutes (most of the time within 5 minutes).<br />
<strong>Second Case:</strong> After starting from (shutdown state) and log into Windows, laptop will hibernate automatically within approximately 30 minutes (most of the time within 5 minutes).<br />
<br />
It does not hibernate when logged in after a restart (even if many times). Very rarely it has hibernated more than once (2nd hibernate happens within seconds of logging in after first hibernate). I have tried all possible variants of Power Settings, nothing
 helped.</p>
<p>There is another problem (stating because may be related, please ignore if not): Sometimes cursor gets stuck in circle or circles on the screen (see gif attached). It is a touchscreen tablet. I can free the cursor with stylus or finger. Many Thanks in advance.</p>

<div>Hi howie,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try backing up with a different disc and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you back up your files using Windows Backup, you can let Windows choose what is backed up or you can select the individual folders and drives that you want to back up. Depending on what you select, your backup will contain the items described in the
 following sections.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>&nbsp;Windows Backup won't back up the following items:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; Program files (files that define themselves as part of a program in the registry when the program is installed).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Files stored on hard disks that are formatted using the FAT file system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Files that are in the Recycle Bin.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Temporary files on drives smaller than 1 GB.</div>
<div><br />

</a></div>
<div><br />
Also, check if the Windows Backup service is started or not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Follow these steps to check for the same.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Start &gt; Run and type services.msc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check for Windows Backup Service and double click the Windows Backup service to bring up the Windows Backup service properties window.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select automatic and then click start.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, just select the drop down menu and then Start.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also check if the dependency service for this service is started by following the same steps as above.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>First of all, to check which is the dependency service for Windows Backup service follow these steps:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Start &gt; Run and type services.msc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check for Windows Backup Service and right click on it. Click on Properties and under the Dependencies tab you will find the Dependent services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note these dependent services and follow the above mentioned 4 steps and start these services too.</div>

            Thanks!<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <u><b>DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (9f)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that the driver is in an inconsistent or invalid power state.</i>
<br />
<br />
As opposed to the traditional *9F bug check that we can run an !irp on the 4th bug check parameter to get the device driver that's causing the inconsistent state, with yours a thread was holding a lock, which wasn't released, causing a timeout.<br />
<br />
If we run a !thread on the 3rd parameter of the bug check (thread currently holding on to the Pnp lock) we get the following:<br />
<i><br />
6: kd&gt; !thread ffffe000179a6040<br />
GetPointerFromAddress: unable to read from fffff80224b5a000<br />
THREAD ffffe000179a6040&nbsp; Cid 0004.1848&nbsp; Teb: 0000000000000000 Win32Thread: 0000000000000000
<b>WAIT: (Executive) KernelMode Non-Alertable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ffffe00013d0d608&nbsp; NotificationEvent</b></i><br />
<br />
We can see above that what's occurring is the thread is waiting for an event object which happens to be a notification event. Once this completes,
<span>the event objects will switch from non-signaled to signaled, and will release the thread(s) from its waiting state. The thread(s) can then after resume its normal operations.<br />
<br />
What we would do at this point is dump the call stack to see what we get, but unfortunately, there's nothing. With this said, we're going to have to do some detective work to find the culprit device driver.<br />

^^ Driver Agent. This software is absolutely terrible and I would never recommending using it and any other 'driver software' out there by ANY means. I'll explain why:<br />
<br />
a) The drivers it provides are promised or at least said to be the absolute latest, they are not always.<br />
<br />
b) Many of the drivers provided by these softwares are incomplete, buggy, not correct, not the latest (as I said above), etc.<br />
<br />
For your drivers, you should always get them from the manufacturers website and never rely on any 3rd party websites, softwares, or Windows Update (Device Manager as well, because Device Manager's 'Update this driver' goes straight to Windows Update's servers
 for its drivers).<br />
<br />
What do I mean by manufacturers website? You have an HP ENVY 17 Notebook PC, so you'd get all of your drivers from HP's website -
<a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support.html</a><br />
<br />
I would recommend checking all of your drivers.<br />
<br />
<b>3. </b>If you're still crashing after the above, let's go ahead and enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><u><b>Driver Verifier:</b></u></span><br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, so open notepad then go to your chat page, place the mouse pointer at the start of the text you wish to save, click and hold down the left button, slide the mouse right and down until all the text you want is highlighted and release the mouse button.
 Place the mouse pointer anywhere in the highlighted area and right click, a menu will open - click copy - go to the open notepad and right click in the blank page, a menu will open - click paste, then save your document.</p>

                    Windows update keeps coming back with this error but i do not have this printer installed. I have tried all of the various ways to fix this from the Community and none work. I'm starting to get disappointed with the latest Windows10 update.

<h2>            Indexing not running, Windows Search service also failing to run</h2>
                    
<p>Having some issues with Win 7 Enterprise edition &amp; Outlook 2007 serach function on a couple of machines in the office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done a fair bit of Googling and found the solutions that have worked for many haven't worked for me.&nbsp; Here is a list of bit I've done and the errors I'm still getting.</p>
<p>The main issue is within Outlook.&nbsp; If I try a search, I get the error "Search results may be incomplete because items are still being indeced. click here for more details." Search states 124349 items remaining in mailbox Spo 124977 items remaining across
 all open mailboxes. Using the dropdown menu within the search box and selecting search options, under Indexing, Mailbox - Spo, if I check that box, I get another error, A problem was encountered while trying to change which data files to index. some of those
 changes may not have been saved.</p>
<p>- Going into Indexing Options in Control Panel, the Modify button is greyed out.&nbsp; Going into the Avanced, Rebuild (all other options are greyed out) Rebuild doesn't appear to have any effect.</p>
<p>- C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data - Strange happenings in this folder. Many solutions state that there should be 2 folders here, Application &amp; Temp.&nbsp; Initially after browsing to this folder the 2 folders appear.&nbsp; After about 5 seconds they both disapear...&nbsp;
 If I try and create the folders (I've taken ownership of the ProgramData folder along with Full Perms) it fails stating Item not found, could not find this item, This is no longer located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data</p>
<p>- Services - Windows Search service does not run.&nbsp; I've tried restarting, and get this error: Windows could not start the Windows Search service on Local computer, Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly.</p>
<p>- Programs and Features - I've removed the windows component Windows Search, restarted, re added it, restarted and still no success</p>
<p>- Regedit - SetupCompletedSuccessfully key was already set to 0, removed, readded still now working.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any further suggestions rather than a rebuild!?</p>

    <title>Why is Skype always on now&#63; I have not given permission for this. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ultrabenosaurus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Skype always on now&#63; I have not given permission for this.</h2>
                    <p>Since a recent Windows 10 update I noticed Skype started when I logged in to my computer. The problem is that it's not registered as a start-up application, there's no Quit option when you right-click the system tray icon, and there's no setting
 I can find to stop it launching when Windows starts or I log in. This is not acceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can kill it by ending SkypeApp, SkypeBridge, and SkypeBackgroundHost processes from the Details tab of Task Manager in Windows 10. Except every time you reboot it's back even though it's not registered as a start-up application, every time I
 wake my computer from hibernation it's back, and some times it even resurrects itself while I'm sat here using my computer NOT CLICKING ON SKYPE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a BAT file in a folder monitored by Launchy so I can kill all 3 processes in a second whenever I notice it has restarted. If you go to "Settings &gt; System &gt; Personalisation &gt; Taskbar &gt; Select which icons appear on the taskbar" in Windows
 you can tell it to show Skype next to the clock when it's running, instead of hidden behind the arrow. That way you know when it's back and can kill it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I have not given my permission for Skype, a non-system-critical communication program with access to my webcam and microphone, to silently run in the background whenever Microsoft wants it to. I wonder if we in Europe can apply GDPR
 to this in some way? Maybe Microsh*t would start caring then.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That seems to have half worked. The Quit option is there after signing out, but SkypeBackgroundHost is still running according to Task Manager so I absolutely do not believe the main app won't start again next time I use my computer. Please also note that
 this is ridiculous, Microsoft are clearly banking on most users not figuring this out and being too lazy to trial-and-error a solution. It also makes using Skype very inconvenient if you have to sign out and then sign back in each time. Which idiot engineered
 this? I am uninstalling Skype and shall not be using it ever again, thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            Ruwim, your answer explains how to quit Skype - thank you. But you don't explain how to stop Skype launching automatically when the computer boots up. Can you tell us how to do that, please?

<p>That`s a lot of pictures.</p>

<p>There's no way that 1300 plus pictures could fit onto a CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These sentences don't go together:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>Other occasions bring me to a choice on how I want to do to accomplish the transfer which includes,
<strong>like a USB device</strong>, which will allow the transfer &amp; re-entry into her computer or another computer and to other computers as well.

<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>If you chose a "USB device" you should not be "prompted to insert a disc into the CD drive" (unless, of course, your CD drive is connected to your computer via USB rather than built into the computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should not be using "CD-RW" discs.&nbsp; You should use CD-R.&nbsp; The technology used to permit optical discs to be "rewritable" (e.g., CD-RW) leads to a shorter lifetime for the discs compared to "write-once" discs (e.g., CD-R).</p>
<p>
</p><p>More to the point, you should be using DVD+R discs (assuming that the optical drive in your computer can write to DVD+R) because a DVD can hold almost 8 times as much data as a CD (about 4.7 GB compared to the 700 MB capacity of the CDs you bought).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever optical discs you use, you'll have to save the photos in batches such that each batch is no larger than the capacity of the disc to which you are writing.</p>

<p>The goal is to transfer the pics to a device, disc, stick, whatever &amp; then delete the pics from the computer and peruse the CD to see what pics she might want to put back on the computer. As I understand it , if we use a CD-R, we cannot take pics from it
 and put them back on the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I did think about the capacity since a message read; Windows can't burn to the current disc. Please insert a writeable&nbsp; disc into drive E, which I interpreted as there is not enough capacity to continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So far, I don't know how to isolate the 6 different locations where the pictures are to transfer them one location at a time.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is also the situation that I have run into is when for some reason, I get to a blank disc that says drag the pictures that you want to put on the disc.&nbsp; I don't know how to bring the pictures and the blank CD in position to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            One other thing. I did not choose "USB" device it says like a USB device which according to the accompanying explanation saying that I can add or subtract from it&nbsp; and it's transferable back to the computer if I wish.&nbsp; It further states in context that
 CD-R does not have these attributes.

<p>Sorry, I misunderstood some of the things you wrote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, it's often helpful to report exactly what you're seeing in various messages on your computer rather than attempting to paraphrase them.&nbsp; If you want to take a screenshot of something and include it in your post, see
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/fdbk_commsite-fdbk_getstart/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/fdbk_commsite-fdbk_getstart/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably are referring to this screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfde2f73-3afb-4f7f-b9e9-5d10cee0ecfa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfde2f73-3afb-4f7f-b9e9-5d10cee0ecfa?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That screen refers to the format in which files are saved on the CD.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first choice -- "Like a USB flash drive" -- means that you record (burn or write) to the CD in multiple "sessions" until the disk is full.&nbsp; You can also delete files that you have written to the CD (they are not actually deleted, but Windows
 will no longer find them when you "look" at the CD).&nbsp; If you use this method, you will only be able to read the CD with a computer (and perhaps only a Windows computer).&nbsp; The Windows 7 Help system says that you will be able to "use the disc in a
<span>Windows&nbsp;XP</span> or later computer."&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The second choice -- "Mastered" -- means that you will record all of the files in one session and that you will be able to use the disc in a non-computer CD player or a non-Windows computer.<br />
</p>
<p>For more a more detailed explanation, click Start, then click Help and Support.&nbsp; Type &lt;&lt; which CD format &gt;&gt; into the search box in the Help window and then select "Which CD or DVD format should I use?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you're going to be using the same Windows computer, you could use either choice ... but if you are thinking that you would like to save the photos on the CD as an "archive," you're probably better off using the "Mastered" format.</p>
<br />
<p>Here's how to get the pictures from the different locations on your computer onto the same CD using the "Mastered" format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Start by going to the first location, selecting the pictures you want to copy to the CD, and click the "Burn" button in the tool bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; A Windows Explorer window will open with the title "Files Ready to Be Written to the Disc" and you'll see the pictures you had selected in Step 1.&nbsp; A pop-up at the bottom of your display will also show up, and you can click on it if the Windows Explorer
 window didn't open automatically. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cc8dc83-42db-4b43-8d0b-3421f59a775e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cc8dc83-42db-4b43-8d0b-3421f59a775e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Taskbar at the bottom of your display, you should see the icon for your open Windows Explorer window, like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ca89214-9074-4680-9dcc-393bd324eace?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ca89214-9074-4680-9dcc-393bd324eace?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Right-click on the icon for the window with the waiting files and select "Windows Explorer" to open a second Windows Explorer window (you could also press the "Windows Logo" key together with the E key).&nbsp; Arrange the two Windows Explorer windows side
 by side on your Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; In the second Windows Explorer window, navigate to the next location where there are pictures that you want to burn to the CD.&nbsp; Select the pictures and drag them to the window where the files are waiting to be burned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Repeat Step 4 as often as needed, navigating to the different locations where your pictures are located.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; When you have copied all of the pictures to the window that has the "Files Ready to Be Written to the Disc," click somewhere in that window and press CTRL+A (or click Edit &gt; Select All in the menu bar).&nbsp; You can then check in the Status Bar at the bottom
 of the window to make sure that the total size of all of the files is less than the 600 MB capacity of your CD.&nbsp; Then click "Burn to disc" in the tool bar at the top.</p>

 permit you to set the default size of pictures and those can easily be quite small (based on your numbers, your photos average about 360 KB, which is not unreasonable).</p>

<p>The goal is to transfer the pics to a device, disc, stick, whatever &amp; then delete the pics from the computer and peruse the CD to see what pics she might want to put back on the computer. As I understand it , if we use a CD-R, we cannot take pics from it
 and put them back on the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I did think about the capacity since a message read; Windows can't burn to the current disc. Please insert a writeable&nbsp; disc into drive E, which I interpreted as there is not enough capacity to continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So far, I don't know how to isolate the 6 different locations where the pictures are to transfer them one location at a time.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is also the situation that I have run into is when for some reason, I get to a blank disc that says drag the pictures that you want to put on the disc.&nbsp; I don't know how to bring the pictures and the blank CD in position to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the pictures are burnt to your&nbsp; CD-R you can put them back on a computer <strong>
using copy and paste method</strong> or <strong>drag and drop</strong>&nbsp; from the CD+R to a particular location on your computer.</p>
<p>( They will not be removed from the CD+R disk as it is only recordable but a copy of them will be taken which you can place somewhere else ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>( 1 ) You can select them ( the photos on disk ) individually by clicking on them and they usually highlight in a light blue color.</p>
<p>( 2 ) If you want to select different photos out of file order ( not one under the other ) you can hold the
<strong>ctrl</strong>&nbsp;button down and left click on just the ones that you want which highlight in light blue color.</p>
<p>( 3 ) You can also hold the left mouse button down in the blank part of the CD folder where the photos are and group select ( drag the cursor around the group which them highlight in light blue )&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have highlighted the ones that you want using the above method go&nbsp; to the folder you want to put them in.</p>
<p>Open that folder.</p>
<p>Right click on a blank part within that folder and select paste which will then paste them into the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>LemP is correct when he stated you should be using a CD+R depending on what your drive is capable of.</p>
<p>474 MB will fit on a CD+R.</p>
<p>Sounds as if the photo files are <strong>jpeg</strong> which are compressed.</p>
<p>If they were <strong>bmp</strong> files they would not considering the number of photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These in my books are the easiest methods.</p>
<p>There are other ways to do this as well.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>
