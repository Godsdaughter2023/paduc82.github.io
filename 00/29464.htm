    <title>Slow to open create restore point - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brbrown1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow to open create restore point</h2>
                    On my XP 2.01GH desktop PC with 512MB memory, 150GBdrive with 11.1GB used space, creating a restore point takes&nbsp;1 second to open. On my Vista 2.1GH laptop PC with 3GBmemory, 220GB drive with 60.5GB used space, creating a restore point takes 3 minutes to
 open. I can see from other users problems that this is quite quick but bearing in mind I do not get error messages or anything unusual happening, can anyone please tell me why it should take Vista&nbsp;3 minutes to open when XP takes 1 second? Could it be due to
 the&nbsp;higher used space needing to be covered? If not,&nbsp;is there a way of speeding up the Vista 3 minutes?&nbsp;

            I don't have a concrete answer except telling you what I did.<br />
I had your situation many times and I found out that if I did a dusk cleanup and remove all the restore points except the most recent one, the System properties window would open a lot faster.<br />
<br />
Caution : Don't remove all your restore points as I said unless you are sure your compyer is running smoothly. Because, you won't have any older restore point to fall back to after the 2nd stage of dis cleanup.<br />
<br />
Disk cleanup tutorial :<br />
It consists of 2 parts...<br />
From Step 1 to 11, it is just the usual disk cleanup.<br />
From Step 12 to the end, it is to remove all restore points except the most current one.<br />

<h2>            The purpose of DeviceDisplayObjectProvider.exe</h2>
                    <p>Anybody knows what´s the purpose with the DeviceDisplayObjectProvider.exe (It wants to connect to the internet)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the reason I have chosen a windows computer and not an apple is that I can gain some control with my computer - so please Microsof let us know what windows does - I do not like a lot of .exe and .dll files trying to obtain connection with the internet
 without knowing exactly whats going on.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Downloaded Xbox One Game on Wrong Xbox...</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;pre-ordered Star Wars Battlefront 2 and it never showed up on my Xbox. After some searching I found that for my Xbox live account, I&nbsp;had my buddies Xbox set as my home console (we were college roommates for a little). The game showed up on his console, not mine. Any idea how to fix this?? I set mine as the home console, but I&nbsp;have no idea how to transfer the game or where to start? Any help is appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p>Hello, <br />
<br />
My system is Vista Home Premium x86 sp2. <br />
<br />
All other updates download successfully except KB2719985 - the error code that appears is 800B0100<br />
<br />
I have downloaded KB947821 hotfix - this doesn't resolve the issue<br />
<br />
I have run all the checks suggested in the help menu's - it show there were issues with update but alleges to fix them, I re-boot yet still not resolved.<br />
<br />
I have searched online forums without great success.<br />
<br />
I have tried with internet security on and off (my current security is BullGuard - previously virgin internet security)<br />
<br />
I have run numerous scans in case of virus - no issues are shown.<br />
<br />
Can you please help as I don't know what else to do?<br />
<br />

Many Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi
<b>Ellen_L_C,</b></p>
<p><b>KB-947821</b> is suppose to fix error code
<b>0x800B0100</b>, as you have already tried running it and issue still occurs, I would like to go through the log file created by System update readiness
<span>&nbsp;</span>tool <span>&nbsp;</span>to check the status. The System Update Readiness Tool creates a log file that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. The log file is located here:
</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Thank you for your VERY prompt reply.&nbsp; Using your information, I was able to create a USO file on a jump Drive and able to re-install WIN10. I now have a working computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still could not restore my system image.&nbsp; It still ends in the same error.&nbsp; (…&nbsp; RPC Server unavailable....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, besides creating an image,&nbsp; prior to the drive failure, I also copied all of the files from "Documents" to a backup drive, so after re-installing WIN 10, I re-copied those files back onto the new drive.&nbsp; the BAD part is that all of my programs
 are now gone and I have to try to re-install those manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very disappointed that the System Restore does not work.&nbsp; I have three other home computers that I will need to find a better solution for the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other comments or advise it would be appreciated.</p>

            So, you are saying, you can't mount the system image, browse it and copy your files over?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:

            No, I thought you could just reinstall your programs manually. Have you made any significant hardware changes that might be preventing the system image from restoring?
<br />
<br />Do you have secure boot enabled in the BIOS? Also disable Virtualization then try restoring the image again.

<h3> caphalem  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#40;Windows 10&#41; How to full screen in Morrowind&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my version of Windows from 8.1 to 10 this morning. After setting everything up the way&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like it to be I launched The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition to find out that the full screen mode is no more...<br />
<br />
In full screen mode I get borders similar to ones you would get if you'd maximize a program. The result of that is that the bottom of the game's UI gets pushed out of the screen and you can no longer see it. Compatibility mode doesn't help, only makes the borders
 look like those from Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I suspect that there are a lot more programs/games that will do this too. I could not find a solution so now I ask. How do you full screen in Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>new to this forum but I had the same problem with my morrowind bought through steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem lies with the steam edition, I went into reg edit and changed the resolution and nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I uninstalled the steam version and installed my disk version and again reg edit to change resolution to 1920x1080 started the game and it was in full h.d but the window was still around it then I used the alt and tab to go to task manager method which
 somebody posted (kudos by the way :D) and voila working like a charm.</p>

<h2>            No birthday notifications in Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been using Skype version 7.x until today when it has stopped working.</p>
<p>The reason for not updating was many configuration options and birthday notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now - how do I enable birthday notifications in Skype 8?</p>
<p>Can you give a working answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ilya</p>

    <title>Surfce Book with 4G LTE connectivity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melkonbabigian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surfce Book with 4G LTE connectivity</h2>
                    <p>My company currently owns two surface books and 14 Surface 3 LTE capable tablets and approximately 18-20 Lumia 950 mobile phones. Overall we have over 50 active voice/data and data SIM connections. Our choice of MS W10 OS based systems across the board significantly
 transcends the basic cry from Android and IOS users that W10 Mobile is a no value system because of lack of apps. We want control and security. We have options with MS which do not exist with Android and IOS. We can configure and protect our devices and our
 communications and our data. I would like to thank MS for what they've delivered and what is yet to be delivered. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company is a technology integrator&nbsp;with a focus in physical security.&nbsp; Primarily Enterprise level network based video, access control and intrusion systems. With a team of sales, engineering and technicians all in the field, it is essential for us to
 be able to rely on device connectivity as opposed to interdevice connections to provide for internet connectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internal LTE device&nbsp;connectivity is the purpose of my post. I would like to hear from MS and others if and when we will see high end devices with LTE connection,&nbsp;the Surface Book and Surface Pro lines. Microsoft's Cellular Data app seems to be a sign LTE
 connectivity is coming from MS. I just wanted to post this and see what others and MS have to say about when and what devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post if you feel the same way. It seems that without an outcry of need and a shout of commitment that can not go unnoticed&nbsp;by loyal MS users, all else falls to the wayside with IOS and Android users screaming their opinions.
</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for your reply</p>

</p><p>I am using Huawei Wingle 8231S-1 for past&nbsp;three &nbsp;years and I am happy to use it. I have used this network device in various&nbsp;Microsoft desktop &nbsp;OS&nbsp; ( Windows XP,Windows 7 , windows 8.1, windows 10 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This device was working fine upto 15-11-2017 ( windows 10 ver. 1703 build 15063.726)&nbsp; On 16-11-2017 my windows 10 OS was auto updated to Ver 1709&nbsp; Build 12699.64. after restaring my desktop wingle is not working. ( ie not connected ) &amp;&nbsp;assigned IP address
 was like 169.254.51.X. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But my wingle was configured to default IP address 192.168.1.1 and DHCP IP address from 168.61.1.100 to 200.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have searched in MS windows support page and found there was a problem in Windows 10 ver 1709 OS and that would be fixed on next patch. ( ie 28-11-2017 )

<p>Hello Osman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We highly appreciate the effort you are putting in to work on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the latest update, I understand that the sync issues are intermittent and is happening across all/few of&nbsp;the devices you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Please&nbsp;login at&nbsp;<a href="https://devices.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://devices.live.com</span></a> and check&nbsp;if there are devices there that is not used anymore. If there are,&nbsp;remove&nbsp;them then try configuring
 your account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft account has a security feature called <strong>Trusted PC</strong> for verifying your identity automatically and performing sensitive actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to re-add the devices you are using for the Microsoft account and check if it helps to make any positive impact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visit: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/what-is-trusted-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Trusted devices: FAQ</span></a></strong></p>
<p><span>Refer to the section “I've lost access to one of my trusted devices. What should I do?” from the following link, and follow the steps on how to

    <title>Service Center claimed my console was tampered with. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Service Center claimed my console was tampered with.</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox 360 just came up with the three red lights a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Since my warranty was expired I paid for the service and sent my console in for repair.&nbsp; After they had my console for a few days they sent me an email saying my console had external tampering,
 and then another one saying it had internal tampering.&nbsp; This concerned me because I have never attempted to open my console, much less tampered with the internal components.&nbsp; I have had this console for years, and no one else has access to it. This is not
 the original console I purchased.&nbsp; I sent in my original console about 5 years ago when it got the three red lights and I was shipped back a console with a different serial number.&nbsp; The second console is the one I sent in for the paid repair.</p>
<p>When I called 1800-4my-xbox about this they could not give me any information.&nbsp; When I asked to speak to a supervisor he would not do anything but read me the emails that were already sent to me before hanging up on me.&nbsp; All I was trying to find out was
 what specifically they saw on my console so I could verify it when I received the returned console.&nbsp; I am hoping someone here can point me in the direction of someone I can speak to about this issue who is capable of doing something other than read me emails
 I have already read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I can not get anywhere, my only option will be to sell off all my games and accessories and move away from xbox products.&nbsp; There is no way I can justify spending money on a product with service that is this useless.</p>
<p>Please let me know of any avenues I should try to pursue.&nbsp; I love my xbox and would hate to quit playing over something that should be so simple.</p>

<p>Hey there. Sorry for the inconvienience. This kind of issue happens rarely. If you have ever joined a modded lobby of some sort, or have a USB with suspicious items connected to the xbox then the xbox can be registered as tampered with. As long as you are
 not banned you should be fine. Im sorry you have to deal with this. I had the same problem a few years back when I joined a MW2 lobby. You should be fine. Im sorry about the support you have been trying to get. If you're xbox itself is not working then (since
 you already tried sending it in) you must buy a new console. (which can be as cheap as 100). These kind of things happen rarely. It is a pain, but do not give up on xbox. :) I hope I helped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My issue is simple. &nbsp;I have only ever used official xbox accessories with my console. &nbsp;I have never attempted to modify my console in any way. &nbsp;When it failed, I did not try to use a third party to fix my console. &nbsp;I paid Microsoft to repair it. &nbsp;Their
 response was to tell me that it has been tampered with in some unspecified manner, leaving me with a broken console. &nbsp;When I try to get some basic information, i.e. what signs of tampering did you find so I can see for myself, I get told that there is no one
 that can give me this information, no way to dispute the claim, and that my only option is to buy a new console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why would I ever spend money with a company that has this response to their customers. &nbsp;I can afford a new console with no trouble. &nbsp;I can even buy the new style of hard drive and transfer my data, but why should I give several hundred dollars to a company
 that refuses to complete a paid repair their product. &nbsp;A product that is exactly the condition it was in when I received it from the repair center years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a huge fan of the Xbox. &nbsp;I have over 40 games for the 360, all purchased new so the money goes to the people who made the games. &nbsp;I was intending to buy the next generation xbox at launch. &nbsp;Now I find myself seriously considering selling all my
 xbox games and accessories and giving up on xbox entirely. &nbsp;All because they refuse to provide even the most basic level of customer service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I want are some clear answers to a few basic questions about my console.&nbsp; Is this really too much to ask from Microsoft.</p>

<p>Just guessing here, but if they sent you a replacement console from your very first repair, then maybe they have just simply overlooked the fact that they themselves have opened that replacement console in the past and (instead) have concluded that you are
 responsible for it, during this repair. Again this&nbsp;is&nbsp;just my best guess.&nbsp;Everybody makes a mistake every now and again so please don't lose faith in the company as a whole. Post back a response to Miss Ermine and see how things go :)</p>

<h2>            Migrating Windows 10 from m.2 sata to new pcie nvme ssd</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to upgrade my current m.2 sata 128gb to a m.2 pcie nvme 480gb and have questions about migrating Windows over. From my understanding since i have a laptop and cant connect both drives at the same time and pcie nvme isnt supported externally I was
 going to try and create a restore disk of my current drive and then image it to my new drive. Will this work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again my process will be, create rescue disk and image to usb, power down and swap drives, enable usb boot to my usb and power on, run the rescue disk and image to my new pcie nvme ssd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone see problems with this? Do I need a large usb or will 32gb work for a 128gb ssd?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be safe, your should have a USB Device that is larger than your used space on your current SSD... Plus all of the additional partitions...</p>
<p>You will need to image and restore all partitions on the SSD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think the Recovery\Rescue Disk will create an image, only restore... But perhaps I should ask which imaging tool you are going to use... It makes a big difference as all tools don't have the same capability...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you are describing should in reality be a piece of cake, but there are a number of things that can go wrong...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The location of the EFI and Recovery partitions are one potential problem... Since your new SSD is larger, you will need to expand your OS partition to make use of the extra space... If the EFI and Recovery are first... no problem... If one of them is after
 the OS partition, you will have problems expanding...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could always use the extra space for some type of storage in a worse case scenario...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could get a screen shot of your current SSD in Disk management, and provide the tool you plan to use, I may be able to be of more help...</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. I plan on using EaseUS TODO backup free 10.0. It states I can use disk clone to move my OS.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If I were to do a clean install to my new SSD would there be any complications? I can save files and important stuff to my back up HDD, but can I save apps too and then drop them onto my new SSD or will I have to try and download all new programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just trying to figure out the easiest way here no not screw everything up. I have important stuff backed up 3 times over so that's not a concern. I understand with a&nbsp;clean install means no apps and possibly no drivers. I don't want to lose certain programs
 like the msi dragon center and so on unless I can just download them/drop them from my HDD onto my new SSD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you only have one M.2 connection... If that is the case, you will not be able to clone your SSD as the two drives both need to be hooked up to do that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would need to create an image of your current SSD and save it on either your 1TB HDD or a external USB drive... I don't think the Easeus free will do an image, but maybe...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue to check before you get started is whether any of the partitioning\Disk Management tools you may need will even work with a NVME drive... I just recently added one of these to my desktop, and quickly found most of the tools I normally use will
 not recognize the drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do a clean install you will lose everything except for Apps that come with Windows... I'm not sure how easily you can replace the ones you lose... I know little about reinstalling Apps as I don't use any.. Just standard installed type programs...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to reinstall any app or program you have purchased... Any preinstalled programs that you lose, you should be able to download from your computers manufacturer..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see one potential problem with Cloning or Imaging, and that is the 900mb Recovery Partition... It will need to be moved in order to expand your OS partition... The good news is that your EFI partition is first, which makes things easier...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again the problem may be finding a BOOTABLE program to move the Recovery Partition and expand the OS Partition... Windows will not let you move the Recovery Partition with it's Disk Management tool... You will need a 3rd party tool of some kind..</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the programs I normally use for stuff like that would recognize the NVME drive... I was able to find a BETA update for Acronis Disk Director 12 that would do this, but it was hard to find... Partition Wizard is another free program, that does not
 recognize the drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some things you can use Win 10 installation media and select REPAIR at the Install screen, then Customize... But that only adds, deletes , and formats partitions. It does not provide a method to move them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does a really good job of finding drivers during the install, or installing them afterward, but it is possible that you may need to add some yourself, or change the ones it uses...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... Windows 10 will create an image of your current SSD, and should also put it on your new SSD without problems... You would need to save the image to your DATA HDD using the backup and Restore (Win 7) tool that is included in Win 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the image you will either need the System Repair Disk, or installation media to load it onto the new SSD... The tool won't work if moving to a smaller drive, but you are going larger.... The problem with this is that you still need to move
 the 900MB Recovery Partition...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so you know... the 900mb Recovery Partition can be deleted... The only drawback to doing that is tha some of the built-in Recovery operations will not function... You can still do them, but would need to boot with installation media or a System Repair
 Disk...</p>

    <title>On Windows 7, Recovery &#40;D&#41; Drive filling up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> offthegriduk  say:</h3>
<h2>            On Windows 7, Recovery &#40;D&#41; Drive filling up </h2>
                    Hi folks,<br />
<br />
I've just installed Windows 7 on a Dell inspiron 1521 laptop. Although there is plenty of disk space left on the C Drive, the D Drive (the Recovery Drive) has a horizontal red bar displayed almost all across. Although it is a 10Gig Recovery drive it says there
 is only 397MB left.<br />
<br />
For some reason&nbsp;ant software&nbsp;I install gets directed to the D Drive, and also any files get directed there. I've just tried downloading I Tunes and it fails as part of the programme is being directed to the D Drive but there isn't enough space!<br />
<br />
Apart from that, the system seems to run fairly fast and smooth. It's just this Recovery D drive filling up. Hope someone can help.<br />
<br />
All the best,<br />
John

<p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p><span>Here's a workaround to&nbsp;change the default installation path for applications from D: drive&nbsp; to C: drive or whichever drive
 you want to from the registry.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>:
 This post contains information about how to modify the registry. Make sure that you back up the registry before you modify it. Make sure that you know how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up, restore, and
 modify the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Back up the registry</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>To go to registry editor:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on start and type regedit in the search field.</span>
</li><li><span>Click on regedit from the programs list.</span>
</li><li><strong><span>Navigate to the following location</span></strong><strong><span>
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion</span></strong> </li><li><span>Now look for a key in the right pane called
<strong><span>ProgramFilesDir</span></strong>.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>You should see that the value something as D<strong><span>:\Program Files</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click on the value and edit it to whatever you like, for example:<strong> C:\Program Files</strong>. From
 here on, whenever you install a new program, Windows will use the new location as the default installation directory.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.<br />

<p><span>Hello
</span>rpkasko,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Community</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site. The issue you posted is related to</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Community<span>&nbsp;
</span>and would be better suited in the<span>&nbsp; </span>Microsoft Office<span>&nbsp;
</span>Community. Please visit the link below to find a community that will offer the support you request.</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Office Community</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Inregards to your question it really is simpler than you think.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Simply uninstall your current version, you document files should stay intact unless you have save them to the system32 folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But,<span>&nbsp; </span>I would recommend backing up your profile to be on the safe side.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then install your new version.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then go ahead and give your friend the standard version.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Backup</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Many people lose data everyday due to various reasons: virus infections, accidental deletion, hardware &amp; software failures, power failures and so on. To protect yourself from data losses, you can create a backup so that you will easily restore it when needed.
 Using Windows Vista’s <span style="font-style: italic">Backup and Restore</span> center, you can easily backup your personal files or the entire system. You can create a manual backup or schedule automated backups which will add the new files or the modified
 files into your original snapshot.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In this tutorial we will show you how to backup your data. In the following weeks we will also publish a tutorial about restoring your data.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
In the search field of the Start Menu type the word "backup" and then click on the
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The <span style="font-style: italic">Backup and Restore Center</span> has two main sections: one for backing up files and one for restoring them.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
On top of this, the backup section offers another two options: <span style="font-style: italic">
Back up files</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Back up computer</span>. The first option will create a backup of your personal files and folders and the second will create a complete backup of your entire computer. It is recommended to create a full
 back up of your computer just after you have set up your computer for the first time. Windows Vista will take a snapshot of all your programs, settings and files. You can use this snapshot if your computer ever stops working and restore it to the original
 state.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
How to backup your personal files and folders</p>
<p>
To start the procedure, click on the <span style="font-style: italic">Back up files</span> button and the wizard will start.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the <span style="font-style: italic">Back Up Files</span> window you will have to select where to save your backup. You can select a partition from your hard disk, a CD, a DVD or a shared folder from your network. Select the location you prefer and click
 on <span style="font-style: italic">Next</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the next window, you will see a list with all your partitions except the one selected as the location for saving your backup. The partition on which Windows Vista is installed will be selected by default. Now you can choose to include or exclude other partitions
 from the backup procedure. After you have made your selections, click on "Next".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The wizard will now ask you to select the types of files you want to have backed up. You can choose any of the following: pictures, music, videos, e-mail, documents, tv shows, compressed files and additional files. Select the file types you want to include
 in the back up and click on <span style="font-style: italic">Next</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the next window you will be asked about the frequency of the back up process. You can have daily, weekly of monthly backups. The scheduled backups will include only the new files or the modified files to the initial backup which you are about to complete.</p>
<p>
Create the settings you want and then click on <span style="font-style: italic">Save settings and start backup</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The backup process will start. First it will make a shadow copy, then it will scan the selected partitions for files and folders and then it will create the desired backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Depending on your system and on how much data you want to backup, the procedure will take from a few minutes up to a few hours. You can stop the backup at any time by clicking on
<p>
When the backup is completed you will see a balloon tip notification showing up on your screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
How to reschedule or turn off your automated back up</p>
<p>
If you want to change the settings of the automatic backup procedure, go to the <span style="font-style: italic">
Backup and Restore Center</span> and click on the <span style="font-style: italic">
Change settings</span> link beneath the <span style="font-style: italic">Backup files</span> button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can use the start menu search box, type "backup" and click on the
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The <span style="font-style: italic">Backup Status and Configuration</span> window will open. Here you will see the latest information about your backups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you want to make a new backup, click on the <span style="font-style: italic">Back up now</span> button. To change the current settings click on the
 the schedule, and finally you will have to choose if you want to create a new backup or you just to save the settings and exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you want to disable the automatic backup, click on <span style="font-style: italic">
Turn off</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Once you have finalized making all the desired changes, close the window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
How to create a complete PC backup</p>
<p>
To create a complete backup of your PC, go to the <span style="font-style: italic">
Backup and Restore Center</span> and click on <span style="font-style: italic">Back up computer</span> to start the procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The wizard will start and it will ask you where you want to save the backup. You can select a hard disk or one or more CDs/DVDs. Make sure you have enough CDs/DVDs or sufficient space on your hard disk and then, after you have made your choice, click on
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the next window you will need to select the partitions which you want to include in the backup. Make the appropriate selections and click on
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the last window, the wizard will show you a summary of your backup settings: the backup location and the disks which will be backed up. In the
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Click on the <span style="font-style: italic">Start backup</span> button and the procedure will begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:
</span><span>this tutorial was created with </span>UAC turned off<span>. If you have it turned on, you will have to make some additional confirmations for the changes that you want to apply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should resolve your problem.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let us know if these steps resolve your problem.&nbsp; I hope the information is useful.</p>
<p>

<h3> troubledvictim  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer is doomed... please help me.</h2>
                    <p>The problem all started about 3 days ago. Windows was continuously telling me about a update, which i kept putting back a hour because I was busy with things on my computer. My computer was running as fine as ever, no issues at all. I finally decided to
 let the update go, and I went to sleep, not aware of 2what the horrible result would be when I woke up. When I start my computer now, there is a black screen before the actual login screen with my username where i enter my password. this never happened before.
 It seems to continue to the next screen when I simply click. I sign in, and everything seemed fine. But No. Now my computer was moving so incredibly slow. I checked the wifi, thats perfectly fine. There's no background processes. There's nothing on my computer
 and its moving deathly slow. I try opening one of my computer games that always performed perfectly fine. It's unplayable because its moving so slow. The entire game is laggy, my mouse cant even move much before the screen freezes a second. I try opening another
 one of my games. Right as the actual app opens, the game closes and sends me back to the launcher. No luck at all. This is crazy, this has never happened before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the steps I've taken to try and fix this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I tried reinstalling some of my apps, obviously that isn't going to work</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I tried restarting my pc, I thought perhaps my computer just booted up incorrectly and carried over problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. windows defender did a full scan for viruses. Nothing located</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I had tried a bunch of things I looked up online on "windows update making my computer slow" tried using the command prompt etc, nothing worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. <strong>I had to fully reset the computer several times now</strong>. It does not work still. I tried to restore windows to a previous version but it said it cannot do this and sent me back. I fully cleaned the drive, I just removed my apps one time.
 I used as many troubleshooters as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fully restarting my computer, cleaning the drive didn't even help. <strong>The computer actually isn't slow until I actually try downloading one of my apps.&nbsp;</strong>once I try downloading and using the apps I used to run easy and perfectly, the computer
 starts moving at incredibly slow, laggy speeds. it's insane. </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>I'm not 100% sure if this was caused by an update, but it MUST be</strong>. If it was a virus, it would be gone as I cleaned my computers entire drive / reset the system. (the longer reset) I also made sure I did a full scan
 with windows defender, and I always had my windows defender firewall up. I don't believe it was a virus. My computer just started not working for no reason. But how can the update still be there if I made a clean installation of windows?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">I need help. If you require my computer stats please show me where to find them because i'm not very tech savvy. Please tell me whats going on... I can't afford a new computer</p>

<p>Yes i have unlocked 47 achievements out of a possible 82. Problem is when I play the game, I am not allowed to use any of the fortifications and benefits that come from having unlocked so many achievements. It is literally as if I am starting the game and
 a new xbox life account. </p>

<p>The achievements are still recorded on the servers against your account, so it sounds like the local file is possibly not there. Have a look on your storage for it, and make sure this is the one you select when you start up the game.</p>

<p>One of the most common reason why users do not see their credits is because they are accessing a different account. To ensure that you are on the correct account, I suggest that you sign out and sign back in using the credentials you used to
<strong>initially </strong>create your account. You can use the Microsoft <strong>
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Accounts Diagnostic link</a></strong> to determine whether you have multiple accounts or not. Enter the email address associated with your account and click Continue. We'll give
 you the list of accounts that are under your email address. </p>

    <title>Unable to add friend to friends list on Xbox website or on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kentnelson84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to add friend to friends list on Xbox website or on console&#59; Friend stuck in pending</h2>
                    
<p>Since June, I have been trying to add a friend to my Xbox friends list. He receives the invite and accepts the invite. I then appear on his list of friends but he does not appear on mine. He is still stuck in pending on my console. This is even so on my
 account on Xbox Live website. He still appears as pending. I have contacted Xbox live chat support four times now and still no luck.</p>
<p><br />
Things that I have been asked to try by support staff: </p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We have already tried a full power down of the console with all cables unplugged.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Deleted profile on my Xbox and reloaded it.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Made sure privacy settings on both consoles were set correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Checked network connectivity (No interruption of service when online at all)<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My friends have not had any connectivity issues either.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I really am not sure what else there can be done since it does not seem to be an issue on my end</span><span> since I have been able to add more friends after I first started to add the friend I
 first started talking about. T<span>his one friend that will not add e</span><span>ven though I am appearing just fine to him on his end.
</span><span>We are even able to send messages through the console.&nbsp; </span><span>All that I see of him on the console or website account page is that he is still "pending" even though he has approved the request.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><br />
After all the troubleshooting on my end, I keep being told by Live support that this was a server issue to get me off of the chat window. Well it has been a "server issue" since June and I have not seen any progress. Any help you can give would be much appreciated
 to fix this issue. Thank you.<br />

<p>Hello ElGringo7,</p>
<p>That does seem odd, especially since you have done most the ways for troubleshooting the problem. There have been a few service alerts about viewing Friends on Xbox. However, they have been resolved. Since it does show on Xbox.com that your friends are still
 set to pending even though they have accepted them and on the console.</p>
<p>Have you tried using Smatglass to see if they are added to your friends list? Please try deleting the request and having him delete you and re-add you for you to accept to see if that works. Also, try having him do the same troubleshooting steps you have
 mentioned. Once you have done that try clearing the system cache.</p>
<p>I would recommend contacting phone support about having them send the issue to the Advocacy Team to see if they can further investigate your account.</p>
<p>Phone Support number: 1 (800) 469-9269</p>
        </p>

<p>I totally agree with you regarding this issue. I have done what you suggested by clearing the cache and that did not work either. I do not have SmartGlass to be able to add friends. I have also had my friend do a lot of the same troubleshooting steps that
 have been presented to me regarding this issue. I suppose it would be best to get in touch with the Advocacy team to see what they can do as well. If there are any other folks out there with any other suggestions, please let me know!</p>

<strong><span>Hi selmore11,</span></strong>
<p><span>User Account Control (UAC) is used to increase the security of the operating system that can help prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. UAC does this by asking you for
 permission or an administrator password before performing actions that could potentially affect your computer's operation or that change settings that affect other users.</span></p>
<p><span>By verifying these actions before they start, UAC can help prevent malicious software (malware) and spyware from installing or making changes to your computer without permission.
</span></p>
<p><span>To Turn ON User Account Control:
<br />
<br />
1.Click on Start, type uac in the search box, and then click Change User Account Control settings.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. To turn on UAC, move the slider to choose when you want to be notified, and then click OK.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
