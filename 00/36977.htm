<h2>            Error 1722 when I try to install  iCloud for Windows 4.0 update.</h2>
                    I get the following message: "There is a problem with this windows installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor." I've tried everything suggested in the "Community" and
 online I could find. Nothing works.&nbsp; I have not had any problems with other software including iTunes.<br />

    <title>WD MyBook Essentials 1TB Not Detected on Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kerrdog1  say:</h3>
<h2>            WD MyBook Essentials 1TB Not Detected on Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and can no longer use my WD MyBook Essentials 1TB external hard drive now. The computer does not detect it at all, despite the fact that it is switched on and running (whirring sound and light is on). I have three
 other hard drives that all function fine, including a newer WD that I purchased to replace the MyBook. The MyBook is an older hard drive, so I wanted to back up the files from it with the newer WD. However, only the new WD shows up under "This PC."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the WD is functional, because it was running without any issues on my old PC. I unplugged it from my old PC, gave the old PC to a family member, and then plugged the hard drive into my new PC. That is when I discovered that the new PC would not
 detect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Device Manager as well as "Manage" under the "This PC" button from the Start Menu, but cannot locate the 1TB hard drive anywhere. It's like the computer is just not "seeing" it. I spent a lot of time researching on the forums and Internet, but
 most everyone seems to be having problems with getting it to read while it is showing somewhere on the computer. Unfortunately, I am not that far along; I am struggling just to get it to be detected so that I can find it somewhere on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the cable from the newer hard drive, but that did not make any difference. I also updated all my drivers and that too made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home Edition</p>
<p>Intel i7-6700K @ 4.0 GHz</p>
<p>16 GB of RAM</p>
<p>64-bit processor</p>
<p>
</p><p>External hard drive is a Western Digital My Book Essentials 1TB with USB 3.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice or assistance would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Darian, thanks for the reply! As stated in my original post:<br />
</p>
<p>1) No, it is a brand new computer, so no changes made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Yes, I updated every driver already in my initial stages of troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Yes, I did run the troubleshooter.</p>

            Hi. I am a fellow community Member who likes to help out when I can.<br /><br />Recent Windows updates have had several glitches that users are finding difficult to deal with.

            If you do choose to Rollback I would block the automatic updates to 1803 for now until Microsoft releases patches to address the current issues. To block automatic updates see this guide<br /><br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-10-feature-update-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-...</a><br /><br /> Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

            Yes the Show or Hide Updates Tool is likely a better way to stop Windows Update but since I have rolled back and disabled Windows Update<span> through computer management when I tried Microsoft Show or Hide Updated it found no update to hide.
 I think I will be ok keeping Windows Update disabled as I have and keep an eye on the web for any fix for this in the coming months.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>

<h2>            Using a Korean OS product key with an English Windows 7 CD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to ask if it is possible to use a previously activated (on my desktop) Windows 7 Home Premium CD to reinstall&nbsp;an English OS on a laptop that has a Korean Windows 7 Home Premium OS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a previously purchased Windows 7 CD. I recently purchased a laptop that has the Korean Windows 7 OS.
</p>
<p>I would like to reformat the laptop with the English OS and then use the product key&nbsp;from the Korean OS(from the sticker on the laptop).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this possible at all? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called mircosoft tech support and they wanted 150 dollars to walk me thru an on-line process.</p>
<p>However, I feel I have paid enough money for all the software and hardware I currently have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate any help or insight into this situation.</p>

<p><strong>One other possible workaround, you could try using the factory recovery option which could likely give you the option to select English during the Out of box experience. You can try that before you using the above options:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<font>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
</font>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p><br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you have determined which system file was corrupted, we need to find where the corrupted file is located and then manually replace the corrupted file with a known good copy. To do this, follow the steps found on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep us posted with the result.

            Thank you -- but this is all jibberish to me and quite frankly not sure that I completely understand the directions - Is there a reason why the TEMP file will not delete?&nbsp; This has been an issues since day one when I bought this lap top in November - Is
 there a fix for this issue?&nbsp; It seems many many customers have the same problem.

<h2>            Skype for business issue kb2566790</h2>
                    We recently had O365 Exchange deployed and working wonderfully, everyone works on the system, but there is just one location that Skype seems to be an issue for signing in.<br />
<br />
All other locations are fine, I also have swapped computers out and tried the login here before swapping out to the location and it worked fine.<br />
<br />
I keep getting that its " There be might an issue with the DNS"<br />
<br />
I ran the test connectivity analyzer tool and it came back successful and no errors at the location....I am not sure what this could be? I am starting to think its our firewall, but it doesn't look like anything is really blocking the connection.....

<p>Hi Asmith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally speaking, the "kb2566790" of Skype for Business is related to the DNS records of the Skype for Business account. Since you have mentioned that you tested the connectivity, I'd like to collect the complete test result for confirming it. For protecting
 your privacy, you can provide the test result in the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/new">
Private Message (PM)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another hand, please try clearing the cache of the Skype for Business client to see if it works. As you posted under the Windows category, my understanding is that the affected user is using the Skype for Business on Windows system. As a result, you can
 refer to the following steps to clear the cache.&nbsp;</p>
a. Sign out it and close the client.&nbsp;<br />
b. Open Run bad and type &nbsp;in <strong>%AppData%</strong>. Make sure you're in the AppData directory and navigate to
<strong>Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</strong> for Skype for Busines 2016. (Skype for Business 2016 is the newest Office version)<br />
c. Delete all files in Tracing folder. Do not delete the folder itself.<br />
d. Clear DNS cache: in Command Prompt run <strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> command.<br />
e. Re-start the Skype for Business client.<br />
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I'd like to confirm/collect the following information for further troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. For your mentioned "<span>&nbsp;there is just one location that Skype seems to be an issue for signing in", what do you mean by saying "location"?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does the issue persis with any other users under the same domain as the affected user?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Does the issue persist if the affected user changes another network environment, for example, the user got the issue in the Office, he can try it at home or any other place where the network is
 good?</span></p>
<p><span>4. A screenshot about the "</span>Skype for business issue kb2566790".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looking forward to your update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,<br />
Alan</span></p>

<p>Hi Adam Smith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, I understand all users in one location/area cannot sign in Skype for Business and when you sign in your account in the location, you also got error while it works on your location, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help to get the <strong>Configuration Information</strong>&nbsp;(hold <strong>
Ctrl</strong> button and click the Skype for Business icon on the bottom-right corner) to analyze in PM.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09e666f2-38ab-4815-91d4-9fb7e444693f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09e666f2-38ab-4815-91d4-9fb7e444693f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please clear Skype for Business cache as Alan mentioned (Open Windows (File) Explorer and navigate to the folder:
<strong>%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</strong> to delete all contents in Tracing Folder), then reproduce the issue and send the&nbsp;Tracing folder as .zip file to us in PM.</p>

<p>Hi Adam Smith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the configuration information, you should hold <strong>Ctrl</strong> button on your keyboard and then click the Skype for Business icon. For the Tracing Folder, the file you sent in PM seems not the folder (.zip). If you deleted all files in Tracing
 folder before, after you reproduced the issue, there are some files generated in the folder. You can&nbsp;zip the folder and send to us in PM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<h2>            Installed Windows 10 Pro but have a Windows 10 Home key</h2>
                    When I was loading up my new PC I used the Windows 10 creation tool on my laptop, and installed it to a USB. It gave me no option between Home and Pro and when I installed it on my new computer. I later realized it installed the Pro Version. The problem
 is I bought a Home key from Microsoft and since they're different version the key doesn't work. How do I change windows versions?&nbsp;

            Josh, as per the tutorial for the gold standard Clean Install I gave you, sort your files into their User folders and then drag them to the hard drive to back up, confirm they were fully copied by size of folders.
<br />
<br />Then unplug the secondary hard drive, boot the media provided and delete all partitions on the SSD, click next to auto-create and format the necessary partitions, begin install -  this makes it foolproof.  
<br />
<br />Keep us posted.

            Thank you for your reply.
<div>I have downloaded the programme you recommend.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This programme highlights two lines:</div>
<div>The first, highlighted in pink, (below avg user interface &nbsp;avg technologies c:\programme files (x86)\avg\)</div>

<div><br />
<div>The second, Wow6432Node\microsoft\active Setup installed components</div>
<div>and underneath, highlighted in yellow, Internet Explorer &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file not found c:\windows</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have un-ticked the mobilegeni box. I have checked uninstall programmes but could find no mention of this in the list. &nbsp;I have revo uninstall but have not yet checked this to find mobigeni as I am not completely sure what it is. I think it is part of
 the malware problem I had on Sunday but not certain enough to delete particularly as it seems to be associated with avg. &nbsp;Please advise!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am very cautious about anything to do with windows. I did download updates on Sunday - one listed as critical so it may be that it is something to do with this - or the malware.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not sure about uploading files to sky drive - how to, or security - so hopefully the above will enable you to advise.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

<div>Purple ones seem to start HKLM/software Wow or microsoft</div>

<div>Another pink line makes reference to corel. &nbsp;From this one, as I know it is a programme that was uninstalled, would it be a good guess to assume that pink might refer to uninstalled programmes - or those not completely deleted?</div>

<p>The file requested is a technical report about how your system is works and does not relate to personal data, which you naturally wish to protect. You only need to leave a file in your Sky Drive for the limited time necessary for the other party to retrieve
 the file. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Having requested thousands of reports in these forums over the last 3 years, I can only say that I have never encountered a complaint that an exchange of files has contributed to a breach of the users security and a loss of personal data. I am not an expert
 in computer security but breaches of security occur when a&nbsp;user allows direct access to their computer. &nbsp;Access can be granted by the user knowingly allowing direct access or access being achieved by deception or trick though a camouflaged link in an incoming
 email or other communication.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you look at other threads you will find many other users&nbsp;sharing files, notably by those&nbsp;seeking help with diagnosing&nbsp;the causes of blue of death crashes.&nbsp;Exchanging copies of files is&nbsp;an extremely practical way&nbsp;to aid and expedite the finding of a solution
 to the problem the user has. You no doubt are aware that these&nbsp;are moderated public forums. Abuse of whatever kind&nbsp;in these forums is rigorously dealt with and those seeking to abuse others are excluded from using the forum. However, I have never seen the
 type of abuse you fear reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your query regarding colour coding in Autoruns is explained by this extract I have obtained from a post in the Autoruns forum:</p>
<p><br />

                    Hello guys, I want to know if&nbsp;there is an alternate way&nbsp;to&nbsp;delete the $Windows~BT Folder? I've tried to use the Command Prompt bat, the one that's like posted everywhere. But I keep getting an access denied message. What can I do?

<p>The Disk Cleanup is not working, it sees the windows installation files and when it tries to clear&nbsp;them, it doesn't. It doesn't even detect the Window's BT Folder.</p>

            Seems everyone has given up on this including Microsoft I guess. None of this works. Are you kidding with the Safe Mode answer. Lets pretend we all grew up using windows and never had to ask these stupid questions before. Now lets imagine that someone
 made Windows impossible to work on yourself anymore. Now comes this forum where we swallow our pride and ask Microsoft for help and you give me the standard answer tree answer of “did you try Safe Mode”. I suppose you would recommend a windows re-install next.
 Thats how we got people off the phone back in the day. Ridiculous. Lets assume it worked great till Microsoft filled all its space with crap files that we can’t delete off a computer I paid over two grand for because apparently I’m not the administrator it
 wants even though its my computer? &nbsp;Thats what your telling me? Is Microsoft gonna reimburse me for the 40gb of lost space that I am never getting back?&nbsp;

<p>@ KennethStager &amp; BruceMorris- Microsoft didn't make Windows impossible to work on ourselves, it's just ridiculous to presume that over the span of decades, that Windows is never going to seriously change.&nbsp;That said, the particular issue of being unable
 to delete certain files or folders in Windows even as an Administrator by&nbsp;selecting and pressing delete&nbsp;is not new, although the very particular version explained here in attempting to remove those specific files may be unexpected for most.
<br />
<br />
The reason the administrator cannot&nbsp;clear the contents from Program Files from even the recycle bin, is because the Program Files folders are&nbsp;system folders,, meaning the system owns them, not the user. Deleting them from a PB environment has zero effect on
 the permissions of those files, so they are still tagged the same way even after they are moved to the recycle bin in a PB Environment. That is why the system is still requesting administrative permissions to delete those files.&nbsp;The change in default&nbsp;ownership
 of the Program Files folders specifically to System however, occurred in 2012 with Windows 8, approximately six years ago. The administrator accounts *can* absolutely take ownership from the system&nbsp;and do as they like after doing so, but System owning certain
 folders and the local administrator accounts being unable to tamper with those folders without some extra steps is a functionality that has been in place since Windows Vista in 2005 and has not changed ever since.
<br />
<br />
In regards to the 10GB-40GB of space, you will get it back automatically after the default delay period elapses as part of the standard Windows Update process in Windows 10, which if my memory serves is either 60 or 90 days. After that period of time elapses,
 Microsoft considers the probability very low that any issues due to that update will occur, and automatically deletes those files itself. Those files are what Windows uses to revert the installation to its' previous version any time there are errors that cause
 the device to be unusable. So attempting to delete those files actually deletes&nbsp;the *OLDER* version of Windows 10. That is not the update, but rather is the backup of your known-good configuration when the system attempts to update, which as mentioned above,
 is why it is automatically retained for a set period, and then automatically deleted after that time period elapses.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with Windows, but rather the issue here is gaps in understanding of how the current version(s) of Windows actually function when doing certain things. Such gaps are fully understandable, since it is not as if Microsoft sends a manual
 with every Windows Installation, or even if they did, the overwhelming majority of us would not read it anyway until we run into an issue like this where it will not do what we want to do the way we want to do it. 99% of the time, the issue is not that Windows
 is poorly designed, but that we as users don't understand how it was designed, because it's not the sort of thing(s) we do all day, every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MaRoselle Cag's response&nbsp;was not only a good answer, but the correct answer. Safe Mode's entire purpose is to prevent anything but the bare-minimum Windows processes, services, and drivers from loading.&nbsp; If an issue such as above persists, with certain files
 being locked in use while in normally booted Windows, then the proper solution&nbsp;is still the same as it has been since XP, to determine the necessity (or lack thereof)&nbsp;by booting into Safe Mode where Windows (and anything/everything else) is much less likely
 to attempt to use them. The comment about taking ownership of the files/folders is also the solution to the inability to delete certain files, even as an administrator. Once the administrator has ownership of the files, then you may then delete those files
 at any time of your choosing.</p>

<h3> karissa beveridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Mouse and Surface Pen not working</h2>
                    <p>I have had my computer for a few months now and my pen has always worked fine, but in the past week or so my surface pen has stopped working intermittently and now does not work right. The pen has a charged battery in it and the top button will still open
 the sticky notes, screen sketch, and windows ink workspace, but the pen will not write or register on the touchscreen and the bottom hidden button does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I have been using a wireless Dell Bluetooth Travel Mouse with the laptop and have had to remove the device and reconnect it multiple times. After removing the device the last time it will no longer connect to the laptop, and when I try to connect
 the mouse it requires a PIN number that was never required before. I tried to input the PIN number listed on the bottom of the mouse, but the laptop still failed to connect to the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried troubleshooting tutorials I found on the Microsoft website, but nothing has worked so far. Any ideas on how to solve these issues would be appreciated.</p>

            Can you go into Settings, Updates and confirm all available updates are installed? Also, can you check device manager for yellow "bangs" on devices and look for anything unusual?

The Pen and pinch:zoom issue might be related. Have you tried a two button reset:

Step 1: Swipe in from the right and tap or click Settings, tap or click Power, and then tap or click Shut down to shut down Surface. If you can’t shut down Surface normally, press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds. 



Step 2: After Surface turns off, press and hold volume-up button and the power button on your Surface at the same time for at least 15 seconds, and then release both.              

                                                                
        

        The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.


 
Step 3: After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds. 



Step 4: Press and release the power button again to turn your Surface back

    <title>Emails never arrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carolhiggins6710  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails never arrive</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; My sister has Outlook.&nbsp; We email every day, sometimes several times per day.&nbsp; Occasionally, an email sent from one of us never arrived at the other's inbox.&nbsp; Not in trash, not in junk, not in spam, not blocked, as we email daily.&nbsp;
 99% of them get through but occasionally they don't and when we try to forward from the sent column, those don't arrive either.&nbsp; We thought it was because of fonts that the sender sent in and receiver didn't have but it is not that; we have retried and the
 font just gets changed to default font.&nbsp; We both used to have Outlook Express and it used to happen back then, also, so I don't think it matters which kind of mail program you are using.&nbsp; Does anyone know why some emails just never arrive and what happens
 to them and why?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a huge problem because after we realize it has happened, we just copy from the original sent email into a new email.&nbsp; Sometimes it comes through right away and sometimes it has to be sent several times.&nbsp; We are just really curious as to why this
 happens; would appreciate if anyone can shed some light on the subject.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also does anyone know how to get an email or even snail mail to Microsoft?&nbsp; I haven't been able to find any way to contact them.&nbsp; I want to tell them how much a lot of us miss stationery that Outlook Express used to have.&nbsp; I don't understand why WLM doesn't
 have any, as it was supposed to be an improvement on Outlook Express, but in that respect, it fails.&nbsp; The only program I can find with stationery is Incredimail and my provider doesn't recommend it and won't support it.&nbsp; They think it will cause security problems.
 Also, if you get Incredimail, all your email comes in there, you can't maintain other email accounts like WLM or Outlook or Gmail.&nbsp; I need two because sometimes one account has problems with it.&nbsp; Thanks again if anyone can help.</p>

            We experienced the same thing yesterday. Spent 7 odd hours with support on the phone with no results! My wife found a tip on line which got me on the road to solving the problem. While your computer is looping, hold down the upper zero button on the keyboard,
 this will bring you to another screen with options. Choose and scroll till you find recovery and select.It took most of the night but windows 8.1 is now operating again, we did lose personel files but nothing important. The windows tech told me it was a hardware
 issue and I would have to bring it to a specialist! He had me remove the battery multiple times, and restart multiple times which brought us close to dropping the laptop. He said we needed the recovery disc that came with the laptop, but they come preloaded
 without a disc. My blue screen was saying there was a locked driver then changed to a NTS file error. Our laptop is a toshiba and there site has no driver updates for windows 10. The tech told me it was our responsibility to che

    <title>Desktop Background Image Disappears When Screensaver Kicks In - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop Background Image Disappears When Screensaver Kicks In</h2>
                    Hi, I have been having this issue ever since I updated to Windows 10... &nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, I love having a snowy, winter desktop background, and I have the perfect falling-snow screensaver. &nbsp;I used to enjoy a snowy scene with NO problems, at all, before this update.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>PROBLEM: </strong></span>&nbsp;When the screensaver kicks in, the beautiful snowflakes fall, but the background disappears completely, and instead of a cool winter scene where it really looks like it's snowing in the
 middle of a beautiful alpine forest, it's just snow falling against a black background.<br />
<br />
When I press a key, everything else is normal, I have to enter my password, my snowy forest background image is back and everything, but it's so annoying that I can't have the falling snow against my picture of an evergreen forest covered with snow. &nbsp;I've been
 lightly playing around with settings for what seems like an eternity on a series of sporadic whims to no avail. &nbsp;I've tried to look this up to see if anyone has this same issue, but all I see are people who have problems with their desktop backgrounds disappearing,
 completely, where they have to go and re-add the image. &nbsp;Admittedly, that's a much more annoying problem, LOL! &nbsp;Seriously, though, I have been living with this for months and months, but it's getting closer to Christmas, and it's really starting to bother
 me, now. &nbsp;LOL!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please, help bring a smile back to my face. &nbsp;I'd appreciate it very much. &nbsp;:)<br />
<br />
Signed: &nbsp;Black Snow &nbsp;:(

            It sounds like that screensaver may not understand how to draw on top of the desktop background.&nbsp; Have you contacted the maker of that screensaver software?

            Hey, Zach, thanks for the tidbit. &nbsp;I think you are right, I've been messing with it for soooooo long. &nbsp;LOL. &nbsp;When I have some spare time, I'll be looking into contacting the software people. &nbsp;For now, I figured out how to just manually make it fall over
 the picture, which in a way, is better than waiting for the screensaver timer. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;:)

            <p>If you figure it out, please let us know! &nbsp;I love the 3D snow screen saver and have been using it for 3 or 4 years. &nbsp;All was fine until the last Windows 10 update as far as I can tell. &nbsp;Now I have the exact same issue you describe. &nbsp;Instead of the "snow"
 falling on the image on my Desktop, the Desktop goes black when the snowfall begins. &nbsp;I've double checked all the settings for both the computer's screen &nbsp;and the screen saver, and everything looks OK. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When exactly do you get the error message?</p>
<p>2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>3. Are you facing any issues with the Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ieframe.dll is a Windows DLL file. DLL is the abbreviation for Dynamic Link Library. DLL files are needed by programs or web browser extensions, because they contain program code, data, and resources.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The ieframe.dll DLL file is related to Internet Explorer. In many cases, the installation of Internet Explorer causes ieframe.dll errors to appear. Other causes include viruses, certain Windows Updates, incorrect firewall settings, outdated security software
 applications, and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Install the latest version of Internet Explorer. No matter if you're missing ieframe.dll or if you're receiving a browser error message about it, reinstalling or updating to the latest version of Internet Explorer has resolved many user's issues with ieframe.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sometimes, the ieframe.dll error will show up when your computer is infected with certain kinds of viruses.</span></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the Microsoft Safety Scanner and check:</p>

<p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Install any available Windows updates. </p>
<p>Installing more recent updates, especially those to the Windows Update software itself, may help resolve the problem.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much!! &nbsp;You were very, very helpful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe errors began Friday 5/10/14 when my Internet Explorer stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not make any changes to my computer previous other than updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I did run a virus scan. &nbsp;Nothing there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;I did install any available Windows updates. &nbsp;Still nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;I couldn't get Internet Explorer to download, an error report kept coming up: the ordinal 294 could not be located in the dynamic link library.....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;I ended up restoring to a previous setting, end of April. &nbsp;Whala!! &nbsp;Everythings working! &nbsp;I've stopped any automatic updates and now wondering what to do from here!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how to get future updates if my programs are going to fall apart! Before restoring back end of April, &nbsp;I couldn't make primopdf's, download internet manuals from programs or get Internet Explorer. &nbsp;There might even be other problems as well!
 &nbsp;Hmmmm......</p>
<p>
</p><p>More ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!!</p>

            <p>I'd like to pick up this thread as I had the same problem, but do not have an April (or prior) restore point to recover. I am running Windows 8.1 x64 and after a Windows update in the early May (not sure exact date) I had the following symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-IE fails to launch. Just a brief blue wheel for a mouse and nothing appears.</p>
<p>-When launching Adobe Acrobat, I get the following error:</p>
<p>Acrobat.exe - Ordinal Not Found<br />
The ordinal 294 could not be located in the dynamic link library<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\ieframe.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:</p>
<p>-uninstalling IE11, but that failed with a catastrophic error code 0x8000FFFF</p>
<p>-ran sfc/scannow and got the following result:</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some<br />
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For<br />
example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not<br />
supported in offline servicing scenarios.</p>
<p>-ran Microsoft Safety Scanner. Didn't find anything suspicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips or further information I can provide?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If System File Checker (SFC) could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it could fix the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.<br />
<br />
If not, then run the Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealthcommand to repair any component store corruption, restart the PC afterwards, and try the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>Follow these steps to use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<strong>Search</strong>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click
<strong>Search</strong>. Type <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> box, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click

<p><span>b. Type the following commands. Press <strong>Enter </strong>after each command.<br />
Note: It may take several minutes for each command operation to be completed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><span>c. Close the command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>DISM creates a log file (%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. %windir% is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the %windir% folder is C:\Windows.</span></p>

            Thanks for this response. Since my last post I uninstalled Windows updates going back through 4-29-14 and the problem is resolved. Someday, I will have to let these updates install and, at that time, I will pursue your recommendation. &nbsp;I hope Microsoft
 resolves the issue with a future update.
