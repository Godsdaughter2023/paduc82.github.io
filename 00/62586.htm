<h2>            How do I select multiple files when searching in windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to select all mp3 files on my computer so that I can copy them into my music folder. Unfortunately when viewing search results I cannot hold down shift to select all files like I could normally do and have several thousand files to move, so
 enabling checkboxes would take ages. Does anyone know how to select all results of a search? Ctrl A doesn't work either.

            <p>I just searched for all MP3 files in my PC using the Search box in This PC. &nbsp; There are ~600 of them.&nbsp; I clicked on the first file in the list, then scrolled down to the last file in the list and held down the shift key while clicking on the last file. This
 caused the entire list to be selected.&nbsp; I could then right-click on the selection and choose copy (among other choices).
<br />
</p>
<p>Is this process not working for you?</p>

            When I click on the first file in the list it tries to play it. When I right-click it it gives me the option of opening or copying it. Holding down shift doesn't change this when I click on another file. I don't know why your suggestion doesn't work like
 it does with most files.

            If you want an answer to your question it is best to start a new thread asking it rather than add it to a thread about a different subject.

    <title>Volume Licensing &#47; Divestment question - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Volume Licensing &#47; Divestment question</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are currently going through an asset sale and have a question regarding transitioning when the third-party takes ownership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following are charactistics of our environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are a Microsoft volume licensing enterprise enviroment</li><li>Deploy the volume license distribution of Microsoft desktop OS's and servers's OS</li><li>Have centralized KMS Server and implement volume MAC keys (for special purposes)</li></ul>
<p>What we know the third-party company is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are a lot smaller company</li><li>They do not have an Enterprise Agreement, no any volume licensing</li><li>No KMS/MAC licenses</li><li>They deploy OEM/Product licenses within their enviornment, they enter product keys per device deployment is my understanding</li></ul>
<p>So we need to eventually remove these computers off our domain, and eventually off our network. &nbsp;</p>
<p>some of my concerns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would they need to reimage their Servers/Desktops to a FPP (Full Packaged Product) or OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) distribution copy of the operating system?</li><li>The goal is to keep some Servers/Desktops operational, but once removed from our Domain and network the KMS count down begins (I believe 180 days)&nbsp;</li><li>Can a volume license install of an OS be converted/or have the ability to accept FPP/OEM product keys?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, any advice is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            FIXED PING SPIKES OVER 1000-2000 WIFI</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have been lurking the website for few days now trying to fix my new gaming laptop problem. The issue was spikes on the ping every 10-15 secs. It would go so high that gaming was unbearable. I tried everything, changed hardware router and modem, reinstall
 windows (even though this laptop is only few weeks old), Bios upgrades, drivers upgrades, all the suggested guides in this forum.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gave me an advantage is the fact that I had 2 laptops and one was only doing it. The second laptop was not doing it at all. What helped is when someone in the forum mentioned about disabling services in windows. I turned them on and off one at a time.
 Here are the several possible answers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. one drive syncing</p>
<p>2. enpass ( if you have that)</p>
<p>3. any cloud base folder that is not syncing right</p>
<p>4. antivirus that is syncing every 10-15 seconds with database.</p>
<p>5. lastly on my part ( location services) in windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried them all and only number 5 worked. However through my reading of locked threads these are the multiple options that can help with your problem. I just wanted to help out, since most of the threads that has the previous answers are closed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/689d972e-cc32-4c30-9380-9f78be03a1b4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/689d972e-cc32-4c30-9380-9f78be03a1b4?upload=true" /></a></p>

            I got the same exact problem. I can exclude the first 2 options. Is there a way I can check if the syncing is broken or even see if I got any cloud folder unknowingly. Im also pretty sure that I got no location services installed. Only difference is that
 I use Win7.

            Here's a repost from the windows.tabletpc newsgroup: (Old post but might work)<br />
=====<br />
&lt;snipped&gt;<br />
<br />
To restore the Journal Note Writer, do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Log on as a user with administrator privileges.<br />
2. Close any open instances of Windows Journal.<br />
3. Open a command prompt.<br />
4. Change the directory to &lt;systemdrive&gt;\Program Files\Windows Journal.<br />
5. Type the following and then press Enter: journal.exe /RepairNoteWriter<br />
<br />
There will be a brief flash of the Windows Journal splash screen and then<br />
several seconds of hard disk activity. When the repair is complete, the<br />
journal.exe process will shutdown. There won't be any visual notification<br />
that it has finished. To verify that the repair has completed, check Task<br />
Manager for any instances of journal.exe, and verify that Journal Note<br />
Writer is present in the Printers and Faxes folder.<br />

    <title>Windows Drivers Update to Support Aero Effects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. kofinyamekye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Drivers Update to Support Aero Effects</h2>
                    <p><span>I have recently been getting some “dark wavy lines” across my computer screen after the screen has been in “a screen
 saver mode” for quite some time. By the way, this particular problem exists in Windows 7, which is on a separate hard on my PC. The reason I am bring this up is that I have Windows XP on a separate drive and I don’t have same problem on XP. Please note that
 to use Windows XP, I exit Windows 7 and reboot Windows XP. </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Using the “Troubleshoot problems with transparency and other Aero effects,” Windows gave me the following message:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span>"The current video card may support Aero with a driver that is compliant with the Windows Display
</span></i><span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Driver Model</i></a><i> (WDDM). Contact
 the manufacturer of your computer or video card for a WDDM-compatible driver."<br />
<br />
when I try to troubleshoot the problem, Windows 7 says "Video card driver doesn't support Aero effects".</i> More importantly, Windows 7 keeps telling me that I have all current updates and yet I keep getting the weird “dark wavy lines” on my computer screen</span><span>
 after the screen has been in “a screen saver mode” for quite some time.<span>
</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Please help to fix this problem!

            Install the more complete and Windows "level" compatible video card driver that the video card manufacturers provide "free" on their own support web site.<br />
<br />
If your video card does not have a complete Windows 7 video card drive and you use the minimum video card driver that Microsoft provides with Windows 7, you will not have Aero working.&nbsp; It also means that the video card manufacturer has stopped supporting driver
 development for your video card.<br />

<p><span>Hi KNPeterson,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p><span>The error message - An unexpected I/O error has occurred, Status: (0Xc00000e9) is a hardware error pertaining to your computer's BIOS.&nbsp;Basically<br />
it is telling you that the computer is not able to reliably communicate with the hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>You may try startup repair. Startup Repair is designed to prevent a time-consuming reinstallation by diagnosing and repairing problems that
<br />
prevent Windows from booting. Introduced in Windows Vista, Startup Repair is even easier to use because Windows 7 now installs it on your
<br />
hard drive for you.</span></p>

<p><span>I also suggest you to update the BIOS. You must get in touch with the system manufacturer to update the BIOS.</span></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot

guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS settings can e solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk</span></p>

<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer (Start
 / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.<br />

 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>

 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also
 conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers, do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates
 from Windows Update as follows: </span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></a><span>.
 Proceed as follows: </span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</p>

<h2>            Intermittent Audio Buzzing After Latest Update</h2>
                    I am having issues that seemed to have arisen after the latest update.&nbsp; Rebooting, updating drivers, etc., has not changed the fact that every few seconds, there is a noticeable buzz in any audio I am listening too.&nbsp; This happens for headphones and different
 speakers.&nbsp; I recorded a sample using snagit so you can see/hear it, it is just a clip of a video news story.&nbsp; At 0:14 you can hear it clearly:<br />
<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irbDH_Lkm-w&amp;feature=youtu.be<br />
<br />
What can I try?&nbsp; I already went through the audio troubleshooter to no avail.

            I would recommend that you should consider rolling back 1803 to 1709 and defer it from happening as their seem to be issues around audio in 1803 for certain audio drivers.
<br />
<br />Roll Back - Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Under Go back to previous version of Windows 10, Get Started &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />Defer it from happening - <a href="https://windows101tricks.com/delay-windows-10-fall-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows101tricks.com/delay-windows-10-f...</a>

            This is a bug because my notifications setting is on. However if you turn notifications off and then on again the minus sign disappears. It only happens after a cold startup but it is driving me crazy.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for your suggestion. Actually today I reset my PC. With nothing but Windows 10 installed, as soon as I shutdown and then cold-started the PC, there it was again. It must be something coming from Windows as when reset the PC had absolutely nothing
 installed on it except the operating system.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose to keep my documents and settings. So it could be due to something tied up with my outlook account which I use to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I do not have the option to create a new user as per suggestion above as it only allows me to create a new user with a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other option is to sign in with a local account which will probably make me loose all my access rights to my data located on another partition.

            <p>I believe that this is the Quiet Hours feature.&nbsp; However, something is wrong with it if I boot the computer cold at noon and it comes on and won't go off until I physically click on the setting button for Quite Hours.&nbsp; Right clicking the icon give the choices
 to go to Open Action Center or Turn on Quite Hours.&nbsp; As the icon is indicating after this cold boot, the Quite Hours are on and the right click menu is giving me a choice to turn them on.&nbsp; Setting the Quiet Hours to on at this point make no change to the icon,
 but then switching it to off allows the notification icon to appear normally without the Quite Hour change to the icon.</p>
<p>This is a bug.</p>
<p>There are no settings to change with regard to Quite Hours other than off or on.&nbsp; It is completely automatic other than that and shouldn't be coming on at any other time of the day other than 12am to 6am....but it clearly does.&nbsp; It also seemed to affect
 my ability to send and receive.&nbsp; Once I made the correction above everything worked as expected.</p>
<p>Please fix and before anyone offers a canned answer please read the issue through.&nbsp; We know what the notification icon does.</p>

<h2>            Aero peek not working</h2>
                    Aero peek is not working! When I put my mouse over the taskbar at the bottom of my computer it just shows the words and not the smaller window icon. When I go to taskbar properties it's gray and I can't enable or disable it. I've read a few of the other
 peoples questions on here and I wasn't aware that Office 2007 could be part of the problem. I have Office 2010 could that be the problem? This aero peek was one of the features that Windows bragged about and now it doesn't work? I'm not happy about this and
 no one seems to have a solution for it!!!! Why not???????? I want answers please.

<h2>            Extremely slow download speeds since 2 days</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know what's going on for 2 days now, My download speeds are extremely slow on xbox one. On pc everything is fine. I even contacted my ISP and they said that the problem is not on their end and they double checked for me (I have a family member who
 works there).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have assasin's creed unity and Dragon age inquisition pre-ordered. AC:U was downloading fine at full speed. But since 2 days the download speed is always 74.2 kb/s to 200 kb/s downloading about 300-400 mb per hour and that's very slow. Today I pre-order
 dragon age and it's the same thing...&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried all the trouble shooting I found from clearing persistent storage to hard reboot to shut down xbox one and unplugging cable to clear alternative mac adresse. Nothing worked, restarted router many times. I'm hard wired to the router and nat is open.
 No other device is leeching internet bandwidth. Please help!</p>

<p>Have you updated your graphics card drivers? &nbsp; Card manufacturers usually update their drivers to configure them to Windows 10. &nbsp; Go this site:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't know your driver, choose the option to automatically detect/install. &nbsp; If there is an option to do a Clean Install, choose this, as it will clean out any old drivers present before installing the new ones.</p>
<p>

<p>With laptops/notebooks it is recommended to download the custom driver provided by the mfg of the machine.<br />
Desktop PC's download from either AMD or Nvidia for dedicated graphics cards, but with Intel or AMD integrated graphics,

<p>download from the mfg of the motherboard.</p>

<h2>            Disabling &#34;Turn on convenience key PIN sign-in&#34; doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used gpedit.msc to update the computer's turn on convenience key PIN sign-on from "Not Configured" to "Disabled" but disabling it didn't work. I expected it to override all accounts' abilities to use pins. I tested that a user could still sign on with
 a pin. I even rebooted and verified setting was still "Disabled" when I logged back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a security problem because pins are easier to figure out than good passwords. I also figured out kids in the family are using this to get around family time limits by going into other peoples' accounts, so it isn't just hypothetical</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Expected behavior: Changing to "Disabled" prevents users from logging on with pin.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Actual behavior: Changing to "Disabled' has no effect.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I also don't want to remove pins for certain family members from the Microsoft account. I just want to disable it from being used on this computer.</span></p>

<h2>            why won&#39;t my windows 10 pc show any external drives, camera, ipad, external storage etc.</h2>
                    I can't find any external devices on my windows 10 laptop. When I plug in an ipad the iTunes program opens automatically but I can't find the ipad in the list of drives when I try to transfer pics and video. The same problem with my video camera, it doesn't
 show up on the list of drives. I have tried every usb port and everything works properly on my other computer running vista.

    <title>Can you get console banned for using a HDMI to VGA Converter on Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can you get console banned for using a HDMI to VGA Converter on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello I have an issue that I have tried to resolve by all other methods. My issue it looks like can only be solved by this method, the issue at hand is text and so forth is appearing off screen on my Hisense 40 Inch 40H3E  HDTV with a direct HDMI input from the console. My TV does not have any option other than the pre-sets to adjust the X &amp; Y axis of the screen ratio, I know the quality won't be as good, but at this point I don't care. At least to my knowledge I don't think I can since I am NOT modifying anything of the console or anything Microsoft/Xbox related. I want to be sure though. The reason why I am thinking this is the solution is, because my VGA port does in fact allow the X &amp; Y axis to be adjusted allowing me to fix the problem at a reduction in quality of course. Thank you for taking the time to respond to my question and helping me with my issue.</p>

<p>Hope this all helps!<br />

<p> 
 </p></blockquote><p /><p>Yeah that's why I was asking about this, as my HDMI ports have no way of changing this except through preset settings that do not work, but my VGA port does allow you to use a custom setting to adjust the aspect ratio. Anyways I did ended up buying one at Radioshack as none of my local stores sold any, and it works perfect, in some cases it feels and looks better than HDMI. If you are curious here is my HDTV name and model: Hisense 40H3E 40 Inch LED HDTV.      <br /></p>

<h2>            Unable to access other computers on network&#47;Homegroup</h2>
                    <p>I have been having an issue with accessing other computers on my network for a few weeks now; it's hit and miss and only from one computer to another. This one computer can never communicate with others, but can always be communicated with when the error
 occurs, but it has not been occurring all the time until this past week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to connect, I am prompted to run the network troubleshooter and apply a fix as an administrator for the "Windows sockets registry entries for network connectivity are missing" error. The automatic fix never works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every solution that has worked for others, no matter whether this forum, TechNet, or an external one, does not work for me. Even the most popular suggestion, ( http://www.kapilarya.com/windows-sockets-registry-entries-required-for-network-connectivity-is-missing
 ) does not work. At the end of their solution, I am met with another error: "Could not add the feature. The error is: This program is blocked by group policy."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know someone is going to tell me to search the forums again, to try things I've already tried or even have me troubleshoot from the beginning, but any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>a) No, a homegroup.<br />
b) No.<br />
c) Avast antivirus, and it was updated yesterday, but the problem has been occurring longer than that. No changes were made before the problem occurred.<br />
<br />
Method 1: What program? Explorer? I am trying to connect to another computer to view files.<br />
<br />
Method 2: Does not work. As a matter of fact, the change did not keep after reboot. I tried twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: It seems as though Windows 10 has a problem "remembering" settings. On a this laptop, the backup software has a reminder to make new recovery disks after upgrading to 10. I always check not to remind me, but it pops up on each reboot. Then this problem
 of the permission not remaining set. Also, on a different laptop, the option to "turn off my trackpad when an external pointing device is connected" would not stay enabled. Every reboot would turn on the trackpad again.</p>

<p>Altering the NSI key is only good until next reboot. I don't know if it's supposed to be like this or not. The only time I find it of use is under the request os using netsh or winsock reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still having issues, and the type of issues seem to change daily. Today, one computer can see itself and the other, but cannot connect to the other. The other computer can only see itself. Entering the location of the other computer from either computer
 will give me "Windows cannot access [computer]."</p>

<p>Can't join a Homegroup, either. There is already a Homegroup on the network, one I don't know the password to. This Homegroup was created by a computer several years ago and has been reformatted and upgraded several times since. All computers have, actually.
 The computers have left the Homegroup and when trying to create a new one, they still see the ghost.</p>

<p>So, as it stands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>One computer is a Toshiba P740 laptop. One is an HP laptop. One is an Alienware laptop. The Toshiba used to be called Toshiba and the user was Meg. She created the Homegroup, years ago. Everybody else has joined. Over time, everybody had been reformatted,
 reinstalled and has since upgraded to Windows 10. The Toshiba is now called P740 and has also joined the Homegroup while it was being held open by the other two laptops and the Toshiba was reformatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everybody has now LEFT this Homegroup. It still exists, somewhere. Each laptop sees the Homegroup as viable and the only option is to join it. Nobody can create a new one. I do not know which computer hosts the files and searching yields no results.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>What happens if you boot without any connections?&nbsp; If you still see this artifact it means that it is on your disk.&nbsp; Then ProcMon might help expose the implementation.&nbsp;</p>
