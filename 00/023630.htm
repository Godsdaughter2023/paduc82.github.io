<h2>            Email history completely gone from ALL folders when I logged into my outlook.com account this morning, why has it been upgraded&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I logged into my outlook.com account this morning ALL my email history from ALL my folders had disappeared (inbox, sent items, deleted, junk).&nbsp; There was a pop up message saying my account had been upgraded but I don't remember seeing anything about
 requested this or it being due to happen.&nbsp; Could this have caused the email box to have been disconnected from my account somewhere?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely DID NOT delete all the messages yesterday when I logged off, there were lots of them still there and I need them back asap as I have to print several of them off as evidence of the work I have been doing.&nbsp; Please advise what I should do next?</p>

            <p>Hi Cathy,</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The possible reasons why e-mails suddenly disappear.</span></strong><br />
<strong>1.</strong> Messages were manually deleted either due to accidental deletion or were moved or deleted due to your account filter settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Messages were deleted due to account compromise issues where a hacker might have gained access to your account and deleted the emails.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>You are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account.<br />
This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option “Always leave a copy of the message on the server” is not selected.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>The account was marked as “Inactive." Accounts become inactive if you don’t sign in via web browser at least once a year.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>If the feature Conversation Threading feature is turned on.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> If you use Sweep to schedule a cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>If you rename your</strong><strong> </strong><strong>account to @Outlook.com
</strong>a prompt would have asked you – ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account.</p>
<p><strong>8. </strong>Did you try to<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp; restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com?</a></strong>
</p>

            <p>Just to make it clear as you don't seem to have grasped what has happened here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I did not manually delete the messages, there were all still there when I logged off yesterday</p>
<p>2. I have checked the activity log and the only person who has logged in is me at the times in the log</p>
<p>3. I am not using spam filtering software</p>
<p>4. I last used the account yesterday, so it has not be inactive</p>
<p>5. Conversation Threading is not turned on</p>
<p>6. I do not use Sweep</p>
<p>7. The account was only set up a few weeks ago as an outlook.com account so has not been renamed</p>
<p>8. There is no option to restore deleted messages</p>
<p>9. I have been trying to contact customer support ALL day and am getting nowhere</p>
<p>10. I have also sent a support request</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting very frustrated with this as I need the messages back ASAP but ALL the folders are empty and there is a message in the inbox saying "Wow, you have a very clean inbox!" - well it wasn't yesterday and I have definitely NOT done anything to remove
 them so it must be something wrong with your system.</p>

            <p>No I don't have a backup of my&nbsp;Hotmail / outlook account.&nbsp; I've always just used it online, especially as I mainly access it from my phone when I am not using my laptop.</p>

            <p>As an update to this thread for info to others, I have still not got anywhere near finding my lost emails.&nbsp; I have had a few responses to my support request asking for screen prints and trace logs, they don't seem to know what is wrong&nbsp;but on the positive
 side&nbsp;they could see my emails were intact. It&nbsp;just seems to be me (ie. my account)&nbsp;that can't access them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told today the request has now&nbsp;been referred to a specialist, so I assume I won't hear anymore until next week.&nbsp; Just as well I've managed to compile enough info from other sources to hopefully meet my deadline of 26th on the work side, so hopefully
 I can relax and enjoy Christmas celebrations in the meantime.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

    <title>Visio 2016 Custom Line Ends - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio 2016 Custom Line Ends</h2>
                    <p>I am able to create a custom line end in Visio 2016 but when I look at the list of available line ends the one I created is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some feature it needs that I am setting incorrectly or not supplying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find documentation relative to this, i.e. why it would be greyed out or what feature is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need several of these for the diagram I am doing; the simplest being a half-arrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can suggest an approach, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>James Phillips</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen shot [1] below shows a line and a custom line ending I created, bg.ru. On the right are the formatting tools for the line. When I use the pick list on the right to select the custom line ending, it appears with no graphic, and the name is greyed out.
 The other built-in endings have a graphic that displays and their names are not greyed out. I am unable to take a screen shot of the pick list, as it disappears when I use the key combination to take the screen shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen shot [2] below shows the custom line ending bg.ru opened for editing. This is nothing special, and is not the shape I am trying to achieve; it is the simplest arrow I could think of while trying to get the feature to work.<br />
<br />
What I actually want to achieve is a set of 4 custom line endings for use in drawing bond graphs (a type of technical drawing). Two of the four are simply half-arrows, sometimes called harpoons; they are not centered on the line but lie entirely on one side.
 Two of these are required, one for one side and one for the other. Any tips related to achieving this specific result would be appreciated as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am entirely a novice with Visio, but not with drawing tools in general. I normally draw these diagrams using a LaTeX based package called IPE; I need to get this working so I can do some new diagrams in the format and using the tool my employer prefers.</p>

<h2>            Word - Mail Merge Formatting</h2>
                    In Mail Merge, how do I change the format of the date from 1/1/12 to January 1, 2012?

            On Mac, the suggestion Bob made is probably the easiest way to do this if the field is a { MERGEFIELD } and comes from an Excel sheet.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>But if that doen't work, another thing you can do is to modify the MERGEFIELD field that inserts the date.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To do that, you have to work out how to "reveal field codes" - could be Option-F9 or fn-Option-F9.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then look for your date field in your Mail Merge Main Document - e.g., it might be</div>
<div><br />
<div>{ MERGEFIELD mydate }</div>
<div><br />
<div>or you might even be talking about a { DATE } field</div>
<div><br />

            The simplest solution is to format the date field in the record list -- especially if it's an Excel worksheet. Otherwise, there's too little information to go on.<br />

<h2>            I have more than one Hotmail account&#59; Outlook seems to confusing them..why&#63;</h2>
                    I was in my main email account (I have 4 which were all linked together so that I could see any messages in my main one that I used constantly) . When I refreshed this morning, it suddenly changed to Outlook. When I selected Help on the menu and am taken
 to to the Help screen, the sign in name at the top right corner is another of my accounts, not the main one. Questions: &nbsp;Why was I suddenly changed to Outlook? &nbsp;How does this Outlook differ from the Outlook account that is already on my machine which came
 with Roadrunner and I never use? &nbsp;Why is the name at the top of the Help page not the same name as the account I was in when I selected Help?

<h2>            Publishing Calendar to the Internet...</h2>
                    I went through the steps to Publish my calendar from Outlook 2007 to the internet. I added my hotmail email as a user. Then I went to hotmail, and subscribed to that calendar, but it keeps saying
<span>This calendar hasn't yet been refreshed. Or before, it gave me an error that it couldn't connect. Now that error's gone, so I'm not sure what it said exactly. What I used to subscribe was the link from the email generated when I shared
<span>This calendar hasn't yet been refreshed. Or before, it gave me an error that it couldn't connect. Now that error's gone, so I'm not sure what it said exactly. What I used to subscribe was the link from the email generated when I shared
 it with my hotmail email:
<p><a href="https://calendars.office.microsoft.com/pubcalstorage/w8217g8z2413774/MY_Name_Calendar.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://calendars.office.microsoft.com/pubcalstorage/w8217g8z2413774/MY_Name_Calendar.htm</a>&nbsp;(I
 took my name out in this example). Did I do this incorrectly? Is there another way to share your Outlook 2007 calendar to Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line is I want to be able to log on anywhere (phone, in other locations etc) and see my outlook calendar. It says it's supposed to update frequently as well. Does this feature still work? When I click on the other link provided
 in that email: cal://calendars.office.microsoft.com/pubcalstorage/w8217g8z2413774/MY_NAME_Calendar.ics, It asks me to allow and if I do, it adds it right back into Outlook. This obviously isn't what I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when I click on the link that's supposed to give me access to my calendar on the web (above), it redirects me to this page telling me this feature doesn't work and I have to use it in a different calendar&nbsp;
 which I assumed hotmail would be:&nbsp; <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/manage-and-preview-calendars-published-with-the-outlook-calendar-publishing-service-HA010388759.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>You can't subscribe hotmail to private calendars - you need a 3rd party tool, like Outlook - that's why it opened in outlook. Update frequency is 1 hour - oh, and its read only, so you can't update it from your phone and have it sync back to outlook.
</p>
<p>You could use the hotmail connector and sync the calendar up to hotmail - you'll either need to set hotmail as default in outlook or copy your appointments to the hotmail calendar folder, but it will work better than publishing to the internet. It's 2-way
 so you can update from anywhere. </p>

            <p>OK, so when I use the Publish to Internet option in Outlook, what took on the web CAN I view it in? My phone is a Kin TwoM (Microsoft) which they stupidly didn't make so the calendar would synch w/their own Outlook or anything else. So my main goal is to
 be able to view my calendar from my phone - not necessarily add something back to it. The description of that Publish to Internet seems to make it so somewhere, somehow, you can view the calendar from cyber space no?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to have to use the hotmail connector - I had it before and it kept freezing Outlook up and I don't want to have to keep copying appts. over to it. I'd rather just publish it to some magical place where I can view it from a web browser of some
 sort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any solutions like that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Although Word Starter doesn't have the View tab, you should be able to select Outline view by clicking on the appropriate view icon on the right side of the status bar (just left of the Zoom settings). Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Alt, V, O</strong>.

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode does not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a free version of PST Email Recovery to scan and repair the Outlook PST file.&nbsp; No resolution achieved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem arose while Outlook was configured to an ISP I'll call&nbsp;<em>South.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I have been connected to South for many years and this error has never surfaced before.&nbsp; Speaking with a support member of South, we confirmed that my settings for the account
 in Outlook were correct.&nbsp; We also confirmed that I was able to send email from South's web-mail page.&nbsp; The support member concluded that because I could send email via the web-mail page that the problem was not his.&nbsp; He suggested I talk to Outlook support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added another account to Outlook, ISP&nbsp;<em>North</em><em>.&nbsp; </em>North has the same values as the configuration of the out going server (SMTP) of South.&nbsp; When I look to send email from North, there is no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While reviewing the entries of the Google search of my problem, I came across two that offered free&nbsp; &nbsp;downloads of programs that would resolve the problem.&nbsp; Both programs caused an alert from my Malwarebytes program.&nbsp; I did not pursue them any further.</p>

            I found a resolution to the problem.&nbsp; The problem was resolved after I left using the ISP&nbsp;<em>North</em>.&nbsp; &nbsp;My conclusion:&nbsp;<em>North</em> changed their rules toward using an outbound mail server that was not theirs.&nbsp; I was able to test that theory on several
 different ISP's while traveling.&nbsp; Each of the hotels used a different ISP and my choice of using&nbsp;<em>South</em> to send my email was not blocked nor did it generate any error messages.

                    I have several tasks in my list that are incomplete (0%), but are displayed grayed out &amp; with the line-thru font.&nbsp; Even when I cycle them from to complete &amp; back, they remain in the format.<br />
<br />
These are tasks that I had checked off from my iPhone, and the Exchange sync seems to have confused the tasks formatting.&nbsp; Tasks that I have not marked through my iPhone behave normally.<br />
<br />
How do I get the tasks to display normally when they are not complete?<br />

            <span>Issue could be due to sync with the mobile device.
<br />
1. Create new profile and configure the email account.<br />
2. Add few test entries and verify the result.<br />

    <title>Speeding Up Array Formulas - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Speeding Up Array Formulas</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a workbook which is about 6mb - but it contains lots of array formulas, dynamic named ranges, dynamic charts and drop down boxes which allow users to interact with the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything in it works - but it is incredibly slow!&nbsp; I have added macros so that when drop down selection are made it only recalculates the parts of the file it needs to, to refresh the data (rather than it all recalculating) - but it is still really slow
 and sometime it just hangs and doesnt refresh until I hit escape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it is difficult to judge without seeing the workbook (but I wouldnt be able to share it due to the data in contains), but are their any principles that I could apply to the model which might help me speed it up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatfully received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elizabeth.</p>

Maybe there is a different way of doing these formulas....but i have always just used nested ifs.</blockquote>
<br />
You might have done that in XL2003.&nbsp; But even in XL2003, you can avoid the array-entered formula by using SUMPRODUCT.&nbsp; For example:<br />
<br />
=SUMPRODUCT(('C-By Organisation by Test'!$B$1:$B$60000=O3)<br />
*('C-By Organisation by Test'!$D$1:$D$60000=R3)<br />
*('C-By Organisation by Test'!$AB$1:$AB$60000=S3),<br />
'C-By Organisation by Test'!$F$1:$F$60000)<br />
<br />
It is unclear whether that is more, less or equally efficient.&nbsp; But since array-entered formulas are error-prone (you might press just Enter and get some GIGO result), I try to avoid them.<br />
<br />
However, if XL2003 compatibility is not an issue, you can use SUMIFS in XL2007 and later.&nbsp; For example:<br />
<br />
=SUMIFS('C-By Organisation by Test'!$F$1:$F$60000,<br />
'C-By Organisation by Test'!$B$1:$B$60000, O3,<br />
'C-By Organisation by Test'!$D$1:$D$60000, R3,<br />
'C-By Organisation by Test'!$AB$1:$AB$60000, S3)<br />
<br />
That might be more efficient, especially if you have less than 60,000 rows of numeric data in column F.<br />

</blockquote>
<br />
<div>As mentioned, if you do not have to provide for Excel 97-2003 compatibility, converting that formula to SUMIFS() will greatly decrease the processing time. Something like,<br />
<br />
=SUMIFS('C-By Organisation by Test'!$F$1:$F$60000,'C-By Organisation by Test'!$AB$1:$AB$60000,S3,'C-By Organisation by Test'!$D$1:$D$60000,R3,'C-By Organisation by Test'!$B$1:$B$60000,O3)<br />
<br />
I ran some speed tests by re-arranging the high probability matches and the low probability matches in your SUM(IF(IF(IF()))) array formula and compared to an equivalent &nbsp;SUMPRODUCT(), and while the SUMPRODUCT() was marginally quicker on a regular basis, there
 was not enough of an appreciable difference to warrant reformulating an entire worksheet.<br />
<br />
Of course, reducing the rows 1:60000 as much as reasonably possible would also help.<br />

    <title>Turning off &#34;AutoSave&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turning off &#34;AutoSave&#34;</h2>
                    How do I disable the "AutoSave" feature that has recently started popping up on all of my office applications? It is messing up my documents. I have turned it off countless times, by using the switch at the top of the program, and it continues to turn
 itself back on again. It is causing me to lose data, and I'm constantly needing to go back and restore old copies of the documents.

            AutoSave only turns on when you save to Onedrive or SharePoint. If you save locally or to Dropbox, it will not turn on.<br /><br />The secret to using AutoSave is to save to Onedrive. When your Excel, Word, or PPT file is the way you want it, save manually and close the file. Open it back up, that "good" version is saved if you need to restore it.

            There is no option to disable AutoSave for all files, you will have to turn it off for every file independently.  
<br />
<br />Ill invite you to post your feedback on the following tread: <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general/suggestions/19082773-disable-the-new-autosave-by-default-as-it-can-lea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-g...</a>
<br />
<br />Also you can try to disable the autosave from Windows registry by creating a DWARD valu 1 named DONTAUTOSAVE
<br />
<br />
<br />Microsoft Word: 
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\DontAutoSave
<br />
<br />Microsoft Excel: 
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Excel\DontAutoSave
<br />
<br />Microsoft PowerPoint: 
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\PowerPoint\DontAutoSave
<br />
<br />The DWORD value of 1 disables AutoSave.
<br />
<br />If you willing to try from disable AutoAve from the registry ill suggest to doa  registry backup first

<p>I've tried disabling it from the registry in the past, and it did not work. I find it hard to believe that Microsoft would resort to having us hack the registry, just to disable a feature, that is destroying my files. No matter how many times I click that
 slider to turn the feature off, it turns right back on again the next time I open a file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at the point now, where I'm starting to lose business data, and someone needs to be held liable for that. I've never seen anything like this before, and constantly having to restore backed up copies of files, because they were saved over, without my
 permission, or hacking the registry, aren't options that I can continue with.</p>

            well in Excel i can access embedded pdf's after "enabling editing" but clearly there is something preventing me from doing this in word - even after enabling editing. I am using the security software that is built in to Windows 8

<p>I also cannot open pdf files when attached to emails.&nbsp; My surface pro 3 opens a screen that stays black. I can open them once they are saved, but I sometimes have problems saving them from an email&nbsp;also when there is just one pdf instead of many. The save&nbsp;option&nbsp;is

<h2>            How to update alias email id for an user using Graph API&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any possibility to update alias email Id for an user using Graph API in Office 365? As checked some reference regarding this I came cross that adding alias email is not supported in Graph API and can be achieved using Power Shell commands. Is this
 true or any possible way to achieve this using Graph API?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>kindly share your thoughts in this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Group chat messages don&#39;t update</h2>
                    <p>So, since yesterday one group chat simply refuses to update messages. It can only update if I set my status to offline and then online again. I tried to following things before posting here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Updating Skype to the newest version.</p>
<p>- Using skype web (I have to refresh the page for the messages in the group chat to update)</p>
<p>- Using Skype for Windows 10. (Doesn't work)</p>
<p>- Reinstalling Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Restarting my laptop several times.</p>
<p>- Changing to a different Wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works on mobile, but it doesn't update on my laptop. I'm part of like 4-5 active group chats, all of those update new messages but only of them doesn't which is really frustrating. And yes, I can send messages to the group but I won't receive any..&nbsp;</p>

            The first step is to make sure your account with your network operator has to be enabled to send MMS messages.<br />
<br />
Once enabled, you would then go into the messages menu and when you create a new message, the phone should ask you whether you want to create a SMS (text) or MMS (picture) message - just choose the latter !<br />
<br />
I haven't used my 6230 for over a year, but if I remember correctly I think you can also do this from within the Gallery if you have a picture selected - but don't hold me to this !

            Hi james1<br />
<br />
Did you get an SMS from network provider with settings, it was probably in two parts to save?<br />
<br />
You can also get settings from Nokia:<br />
<br />

<br />
Bear in mind if brand new SIM that service for MMS or GPRS sometimes takes network 24-48 hours to activate.

            Hi<br />
Im experiencing the same problems. Followed the config settings as per my service provider and still nothing sending. Just keeps going to outbox to be sent. Also, am i right in thinking with the 6230i you can record videos but can't send them? About to throw
 the darn thing out the window!!!

Not sure about the videos because I've never tried it - hopefully when you get your MMS working you can give it a go and give us all some feedback :)<br />
<br />
As to the MMS issues you're having - I'd advise you to give your network provider another call and get them to talk through it with you on the phone and if possible test it whilst on the phone to them - although you shouldn't have to do this, essentially if
 you make a big enough nuisance of yourself someone will fix it for you :)

            Excel does not save individual sheets unless you specifically move or copy that sheet to a new workbook.&nbsp; Did you hide sheets? Try right-clicking on the sheet tab and choosing "Unhide" - if it is clickable, then there are one or more sheets hidden.&nbsp; If
 you deleted the worksheets and then saved the file, then you are out of luck unless you have a backup somewhere.

                    <p>I deleted IE 11 on a Windows 7 64-bit and cannot reinstall ANY IE verson. I get the following message very soon after trying to install IE:
</p>
<p>"&nbsp;Cannot find http:\go.microsoft.com/fwlink/'Linkid=299.204. Make sure you typed the name correctly and try again." What a stupid message - I am simply installing a MS product and I have NO control where it goes or what it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after removing IE (following the MS instructions), I cannot get it back. I have Firefox and Google Chrome installed, and Firefox is the default browser. Furthermore, when I feed that URL directly into the URL line on my Firefox browser, it cannot be
 found, so this error message is correct. So, what is going on with installing IE 11 on Windows 7 64 bit systems???</p>
<p>
</p><p>The product I am trying to install came from a MS site: IE11-Windows6.1-x64-en-us.exe. I have tried a few other install exe' (IE 10 as well as other IE 11 executeables), and they all get this error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I get around this and get IE reinstalled???</p>

<p>
</p><p>In fact, you have made multiple typos.&nbsp; Fix the typos to see that page.&nbsp; The link in the other thread you posted in is coded correctly and does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you also&nbsp;are making an incorrect assumption.&nbsp; It is not possible to uninstall IE.&nbsp; The most you can do&nbsp;in W7 is uninstall an update which brought you a higher level of IE.&nbsp; So, if you had IE11 you may have uninstalled an update for that which would
 then have put you back at whatever version of IE you had before you did that update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get an idea of what version of IE your OS is using go into Windows Features and read what it says for&nbsp; Internet Explorer there.&nbsp; Also, to get an idea of your maintenance level for your IE you can open an Administrator Command Prompt and there enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>fsutil&nbsp; hardlink&nbsp; list&nbsp; wininet.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various ways of capturing the output from that command.&nbsp; The most significant part of it is the version of module in WinSxS which is implied by its path.&nbsp; That shows you what you have applied, which may be different from what you think you have
 installed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically symptoms such as yours indicate something is blocking the application of security updates, often at a very old level.</p>

            <p>Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response, but you seem more concerned about typos than the issue at hand. First, you can remove IE, and I did it. Go see:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/install-ie#ie=ie-11-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/install-ie#ie=ie-11-win-7</a>. Next, There is NO iexplorer.exe on the computer at all (I did a global search) now since I ran thru the directives given at that site given here. I deleted IE, and now there
 is no IE anywhere on that system. If you need further proof, given me an email address so I can send you snap shots of the file structure and show you. All the desktop icons for IE were removed as well, as it should be when you delete an application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my problem is that no matter what version of IE I now try to install on that computer, they each run into the Linkid error, each version with a different error code. So, unless I can get a real answer from MS or someone who knows how to resolve this,
 I may have to reinstall Windows just to get IE back. And that is a big task!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please continue reading my post.&nbsp; (You seem to have stopped after the first two sentences.)&nbsp; This would be explained by finding that Internet Explorer (at whatever version is currently installed) was unchecked.&nbsp; Unchecking it merely hides iexplore.exe and
 its shortcuts, as you have observed.&nbsp; Then checking it would re-enable iexplore.exe and its shortcuts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of whether you have iexplore.exe (a stub program) you always have whatever modules are provided with it to give&nbsp;your OS&nbsp;its designated level of browser support.&nbsp; Hence my suggestion to use wininet.dll to find out what patch level it is at (as
 an example of many which could be checked for the same reason).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>If your case runs the way previous ones like it have, that very well may be the case.&nbsp; However, there is always a possibility that by digging deeply enough into the details that you may be able to patch it back into life.&nbsp; E.g. running&nbsp; CheckSUR would probably
 be the next repair/diagnostic step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for another response. I have not tried your command yet, but I am now. But please keep in mind, I am not a junior user. I have been in the computer business since it started, and my business is supporting many customers. I use Total Commander
 for my file manager, and I see ALL files, and there is NO iexplorer.exe anywhere. In fact, the folder that contains IE&nbsp;is essentially empty. IE is really gone. On my other computer, the IE folder is full, and it includes iexplorer.exe.&nbsp;Did you look at the
 link I sent you about removing IE? Because it is really gone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your command, and nothing happens at all when I attempt to execute it in the Star command box, unless I open up a DOS command window. When I execute the command there, I get a very strange response. Then, when I execute the wininet.dll file directly,
 it asks to find what app to run, and of course iexplorer is not found in the list, but the 'Internet Explorer' folder does show up when I tell it to search further. And since that folder is essentially empty, it cannot be run. The wininet.dll file is about
 the same size as the normail iexplorer.exe (IE is 814K on another Wndows 7 computer). This is not a stub program!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the facts remain that IE is truly gone. The question is why are all the downloaded internet explorer files from the MS sites looking and going to web pages that are not there online??? This is why the&nbsp; installs are falling, and it does not matter if
 I try to install any of the various versions of IE 11, or even&nbsp;IE 10, or even IE 9. I get different Linkid error codes with the different IE version levels. They all have a link to a web page that does not exist! This is really very poor on Mircosoft's part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The response I got from your command does not show any system or IE levels. The only part of it I can extract that may be of any value is ...0.0.7601.17514_none...</p>

    <title>Scheduling execution of mpcmdrun.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajsrockstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scheduling execution of mpcmdrun.exe</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I'm running on a metered internet connection so I'm trying to move as many download tasks as possible to my off-peak hours of 2 a.m. to 8a.m during which time I get a bigger data allowance. I've managed to do this successfully for most things but when I
 check in my network traffic monitor (Glasswire) I still frequently see the program mpcmdrun.exe has started up and downloads about 30Mb of data. OK, so 30Mb of data doesn't sound such a big deal but if it does that daily that's close to a Gb per month out
 of my peak-time monthly allowance of 10Gb, so moving it to the off-peak period is worth doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glasswire identifies mpcmdrun.exe as Microsoft Malware Protection Command Line Utility which I understand is part of Windows Defender. Unfortunately Glasswire doesn't show the execution parameters when mpcmdrun.exe is run so I can't be sure what it is doing
 but am assuming it is downloading virus signature updates because the download size is consistently around 30mb each time and I imagine the size would be more variable if it was downloading updates to programs. Plus I would think it unlikely that program updates
 would be downloaded every day but that is quite feasible for virus signatures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a group policy which allows me to specify the time window for downloading signature updates, but enabling that and setting the appropriate times&nbsp; does not stop mpcmdrun.exe running when I don't want it to. I also created a scheduled task to run mpcmdrun.exe
 during my off-peak hours - that worked fine but again, the program still ran of its own accord during peak hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a couple of questions: if mpcmdrun.exe is not updating virus signatures what else could it be downloading? And how can I prevent it running during my peak time (I don't want to stop it, I just want to shift when it runs)?</p>

<p><span>These are definition updates, and the command line parameters appear in the Windows &gt; Temp &gt; MpCmdRun.log file. So far, I’ve only tried scheduling updates with the PowerShell Set-MpPreference cmdlet, which takes the place of Group Policy in the Home
 edition of Windows 10, but which works interactively with Group Policy in the managed editions. So I’m not sure that the automatically generated update checks can actually be turned off with the Set-MpPreference cmdlet, although the documentation seems to
 hint at that possibility. </span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>To set up my scheduled update, I ran these commands at the Administrator PowerShell prompt:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">Set-MpPreference -SignatureScheduleDay 0</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">Set-MpPreference -SignatureScheduleTime 10:20</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>(The interpreter doesn’t seem to accept minutes after midnight)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">RandomizeScheduleTaskTimes $False</span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This adds a <strong>Windows Defender Update</strong> task to the Windows Defender folder in Task Scheduler – but this task appears to run with the usual Automatic Maintenance only-on-idle priority, and it isn’t starting the update at the scheduled
 time. Adding a trigger to the task might help, but I’m afraid that you might have to depend on your independent user-scheduled update task to keep the updates running on time. And then the next step would be to try managing the automatically generated update
 checks with the <span>-SignatureFirstAuGracePeriod and </span>-<span>SignatureUpdateCatchupInterval parameters.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>-SignatureFirstAuGracePeriod</span></span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Specifies a grace period, in minutes, for the definition. If a definition successfully updates within this period, Windows Defender abandons any service initiated updates. This parameter overrides the value of the
<strong>CheckForSignaturesBeforeRunningScan</strong> parameter.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>-SignatureUpdateCatchupInterval</span></span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Specifies the number of days after which Windows Defender requires a catch-up definition update. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, Windows Defender requires a catch-up definition update after the default
 value of one day.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example, you might try setting both of these intervals to 2 days:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Set-MpPreference -SignatureUpdateCatchupInterval 2</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">Set-MpPreference -</span><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">SignatureFirstAuGracePeriod 2880</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is probably a long shot – because the documentation is still pretty fuzzy here, and also because some of these parameters just don’t seem to work the way they’re supposed to.

<h2>            Is there a non-cloud way to sync Windows Phone 7 with Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    Dear Forum,<br />
<br />
I am looking for a way to sync Windows Phone directly to Outlook.&nbsp; I store all my contacts in Outlook, my todo list is in Outlook, all my appointments are in Outlook.&nbsp; I just do not want to put all this information in the cloud, where it will create a permanent
 unerasable record of my life.<br />
<br />
My HTC Tilt 2 has served me well over the past two years and I would much prefer to stay with the Windows Platform if I can help it.&nbsp; I looked at a few Windows Phones in the store and I like them, especially the Lumia.<br />
<br />
A solution I am looking for should support sync of Outlook contacts, calendar, and tasks.&nbsp; It needs to support categories and allow me to add notes to my contacts and appointments.<br />
<br />
If possible, lets not turn this into a debate over cloud use.&nbsp; There are plenty of other places on the Internet to hold this debate.&nbsp; I am simply looking for a solution.&nbsp; If it helps, I am using Outlook 2007 and considering Lumia 900 as my phone.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Fred<br />

            <p>The only option is this 3rd party software that you can buy.&nbsp; I have never used this software so cannot vouch for it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will never get categories synced to windows phone because windows phone dies not support categories at all...there is no categories field in contacts, appointments or tasks and no way to search or work with categories.</p>
