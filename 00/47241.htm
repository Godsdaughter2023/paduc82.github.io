            After you install an operating system you must then install drivers for all your hardware. This includes the motherboard (chipset) drivers which cover the SMB Bus and the sound, etc. Since you have a Dell, get the drivers from Dell's tech support site
 for your specific model computer. Put in your Service Tag on the site to get the right ones.

    <title>screen time limits - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brookepillow  say:</h3>
<h2>            screen time limits</h2>
                    I set screen time limits for my son and he said a message just pops up when screen time is up saying "do you want more screen time?" and he just says yes!&nbsp; That's ridiculous.&nbsp; Why would I set limits if it was so easy for him to change them?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a "child", I have experience with screen time limits, amongst other things. When he clicks yes, it should come up with an admin account username, the picture and asking for it's password. Maybe your son's on an administrator account? If he is, set that
 to a child account and it should help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think screen time limits are a waste, I always find ways to circumvent them. I.E F-Secure Safe's time limit, I just need to swipe my screen and delete it from the open programs, Kaspersky, I can just turn it off and on without using the administrator
 password that it requires with relative ease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message of that is to not put all your trust in technology, they can and probably will fail you at least one time in your life time, unless you don't use it, that is. Keep an eye on what he's doing when possible, perhaps that's a better alternative.
 If you know abit of coding, perhaps make an application that runs at certain times and blocks the shift key's usage (though if they have touch screen on the device, they'll be able to get out of that) and takes the whole screen up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps a better alternative, one that my dad uses, is that 15 minutes after the set time limit, my internet goes off, however, my WiFi stays intact, so if I'm on an application that would require internet to load and WiFi to stay up, for example, the popular
 games such as Roblox and Minecraft, then it'll still work, as long as it doesn't need to take any information that requires internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helped!</p>

<p>That is the most informative error message you'll ever see in Windows Live Mail. There are very few public mail servers that support Secure Password Authentication, and Hotmail is not one of them. The only piece of information you're missing is which logon
 option to select: you want <em>clear text authentication</em>.</p>

            <p>I have always had Hotmail setup in Windows Live &amp; it always worked in the past but here lately its going "Haywire".&nbsp; I originally had the Account within Windows lIve setup
</p>
<p>by an Execute file Microsoft offered a while back it setup everything, but these Hotmail Account settings doesn't use a POP3 settings it uses an HTTP here is what it has for the Server URL:
<a href="https://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/sync.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/sync.aspx</a>, there is no option what so ever in Properties for SSL it only has 3 tabs General, Server Security.</p>
<p>So after the issue arose trying to download email or send thru Hotmail account in Live</p>
<p>I tried setting a new account in Live using POP3 Settings with /without SSL but that one would never connect &amp; get or send email period , these were the setings in that account: Mail Server (POP3) - pop3.live.com (logon using Secure Password Authentification
 - SPA, mail server port: 995) </p>
<p>Hotmail Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) - smtp.live.com (TLS enabled, port 587) &amp; I tried these also:
</p>
<table>

<h2>            Cannot merge C drive &#40;disk 0&#41; with unallocated space &#40;on disk 1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some advice on whether it is possible - and if yes, how to merge my C drive on disk 0 with D drive on disk 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is: my C drive is getting full soon, but previously after I deleted D drive and make it unallocated space (the bar of current D drive will change to black from blue), I still cannot expand C drive by adding the 100GB unallocated space into it.
 If I right click on C drive, the "expand" item is in gray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched online for solutions but so far only have seen same questions around. Does any one know the solution and do a big favor to explain how to do it step by step?&nbsp;Thanks much in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S, sorry that the interface is not in English. Below page shows the "Disk Management" function, and you can see that:</p>
<p>1) Disk 0 has 55.78G, including C drive (55.21GB), 100MB of something I don't know what it is, and 473MB of recovery zone</p>
<p>2) Disk 1 has 100GB D drive, and 831.51GB E drive</p>

            <p>You cannot combine space from two separate physical disks. You have two choices:</p>
<p>1. Replace your C drive (disk 0) with a larger disk, or</p>
<p>2. Move some of the files from the C drive to a D drive on disk 1. Be very careful moving files from C to D; moving the wrong files can render your PC inoperable.</p>

</p><p>2. However, my current C+D+E total size is only 986GB - which means they are all part of the 1000GB hard disk? I do remember that when I just got this laptop, I used the Win10 partition editor to split my 1TB hard drive into C/D/E. That's why I don't understand
 why disk 0 and disk 1 here are two different hard disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. So where is the 60GB SSD "hiding" and why the 60GB is not shown in the picture of my first post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much!!</p>
<p>Gia</p>

            <p>You cannot add unallocated space from one disk to another disk unless you convert the basic disk to dynamic disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual hard disk space you can use is roughly 7% less than what manufacturers advertise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>60GB=55.78GB</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that your desktop has suddenly developed runway processes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check. Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you don’t receive the error message in safe mode, I suggest you to perform <strong>
clean boot</strong> and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://mail.agent.cvgs.net/owa/redir.aspx?C=b4GN3-2XIk6wBOn12ogaAZWNuGrgONIIXgTTbLzaD6JTtCXZV0bwPkHgv-9759MR-Qvd7c-ekm0.&amp;URL=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fkb%2f929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You
 may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform
 a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section <strong>“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong> and check if that helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the Microsoft Help Article and given below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/sysreq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/sysreq.aspx</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <span>
Data or files which are infected by malware might be beyond cleaning and have to be deleted entirely to maintain the integrity of your system, which means there might be a potential for data loss.

<p>Safe mode is no help. Clean boot (again) is no help. Problem still exists in both cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only new installs were Adobe reader and Flash. Removed. No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Dell diag. Nada. Ran Malicious Software removal. No change. Is there a difference between that and MS Safety Scanner?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also restored to earliest point possible. No change.</p>

            <p>I have found the enemy and it is us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, sort of. A <strong>Microsoft "optional" update interferes with McAfee</strong>.</p>
<p>One of these updates: KB3065979, KB3064209, KB3040272</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the last one. I deleted the first two and rebooted. The real time scanner on McAfee Security V13.6 kept turning off. (w/i 2 sec.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted 0272 and rebooted. No problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps MS and McAfee need to talk!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned it’s the optional updates is creating conflicts with some third party programs or the security software program installed on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>install the updates in clean boot state</strong> and check if that helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or
 troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</p>

            <p>How about <strong>1</strong>) I do not install the optional updates and <strong>
2</strong>) McAfee works with MS to solve this. In 25 years of IT, I have never had this kind of conflict and feel sorry for those with less knowledge. Big unnecessary repair fix probably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are MS and McAfee following certain cable companies in the "I don't care" area?</p>

<h2>            Virus blocks system folder, recovery point, Windows defender </h2>
                    I have a virus that blocks access to my SYSTEM files, Windows Defender and maybe even Windows Support. For some reason when i give Windows permission to check my system for my Product key and ID it can't access. Both Malware bytes and AVG didn't find anything.
 Malware i ran in safe mode. AVG was not available in the save mode. Defender doesnt open. IE and Windows explorer are constantly stopping and giving errors too.
<p>My system is Vista Home Premium, service pack 1, last changes i made is language dutch to english. This week i removed a very annoying taskbar called Babylon from my computer which seemed like malware to me too. All traces of this have been gone. What to
 do next. I've tried everything i can think of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options (except
 the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In case it isn't a virus (or maybe it's damage caused by the original virus), let's do some general troubleshooting to try to find and resolve
 the problems.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work (the procedures may vary slightly with the disk but if you follow the prompts and with the above information you should be able to get through it
 just fine).<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32.<span>&nbsp; </span>Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption
 post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or
 typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data,
 settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had
 to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></p>

    <title>windows 8 app store. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fardinhoque  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8 app store.</h2>
                    <p>hello guys, I am having problem with the windows 8 app store and the tiles. first of all:</p>
<p>1. I'm using a screen resolution of 1366*768</p>
<p>2. My laptop has around 220 Gb of hard disk left</p>
<p>3. I've already tried this method: windows button+R and then typing wsreset.exe. Nothing happened, a message came showing that the app store cache is cleared and I can now browse the app store... But The screen remains blank(white)..and after a few mins
 it again starts to load...</p>
<p>4. I have high speed internet, so I don't think it's caused due to my internet connections.</p>
<p>I need your help guys.... and one more thing...when the app store was oppening...it was not installing any updates for the apps,it was simply showing pending and after a few mins it showed- couldn't install the update. My windows 8 copy is legit and not
 pirated and it came pre installed on my laptop.</p>
<p>Thank You in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Fardin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us&nbsp;updated on the status and we appreciate your patience on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the Windows App Store is not working. Additionally, clearing the Store cache didn't help to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, kindly check if the <strong>Windows Date and Time</strong> is set to
<strong>Automatic</strong> and correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try&nbsp;to use the following command line in the Command prompt window and see if it helps to re-register the Store App and rectify it.</p>
<p><span><strong>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.XML</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above recommendation fails to fix the issue, there may be a chance that there is an issue with the system integrity. I would recommend you to employ the
<strong>System File Checker</strong> and see if it fixes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Ref</strong>: <span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93<br />

    <title>Popup Dialog Box Enabling For Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackh24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Popup Dialog Box Enabling For Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Okay so when I plug my headphones into the audio jack, the speakers play. I used to use headphones, and they worked amazingly with my computer. But they broke, and I got a new pair. The new headphones work fine. I listen to music with them on my phone. So
 do you know the little box that pops up when you plug something into the audio jack? (I'm using a laptop), well I turned that off a long time ago because I thought that was a pain. So I feel like that has something to do with the problem. I feel like my computer
 is reading it as a communication device. Does anyone know how to re-enable it? I'm on Windows 10.</p>

            Hi Jack.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Plug in the headphones, right click the Volume icon in system tray at right end of task bar, open Playback Devices, if headphones aren't listed right click an empty area to choose Hidden Devices.  Right click on headphones to Set as Default, configure and Test.  
<br />
<br />If the headphones don't show up or won't play then run the Playback Troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />You said you changed some settings earlier, so this might point to the Sound driver software. I'd look for it in All Apps list to open and go over settings to try to find the one you changed, or reset all sound settings to default.
<br />
<br /> If not  I would uninstall it in Settings&gt;Apps and Device Manager.  Then download and install the latest sound driver software for your model PC or device from the PC's Support Downloads webpage and install it fresh to reset all settings to default. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hey Greg, thanks for the reply. I opened Playback Devices and my headphones were not listed anywhere. Only thing I saw was the realtek speakers. I got confused when you said "click an area to choose Hidden Devices. Right click on headphones to Set as Default,
 configure and Test." I right clicked the white area, and all I saw was something about disconnected devices. I left clicked the white area, but nothing happened. (I don't really know that much about computers so working with me may be difficult, apologies
 in advance.) I also tried doing the Windows troubleshoot thing. That got me very confused. I went to Update &amp; Security, and then troubleshoot, and troubleshooted audio. I eventually got to some part where sound was coming from my speakers, so I just closed
 that. If you could expand upon the Playback Devices part, I think that will help with the problem. Again, thank you for the reply.</p>

            HI again Jack --
<br />
<br />The Troubleshooter should have showed you what it's doing while it ran.  You said you heard sounds but were you watching the progress?  Try it again.
<br />
<br />When you open Playback devices panel if the headphones aren't showing you can right click an empty area to try to get them to show.  If that doesn't work then they are not being detected there.  
<br />
<br />Next right click Start to open Device Manager.  Do you see the headphones under Sound, Audio outputs, etc?  If so and you click on the device what does it say about it's condition?  If nothing is there then click on the Sound device, on Driver tab choose Uninstall.  Restart PC to reinstall it.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot get the headphones to show up then I'd reinstall the Sound software from the PC's Support Downloads webpage to have the latest and set it back to defaults as a fresh install.  
<br />
<br />Do you remember at all what setting you changed and where?  Try to retrace your steps.  This may have caused the problem.

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failure to use the wireless mouse after the recent update can be due to an outdated driver. As an initial step to ensure that your devices are configured properly, we suggest that you download and install the appropriate driver for your Arc Mouse. To do
 this, click this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/d/arc-mouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>, select the edition of your Windows device under the <strong>Software &amp; Drivers</strong> list, and then click the link to start the download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

<h2>            Working Week in Windows 10 Calendar app</h2>
                    <p>The Calendar app in Windows 10 includes a setting to specify the days in a working week. As far as I can tell, I can only untick days from the beginning or the end. I can't specify a part-time week working just Wednesdays and Fridays, as I do. Is that correct,
 or am I missin from something obvious?</p>

<h2>            Organizing Windows 10&#8217;s Start Menu Folders and Icons to Customize the Start Menu</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello!<span>&nbsp;
</span>This post is related to <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-winpc/organising-the-all-apps-menu/1e004070-0840-4d60-b9a0-b972dad64edc">
Organising the All Apps Menu?</a> of a couple years ago.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have built PC running Windows 7 for years and have been organizing the shortcuts in both Start Many locations (user-specific, all users) to my heart’s content, getting the Windows 7
 Start Menu on screen to look just the way I wanted it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I installed Windows 10 Pro on a new PC a few days ago and began organizing the Start Menu &gt; Programs folders and icons as always, but the changes are not reflected when I hit the Windows

<p>Thanks for the update Dave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that getting an access to a system folder will affect your Start menu folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried replicating the issue on my end and was able to produce my desired Start menu folders. However, what I found out is (1) empty folders will not appear on the Start menu and (2) folders containing the same content/program will invalidate the program
 itself and will not appear at all. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Folder 1 contains: Word 2016</em></p>
<em>Folder 2 contains: Word 2016</em>
<p>
</p><p>In this instance, Both folders will not appear in the Start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Folder 1 contains: Word 2016 and Excel 2016</em></p>
<p><em>Folder 2 contains: Word 2016</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Start menu will show Folder 1 containing Excel 2016, while Folder 2 won't appear at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Adrianne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's me again!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I wrote a script for me to follow for the Monitoring phase of Feedback and gave it a dry run:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First I ensure there are no IE shortcuts in either C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs (main) or C:\Users\dmcke\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs (user).&nbsp; I do this by searching in those folders in File Manager on
 the shortcut name “Internet Explorer” and on “iexplorer”.&nbsp; Just to be safe I deleted the shortcut on the Desktop I had placed there.<br />
<br />
2. Next I find the executable for IE in C:\Program Files\internet explorer and create a shortcut for it.&nbsp; I accept creating the shortcut on the Desktop.&nbsp; I verify that the shortcut is in fact on the Desktop.<br />
<br />
3. I then find the shortcut on the Desktop in File Manager and move it to Programs in the main Start folder. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
4. After that I pop up the Start Menu, and, voila, <del>no IE shortcut</del>! &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>NO!</strong>&nbsp; The shortcut was <strong>there</strong>.&nbsp; Right on top in the "I"s of the Start Menu.&nbsp; I moved it into a folder I had created and it was still visible when I dropped down the "v" folder open icon.&nbsp; I created a Shortcut Key for it, installed
 the special plugin in IE that was the point of all this, and it looks like I’m in business.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm bewildered, but I'll take it!&nbsp; Thanks again!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Dave</p>

Most of these cheats have been a problem for years so there is no way complaints for cheating are investigated.</p><p><br /></p><p>You are basically saying that this is not Microsoft's problem, which just shows the attitude of Microsoft towards its customers.

                    My pen hasn't been working for weeks now. I don't know how or when, but it doesn't show up under bluetooth devices in my settings. I've tried switching the battery out, yet nothing. I attempted to swap the pen nibs. I even tried pressing the buttons, holding
 them down, repeatedly pushing them, etc... and still nothing worked. All that is visible is a yellow blinking light on the top piece of the stylus. I've tried looking up what this means and how to fix the problem, but I've only found results for orange and
 red blinking lights. There's nothing more I can think of, and I can't find a solution. Please help.

            This (unfortunately) sounds like a hardware problem with the pen. If you are in the US, the best thing to do is go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations...</a> and they should assist (and exchange under warranty). If you are outside the US, you will need to call support <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405170...</a> - to get through to them, you will need to probably use the serial number for your Surface Pro (and you may have to ask for a supervisor). Then explain the issue and ask for a warranty exchange (be firm and persistent - you may need to call twice to get an agent that understands the issue, especially on weekends).
<br />
<br />I'm sorry you are having this issue. I hope this helps. If it was of assistance, please DO mark as Answer.

            <p>SafeSearch settings can be accessed through App Settings / SafeSearch in Bing.</p>
<p>SafeSearch settings (and any actions taken within SafeSearch) are NOT shared with the bing.com experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, you can have SafeSearch within
 the app set to <b>OFF</b>, but have the same feature set to <b>
Moderate</b> for the bing.com experience.&nbsp; In other words, these settings are not shared across app &amp; bing.com experience.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update caused my laptop to crash &#40;blue screen&#41; with Error&#58; DPC_WatchDog_Violation</h2>
                    <p>Hi Windows Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my Lenovo Z570 Ideapad laptop. This laptop has been with me for 5 years and came with Windows 7. When Microsoft released Windows 10 I upgraded the OS. Everything was working well till three days ago when Windows asked me to upgrade
 my version of Windows 10 to an updated one. Everything went smoothly and left my laptop to update itself overnight. When it was done I shut down the laptop. The following day Microsoft wanted to update the Apps in my laptop. I did so, however, I noticed that
 the update froze. I immediately forced shut down the laptop by holding down the power button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows booted up but all of sudden a blue screen appeared with an Error: DPC_WatchDog_Violation. &nbsp;I went to Safe Mode to try and troubleshoot the system. I used the 'reset PC' option because I want to keep my files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do make a copy of my files in my laptop if I cannot boot Windows? Is there a possibility I can copy the files via 'Safe Mode'? How can I reinstall Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help is much appreciated.</p>

            <p><strong><em>How do make a copy of my files in my laptop if I cannot boot Windows?
</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>An inexpensive solution is to purchase an external USB 2.5" sata enclosure. You remove the drive from the laptop and place the drive in the enclosure and connect to a USB port of a working computer.
 You need a 3.5" enclosure for a drive from a desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Providing the drive has not “failed” connecting to another computer enables you to read, write to, and copy from the drive. You can scan the drive using the security software installed on the second
 computer. If the hard drive has failed then it does not work. You cannot boot the operating system installed on the drive in the enclosure.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Enclosures are reusable and can be used to provide additional external storage for any computer, where you have a discarded drive which worked, but was too small for further use in its existing location.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An illustration of an external enclosure is provided in the link below:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/2-5-Sata-eSata-External-Enclosure/dp/B000S89NQG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.amazon.co.uk/2-5-Sata-eSata-External-Enclosure/dp/B000S89NQG</span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is a cheaper alternative:</span></p>

</p><p>Thanks for your help and I will be buying an external&nbsp;SATA 2.5 to salvage all my files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the laptop is fully restored to all Microsoft Windows 10 defaults. I noticed that if I want to connect &nbsp;to my WIFI connection it freezes. Any solution to that?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Also, since the laptop is quite old do I need to update the BIOS?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check all the cables on both ends - mainly video.<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out the dust bunnies and make sure the vents are clear.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
After the above you can repeatedly tap F8 as you boot - Last Known Good Configuration.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>I am curious about same process - uploading a training video I own to my computer.&nbsp; Above process is not working for me - have there been updates to Windows 10 to make this process easier?&nbsp; When I insert the DVD- a video player (VLC video player since no
 Windows video player in Windows 10!) starts playing the video immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I click on the "dvd:///E:\" it just keeps bringing up the video that is already on the screen.&nbsp; Where do I go to click on just the "E drive" in (E drive is drive I put video in
 to play in this case)?&nbsp; If&nbsp; I left click - video screen keeps opening.&nbsp; If I right click, I can choose from VLC player, PIN it or task bar.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Inside the video player - task bar at top of screen:&nbsp; Media, Playback, Audio, Video, subtitles, tools, view and help&nbsp; - none of these choices seem to offer content of files for the video.&nbsp; Except maybe something under "Media" called, "Capture Device."&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
 I didn't know what to do when I opened Capture Device and box popped up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any better advice?</p>

<p>Hi - the tutor in this youtube clip (link below)&nbsp;is using a Mac but the folders should look similar when you open
<strong>This PC&nbsp;- DVD/CD drive </strong>with the disc inserted... It may be that the dvd is created in such a way that you cannot access the files... try a few more youtube Vids if that's the case... update if still no joy... Ric.</p>
