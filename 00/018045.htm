            if the problem is with the phone memory, then try deleting any ringtones/wallpapers/other files etc that are contained within the Gallery (i.e. phone memory folders). the message should then go away. if you do not want to delete, then move those files
 to the memory card. if you are unable to get into the Gallery folder, connect your phone to a PC and use nokia pc suite to transfer the data to your phone and clear memory that way

            <p>I received my new links for Office 2016 Professional through the HUP program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After receiving it appears it's Click-to-Run which means that is NO way to slim down the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't understand&nbsp;why&nbsp;Microsoft would think that everyone, or the majority of HUP users would want to install the entire suite. I can understand it is far easier for Microsoft to this, but puts their customers at risk of installing applications they may
 never use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The help desk is completely inept it even trying to resolve this, getting shuffled from department to department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to use my RETAIL version of Office Pro 2013 with my Office Pro 2013 HUP key, but that is not working with my RETAIL version of Office 2016, and my Office Pro&nbsp;2016 HUP key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to install office pro 2016 on D:/ drive,&nbsp;or&nbsp;ONLY install Word, Excel, and Outlook on my C:/ drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I'm not sure of is will the ISO provided by Microsoft at $15.95 allow me to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install on a non C partition</li><li>Install individual programs</li></ul>
<p>Can I use the "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 2016 Deployment Tool</a>"? This appears to be the solution but there is no way to use this on the links sent for installing Office
 Professional 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there as download link for the ISO for Office Pro 2016 that is for the HUP?</p>

    <title>Cannot Attach a File to Email in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grantlandhammond  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Attach a File to Email in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Versions of this question have been answered in years past, but this one is a little unique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Outlook 2010 on Windows 7, but I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and then reverted back to Windows 7 because I hated the new OS for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every since I returned to Windows 7, I cannot attach a file of any kind or any size to a new email, reply email or forward email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted this in Safe Mode and still the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Silver Light is not installed as an add in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create an email, the "Attach File" paperclip is visible. I click on it and proceed to add a PDF. It allows me to select the PDF (or JPG or whatever file), but nothing actually attaches to the email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Refreshing query changes cell references on a different worksheet that - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> will pietkewicz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refreshing query changes cell references on a different worksheet that refer back to query worksheet. Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Worksheet "Sheet_A" contains a query table positoned at cell A1. The top row contains column headings &amp; the&nbsp;data, of course,&nbsp;begins in cell A2.</p>
<p>Worksheet "Ref_Sheet" contains numerous references to cells on "Sheet_A".</p>
<p>I created all references in <strong><em><u>row 2</u> of "Ref_Sheet"</em></strong> pointing to cells on
<strong><em><u>row 2</u> of "Sheet_A"</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I then "Filled Down" from row 2 to row 600 on "Ref_Sheet" so that <strong><em>each row on "Ref_Sheet"</em></strong> contains references to the
<strong><em>same row number on "Sheet_A"</em></strong>.</p>
<p>When I refresh the query on "Sheet_A" it pulls in 4 records, rows 2 - 5.</p>
<p>All references on <strong><em><u>row 2</u> of&nbsp; "Ref_Sheet"</em></strong> now refer to
<strong><em><u>row 5</u> of "Sheet_A", </em></strong>all references on <strong><em><u>row&nbsp;3
</u>of&nbsp; "Ref_Sheet"</em></strong> now refer to <strong><em><u>row 6</u> of "Sheet_A"</em></strong>, etc.</p>
<p>In all, I have 9 queries on 9 separate sheets and 9 other "reference" sheets, each referencing cells from a different query sheet.</p>
<p>Some of the "reference" sheets maintain their references intact when their corresponding queries are refreshed, while others change the references as outlined above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that, for the sheets whose references change, the first row (row 2) on the "reference" sheet changes to reference the
<strong><em>last row with data</em></strong> on the query sheet. This results in the "reference" sheet only showing one row of data, regardless of how many records were actually returned by the query.,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does the query-refresh change the relative refrencing on a different sheet?</p>

            Using Structured References, rather than "<em>Sheetname</em>!<em>C1</em>" style references, resolved the problem.

<h2>            The older Kindle Fire models still do NOT have access to OneNote&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">The older Kindle Fire models still do NOT have access to OneNote! Has anyone heard if there is going to be a fix any time
 soon? Or who can I contact to have this fixed? Amazon or Microsoft? I saw the blog post / announcement about OneNote being available to use on Amazon products (</span>http://blogs.office.com/2014/07/24/onenote-available-for-kindle-fire-and-fire-phone/#<span><span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)"><span>).
 In the comments on that blog it is stated that the OneNote app can't be downloaded onto Kindle's without microphones. My Kindle Fire 8.9 HD (2nd Generation) from 2013 does have a microphone. Yet I still can not download the OneNote app because the amazon app
 store says OneNote is not compatible with my device. The blog post about OneNote being&nbsp;available&nbsp;for&nbsp;the Kindle was from July 2014 and it was known then that there is a problem with the older kindle generations. We are coming up on a year and there is still
 no solution or even a statement that they are working on a solution.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">Does anyone know if this will ever be resolved? Is there someone I can contact to have this be resolved? Thank you!</span></p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through all of the threads on the <span>
&nbsp;Microsoft Office Community that are related to the OneNote App for the Kindle Fire, including the one you&nbsp;referred&nbsp;me to. They have solutions that involve rooting&nbsp;and/or downloading the apk file from random webpages, which is always a risk.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm looking for the OneNote App directly from the Amazon App store, which is now offered but only to certain Kindles. When I go to the app store and try to get OneNote I'm told that my Kindle isn't compatible (see the
 image below). So the answer that is given on the thread you referred me to does not answer my question.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now I understand that the OneNote app is only compatible with certain Kindles. Somewhere on all of these threads and support pages I have read that the OneNote app requires a microphone on the kindle and that's why
 the app only works with certain kindles. My kindle does have a microphone, but as you can tell from the picture I attached I cannot get the OneNote app from the Amazon app store.&nbsp;</span><span>When the app came out in July 2014
 my kindle was barely a year old. Many people, including myself, thought that a fix would eventually come out so the many slightly older kindle models could use OneNote or at the very least a OneNote viewer/reader but nothing has come out yet. I've searched
 and searched. Part of my&nbsp;frustration&nbsp;is&nbsp;that there are several threads like this one on this site and others that say the problem is fixed or the question is answered but&nbsp;usually&nbsp;it is a work around like rooting the kindle or worse, it's been marked as answered
 and there are still posts saying they are having problems. So I wanted to open up a new thread in hopes that those of us left in the dark can have an answer. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So my question remains: Will the OneNote App become&nbsp;available&nbsp;to the other Kindle HD Fire models on the Amazon App store? At the very least,&nbsp;available&nbsp;to the Kindle models with a microphone? Or maybe a&nbsp;OneNote viewer/reader?
 If this isn't the place to ask these questions, could you please tell me who I should ask?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you!&nbsp;</span></p>

                    How do you simultaneously select all the objects in a word 2010 drawing?<br />
I have tried this with objects on a canvas and not on a canvas.&nbsp; I am trying to reposition the entire drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wish to be able to copy and paste all the objects in the drawing simultaneously.&nbsp; It is impossible to do multiple selections by&nbsp; holding
 ctrl key held down while selecting.&nbsp; Objects are layered on top of one another and objects get deselected.<br />

            It is probably best to use the grouping function before moving, though you need to select each object while holding down the shift key as you do so, so that you can select multiple objects.

<h2>            Onenote Sync Issue - It looks like I have 2 profiles</h2>
                    <p>I'm using OneNote App for Windows 10&nbsp;in notebook and in iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my notebook, after use in off-line mode for a while, opening and closing the cover, when I come back to internet access, it ask me to enter with my credentials, using Windows Hello.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that all my pages, in his paragraphs, is shown the initials of my name in the right side. My name is Marco Vicente dos Reis Jesus, and in the right side is shown MVdRJ.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I edit some paragraphs, this intials gone in this paragraph, but, if I open the same page in my iPhone, at right side of this paragraphs is shown just the initial of my firt name.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It looks like you have two authors at the same time on the same page,
</span><span><span>but the two are myself. I don´t have two profiles in Microsoft. In my notebook I'm logged in my only one profile.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I restored the app and started all again two times, but, if I use OneNote in off-line mode for some time, it happens again.</span></span></p>

    <title>Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 crashes whenever I try to insert audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> outofsam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 crashes whenever I try to insert audio &#40;worked fine on March 12, does not work now&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using PowerPoint 2010 for a very long time with music and audio inserted. &nbsp;I have never had a problem until now. &nbsp;Anytime I click "insert audio" and try to insert an audio clip, the program freezes and has to forcibly be shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running it on safe mode, I have tried closing all other applications, I tried "repairing" office, and I even tried doing a system restore back to March 10 (which failed, see:&nbsp;http://imgur.com/a/g9Kz3 ). &nbsp;None of that worked, PowerPoint still
 freezes when I try to insert audio. &nbsp;I also made sure that I am running all of the latest updates, and everything is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there was a major Windows Update on around March 15 or so, so I'm wondering if that ruined everything. &nbsp;But it's very frustrating because I have deadlines I need to meet and I NEED to be able to insert audio on PowerPoint for these presentations.
 &nbsp;Can anyone help with this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking time to test this. I tried it several times, using my Surface4, and was not able to proceed after including the hyperlink in Sway. I assumed it was an issue with Sway, instead of a limitation with my Surface4. After I received your response,
 I restarted the Surface4 and tested again - and it worked fine. This is working fine, and my Sway newsletter now takes readers to Delve profile of my IT team, where users can find Skype, email address, etc. Nice. Thanks!</p>

            At $300 it's a fake. Walk away.<br />
<br />
While it may have a similar finish to the original phone, it most certainly won't have the same build quality or features. Nor will there be any support.

    <title>vba to minimize the window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> camdill  say:</h3>
<h2>            vba to minimize the window</h2>
                    <p>I am using Powerpoint in Office 2013&nbsp;on Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to have a macro that will minimize the presentation or an option that will turn the presentation into a resizable window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my module running in Kiosk Mode.&nbsp; I know that I can change it to a Windowed mode, but I need to have the presentation so that the user can not use a mouse or keyboard to advance through slides.&nbsp; I can disable mouse clicks but I can&nbsp;not disable the
 use of the mouse scroll button or the keyboard arrows.&nbsp; Those will still advance the slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a vba code that might accomplish this so that my current full screen can be minimized with a button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Alt + Tab, Win + TAB and Win + D will all minimize the window but for the sake of the computer illiterate persons that will use this presentation, I think a macro button is the best option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

                    i have been using the Microsoft Security Essentials for a while now, but lately i am finding that after i run a scan, a couple of hours later, the shield says potentially unprotected and this morning the real time protection was off? what is going on with
 this program? i like it a lot but i am getting frustrated with it doing this.

            <p><b><span>Are you using
<span>CCleaner</span>?</span></b><span>&nbsp; Piriform has programmed it for some reason to remove part of the MSE History files and it's deleting the files MSE checks to determine the last time a scan was
 conducted.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open CCleaner&nbsp;Applications Tab, Under Windows uncheck MS Antimalware...that should prevent CCleaner from deleting the MS Antimalware scanning history&nbsp;files.&nbsp;
 The actions of CCleaner&nbsp;should not have any effect on the antimalware protection provided by MSE.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Per suggestion of MSE User
<i>MartinHampton </i>you <b>may </b>also need to uncheck MS Management Console.</span></p>
<p><span>You may&nbsp;need to run a "Quick Scan" and possibly re-boot the computer to re-establish a scan history.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Do you use Advanced System Care?
</span></b><span>We have reports of ASC “deleting” administrative files from MSE in the same manner that CCleaner is deleting them. Again, these are administrative files and the removal of same by ASC is an inconvenience
 to the users of MSE but removal of the files does not affect the antimalware protection of MSE.</span></p>
<p><span>If so, open ASC, in the upper right corner, click More, Settings</span></p>
<p><span>Scroll to Quick Care, Privacy Sweep, go to Windows, be sure MS Antimalware and MS Management Console (if visible) are unchecked.</span></p>
<p><span>Scroll to Deep Care, Privacy Sweep, go to Windows, be sure MS Antimalware and MS Management Console (if visible) are unchecked.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on Auto Clean under Automatic Service - uncheck the MS AntiMalware under windows - then click the button to Apply and OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Or contact ASC Support at:

    <title>Speech Recognition with Outlook 2007 Not Displaying Text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim kono  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speech Recognition with Outlook 2007 Not Displaying Text </h2>
                    The following issue occurs occasionally in Windows Vista and frequently in windows 7 using speech recognition with outlook 2007.<br />
<br />
When dictating into an email the new text often does not display as if a was white letters on a white background.&nbsp; The cursor does move as the text is generated but the text itself does not display. If I minimize the window and bring it back up the text then
 displays fine. <br />
<br />
I am not using any special font, colors, style or any other formatting when this occurs.&nbsp; It can even happen in plain text emails.<br />
<br />
It is truly a pain to have to keep minimizing and redisplaying be active window to see the generated text from speech recognition.
<br />
<br />
As mentioned above this is occurring on two different computers with the two operating systems.&nbsp; Is there anything that can be done, other than the minimize and redisplaying the window, to force the text that speech recognition has generated for outlook to
 display?<br />
<br />
I have to use speech recognition on a regular basis and do not seem to have a problem with any other programs both in and out of Microsoft programs including the other office programs.<br />
<br />
Any and all suggestions are welcome.

            &nbsp;
<p>Speech recognition is not a feature that is embedded in the Office suite, it is a part of the Windows Operating system. I would suggest a basic step as it is happening only with Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try creating a new profile and see if that helps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the link below on how to create a new profile in Outlook 2007</p>

            Same problem here on my lumia 920. It has something to do with the change from summertime to wintertime,I think. Because events created before the yesterday time change are not affected. But all events since today are changed after synch to one hour to
 early! That's very disturbing, ms please fix this problem.

            I too have the same issue on my Lumia 1020 on O2 network. I had been using a lumia 800 for more than 2 yrs and have the same setting. Never had a problem with it. Not sure why my calender is changing time. The post marked as Answer did not help me. I have
 set the time to automatic. I rely on my calender a lot and its messing me up badly. Any other help please.

            Mine pushes the times 12hours forward for no particular reason? Doesn't help to change to 12 hr clock and fiddling the time zone doesn't get over the shift of some appointments to the next day - MS you are becoming a waste of space this calendar &nbsp;need

            <p>If the file actually is saved as file type <strong><em>Excel 2004 XML Spreadsheet
</em></strong><em>or</em><strong> XML Spreadsheet 2003</strong>, there should be no problem. Files of that type use a built-in standardized schema supported in all Mac/PC versions from [IIRC] Office 2003 forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if it's saved as an <strong>XML <em>Data file</em></strong> involving the use of the XML tools found on the Developer tab of the Windows versions &amp; the XML Source Task Pane, Mac Excel cannot work with it. Mac Office never has been equipped with
 true XML capability, nor have those tools been added in O2016.<br />

            "deal-killers"? Are you referring to features available in the Windows versions that still are not provided in the Mac O2016? Or are you referring to previously available Mac Excel features that have been dumped in order to make room for the new capabilities

    <title>WM hang on start screen after copying pim.vol - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tara kraft  say:</h3>
<h2>            WM hang on start screen after copying pim.vol</h2>
                    My phone (Moto Q9c)&nbsp;began misbehaving (hangs, screen redraw issues).&nbsp; Rather than a lengthy troubleshooting process I hoped a hard reset would quickly get me back to a good state.
<br />
<br />
Prior to doing so, I made a copy of pim.vol<br />
<br />
After hard reset, the phone started up fine.&nbsp; I then changed the pim.vol on the phone to "pim.old" and copied over the old (backup) pim.vol to the phone.<br />
<br />
Then I did a soft reset of the phone - but on restart, the phone hangs at the Windows Mobile screen forever and ever and ever...<br />
<br />
I've done this pim backup/restore before on this phone with no issues. <br />
<br />
Any ideas or help?

            Try removing micro sd card from mobile and boot your wm.<br />
Or else if data back up is done, restore your phone to factory mode.<br />
<br />
It seems like problem with card you are using. You may need to format it by putting in your mobile.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Optimizing Pub Websites for mobile devices</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone found any good tips for optimizing websites created in Publisher for mobile devices...specifically, some sort of code to say make the text 1.5x larger on a mobile device or some such thing? I have many sites created and edited in Pub and as more
 and more people are using smart phones etc. I'm wondering if there's a way to make them easier to read for these people. Any ideas appreciated.</p>

            <p>Publisher produces fixed width, static websites which limits your options.&nbsp;You can&nbsp;consider keeping the page width somewhat narrow to minimize the horizontal scrolling and use a default font size of 12 or larger which those of us with old eyes appreciate
 in regular sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could create another website specifically designed in terms of width and font size for smartphones, and provide a link to that site from the home page. You would just upload that site to a subfolder and link to it from your main homepage. We can talk
 specifics if you want, but here is an example of a website that offers an English and a Greek version. Click on the two flags in the upper right corner to toggle back and forth between the two sites. You could offer a textual link to a 'smartphone' site in
 this manner. <a href="http://www.hotelsrhodes.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hotelsrhodes.gr/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a website that will 'adapt' to a smart phone then it is time to move to something other than Publisher. You already know that MS is deprecating the web building functionality in Publisher so perhaps this is another reason to switch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSFT has made Expression Web a freebie now. It requires you learn basic CSS and HTML coding but it will give you the ability to code your site for smart phones or big screens. You can code your pages to automatically render a different page if viewed with
 a smartphone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you look at Serif WebPlus. It offers the ability to opimize for smartphones but works much more like Publisher.
<a href="http://www.serif.com/webplus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.serif.com/webplus/</a>&nbsp;There is a free version that if you download it within a few weeks Serif will start offering you big discounts on the newest version. So even if you never use it you might
 download the free version. <a href="http://www.serif.com/web-design-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.serif.com/web-design-software/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are lots of other possibilities out there. Another one I would suggest you consider is WordPress. Bottom line is you are eventually going to have to move on from Publisher so as you ask these questions about building smartphone websites, I would suggest
 you also start investigating new software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I don't worry about smartphones. My Publisher sites are designed to offer a lot of textual information...to&nbsp;'educate' people about&nbsp;certain subjects&nbsp;and no matter what I do with them, I don't think anyone would want to try to read that much&nbsp;content
 on a smartphone. I think that designing for smartphones is entirely differnt. It is my view that smartphone users are looking for small bites of information to consume&nbsp;and my sites just don't lend themselves to that, so I ignore that market segment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's my two cents worth...</p>

            Thanks David, I was afraid that would be the answer. I&nbsp;like the idea of building&nbsp;a smaller smartphone friendly version of my sites in serif webplus (I'd already been looking at that, but it's a lot of work to rebuild 20 or so sites so this might be a good
 option), then put a link to those in my pub sites like the example you gave above. I sure wish MSFT hadn't bagged a good thing!

<p><br />
That sounds like a excellent way to start transitioning to new software. I haven't used Serif much but someone who used to post here told me once that he was able to import a Publisher site into Publisher and convert it without too much tweaking. As you build
 your smartphone sites and become more familiar with WebPlus I imagine you can experiment and find the best way to convert. In fact as you do, please come back and share your experience with us. I think the hardest part of building a website is the design and
 the writing...if you already have the design in mind, the text written, the pictures chosen and optimized it seems that recreating a website that you produced in Publisher&nbsp;in WebPlus should go quickly.

Just a thought:<br />
<br />
Your suggestion of creating a separate website suited for smart phones with a link to it on the original full version is indeed the most appropriate solution. But rather than a link, I would simply use a customized "screen resolution sniffer with redirect"
 script.<br />
<br />
I have used "redirect" scripts before and they work quite well.<br />

Geoffrey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds great, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you edit the code and insert the script into the &lt;head&gt; section or is this one of those scripts that will work just by inserting the script via the 'insert html code fragment' tool?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The script suggest 4 monitor resolutions. Do you happen to know what the default size would be for a smart phone? What width would you make your second web page that will be directed to the smart phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for the suggestion. I knew of 'redirect scripts' but did not know they worked with Publisher webs.</p>

<br />
This script needs to be inserted in the &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML document, not in the body as it must be activated before download begins.<br />
<br />
The resolution of smart phones varies greatly in the range 480 or less to 800 wide and for that reason I would keep the page width within this range. You can find more information at:<br />

Thank you sir. I am still not sure I will bother with it all. I still tend to build sites 760 pixels wide so perhaps I will just live with that. Perhaps I am getting old and lazy...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am getting more and more interested in WordPress. It seems so versatile.&nbsp;I ran across a factoid on one of the pages your links lead me to: "WordPress accounts for 20% off all visits on the web today". I find myself wondering if this is part of the reason
 MSFT decided to drop development of Expression Web, their full fledged standards compliant web software. You can dowload it for free now, but to use it you must understand at least basic CSS and HTML coding. That steep learning curve keeps it from being a
 good alternative for the people that use Publisher, WebPlus...on-line web builders, and others that want relatively simple sites and don't have the time, interest and perhaps the aptitude to learn coding. I think WordPress offers yet another good choice for
 those users. Done rambling now...</p>

            <p>David,</p>
<p>Well, here's some feedback on Serif Web+6. I downloaded the trial, messed with it a bit, it was very Publisher-like. What I mean by that is if you're used to building sites in Pub, it's not hard to learn. I watched a few of their video tutorials to get the
 feel of things, picked a template and got to work. I soon learned that there are limitations to the free version, I was able to upgrade for $60 but having used it a bit now, that seems pretty inexpensive. I really like the ability to put photo slide shows
 in and it's easy - but don't use the flash template ones or they don't work on Apple stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took my own site, started rebuilding it (it needed to be rebuilt anyway, it was getting cumbersome), then I realized that it's not really optimized for mobile, you have to choose a special mobile template. So I did that, reworked just my home page in the
 mobile template to see what it would look like. It has a built-in redirect to send a mobile device to that page (index0.html) rather than the normal index.html page. That's pretty cool. I don't have a smart phone, so I'm testing with my son's ipod. I had to
 hard code the redirect, but it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you want to see what it all looks like, here are the links:</p>
<p>Original site (still live for now) <a href="http://www.vkvboers.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.vkvboers.com</a></p>

Thanks for taking the time to share your experience and the links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the looks of your new site. Updated and clean. I don't have a smartphone either so I can't test that feature but it looks good on my desktop monitor. It also looks good in Firefox and IE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You reinforced my belief that if you used Publisher you could figure out WebPlus fairly easily. I bought version 5 some time ago but never got around to installing it. Maybe it is time. There are so many built in features in WebPlus...I love the thumbnail
 to large picture function on your site. Very clean and easy. Geoffrey shared some javascript to do something similar just recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really wish MSFT had taken Publisher in the direction of WebPlus instead of abandoning the web functionality.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>I can't stop playing with it - it's really cool. I'm really excited. Check out the slider I put in the center of the page, it's even sensitive to the mouse scroller.... and it's so easy -it took me a little to figure it out, but now it'd take like 5 minutes
 to add one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vkvboers.com/Mobile/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vkvboers.com/Mobile/index.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for suggesting this software. I have about 20 sites that I've built in Pub, but I think I'm sold on this now. Putting things like this slider into sites is something I've always wanted to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried things like Joomla but have found things like virus activity in their templates, they're hard to navigate, you can't move things around easily like you can in Serif or Pub. This really is very much like Pub only very powerful - no more adding
 code to do things like center on page etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can anchor things on a page as a link style, do the shadow boxes, open in new page (without adding code to the link) or pull up the pix from a thumbnail like I did in some places - there are a lot of options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even added a Paypal button really easily, it took a lot of work in Pub (but it's possible there).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also have some really good support like this short tutorials.</p>

<p>You can watch a few and really get the hang of it, click around a bit and it's pretty intuitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this is a MSFT Pub site, but hey, they're the ones who abandoned us!</p>

<h2>            Office 365 icons missing and clicking on office documents does not open the office document</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subscription Product</p>
<p>MS Office 365</p>
<p>Version 1707</p>
<p>contains Word 2016, Excel 2016, PPT 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Office 2010 on my laptop. Then I installed Office 365. For a while this was ok but I decided to uninstall Office 2010. After I did this the following problems started appearing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Office documents no longer had the correct icons. They would just show the generic white file icon. The names of the documents would still be .docx, pptx, etc. What's really annoying is that I can change the icon if I set the "Open" option to Adobe Acrobat
 or Notepad. But if I change it back to the Microsoft Office program, it's showing the generic white file icon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) secondly, (and more importantly), when I double click on the icons to open the documents, office opens the relevant program (Word, Excel or Powerpoint) but doesn't proceed to open the document too.<strong> &gt;&gt;</strong> I can open the document only if I
</p>
<ul>
<li>drag the generic document icon to the Office program (which is already open) or</li><li>if I Ctrl+O to manually open the office document by going to the relevant path and selecting the file.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So much for point and click...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on what I can do? </p>
<p>

    <title>Subreport only showing last &#40;or first&#41; record from master - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caledoniat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subreport only showing last &#40;or first&#41; record from master Report</h2>
                    I have a Report that is filtered from a user input Form. The Report is grouped by the field "sAgent" and has a SubReport using the PolicyID field as the "Link Master/Child Fields" criteria. &nbsp;The SubReport pulls from a different query and will display totals
 of commissions paid for the records included in the master report.<br />
<br />
Here's the problem:<br />
When I put the SubReport in the sAgent Header of the Master Report, the results show only records for the first PolicyID from the master.&nbsp;<br />
When I put the SubReport in the sAgent Footer of the Master Report, the results show only records for the last PolicyID from the master.&nbsp;<br />
When I put the SubReport in the sAgent Details Section of the Master Report, the results are accurate, but they appear after each PolicyID, instead of a summary of all PolicyIDs (ideally in the report footer).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated!<br />

            <p>What you're describing is exactly what I'd expect: each instance of the subreport has one PolicyID, that specified in the Master Link Field (the first in the header, and so on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you need to either use a subreport with no master/child link at all (to sum all the policies) or you need to base the Report on a query joining the two queries and using the Sorting and Grouping to display the appropriate groupings. Not having
 a clear picture of the data I'm not sure just how that would be set up, but it might be more appropriate!</p>

<h2>            Security Alert Microsoft apps &#38; services was granted access to your Google Account</h2>
                    <p>Why is Microsoft suddenly forcing access to my gmail account from my laptop outlook. This just started on the 31st.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Security Alert Microsoft apps &amp; services was granted access to your Google Account allowing Microsoft to do whatever it wants with my email. If I don't allow then I can no longer use Outlook for Gmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not wish Microsoft to have access to my account however do want to use Outlook with my Gmail as I have for the past decades. I experienced this request when first downloading outlook for mobile. This is the very reason I cancelled the download for mobile.
 However this is a first for laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to get around this?</p>

            Dear Kevin,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />This is not because of Microsoft changes, it was Google that made the changes and now you are getting this pop up. I had the same experience. Go to&nbsp;account&nbsp;settings and change the "imap.gmail.com" and "smtp.gmail.com" to "imap.googlemail.com" and "smtp.googlemail.com" and it should be working fine. 
<br />
<br />Please share the results.

            Dear Greyfox100,
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />I also have Oreo on my Samsung. In order to remove app, just go to the app list, find the Outlook app , press the icon and hold until a pop up menu will show. There will be option to uninstall.
<br />Can I ask why do you want to uninstall it ?
