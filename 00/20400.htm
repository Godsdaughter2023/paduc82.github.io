<h2>            Two Windows Defenders - Original with Win 10 and a new Windows Defender Security Center</h2>
                    <p>Dell Inspiron 5545 </p>
<p>Running Version 1703 (OS Build 15063.540)</p>
<p>I have 2 Windows Defenders - the Windows Defender antivirus that came with Windows 10, now, after an MS upgrade a couple months ago, I have a Windows Defender Security Center. The odd thing is that both have the same basic functions, and can even do separate
 virus scans at the same time.&nbsp; Also, whichever one I use to scan my PC, it updates the date of last scan in that one only.&nbsp; I can only assume that Windows Defender Security Center was supposed to replace the original Windows Defender.</p>
<p>How do I get rid of the original Windows Defender that came with Win 10????</p>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean "<strong>uninstalling</strong>" when you said "<strong>get rid</strong>" of the Windows defender, it's not possible as this is a pre-installed security for your computer; however, you can turn it off. To do so, see the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> and type in "<strong>windows defender</strong>".
</li><li>Choose <strong>Windows Defender</strong>. The Windows Defender pop-up window will appear.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Turn On/Off</strong> button.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Adding up, see this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/windows-defender-help-protect-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>for your reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any questions and/or clarifications. </p>

            I'm not asking how to turn it off, I know that.&nbsp; Your response doesn't answer my question nor act upon my problem of having two different Defenders.&nbsp; Of which both are asking for updates and both are telling me that I haven't run a scan.&nbsp; I don't think
 it was Microsoft's intention for someone to care and feed two Defenders on one system.

<p>I’ve got one icon in the lower right corner on the taskbar near the clock - that’s the Windows Defender Security Center…it’s a got a green checkmark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve also got a Windows Defender icon (blue &amp; white) on the left side of the taskbar - when I open the icon it looks like the previous WD interface before MS created the Windows Defender Security Center….yes, I think it’s confusing and could/should have
 been left alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you seeing more icons than those two?</p>

BTW, I don't run CCleaner or any such programs that delete the WD history and WD automatically runs a scan about once a week.&nbsp; It's actually worked quite well since I purchased this laptop a year ago.</p>

<p>Had you enabled the taskbar icon&nbsp;for&nbsp;Windows Defender&nbsp;to be displayed in Windows 10 before the Creators Update occurred earlier this year?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask because I easily found the Notification area&nbsp;icon setting that allows moving the new Windows Defender Security Center icon from the hidden&nbsp;icons box&nbsp;where it normally resides directly onto the taskbar at the right-hand end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have no second icon on the left side of the taskbar as Le Boule mentioned and since this apparently opens the older&nbsp;Windows Defender Antivirus interface, I suspect this is only displayed if it was previously enabled in an earlier version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That Windows Defender Antivirus GUI, BTW, is a slightly modified version of the old interface, since it's been renamed to add the word&nbsp;Antivirus and dropped the Settings tab as I recall&nbsp;when I had&nbsp;opened it manually myself.&nbsp; It's actually still included
 within the Windows Defender folder structure intentionally, primarily because it's still required on older operating systems that don't include the new security center like Windows 8.x, even though at present that is still using the older 4.10 client GUI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not certain where or how that icon for the older version can be controlled, since the portions of the older taskbar controls that handled&nbsp;it may not exist anymore.&nbsp; It's possible that it's simply a shortcut, but I really&nbsp;do suspect it was a registry
 entry related to the older client and taskbar.</p>

<p>Never read about this glitch occurring but I must agree with your conclusion - it really sounds like Creator Update managed to leave you with two working "Defenders" on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestions are - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Test WD with Eicar to be sure WD is working.&nbsp; If it's working and both icons/versions seem to be working just leave it alone and see if the next Creator Update (version 1709) due to be released in October might fix it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rexswain.com/eicar.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.rexswain.com/eicar.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(2)&nbsp; Reset your computer or do a clean install of Win 10.&nbsp; Remember that will eliminate programs/data/pics/music etc so be sure everything is backed up. This is the best option to ensure that “all is good” with your Win 10 computer.&nbsp; I would probably do
 a reset/reinstall if this were my computer or I was try to "fix" it for whatever reason.</p>

<p>
</p><p>(3) Disable Windows Defender - see if that turns off/removes one of them from your computer.&nbsp; See option 2.&nbsp; Of course that might turn both of them off – perhaps you can re-enable just one of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5918-turn-off-windows-defender-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5918-turn-off-windows-defender-windows-10-a.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) Install a third party antivirus program which<strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 153, 102, 1)">
should</span></strong> disable Defender.&nbsp; Due to the issues you are seeing that might not automatically occur – if WD is not disabled see suggestion # 3, turn it off using the "Reg" file and use the AV program you have installed.</p>

</p><p>If you'll be patient another poster might have other ideas to include a potential fix by going into the registry.&nbsp; I generally stay out of the registry though since there's no eraser in there and if you make a mistake that might prove "fatal" to the OS.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for all your help and suggestions, Le Boule.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The tests with Eicar worked - the "viruses" were found, so the email portion works.&nbsp; I have no doubts that the Win Defenders are working.&nbsp; It is just a nuisance having to care and nurture them myself with no automation built into them for updates and scans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the hassles involved in your suggestions, and the possible costs (not to mention the inadequate help I have received from MS tech support in the past), I will wait and see if the next upgrade cleans it up before attempting anything that is more involved.&nbsp;
 I will just disable the old WD and keep doing any manual updates and scans on (hopefully) only the Security Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much again.</p>

<p>Just try manually deleting the icon relating to the "old" Defender, which should be opening the still existing and supported Windows Defender Antivirus interface as I stated earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's absolutely nothing wrong or even unexpected here other than the second icon, since both of these interfaces are still present as executable code, it's just the "leftover" icon for the older interface that's causing your apparent confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure when Microsoft intends to remove the older interface, but there's actually only one Windows Defender operating and protecting the PC, it's simply that the two GUI displays are entirely independent, so they also apparently retain their own registry
 and other code that makes them appear to the uninformed to be two entirely different programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, everyone with Windows 10 has had both of these GUI displays available since the Creators update released in April and was later&nbsp;installed on their particular system(s).&nbsp; Most simply hadn't felt the need to enable or create an icon on their desktop
 or in the taskbar for the old version, so they don't have that indication that the old interface application is still present and operational within the Windows Defender program folder.</p>

    <title>Bought a Skype number - after 6 months started receiving a zillion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> max_cooper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bought a Skype number - after 6 months started receiving a zillion unsolicited calls in one day</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a geographical (UK) Skype number some time last year. &nbsp;It has been pretty dormant for most of that time, it is on my eBay business seller information but that's about it, I think I received one maybe 2 calls from eBay customers within these many
 months. &nbsp;The number is also on my business cards for upcoming/future ventures but the cards have not really been distributed to anyone (maybe 2 or 3 people).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have call-forwarding set up so all calls to this (0161) number come straight through to my secondary (business) cell phone. &nbsp;All of a sudden on one particular day in June this year I received a plethora of missed calls on my iPhones Skype App, every time
 I looked there was another missed call from an unrecognised cell number showing on my screen (i.e. number not stored in my contacts). &nbsp;The phone had never actually rang but there was a missed call logged. &nbsp;This happened 13 times within a 2-3hr period and ended
 up killing the battery out!!! (old iphone 5 battery not so good!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When calling the numbers back and asking who they were and what it was regarding, each and every one of them said that they were returning MY call as they have received a missed call from my cell number. &nbsp;This certainly was not the case, there is no log
 on the iphone/skype app of me calling any of these numbers, only after the missed call was received from said number did I call it back and that is the only time an outgoing call was showing in my call log. &nbsp;I asked if they were calling from eBay or a business
 or residential, and all these folks were residential people, I think one was actually a business person, but all reiterated the fact that they called me due to the fact that they had a missed call from me on their device, which obviously I didn't initiate
 and certainly not 13 times to 13 different individuals, whose number I do not have in my contacts!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anywho, after calling Skype support and telling them that there's some kind of fraudulent activity going on as my number is being used to dial out, they could offer no help or understanding whatsoever to the point and query I was trying to make. &nbsp;I told
 them that I was concerned that all these calls being made to my skype number will have probably eaten up my credit, to which they offered a refund as their only solution. &nbsp;I accepted a refund but then the operative went on to tell me that this refund cancels
 my number. &nbsp;I was like, WHAT?? &nbsp;I dont want to cancel the number! &nbsp;it's on my literature and business contact? &nbsp;They said that would be the only way to stop the calls, to cancel the number. &nbsp;They were so bloody useless and I was beginning to get infuriated.
 &nbsp;They had no answer or second line of approach, no willingness to investigate what was going on, wouldn't even allow me to escalate the complaint in anyway, and being as there's no goddamn human being to speak to at Skype I accepted that this number had been
 exploited and there was nothing I could do to stop these random numbers calling consecutively for hours on end so I cancelled and they refunded the full purchase amount.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else heard of such ridiculous situations as this happening? &nbsp;I've spent a small fortune on business cards and could do without having to amend and reprint as I will have wasted a lot of money. &nbsp;They did mention that I could repurchase the number
 within 90 days but they couldn't guarantee this would not happen again. &nbsp; Thanks Skype, really helpful of you! &nbsp;I mean, how can they do business like this and think that it is acceptable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions? &nbsp;Obviously I'd like a geographical landline number to show me as being based in a certain part of the UK but can't go ahead and rely on a Skype number if this is going to be the outcome. &nbsp;Anyone have any advice they can share
 please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right... and breathe....</p>

 suggest is for you to change it to a different number so that your contacts will be able to identify that you're the one who's calling them. If this will not work for you, I'm afraid that the only way to get rid of this issue is for the Skype number to be

<p>Thank you so much for the link. I have successfully downloaded that software and its working perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I still have an issue. The back up file has restored successfully into a company record. No problems and no errors. However when I try to open the company I am getting a message saying
</p>
<p>
</p><p>" Incompatible locale between company database and application. Log On Failed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A company I create in the new installation works just fine, until I restore the .sbb back up to it, after which I get this message. There must be a setting somewhere which is being changed by data in the .sbb file. Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

            Hello DataMiner2, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having an issue as you are annoyed by Outlook delete confirmation popup. I know how frustrating this can be and I will try my best to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />
I find that this article may be relevant to you: <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/show-dialogs-dismissed-using-dont-show-dialog-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/show-dialogs-...</a> (disable/enable by registry method if option not in user-end)
<br />
<br />
To disable the dialog, generally: go to <strong><em>File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced</em></strong>
<br />
<br />
Then, untick "<strong>Prompt for confirmation before deleting items</strong>" <br />
<br />
Cheers! <br />

<h2>            Nokia E73 Internet Connection Problems&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Hello, I'm very new here. I just have&nbsp;started using Nokia E73 Unlocked&nbsp;for 2 days since I lost my iphone, so everything is pretty much new with me(I'm using At&amp;t). But there is a problem I really need your help, that's about the internet connection.
 I have the internet service on my plan, but it doesn't work on my Nokia phone when I try&nbsp;go to&nbsp;the internet. I tried to take the sim card out and put it into my wife's iphone and it worked pretty well. So I'm just wondering that do I have to go somewhere like
 the Settings Connection of the phone to set up or activate my internet service, or it's just automatical connect when I put my sim card into the phone? Please help me out because I really need internet on my phone for my job. Thank you very much.</strong></p>

<p>I don't have an E73 (will likely be buying one in the next few days), but used an E71 for a long time and the phones should be very similar.&nbsp; Unlike other PDA's, perhaps, Symbian phones remember old Access Points, and individual applications can be configured
 to use one Access Point over another.&nbsp; As the E73 is being sold by T-Mobile, I'm guessing the you had an account with them for a short time, and some T-Mobile baggage is what's causing your Internet problem.&nbsp; I would suggest you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Delete all Access Points from the phone.&nbsp; If it's like the E71, you'll go somwhere like Menu -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Settings -&gt; Connectivity -&gt; Access Points.&nbsp; (Or at the very least, delete anything that looks like it shouldn't be there).</p>
<p>2) Restart the phone.</p>
<p>3) See if your Internet application now works.&nbsp; If not, check that program's Settings for any Access Point options.&nbsp; The web browser, in particular, offers this option.&nbsp; (Settings -&gt; General ?).&nbsp; The Email/Exchange applications may or may not,.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

 type, font size or text colors, when I save them and go back into the file I no longer see my changes nor do my peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem with WORD and it was an option under my editor that had to be checked off but I can't seem to find a solution in Excel. Any suggestions? Help :-(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks... M</p>

            Uninstalling OpenOffice shouldn't cause any problems with Microsoft Office. However, after the uninstallation, if something isn't working properly, you can start Office setup from Control Panel and choose the Repair option.

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Folders you don't need to do anything about.</p>
<p>Office 2010 will open Open Office (odf) documents natively in normal circumstances BUT - when you open an odt document, you may get the message that there are error in the document. You can go ahead but you might lose formatting, or you can open it in OO
 and "save as" as a .doc. If you open an ods document (spreadsheet) then Excel will strip out ALL the formulae, just leaving values.</p>
<p>Why not just keep Open Office? It won't affect you using MS Office. I have both MS Office 2010 AND Libre Office (the successor to Open Office) 3.4.4 and they both co-exist quite happily.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title states I'm looking for a list of every option and or feature that Outlook 2019 has, not just what's new. Even the old options from previous Outlook versions which were carried forward to 2019. We're looking to see what is a default settings
 from Microsoft and if possible the reason for the default setting. We'd like to compare this list to what we have set. So to recap I'm looking for a full comprehensive list of all Outlook 2019 features and options. Does Microsoft have this somewhere?</p>

I don't see a gap - the start date is 1 day later so the number of days is 1 less. The calculation is entirely correct. There is nothing wrong.</p>

    <title>Automatically numbering the references - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haideryarub  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically numbering the references</h2>
                    <p>Hello </p>
<p>Im writing a thesis and it needs a lot of references that must be numbered correctly. The problem is when i decide after one month to add a reference at the beginning or the middle the whole numbering must be changed. I always write the reference and number
 them by hand. one by one. so when the numbering is changed it will take me at least one or two days to edit the numbers so they match the reference list at the end.
</p>
<p>is the a professional way to automatically number the references and show them at the end of the document? like when i add a new reference at the beginning it will number it as "1" and the next will be automatically changed to "2" etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p style="text-align: left"><strong><span>Introduction:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span><strong>Metal Organic Materials (</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>MOMs), also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs) or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),</strong><sup>

<span><strong>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are made by linking inorganic and organic units by strong bonds (reticular synthesis). The flexibility with which the constituents’ geometry, size, and functionality can be varied has led
 to more than 20,000 different MOFs being reported and studied within the past decade. The organic units are ditopic or polytopic organic carboxylates (and other similar negatively charged molecules), which, when linked to metal-containing units, yield architecturally
 robust crystalline MOF structures with a typical porosity of greater than 50% of the MOF crystal volume. The surface area values of such MOFs typically range from 1000 to 10,000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, thus exceeding those of traditional porous materials such as
 zeolites and carbons [2]. To date, MOFs with permanent porosity are more extensive in their variety and multiplicity than any other class of porous materials. These aspects have made MOFs ideal candidates for storage of fuels (hydrogen and methane), capture
 of carbon dioxide, and catalysis applications</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Phthalocyanines (Pc’s) are one of the most stable organic materials discovered in 1928. They do not show any noticeable degradation in air up to about 400 °C. Metal phthalocyanines
 consist of a central metal ion surrounded by a core structure of the phthalocyanine macrocycle. The central metal influences the properties of the film.
</span><span>The ambients are also found to influence the electrical and optical properties of these films. The optical properties are found to depend on the stacking geometry

<span>phthalocyanines.
<span>phthalocyanines.
</span><span>Due to further advantageous properties such as catalytic activity, light stability, stability against solutions as well as acids and bases, and their large chemical versatility these
 molecules are used in a wide range of technological applications [3,4], such as industrial pigments and dyes [5], gas sensors [6], catalyst for fuel cell cathodes [7,8], and potential photosensitizers for photodynamic cancer therapy [9,10] as well as in magnetic
 resonant imaging (MRI) for tumor localization [11].</span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;now&nbsp; i am able to add EndNote and use them. But what if i copy a paragraph and paste it in other document. will the endnotes be copied with it? or must i add endnotes again for the new document.
</p>
<p>second question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is word able to add this kind of reference type " [3,4,5]" or this type "[5,6]"
</p>
<p>i googled it but they say word does not have this function. </p>

            <p>i googled your solution</p>
<p>at first i use this method </p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Click at the top of your document (or press </strong></span><strong>Ctrl-Home<span> on your keyboard to quickly go to the top of your document).</span></strong></li></ul>
</li><li>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>In the </span>Home <span>tab, click </span>Replace <span>on the far right (in the
</span>Editing <span>section).</span></strong></li></ul>
</li><li>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Click on the </span>More<span> button. (If you don’t see a </span>
More<span> button but do see a </span>Less<span> button, then you can leave things as they are.)</span></strong></li></ul>
</li><li>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>With your insertion point in the text box beside </span>Find What:,<span> choose the
</span>Format <span>button and choose </span>Style<span> then choose </span>Endnote Reference<span> from the list and click
</span>OK<span>.</span></strong></li></ul>
</li><li>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Click in the text box beside </span>Replace With:<span> and type
</span>[^&amp;]<span>. Now click on the </span>Replace All <span>button. A message will pop up to tell you how many replacements were made. Click
</span>OK<span>. All of your Endnote Reference numbers should now have square brackets around them.</span></strong></li></ul>
</li><li>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Click the </span>Close</strong><span><strong>button to close the Find and Replace window.</strong></span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>but if i add new references and repeat these steps and click "Replace All" i will get double square brackets.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>other solution is this </span></p>
<p><strong>Open Word &gt; Click on the right down corner arrow under ‘Styles’ group &gt; Click on ‘Manage styles’ at the bottom &gt; Highlight ‘Bibliography’ under select a style to edit &gt; click on ‘Modify’ tab &gt; Click on the dropdown of ‘Format’ &gt; Edit the styles and
 verify the status.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>but this only applies to citation. But i want it for endnotes and footnotes.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>the last solution is to edit the styles in system folder. But i dont understand it.
</span></p>
<p>

            <p>I assumed that you were using the bibliography feature, but apparently I was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add brackets around footnote or endnote numbers, you can use Find and Replace, as you have already tried, but you will have to do so after editing is completed. (Adding brackets to the paragraph styles used for footnotes or endnotes won't work.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can remove the "excessive" brackets by searching for <strong>[[</strong> and replace with
<strong>[</strong> (and similarly for <strong>]] </strong>of course). You may have to run the Find and Replace repeatedly (unless you perform a
<strong>wildcard</strong> search).</p>

<p>
</p><p>this is a great solution. Thank you very much. I will mark this question as answered later because clearly i will face another problem with the numbering.
</p>
<p>does office word 2016 have this kind of numbering? </p>

            You can set a hanging indent for the Endnote Text paragraph style, if you wish. However, Word will continue adding a number and a space character when inserting endnotes, so some manual intervention&nbsp;will be required to get the desired formatting.

<h2>            Office 2013 Crashes When Trying to Print or Export to PDF</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had MS Office 2013 for several months now, and I previously didn't have any issues. &nbsp;But recently, within the past week or so, Office is crashing every time I click "Print" or use Ctrl+P in Word and Excel. &nbsp;Office also crashes every time I try to "Save
 As..." a PDF or "Export" to PDF. &nbsp;I'm not receiving any error codes - just a note that Office has suddenly stopped working and will close itself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought perhaps the issue was that the document I was using was on OneDrive (I had a previous issue with OneNote not printing or exporting to OneDrive), so I copied the file onto my desktop and into my documents and tried to export to those locations,
 but that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked that I have no active add-on's and tried printing and exporting in Word's Safe Mode, but it still immediately crashes. &nbsp;I don't have any stand-alone Adobe products on my computer, such as Reader or Acrobat. &nbsp;I removed the only program that I
 know of installing recently (InkScape) and did a System Restore to my last restore point, but no luck. &nbsp;Currently I'm going through the Microsoft Office updates and uninstalling them one-by-one to see if that's causing it. &nbsp;I'm using Microsoft Office 2013
 Professional Plus on a Surface Pro 2 with Windows 8.1. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp;I downloaded this program through my university's technology program, and it's been long enough that I don't know if I'd be able to gain access to the program and key again, so I'd rather not try to uninstall and reinstall it if that can be avoided.</p>

<h2>            Being told by MSE that Real-Time Protection is turned off &#40;error code 8x800705b4&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I experienced the exact same problem yesterday.&nbsp; I went through all of the listed steps to resolve the issue, all of which failed.&nbsp; After working three hours to attempt to resolve the issue, I eventually did a system restore which seemed to solve the problem.&nbsp;
 But no, after an automated update early this am I am being told that I have the exact same problem as yesterday...that
<strong>Real-Time Protection is turned off (error code 8x800705b4).</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>I did another update to MSE this am and did yet another scan and I still have the same problem.
</li><li>I have removed all other anti-virus programs (Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware) although
<strong>NEITHER of them provided real-time protection and should NOT have&nbsp;created a conflict.&nbsp;</strong> I still have the same problem.</li><li>Restarted my&nbsp;PC and, you guessed it, I still have the same problem!</li></ul>
<p>Now I'm going to have to spend additional time this am using removal tools to ensure that all possible remainders of other programs are removed from my system.</p>
<p>I noticed by reading this and other boards dealing with this issue that this is not a new problem.&nbsp; Why hasn't Microsoft solved it yet?&nbsp;I never had an issue with MSE until yesterday's update...is it possible Microsoft is sending information in the update
 that is creating the problem?</p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's forget the update and start over from scratch as if it were a new installation.&nbsp; This typically indicates a conflict, but I don't know with what (it could be with the prior installation at this point).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This means not only current ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:
<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:
</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Do not yet remove the one primary AV program you are using until you have downloaded the MSE file so you are protected while doing so – then uninstall and remove that program after the download but before beginning to install MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).<span>&nbsp;
</span>If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, uninstall MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">

<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span>&nbsp; </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAP and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the infection,
 but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAP database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid
</span><span>support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kosh</span></p>

                    I've been trying to recover my old Myspace account using my Hotmail e-mail that I signed up with, but I believe Microsoft is blocking the e-mails, because I'm not receiving them and on the Myspace FAQ they've said to make sure their email&nbsp;<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 isn't under my blocked list and they aren't, so how can I get them to come through?</span>

            Thanks for the information. It would be best to have this reviewed by our Deliverability team to determine the exact cause on why you are unable to receive emails from the address. Kindly go to this link and fill out form and submit it to the Deliverability
