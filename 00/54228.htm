<h2>            High CPU &#47; Memory Usage ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    <p>Since I've upgraded (downgraded actually) to Windows 10 , ntoskrnl.exe won't stop eating my CPU and RAM . My laptop shuts down every day and all the page files are cleared . I've read that system and compressed memory runs a new way to store and keep unused
 data in memory instead of copying them to hard disk to give better performance. Well screw it ! I want it to work as it used to in Win 7 and Win 8.1 . How do I ? The forum is full of same complaints but you've managed to fix none !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was expecting a fix in anniversary update but you've just changed 'System and compressed memory' to 'System' . If you guys can't do a single job correctly then maybe you should not boast about your pathetic&nbsp;operating system. I'll wait for a month and hope
 for a fix , if this doesn't happen then I'll shift to Linux as everyone else and also recommend others to do so . You've messed this one big time Microsoft !</p>

            With everything turned off and after a clean boot, disabling everything as per instructed avobe, I'm still getting the problem. This is very frustrating, enough to throw away a 4,000 dollar workstation and switch to Linux or Mac perhaps. You obviously
 have no idea what you're doing any more.

<h2>            BSOD 0x00000124 Error from ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been looking through forums and trying things for months now. I only really use my PC for gaming at the moment, but it reliably crashes to a BSOD with the error 0x00000124 every few hours of use. I am fairly sure this is a hardware issue, as the crashes
 would occur further apart before. I downloaded a program called "BlueScreenView" and saved the file it gave of the crash. I have shared these for you to look at here:&nbsp;http://1drv.ms/1yeTzsa</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a fresh Windows 7 install to the same error, so I have basically ruled out a repair install.&nbsp;I really would just like to know if a certain piece of hardware is the issue. Black Friday is coming up and I'm planning to upgrade a lot as it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 File Explorer does not open Maximised - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j. b.m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer does not open Maximised</h2>
                    <div>WHY does File Explorer never remember to open any way other the only option we do not have to work with multiple windows open on our Desktop.<br />
We have quarter view, half view (2 ways) and full screen or Maximised<br />
There are NO TABs with FE so I open multiple views, tabs would have a use but it is much easier to be sure that a Moved or Copied file goes where intended (ESPECIALLY AS THE DIALOG BOX DOES NOT SHOW ON TOP ANYMORE, unless we choose to go without "Expand to
 current Folder")</div>
<div>PLEASE, give us a fully functional File Explorer.&nbsp; So many things with Win 10 do not work as they should, can we not have one?&nbsp; Maybe not a problem with a touch screen but how do you see what is there in quarter or half view on a diddy screen?</div>
<div>
<p>I use a Wacom Touch and Pen and I have tried all methods of trying to change the view to Maximised and it will not work, I get quarter, half and even 1 eighth so have to resort to a keyboard shortcut or the little box in the top right hand corner to get
 MAXIMISED.</p>
<p>Why does this not work anymore when it has for 20 years in all the prior Windows versions.&nbsp; It even worked in VISTA..</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS PROBLEM WITH MAXIMISATION (AND THE MOVE, COPY DIALOG BOX) HAS BEEN WITH WINDOWS 10 FROM THE START AND INSTEAD OF A MORE RELIABLE, CORRECTLY WORKING OS WE GET CREATORS UPDATE! &nbsp; A useless piece of bloatware will hardly solve our operating problems with
 the major way we access our computer's contents</p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Not being a total dimwit I have already posted a comment on the Feedback Hub.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Your referral to it suggests that Microsoft (Ms) are taking action based on our comments and that any problem we may have has no solution in Win10 currently available to us.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Do you believe that to be the case, because I do not!<span>&nbsp; </span>I have been an Insider since the Win 8 and a User since Win 95.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What I am looking for is an answer to the problem that has existed since Win 10 was launched.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I, and many others, have made multiple postings on FEEDBACK<span>&nbsp; </span>
regarding this problem after each of the major updates and still nothing has been done!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>I am aware of a number of problems with the current COMMUNITY postings:<span>&nbsp;
</span>1/. The name change infers a Social Network and many users have started to treat it as such.
<span>&nbsp;</span>2/. Old questions are presented with the Answer for old OSs when that Answer will not and cannot work with Win 10.
<span>&nbsp;</span>3/. Because build plays such an important part relating to some problems, the problems cured and the new ones created.
<span>&nbsp;</span>4/. Be interested to know if you actually categorise the problems reported by build version because if you don’t how do Ms know that the problem is cured?</span></span></p>

    <title>Blank blue screen on startup. No cursor, no keyboard control . . . - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluestar28  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blank blue screen on startup.  No cursor, no keyboard control . . .</h2>
                    
<p>That's before any Windows ID or logo, anything at all appears.&nbsp; Hit the switch, blank blue screen , no other controls or cursor or anything.</p>
<p>My wife's PC, a twin to this one, is having a major problem it seems.&nbsp; An HP Pavillion, Intel P4, 512 MBR, it turns on, goes directly to a blank blue screen, with no cursor or any control over the keyboard.&nbsp; When a restore disc is inserted, the PC shows
 a message that the disc is not acceptable, or that there's not enough room on the hard drive.&nbsp; When the PC is started with the R disc already in it, the message remains the same.&nbsp; Of course we bought these PC's with WXP already installed, so we have only what's
 on the hard drive partition to resource with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither of us are what might be considered computer savvy, but we are not absolutely without any skills or knowledge either.&nbsp; Self taught describes much.&nbsp; I have Norton in&nbsp;both PC's.&nbsp; Unfortunately her's is an older version, because she never seems to get
 around to the newest version I make available to her.&nbsp; She says she has kept up with the updates, if that's even possible, I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't love grand?&nbsp; My question here is how do I gain entry into
<em>anything</em> there, if the F8 thing doesn't work?&nbsp; I believe this machine is just so full of garbage like bots and such, it has decided to sit it out for awhile.&nbsp; And if I can get to the startup black and white page that allows me to choose what method
 of boot I want, I will try that to see what works.&nbsp; If nothing helps, I will come back here to bother you all once again.&nbsp; Thank you much in advance.&nbsp; Oggy</p>

<p>If your computer isn't booting to the HP recovery disc, most probably there is a hardware issue with the hard drive or the motherboard. Windows isn't even loaded at that point. You can do the testing yourself or take the machine to a reputable local professional.
 Don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place.</p>

<h2>            Drivers for MPOW M3 &#40;MPOW-059&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking the drivers for Bluetooth Headset<br />
MPOW M3 (https://www.xmpow.com/mpow-m3-over-ear-bluetooth-headphone.html#f0)<br />
in order to add it to HP ProBook 640 G1 running Win7 Pro 64bit.<br />
</p>
<p>The headset is recognized properly and functioning in all other devices that I have<br />
(Android phones, streaming devices, etc, ...) without any issues (device name MPOW-059).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is sucesfully discovered from the laptop&nbsp;Bluetooth device<br />
but when trying to finilize the add process<br />
it fails with msg "No drivers found".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all other devices can see and operate the headset<br />
I assume that drivers would be pretty common (looks like a naming or config issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus I need Win7 64bit drivers<br />
or a way to work around the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Manolis</p>

<p>These headphones use Bluetooth 4.&nbsp; Windows 7 does not support Bluetooth 4.&nbsp; Thus, you need to buy a Bluetooth 4 USB adapter, disable the built-in Bluetooth support on your HP ProBook, and install the new adapter.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks to all for comments</p>
<p>
</p><p>@John Fer</p>
<p>Yes the headset works everywhere else.</p>
<p>I've had issues after pairing it with Amazon Fire TV <em><strong>stick </strong>
</em>(it pairs and connects but during playback audio breaking or unsynced/too slow, etc, ...) but the operation with Fire TV
<em><strong>4K </strong></em>was super I've been watching TV this way. It also works with Nokia 6 several hours of music tested ...</p>
<p>It also works with my other laptop (Win10 Pro) ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>@LemP</p>
<p>I'm a bit confused. How is windows supporting bluetooth <em>nativelly</em>?</p>
<p>Doesn't the system require some form of bluetooth hardware?</p>
<p>Furthermore<br />
there's a generic bluetooth adapter (assuming attached to motherboard) and LMP version seems to be &gt;= v4.0</p>
<p>Headphones also appear to be v4.0</p>
<p>https://www.xmpow.com/mpow-m3-over-ear-bluetooth-hifi-headphone.html</p>
<p>(check below for snapshots).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore it is surpising that it works in all other devices and not win7.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure some of them do not have bluetooth 4.0 supporting hardware/software<br />
and it <em>seems</em> to work because of backwards compatibility ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            According to this Microsoft document, Windows 7 does not have "in-box" support for Bluetooth 4.x:&nbsp;
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bluetooth/bluetooth-support-in-previous-windows-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bluetooth/bluetooth-support-in-previous-windows-versions</a>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, it appears that because the HP Pro Book 640 G1 was sold with a choice of "Windows 10 versions, Windows 8 versions, or Windows 7 versions," HP included hardware that supported Bluetooth 4.0 (because Windows 8 and 10 dohave in-box support
 for BT 4.0) and therefore must have included a Windows 7 driver that supports BT 4.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth headphones generally don't require their own driver.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest looking in Device Manager to find the particular Bluetooth/Wi-Fi chipset you have (probably Broadcom but possibly Intel or Qualcomm/Atheros) and checking to see if there's more recent driver from HP:&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 7 cannot find .inf printer driver for Canon Pixma iP4000 wired - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vtambore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 cannot find .inf printer driver for Canon Pixma iP4000 wired to Windows XP.</h2>
                    I have a laptop running Windows 7 (64-bit machine) that I want to print from.&nbsp; The laptop is wireless on a home network.&nbsp; The desktop is wireless as well and is running Windows XP.&nbsp; The desktop has a Canon Pixma iP4000 printer hooked up with a parallel
 cable.&nbsp; I have installed the latest XP drivers for the printer on the desktop.&nbsp; The laptop can connect directly to the printer with a USB cable and the drivers will download automatically and it will print fine.&nbsp; However, I cannot connect this printer using
 the wireless system.&nbsp; I can go on the laptop to the Home network and navigate to the printer and try to install.&nbsp; It does an automatic search and says it cannot find the proper drivers.&nbsp; I can Browse to the install file on my desktop, but it is an .exe file
 and not .inf.&nbsp; I have run the .exe file and it installs too, but the printer installer on the laptop will not let me by the add .inf screen to finish installing a wireless printer.
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?

            Question? Did you load the 64x driver into the XP machine? If not you will need to do this to make it work across a network. To install the 64x driver into XP first you need to download the 64x driver for XP. After you have the download you will do the
 following, first open printers and faxes, go to your printers properties, next go to the sharing tab, click share this printer, now push the Additional Drivers button, makes sure both x86 and x64 check boxes are checked. After you have both checked you will
 be asked to install the x64 driver so have your media ready. After its installed lets go to the Windows 7 laptop and get it ready to print. First go to Devices and Printers, then click Add a printer, next click "Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer",
 and it will show up in the printer list but if it doesn't then click "The printer that I want isn't listed". What you do next is push the radio button "Select a shared printer by name" and put in the computer name of the XP machine then put in the name of
 the shared printer and it should look like this "//Computername/SharedPrintername". At this time what will happen is it will say the XP computer would like to install a driver for the printer. Of course the print driver that the XP computer will try to install
 will not go but you should be able to say I have a disk a some point and then use the Windows 7 driver for the install that you can download from the same place you got the XP x64 driver. If it downloads into the system go ahead and do a test print and see
 if it is printing. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps

<p>Most likely the XP driver name is different than the 64bit driver name.&nbsp; Create a Local Port that copies the print formatted data to the Windows 7.</p>
<p>Here's a knowledge base article how to do this for mismatched driver names.&nbsp; Substitute the Windows 7 machine for the NT4 machine referenced in the article.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282842</span></a></span></p>
<p>If you load the 32bit print driver onto the 64bit machine you will need the Windows 7 32bit driver.&nbsp; You can do this if you have a Windows 7 32bit machine on the network to push the drivers up to the machine sharing the printer.&nbsp; The&nbsp;are no flat files on
 the Windows 7 DVD, you need to install the OS or mount the ISO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The key to print sharing success between&nbsp;machines running different architecture processors is driver name matching.&nbsp; PCL6 does NOT equal PCL 6.&nbsp;</p>

                    On start up I get: an Error occured while loading resource DLL<br />
<br />
&nbsp;In the next window it shows me (sorry it is a German laptop and I might not be able to translate it into proper&nbsp; english):
<br />
Error&nbsp; while loading C:\Program~1\ThinkPad\UTILIT~1\PWR MGRTR.DLL&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The laptop is running fine but it is not able to find our router anymore, so it is unable to connect to it and go online. No internet.....<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
The laptop is a Lenovo Thinkpad T61 and it is running on XP Professional. I am not very good in computers at all and I really could do with some help for DUMMIES!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Btw, I am a German living in the UK and the laptop speaks German as well....<br />
I'd be happy for any advice!!<br />

<h3> zyrl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Gateway Not Available &#40;Ethernet&#41; - Recurring on a windows 10 clean install.</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I've just about lost all hope which is why I've decided to finally post a question of my own. For the last month, I have suddenly started experiencing a "default gateway is not available" for reasons I can't understand. I have been using the same
 isp, router, cable, programs, etc. I can't recall installing any programs that might've changed my settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward, for the last month, I've been struggling to find ways to fix it and have scoured multiple threads ranging from:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>updating my drivers</li><li>rolling back my drivers</li><li>resetting the internet settings</li><li>uninstalling my drivers</li><li>changing my drivers with another one that's compatible with it</li><li>using a different isp</li><li>using a different router</li><li>using a different cable</li><li>disabling dhcp and manually inputting the ip (did not work)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>And nothing has stuck. I get the default gateway is not available error every 5 - 30 minutes, I'd run the trouble shooter, fix it by resetting my ethernet and the whole cycle starts again. I know for a fact that it's just my laptop somehow because I can
 connect with my other devices just fine through wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One might ask, why don't you just use wifi then, if it works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE THING IS. My setup is a razercore v2 + razerblade stealth 12.5, which has weird problems with 2.4ghz wifi (and my isp's router doesn't have 5ghz enabled so I really have no choice), which means I won't be able to use my monitor/gpu at all if I use wifi
 and it's kind of the thing that I do need the most for work/gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's the thing. I NEED for this to work with my ethernet, and I've just had about enough so I reset my laptop today with a clean install but the problem persists. And I'm clueless as where to go next. If anyone could help out or throw some suggestions,
 I'm desperate for it. Please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ethernet driver: <strong>ASIX AX88179 USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter</strong></p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently just purchased a Windows 8 computer, and entered in a lot of important events and dates on the Windows 8 Calendar App. Currently I have Google Calendar app installed on my Android phone. Is there any way to sync my Windows 8 calendar on my computer
 with my Google Calendar app so that whatever I input on my computer will automatically sync with my Google Calendar app on my phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If NOT, is there an app I can download from the "Play Store" that syncs up with Windows 8 Calendar App? I don't mind installing a new app, I just want to make sure I can access all the events, dates on my phone after I input them on the calendar on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can sync all the events add on your Calendar app on Windows 8 or Windows Phone to your Google Calendar App. All you need to do is you have to sign in to a Microsoft Account and all the events of the Windows Calendar App will associated with that
 Microsoft account will automatically sync. Then you can import those events following the steps given in the link below.

I would like to tell you that IMAP reads all the emails on the server and downloads what the user wants to read. It also doesn’t delete anything on the server. As the Mail app is based on IMAP, the emails from the account supporting IMAP will be automatically
 stored on the server.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Windows 7 defrag is deleting restore points - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 defrag is deleting restore points</h2>
                    My computer came with a number of tasks already scheduled. Up until now, I've left them alone to wreak havoc as they please, but I recently realized that after the scheduled defrag each week, all my restore points are gone.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read about this problem with third-party defrag programs, but this is Windows 7 very own defrag utility.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read about system restore points being deleted at reboot, but that's not an issue. I can reboot to my heart's content, and the restore points remain safe and steady.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is not a critical issue, but it annoys the heck out of me. Windows' very own defrag utility should not be doing this. I would be exceedingly grateful if someone were to offer a clue or a suggestion.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

It's deleting mine. I've tested this more than once. The only restore points that are being shown are from my system images.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Here are the current restore points:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkbulfz02rdgsd6/Restore%20Points.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkbulfz02rdgsd6/Restore%20Points.JPG</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is what the current settings look like:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bvgtc1p46tyb3xo/SysRes%20settings.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/bvgtc1p46tyb3xo/SysRes%20settings.JPG</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Note that those are not my settings. System Restore was formerly (and now again) set like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/f0ktstjrc57arry/Former%20SysRes%20settings.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/f0ktstjrc57arry/Former%20SysRes%20settings.JPG</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>When I realized I had a problem, I kept an eye on it. It only happens when the scheduled defrag runs. The restore points are deleted and the allocated space falls back to zero. That's just a fact.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>At first I though it was the reboot problem:</div>

<div><br />
<div>I did all that, but it wasn't necessary because it's not happening when I reboot (again, tested again and again--I'm the reboot queen).</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is the error message I get at the same time that defrag is running. It is the only error message in the event viewer. This is one example, but it happens every single time defrag runs:</div>

<div>The only third party maintenance utility I use is CCleaner, and a lot of the default settings are unticked just because I want to avoid removing anything important. Piriform's great, but they make mistakes too. I do not use a registry cleaner. Learned
 that lesson years ago (on a different machine). I do not use Disk Cleanup.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Most often, there's no need for me to post about a problem because the question I have has been answered by someone somewhere. This time, I'm at a total loss. I know there have been issues similar to this when using third-party defrag utilities, but (having
 learned that lesson too, again on an entirely different machine), I let Windows take care of its own.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Call me "mystified."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Edited to add: Re the volsnap error, I have run the system file checker. More than five times. I have also used ckhdisk and two different disk diagnostics programs. All is well if the reports are to be believed. No malware either.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just didn't want to waste anyone's time making suggestions for things I've already done.</div>

<p>Whether it is defrag, that deletes the Restore Points, or some other service, I dont know. However,

            Hi xjah,
<div><br />
<div>As you can see, I never received a reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I noticed the other day that it still happens. I'm guessing that most people won't be aware of it unless they find themselves needing a restore point that doesn't exist.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've searched extensively for more information, but I cannot point you to anything that will help. Sorry.</div>

            I found the following question and answer in the FAQs section of the UltraDefrag Handbook. (UltraDefrag is a well-known and highly-regarded free defragmentation utility). The question and its answer most likely apply to all defragmentation utilities, including
 the defragmentation utility built into Windows.<br />
_______________<br />
<br />
<i>After defragmentation I see my restore points disappeared, what happens?<br />
<br />
This is a normal situation when restore points disappear after an intensive disk processing. Windows limits amount of disk space reserved for restore points. When you perform intensive disk processing, Windows tracks changes through system restore, therefore
 the mentioned limit may be easily exceeded which results in old restore points deletion.<br />
<br />
We would recommend to avoid the use of restore points for serious purposes, because Windows can never guarantee that some point saved in the past will be available in the next moment. Use backup software instead, Windows already has such a program and there
 are also lots of 3-rd party programs of such kind.</i><br />

            This was a known problem in 3rd part defrag programs. It's not supposed to happen using the native defrag utility.
<div><br />
<div>And no, I don't rely on System Restore for anything except the occasional quick fix (software that I should have considered twice before installation instead of after), but it irritates me that it happens.</div>

            <p>I don't know about you, xjah, but this is still happening on my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's now more than two years later, my hard drive still hasn't failed (and all diagnostics report perfect health), but I continue to see this stupid error every time defrag runs on Microsoft's pre-programmed schedule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote a note in another (unrelated) thread about these kinds of issues. I'm sick of them. If Microsoft would just acknowledge its dratted bugs, everyone would be much happier. Bugs happen. The necessity to spend hours searching for an explanation/solution
 should not happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does some great things--right now, I'm totally in love with Office Lens--but when it screws up, it does virtually nothing to mitigate the fallout.</p>

</p><p>I don't use the restore points either, but that's not the point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I save a system image to a separate drive. That way, if my SATA drive goes bad, I'll still have a system image. I do this weekly. All my documents sync to OneDrive (free, with my Office 365 subscription) or Dropbox. Dropbox is a paid subscription with the

 No pre-installed...um, I suppose there's an expletive filter on this site, so...stuff on my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having done all that, I still have this issue which is annoying because Microsoft could so easily say, "indeed, this happens, don't worry about it, we'll get around to fixing it one of these days." Instead, it lets me chase around the internet looking for

            Rhonda, I run Windows 7 Professional, and groups of restore points do indeed occasionally disappear, even though I have allotted a huge amount of space for them. Therefore, I am also using ERUNT for registry backups. Defragmenters won't erase ERUNT registry
 backups. It's comforting to know that, if an old registry backup is needed, the registry backup will be there. ERUNT keeps its files in a subfolder within the Windows folder, and defragmenters won't erase files within the Windows folder.<br />

</p><p>Thank you. I appreciate the reply.</p>

</p><p>I stopped using ERUNT several years ago. I'd had a problem with an antivirus scanner, and I attempted to restore from ERUNT, only to find that more than a mere registry restoration was required. After talking to the developer (of the scanner), it turned
 out that when the same issue had occurred to other users, System Restore did fix the problem, but ERUNT simply...didn't. I ended up restoring from an image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The...I don't know if it's irony, exactly...but the humor in all this is that I do not use System Restore (which is why I'd always used ERUNT). I either restore from an image or I do a repair install or a clean install (depending on the problem). I have
 never trusted System Restore (with good reason, I think). Still, I am very fond of options, so I allow it some disk space, just in case, and it irritates the bejesus out of me that it doesn't behave as promised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have a laptop running Windows 7, but I think I've decided to upgrade it to Windows 10. My current Windows 10 install is very nice, and now that most of the really annoying problems have been addressed, I'm quite comfortable with the features it offers.
 (Admittedly, Microsoft has done some really goofy stuff, but it doesn't come up often enough to drive me bonkers. See picture here: &nbsp;http://aviationhumor.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Microsoft-Windows-10.jpg)</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the keyboard drivers. Also</span><span><span>update
 it with the latest drivers&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span><span>from the &nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/index.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;~ck=anavml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>manufacturer’s
 website</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To remove and then reinstall the drivers, follow these steps:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Disconnect the device from the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Turn off the power for the device, if the device has a separate power supply.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Open Device Manager. Click Start, type device in the Start Search box, and then click Device Manager
 in the Programs list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Double-click Keyboard, right-click the keyboard that you use, and then click Uninstall.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: If your device is not listed, this means that the device was removed automatically when you disconnected the device.
 Go to the next step.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Restart the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, turn on the device, if you have to, and then plug the device into the computer. Your computer detects
 the device and then reinstalls the drivers for the device. Then update it with the latest drivers.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2 touch&#47;keyboard problems. Plz help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tywaztyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 touch&#47;keyboard problems. Plz help</h2>
                    Hello! I'm having some pretty frustrating issues with my Surface Pro 2. My touch keyboard does not pop up automatically anymore even if i click on an address bar on Internet Explorer or chrome. It's not happening with everything but almost everything on
 my Surface including Windows explorer. I can manually click the keyboard icon on the taskbar each time but it gets old, fast. also doing this for some reason minimizes my window screen size to fit the keyboard, so when i'm done typing i have to readjust that
 window size. frustrating.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, when on the internet I cannot "click" any links with my finger anymore and must use the surface pen. when I finger click i see the circle on the screen that shows that it reads my touch input but that's all that happens. I can even hold my finger
 click to bring up the right mouse button options. this is also very frustrating because it means if I ever lose my pen, then I'm in deep trouble. very frustrating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Lastly, sometimes when not in the metro style start page, I would tap the windows start sensor below the screen, feel it vibrate, but it will not take me back to the start menu. :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help! any and all assistance would be most appreciated! open to all troubleshooting ideas</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just noticed that I can't even open the drop down menu on this page without the pen. ugh.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Skype tries its best to ensure as many exchanges as possible are included in the Skype Number program, however this is not always possible for any number of reasons.&nbsp; You would need to select an area code closest to the location you wish to have your Skype
 Number, from the list of options available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it takes a while for new area codes, such as the addition of "overlays" to existing area codes, to be added once numbers in that new area code are available.</p>

                    <p>I've recently changed my email password and I expected my Microsoft account to synchronize it with my Skype, Xbox, OneDrive and Win10 accounts​. But now I see I was wrong. I have no access to any of those accounts and I'm signing in on my Win10 user as temporary
 account. I still have access to my email​ though, which makes me sure it's not a wrong password case. It's a synchronization problem. I really don't know what to do. It's frustrating when things don't work, worse than that, it's even more frustrating when
 work gets delayed.</p>

<h2>            Display Driver stopped working  HP4520s  -</h2>
                    <p>Regularly my AMD display driver stops working on my HP Probook.&nbsp; This is basically a brand new Probook.&nbsp; It happens when I am in my Windows Live Mail quite regularly.&nbsp; It happens when watching a youtube video and then switching to email.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp; predictable
 exactly, just that it happens often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I have updated my drivers awhile back, and it still happens.</p>
<p>I have now tried adding&nbsp;a DWORD and changing the TDRDelay to 2 seconds.&nbsp; I'll try 8 seconds if 2 doesn't work.</p>
<p>And I've run an update again (something which it should be doing automatically).</p>
<p>It would be nice if the answers given to this question were not just "shots in the dark" but proven to work.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>This is a known issue with the nVidia graphics cards.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>One of the forum users has found a temporary fix to this issue. Check the post by Mamoza on Friday, March 26, 2010 at 6:58 PM in the link below.<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/46f1f9d0-313a-4182-a56f-1604edf04448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/46f1f9d0-313a-4182-a56f-1604edf04448</a></div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>Another user resolved the silmilar issue on an nVidia card on this thread. Check TallBen's post on Thursday, February 25, 2010 at 1:35 AM in the link below:</div>
<div><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistagaming/thread/6a07a6e9-7a46-4efe-8c99-1de8b050ae36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistagaming/thread/6a07a6e9-7a46-4efe-8c99-1de8b050ae36</a></div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong></div>
<div>I would ask you to check with the nVidia for a possible fix on these drivers.

<h2>            Printer keeps going &#34;offline&#34; and I get &#34;active directory domain services not active&#34; error message</h2>
                    I have a 2 month old HP laptop with Windows 7. I had a HP Photosmart 2710 that kept going off line so I purchased a new printer, EPSON Stylus NX510 and now it keeps going offline. When I do the troubleshooting, it says it is off network. Then I get a message
 that says "active directory domain services not active" when I try to fix it. I have searched for new driver updates and there are not any available. I think it is something in windows 7. Please help!!

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Is the printer connected to a network?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If yes, then is it wired or wireless?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to download the drivers from the below website and try installing and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/SupportWindows7Details.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=128288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/SupportWindows7Details.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=128288</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>I would also suggest you to restart print spooler service and check if it helps, here is the link:</span></span></p>

<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If nothing helps, then I would suggest you to uninstall all the drivers related to hp printer and Epson printer from the computer. Use Windows installer cleanup utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Download Windows installer cleanup utility from the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Once you remove all the drivers completely from the computer, try downloading the drivers from the above link
 and then try installing the printer and check if you get the same problem.</span></span></p>
