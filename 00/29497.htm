<h2>            Webcam Driver Update is Automatically Deleted</h2>
                    <p>I have attempted to install updated drivers for my laptop webcam. I have run as Administrator, Run the install as part of teh Advanced options Start Up option 7 (unsigned drivers) and attempted the original software as supplied with the PC when running 8
 and the drivers still default back to the Windows webcam drivers of 2006. What I continue to get is the following string when I look at the device events that the first</p>

</p><p>Driver Management concluded the process to install driver usbvideo.inf_amd64_2ed0a6e9573b2d18\usbvideo.inf for Device Instance ID USB\VID_1BCF&amp;PID_2C18&amp;MI_00\7&amp;22116BC6&amp;0&amp;0000 with the following status: 0x0.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The only driver that Windows 10 will allow to run my webcam is 10.0.10586.0 the default Microsoft Driver from 21/06/2006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now as the default Windows driver constantly crashes in Skype and other streaming application as well as only allowing the default 320 x 240 resolution (maybe 640 x 480) if I'm lucky. I have a HD webcam which I would appreciate to use at the 1240 x 720 resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Windows 10 will not allow 3rd party Video Camera Drivers to install, I was enquiring as to when an update from the 2006 drivers will be available? To allow all users to utilise their hardware to teh capacity that the original manufacturers of their products
 intended.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My apologies as I now realise that I did not also include in my original query that I had uninstalled the default webcam driver and then rebooted to ensure that the windows default driver had successfully uninstalled. I then once again attempted to install
 3rd party driver software, and once completed rebooted again as per the driver install requirements. Once the system had rebooted I checked the driver to confirm that it had updated and the driver was back to being the default Windows 21/06/2006 version&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">10.0.10586.0.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you visit the website of your computer's manufacturer and check if the latest driver is available. You can also check from the webcam manufacturer's site as well for the latest driver update.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The initial drivers that I attempted to install are the most recent drivers for the integrated webcam. They are only for Windows 8.1 as there is not a driver for Windows 10 available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my searching through the internet for a solution to my issue I have noted that there are several users of many different laptop manufacturers that are having the same issue, that any attempt to update the webcam driver to ensure stability as the default
 driver in Windows 10 is unstable with the hardware of my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have received a warning message that Windows 10 is blocking the publisher of the software that I need to run to update the webcam drivers, and when I do install the driers by using administrator command prompt Windows 10 automatically deletes the installed
 driver and re installs the default Windows driver. This occurs even when Windows 10 has had the default driver un installed. Once a reboot has occurred the driver returns the deleted driver message in the event viewer and reinstates the default Windows driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions remain how do I stop windows 10 from rolling back the installed drivers?
</p>
<p>Is there an issue between Cyberlink and Windows that means that I will be unable to complete this update due to the fact that the update software is automatically blocked when I initially attempt to install it?</p>
<p>And finally why would Windows 10 only be running a webcam driver made for Windows XP? and not allowing owners to upgrade their hardware drivers for later versions of Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that the reason I have come here is due to being unable to find a solution anywhere else, I also note a I am not the only user with this issue. As the manufacturers / coders of the OS I thought it best to go to the source</p>

<p>You'll want to search in Store for apps. Once Store is open, sweep in slightly from the right edge of your screen to bring up the Charms, select Search. Try different search terms, video, video editor, etc.
</p>
<p>I hope you find what you need, new apps are added constantly. </p>

            Unfortunately you can't physically add space to a hard drive. You can delete files to clear up space, run the disk clean utility or buy a secondary hard drive to house your Windows installation

<br />
<br />Hi Robin.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>

<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the Spring Creators Version 1803 since successfully installing it when released in the next few days will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place.
<br />Track release of v.1803 here:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />Then install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hello 13057532768
<br />When Windows 10 goes to download a new version of Windows, the system itself analyzes your hard drive to verify that it has enough space and, if not, it shows us a window indicating that you do not have enough space. 
<br />
<br />In order to proceed with the update of the operating system it is necessary to fulfill two points: the first one is to have enough space in C to install the new version, an essential step to continue, while the second one is optional, and we can choose between free up at least 10 GB more space so that the system can process the update without problems and make the backup or connect a USB memory and delegate this task to that memory. 
<br />
<br />If we have a memory on hand and connect it, there is no problem, when selecting Windows it will be used to carry out the update. However, if we do not want to use external storage, we will have to free more space on the disk, and what better way to do it than from the Windows 10 space healer, which will allow us to erase all temporary files from our system. 
<br />
<br />Once Windows has enough space to update, it will automatically recognize it and tell us that everything is correct and we can continue. If Windows does not automatically recognize the released space, we must click on the icon that appears next to the release button to update the status of the hard disk and, then, should appear as correct with its green mark. 
<br />
<br />The Windows Update wizard can now continue with its update work. This will automatically continue to perform the additional checks and configurations to begin the installation and ensure that it is done normally. 
<br />
<br />Now we just have to wait and follow the steps that will appear on the screen, if any, to continue with the process of updating our Windows 10. Once the update process is complete, we will have the latest version of Windows installed. in our system.

            Hi 13057532768,
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD (28GB usable) is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />You will need to create the installation on another PC, since you do not have enough space
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Chayce 
<br />
<br />If that account did not previously have an Email address associated with the account, that must have a local user account, try switching back yo a local account
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and enter a new password if required, or leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App

<h2>            Networked Recycle Bin Corrupted</h2>
                    On my computer the "My Documents" files are located on a networked drive (\\Drive\share\Allen\My Documents).&nbsp; When I click on the Recycle Bin icon the Recycle Bin associated with My Documents always generates a warning box that shows it as corrupted.&nbsp;
 With the Corrupted warning box I can either select to empty the "corrupted" bin or leave it as is.&nbsp; As some have suggested, I've deleted the $RECYCLE.BIN file found in the My Documents folder, but&nbsp;when it is regenerated I get the same warning.&nbsp; The recycle
 bin seems to be saving deleted files, but they cannot be viewed - only deleted.&nbsp; (the "Digital Pictures" files are also on a networked drive and have the same problem).&nbsp; I'm using Windows Vista Ultimate, is there someting I can to to fix this?<br />

<h2>            Windows Start Menu Showing nearly only Download Symbols</h2>
                    <p>The update of Windows has destroyed the start menu. Clicking on the icons just sais - wait until this is completed. It now runs for days and still has not changed. What kind of update is this? Very frustrating that Microsoft does not get their act together
 on those updates.</p>
<p>Would appreciate if anybody has an idea what it causing this.</p>

            Hi DerWebProfi 
<br />
<br />Are those tiles with the arrows on them new tiles that were not originally on your Start Menu?
<br />
<br />If so, this has been reported with the large feature update, the best option is to just right click those and choose either 'Unpin from Start' or 'Uninstall' . . .

<p>Unsure - some of them were definetly apps that I used. But not sure if Microsoft added some.&nbsp; I can of course unpin them and add again the apps that I need. But that is not the purpose of an update I think.</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 Home Premium, SP1, 64 bit. &nbsp;
<div>on Acer 5830TG (i7, 6GB ram etc)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Suddenly developed driver problems this morning &lt;following update&nbsp;Security Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 4 on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems (KB2539636)&gt;

<div><br />
</div>
<div>On bootup, the USB ports are not enabled.&nbsp;</div>

<div>"There is a problem with the driver for Intel(R) 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller - 1C26. Reinstalling the driver might fix this problem."</div>

<div>Also:</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Again, reinstalling appears to work.</div>

</div>
<div>I then have functioning USB ports, until the next time I shut down and reboot when&nbsp;I have exactly the same problems again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've downloaded and installed the latest Intel drivers &lt;Chipset_Intel_9.2.0.1021_W7x64_A&gt; but no cure there.</div>

</div>
<div>Health check reveals:-&nbsp;The device, TCP/IP Protocol Driver, is reporting "tv_ConfigMgrErr24". This device will not be available until the issue is resolved. The Plug and Play ID for this device is ROOT\LEGACY_TCPIP\0000.</div>

<h2>            FIFA 12 &#38;quot&#59;The EA servers are not available at this time. Please try again later.&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>When FIFA tries to connect to the EA servers, I get a error message:&nbsp;<strong>"The EA servers are not available at this time. Please try again later."&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This happens when I use the wireless network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I've searched the net, talked with EA online help ect.</p>
<p>Things I've done:</p>
<p>1. Deleted memory cache</p>
<p>2. Moved FIFA 12 save game and Gamertag to USB</p>
<p>3. Fixed the router to a more "open" setting, just like this forum said:&nbsp;<a href="http://forum.ea.com/uk/posts/list/1042338.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.ea.com/uk/posts/list/1042338.page</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And still no solution!! (sometimes I'll get through, some times it says "EAS FC ERROR", and I'm starting to get really fed up.</p>

<p>So... What to do??</p>

<p>If you are able to play via ethernet cable, I'm guessing your issue lies in the wireless. Please go to
<a href="http://speedtest.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://speedtest.net</a> on a computer on the same wireless network as your console, take the test there, and post the result image back here. You can also try power cycling the router and modem, just
 to see if this is a temporary issue. Let me know what happens with these steps. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Why Mirosoft why&#63; Do you ignore the requests of long time skype users and force them to upgrade or stop using</h2>
                    <p>Why did you do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype users have been telling you since you moved away from the 'Classic' versions why they liked certain features and did not want to lose them and all you came up with were cumbersome workarounds with comforting words about listening to your users and
 providing my fixes, you only have to look at the message boards today to see what some of your users think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think personally that this stinks, you took away contact info about who was online, away etc, and replaced, eventually, with Skype active, this is not the same and does not give the same look, feel and usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am sure you are aware this is not the only complaint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So today I accepted the upgrade as the choice was&nbsp; accept or do not run, in the hope you had fixed my own particular concerns, you have not met my hope, and also that if you have not listened to the historical users out there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I then tried to go back to a more acceptable version and you do not allow this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore you now give me no other benefits over my contacts in that I like to see if are available prior to calling as I live in a different time zone to most of my contacts. From now as&nbsp; all of my contacts have an Apple device I will move to Facetime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only reason I have a microsoft account, so I will no longer need or have a reason to log on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for ruining my Skype experience.</p>

            I want to say it's severe lack of communications and unawareness as to how the product effects people outside of them. Just know<span>&nbsp;that you are not alone in your dislike for Skype 8, far from it.</span><br />
<span>Disgruntled users such as us are letting Microsoft know across every platform we can, this forum, uservoice, Twitter, even snail mail letters to their headquarters how terrible the new version of Skype is, how much we
 all relied on Skype Classic, and how we feel that what Microsoft needs to do now is focus all efforts on making Skype Classic available to us again until a point and time where Skype 8 has 100% full feature parity, and I urge you to join your voices with our
 own.</span><br />
<br />
<span>On this forum, the most voices are currently found in&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/update-on-features-added-to-the-latest-version-of/30229c55-ec21-4ccb-9a92-527bf01cdfce</span><br />
<span>as well as&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/classic-skype-who-wants-it-back-please-add-your/642be9d0-b31a-44cc-8a37-d7c929d369d7&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>however you can rest assured that in just about any thread with a high number of replies, the reason will be because of us speaking out.</span><br />
<br />
<span>The top two ideas on&nbsp; the uservoice forum are places where we encourage your votes, as well as in&nbsp;https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-welcome-to-skype-ideas/suggestions/36538813-update-the-back-end-of-skype-7-to-make-it-compatib</span><br />
<span>The reason they gave us for Skype Classic's discontinuation is a backend code problem, and we believe that Microsoft should be focusing all possible efforts to fix that backend problem so that users who relied on Skype
 Classic may one day use it again without being bothered.</span><br />
<br />
<span>On Twitter, the @Skype, @SkypeInsider and @SkypeSupport accoutns regularly ask for feedback from some, offer it there. Skype's current design director, Mark Swift, can also be found at @swift_one .</span><br />
<br />
<p>If you would like to take a slightly more direct approach, consider sending a snail mail letter to:<br />
</p>
<p><span>Office of the President</span><br />
<span>Microsoft Headquarters</span><br />
<span>One Microsoft Way</span><br />
<span>Redmond, WA 98052<br />
<br />
If you, like me and countless others, relied on Skype Classic's rich features for your private or professional life, let Microsoft know how you feel, how dissapointed you are, and how Skype 8 is in no way a serviceable replacement for Skype Classic as a desktop
 app. It is an app that has been in development for a&nbsp;<span>YEAR</span>&nbsp;and doesn't have the most requested user features, but hey, it has Alexa support!<br />
Microsoft has backed down twice on Skype 8 before and so clearly a line in the sand exists, more voices will bring us closer to that line again and perhaps a miracle will happen.</span></p>

<p>I am sorry but as I stated my Skype journey is at an end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Facetime only from now on, at least that app and what they want to do with and get from it has been pretty 'honest' from the start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I logged on one final time just to let you know that I fed back to Skype when they first started this path and ruined my iPhone version of skype which I was using in preference to Facetime. As they chose to ignore not just me but many other users you
 end up having the option to make choice and I have made mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will no longer use Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with your quest, but ultimately it's like your favourite team, a new owner bought it, they own it, we don't and they can do what they like with it, but doesn't mean you have to go along with them the option is always to find a new team.</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>Stop forcing the update and keep Skype 7 alive!</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p>We realize moving away from older versions of Skype is an inconvenience and we’re sorry for that. We wouldn’t be moving everyone forward if it wasn’t absolutely necessary. Watch this site for news about features we’re adding to the current version of Skype
 and reach out to @SkypeSupport on Twitter if you need help getting settled in the new app.</p>
<p>Thanks all for all the comments and votes around this topic"</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Make it look and work EXACTLY like classic Skype version 7</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"We hear you. We love Skype version 7 too. We’re working to build the Skype experience you’ve come to depend on for so long on today’s platforms for today’s user. It would be impossible to bring back the full catalog of features available in previous versions
 of Skype all at once, our engineering systems just don’t work that way. We are committed to evolving the current Skype experience to match your needs over time. As we release new Skype features, we’ll update this site. You can also follow @Skype and @SkypeInsider
 on Twitter for the latest news too. <br />

<p>I'm fully aware of what Petr said.<br />
Both of those responses are coming up on two months old and are unsatisfactory on all fronts. Power users who have been disrupted by this horrendous forced update demand more than platitudes and assurances by Microsoft that "they're listening, but their hands
 are tied". We want actual, honest-to-god conversation about what we as users need from Skype and for alternatives to the forced update to be discussed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The response from users is QUITE clear from this thread alone, they won't accept Skype 8's lack of choice on our end just because it's easier on Microsoft's end to do so, and the anger will persist until something happens which it already has in the past.<br />
<br />
Petr can take that to his bosses and we'll see what comes of it. He can also tell them how their review score on tech websites is tanking.&nbsp;https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.skype.com</p>

<p>Respectfully both those responses acknowledge our feedback, but that is all. They in no way
<strong>address</strong> the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second response, to be frank, deserves to be picked apart:</p>
<p>"today's user"s are the same users you had yesterday. We have not changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"It would be impossible to **<strong>bring back</strong>** the full catalog of features...all at once".</p>
<p>Don't "bring [them] back", simply: do not retire one iteration before the replacement is ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft have pulled a reliable, working, "depend"able "love"d product <strong>
before</strong> the replacement has finished cooking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of us are reasonable, we understand Microsoft may have necessities that mean a new version is inevitable, we understand development of features can take time.
<em>We</em> understand. What baffles most of us is how Microsoft <strong>doesn't</strong> understand a very simple principle:
<strong>if it's not ready, don't ship it</strong>. We'll wait. When 8 is ready, and it has feature parity plus whatever new layers, features &amp; tech are required,
<strong>then</strong> push it out in parallel.</p>

    <title>How do I uninstall Windows 7 Service Pack 1 when elevated CMD prompt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beatingmybrainsout  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I uninstall Windows 7 Service Pack 1 when elevated CMD prompt removal steps does NOT work&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    I cannot remove Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (Feb 2011 build). First tried removing the KB976932 update with no success. Then tried running the CMD prompt with full admin rights using the following steps: wusa.exe /uninstall /kb:976932 which did not work.
 It, after the computer restarts, states that it was unable to configure the service pack...reverting changes.<br />
<br />
Once windows completes that and windows loads to the desktop, the service pack is still there.<br />
<br />
What else does it take to remove Windows 7 Service Pack 1?<br />
<br />
FRUSTRATED!<br />

            Yes, I installed SP1 via Windows Update. Problem is I have tried BOTH ways with no success...uninstalling KB976932 via the Control Panel&lt;Add/remove programs&nbsp; and also tried via elevated cmd prompt removal steps. Question is what else can be done to remove
 SP1 WITHOUT doing a clean reinstall? There's got to be a way to remove SP1! I have tried downloading SP1 iso file and burning to DVD and tried to re-install SP1 and it will not work...says SP1 is already installed...and there is no option to remove it via
 the DVD install. Help!<br />

    <title>windows 10 Preview Pane not working for media files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pittsburghtony  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 Preview Pane not working for media files</h2>
                    In windows 10 the Preview Pane in the Explorer is not working for media files any more. They were working great in Windows 8, then after the update it wouldn't change after showing the first media thumbnail. But as of today, 2/20/2016 it is not working
 at all. I tried a few things, like turning it off and then back on again, but it still does not work. There are no Virus, or other spyware on this computer, at least not as Windows Defender knows, there shouldn't be any anyway. The only Updates I get are those
 from Microsoft and the usual adobe and those types of programs. What is Wrong with this Windows 10? I have had quite a few Problems with Windows 10 and can't find any answers anywhere. I have several Post Questions out there and seems no one knows anything.
 What's the Deal, are there any real tech.'s working at all on this new operating system, or did they just invent it, and throw it together real quick to try and take more money away from everyone?

</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; I cannot connect to any other computers on my Home network....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go on and on but the bottom line is a free Windows 10 (from Windows 7) has essentially trashed two of my three computers.&nbsp; The few things that do work are so far removed from Windows 7 that what used to be a simple task has become a nightmare, wondering
 if it is the download, a learning experience, a bug or what have you.&nbsp; Terrible experience I don't know how to rectify.&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously installed programs seem to work as well on W 10 as W 7, but it is virtually impossible to competently and adequately MANAGE
 the two Windows 10 computers.&nbsp;In addition, I am so terribly tired of seeing/hearing the words&nbsp; "I am sorry for the inconvenience you are experiencing".&nbsp; It is not simply an inconvenience to have two computers trashed by incomplete OS software, it is a travesty.</p>

</p><p>Not to worry, I'm not holding my breath for a response, but I really hope Microsoft will read this and respond.</p>

            <p><span>1. &nbsp;Did you installed the November Major Update? &nbsp;Presumably as the downloaded installs have all been within the last 5 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>2. &nbsp;Have tried creating another User Profile? &nbsp;Yes, no change.</span></p>
<p><span>3. &nbsp;What preview appears with the Image and Video files? &nbsp;The icon for the default app.</span></p>
<p><span>4. &nbsp;What error message you can see with the search and Homegroup network? &nbsp;see A. &amp; B. below.</span></p>
<p><span>5. &nbsp;Which version of ISO image you're using to re-install Windows 10? &nbsp;No idea but for your info: &nbsp;Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, OS Build 1586.104 and one of the techs noted previously told me it was "latest" version.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A. No error message with search. &nbsp;If I look, for example, for "indexing" (without the quotes), I get a semi-blank page entitled SEARCH RESULTS (with a gear icon), the words "No results for indexing" below the title, the search box populated with the
 word indexing and an arrow above the title with a link to Settings which takes me to a page titled "SETTINGS" with nine icons (System, Devices, Network &amp; Internet, Personalization, Accounts, Time &amp; language, Ease of Access, Privacy, Update &amp; security) &nbsp;There
 is also a search box but if I populate it with indexing, the process starts over with the "No results" page. &nbsp;Further, no matter what System element I search for I get the same "No results" page. &nbsp; A1. &nbsp;If I right click the Start icon and then click Control
 Panel I go to a page entitled Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items from which I can usually find a link of some sort to the various parts of the system. &nbsp;THIS IS NOT HOW SEARCH IS SUPPOSED TO WORK!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>B. &nbsp;No error message. &nbsp;It simply does not connect the three computers I have on my network. I am not concerned with this right now and mentioned it as an example. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I NEED the preview pane issue solved. &nbsp;If you can do this I would appreciate it. &nbsp;I have found a work around for the search issue (as explained above) and the Home Group issue can wait. &nbsp;The Preview pane issue is a priority.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless Microsoft has completely lost its collective mind, there must be a setting that pittsburghtony and I are unable to find. &nbsp;I have tried "Set your default programs", "Associate a file type or protocol with a program", "Set program access and computer
 defaults" all in "All Control Panel Items&gt;System and Security&gt;Programs&gt;Default Programs; none of which I can find by using "Search" from either Cortana or the Start button but only because I happen to know they MUST be somewhere.</p>

            I tried that and it is the same on different accounts. Example, the first movie/video file you have highlighted you get its preview picture, but then any other you highlight still has the first picture. But with Audio .mp3&nbsp;files, they work fine, I get
 what each file has embedded, unless it does not have any then you don't any in the preview pane.

            <p>It's a bug in WMP's rich preview handler... and the only workaround is to disable the handler. Doing so would fix image previews, but the media can't be played from the Preview pane.

 Pane Not Refreshing Preview Image for Video Files in Windows 10</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if the folder views is set to icons, there is no point in disabling this handler, as thumbnail images render correctly anyway.</p>

<h2>            Original Star Wars&#58; Battlefront II &#40;2005&#41; to be playable on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So&nbsp;after hearing about the original xbox games that are now playable on the Xbox One, I thought of an old favorite that I'm sure a whole lot of other people would love to see. &nbsp;That game is the original Star Wars: Battlefront II from 2005. &nbsp;Even if the multiplayer servers don't come on again, I would still love to play it on the Xbox One either against the bots or split screen, just how we did it in the past. &nbsp;I would also love to see it availible through the Xbox Store as a download, that would be amazing.</p>

<p>Hi green155,</p>
<p>1. Does the issue persist with the other Ctrl key combination?<br />
2. Do the copy paste shortcut keys fail to work on all the applications or a particular application?<br />
3. Do other keyboard shortcuts work fine?<br />
4. Is it wired or wireless keyboard?</p>
<p>Check if the other Ctrl key combination works fine. Please answer the above questions, so that we can assist you better.</p>

            Thank you for your reply.<br />
I have figured out that my problem is that the CTRL key I am used to using ( on my Acer Aspire One netbook ) on the left corner of the keyboard&nbsp; (away from the open screen) is not working.<br />
I didn't realize that there is another CTRL key (on the right side below the period (.).&nbsp;
<br />
The other CTRL key works fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think my best workaround is to train myself to use the right side CTRL key.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Wishes<br />

                    <p><span><span>My company is in the process of reorganizing all our financial folders and files for the new fiscal year. We are going to copy the files from the current year into the new folder hierarchy.

            Hi AZ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes, you can customize folders and other Windows Explorer features here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/812003/how-to-modify-your-folder-view-settings-or-to-customize-a-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/812003...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>thanks Greg, I did try those but they didn't work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option for changing the icon on the shared folders (I do have the option on my desktop folders). I suspect there is some setting by our IT group that prohibits this feature on the shared drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I change the picture in the customize tab, the folder remains the same but the picture appears as if it is contained in the folder but only in the
<strong>icon views</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>details view</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I see no way to flag for instance, an individual Excel or Word file (without changing the name)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is to be able to&nbsp;mark the folder and/or&nbsp;files much like you can in Outlook with either categories or follow up flags. Perhaps Microsoft will add that one day as an enhancement to the file explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again. </p>

            HI AZ -
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to suggest this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            In details view,&nbsp;you could&nbsp;enable a column for either tags or ratings. As you finish a file or folder you could simply either give it a tag, or you could give it a star rating. Although its not as easy to see at a glance like an icon would be, but you
 aren't exactly looking for icons in detail view anyway. Or for that matter, I believe there are other columns you could play with, including one for completed.

            thanks Wileyharr, I checked into that but it looks like you need to install yet another app for that feature. I will check with the powers that be to see if we can install&nbsp;it but as with any corporate beast that is often difficult. The only column I found
 that I can change with the out of the box features is the Authors, so we may have to&nbsp;use that as a work around.
