<h2>            Can Access print to a label printer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have created a database but information needs to be added to it quickly and then print a label with 2 of the fields on it to a Brother label printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to pull the database into the software that came with the Brother printer but this created a situation where we were closing and opening applications to access the database and the label printing.&nbsp; In turn, it takes longer to close one program,
 input the information, close access then access the label printing software, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious if it is possible to add a command button on the form that will print to the label printer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should this be done as a report, and if so will the report area allow us to add data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using a very old version of Access, 2003, all that was supplied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is a newer featere of a label printer wizard?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can this be incorporated into a form button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hmm, not sure I understand but I would have set up a report and set the default printer for that report to the specified label printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no updated version of the label wizard that could be incorporated.&nbsp; Takes a little time but you should be able to format a report to print labels to your specified size and count and tie it to the label printer.&nbsp; If you are afraid of label waste
 have a look at...</p>

<p>A label IS a report, just a special type of report. When you save the report you can modify the report's Page Layout to print to a specific printer. That printer must be defined on the machine(s) that will be printing the labels.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            E72 cannot make or receive call , sms</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot make or receive call from my E72. Even cannot send or receive sms. When i dail any number a lock sign appears in front of number and nothing happens. When i restart my phone then its start working fine. I am extremely annoyed the basic functionality
 of cell phone is to make or recive call if&nbsp; we cannot perform this task what is the use of buying such expensive E-series phone. I need resolution.</p>
<p>My firm ware is 053.001</p>
<p>Model E72-1</p>

<p>I wouldn't blame Nokia, but suggest you call your mobile carrier and explain the situation.&nbsp; I have never seen the lock symbol you describe, but your account/SIM would appear to be locked.&nbsp; (Can you test your SIM in another phone?)&nbsp; Your carrier should be
 able to resolve this.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply&nbsp;I bought the E72 in October 2010 and before that i was using the same SIM with my Nokia 3110c and&nbsp;I have never faced this problem since 2008 on nokia 3110c. Although&nbsp;I will&nbsp;use my sim in another mobile for testing but appreciate any
 other help.</p>
<p>Although this is not the only issue there are other issues as well but since this is the basic functionality&nbsp;and even chinese cell gives value for money.</p>

            Another possible reason could be the Offline profile being toggled some time after you restart the phone. Yet another might be setting the phone to block all outgoing or all local calls. However, since the problem temporarily goes away after restarting,
 it would seem like there's an app relating to the calling functionality that kicks in after some time on every restart. Do you have Advanced Call Manager installed? Is it running when you're unable to make calls? If so, exit it (or change its settings). Do
 you have another app running when you cannot make the calls? Try exiting it before making the call. Point being, once the reason is known, some possible solution can be thought of.

<p>The Profile is always set to&nbsp;General, never changed to silen or offline,</p>
<p>No the outgoing calls are not blocked(<strong>I am also not receiving calls</strong>),</p>
<p>From where i can check Advanced call manager,</p>
<p>No other applications&nbsp;are running because it mostly happen early morning, Colleagues are calling and unable to reach me&nbsp;nor i can call to inform them that i am comming utill i restart the cell.</p>

            Sorry, I missed the part about the phone working *sometimes*. How long does the phone work before outgoing/incoming calls fail again? From your description, the "lock sign" seems to be generated by the E72, not by some other app. Does that seem reasonable?
 In this case, I would still like to see you contact your mobile provider to make sure there are no problems with your account. If the lock problem appears quickly after a restart, testing the SIM in another phone would also make sense.

            By an app's interference, I meant there might be some weird function of the culprit app that is hijacking the calls network, just like some viruses can cut your internet access on a computer by demanding exclusive control over that channel of networking.<br />
<br />
A query from the service provider is in order, I'd second that.

<p>I have uploaded a picture although quality is not good, i will provide a good quality picture later. If you see upper right corner above the green cradle there is an open lock.</p>
<p>What i observe is when the cell or connection is working the lock appears open but when there is problem at cell or connection end it appears as closed.</p>
<p>I told you earlier i used the same SIM with Nokia 3110c since 2008 till october 2010 it worked fine i never encountered problem of this sort.</p>
<p>As per your advice i will check with service provider also.</p>
<p>No the lock problem doesnot appear quickly after restart it take around 2 to 3 days.</p>

<p>I may have found the answer...but not necessarily the solution.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.expansys-usa.com/ft.aspx?k=41746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.expansys-usa.com/ft.aspx?k=41746</a> .&nbsp; The unlocked padlock could mean an unencrypted connection between your phone and the local GSM tower.&nbsp; But according to the link above, calls should still work regardless of the lock status.&nbsp; Are you getting
 a strong signal?&nbsp; Could you be roaming on another carrier's network?</p>

<h2>            Missing Dll&#39;s in Windows 10</h2>

<p>I installed windows 10 technical preview 9926 x64</p>
<p>DirectX 12, .net framework 4.5, Visual C++ 2010 X64.</p>
<p>When i try to launch any game i got 3 errors about missing dlls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d3dx9_43.dll X3DAudio1_7.dll XINPUT1_3.dll one after another</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kinda don't know what to install next. I didn't install any drivers cause i read it's not good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop Hp ProBook 4540s</p>
<p>Video: Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000</p>
<p>&amp;&amp;</p>
<p>AMD Radeon HD 7500M/7600M Series</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of them have a !mark in device manager. I tried to update them both but saying they are up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sound drivers appears to be good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can i download the drivers from official producer site and install them without needing to install windows 10 after? I can't find documentation about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And about those 3 missing dlls what should i install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 questions, sorry for your time. I'm not a noob, but i don't want to reinstall windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx for your time.</p>

            <p>Still on 9926. When windows try to update to later version is getting an error. Submiting that error directly to windows so in one day i'm gonna reinstall this. But for now i managed somehow to resolve my problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed again latest version of catalyst and after that i installed steam and dota. This game required directx that steam downloaded and installed it for me. Apparently it's working very good. So my opinion is that directx 12 is still not very good.
 No offense. I know this is a beta and i'm still very glad to try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That compatibility is kinda not very important because i sense this windows knows exactly what he is doing, also product companies too. Drivers are up to date without compatibility. Also most of my programs installed flawless without compatibility. I don't
 use store. I download them from internet and next next next it's still working. Thx for all replies.</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were there any changes made to the computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On which website are you playing the flash game?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try uninstalling and then reinstalling Adobe Flash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Uninstall Flash via the Adobe uninstall tool</span></strong><span> - Found here (<a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/141/tn_14157.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/141/tn_14157.html</a>), this tool is the only way to completely remove
 Macromedia Flash from your system.&nbsp; Choose the version that is appropriate for your operating system, download, and then run the program.
<br />
<br />
Once the program has run it will have completely removed Flash from your computer.&nbsp; You can verify this by trying to visit any Flash-enabled website.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reinstall Flash</span></strong><span> - Once Flash has been completely uninstalled, reinstall Flash by visiting the Adobe Flash website (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/</a>).&nbsp;
 Be sure to download the latest version (as of this writing it was version 10).</span></p>
<span>Hope this helps</span>

<h2>            Office installation stuck at 0&#37;</h2>
                    I have a office 365 subscription. I downloaded click-to-run installer of 64-bit version office. But when I run it, it's always stuck at 0%. Checking the task manager, I found it's using 0 CPU, 0 network. So what's wrong with it?

<p>Hi Luck,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your description, I want to confirm if you install Office via <a href="https://www.office.com/?auth=2&amp;home=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Portal</a>.</p>
<p>If so, I suggest you check if you have installed any anti-virus software, maybe it forbids to install Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, here is an article about the similar issue, you can try the steps to check the result:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-is-taking-long-to-install-0f09f357-3fef-42a6-b8aa-cef4c6c44bdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office is taking long to install</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information for further analysis?</p>
<p>1. Where did you download Office? Could you please provide the link?</p>
<p>2. Which version is your OS version, 64 or 32 bit? Can you install 365 bit version of Office?</p>
<p>3. Check if you have installed Office on your computer via control panel.</p>
<p>

    <title>Office 365 reseller providing licensing information I can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronaldcasey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 reseller providing licensing information I can&#39;t corroborate.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We're looking into switching over from Office volume device licensing to Office 365 ProPlus user subscription licensing. Our company needs to license about 200 users, and they're split between offices in the United States and the United Kingdom (90 / 110
 respectively).</p>
<p>We received a quote from a U.S. reseller with no objections to our users' geographical locations, however a quote from a U.K. reseller came along with this:</p>
<p><em>"Open licencing agreements can only license your region, so for instance if you bought in the UK then that would mean you can only licence within Europe."</em></p>
<p>I cannot locate anything in Microsoft's 365 licensing agreements to&nbsp;corroborate that statement. This appears to contradict it entirely:</p>
<p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/microsoft-office-license-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/business/microsoft-office-license-restrictions</a></p>
<p><em>"Customers that purchase Office 365 may assign an Office 365 license to a user that resides anywhere in the world, except for Cuba, Iran, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Skype for Business Online Plan 2 is restricted in Macao
 SAR."</em></p>
<p>Just want to make sure we're not missing some glaring detail about "regions" and Office 365 licensing.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Hi Ronald,</p>
<p><br />
After consulting the related team, it can be confirmed that Open licensing agreements can only redeem on the tenant with the corresponding billing region. That is to say, if you bought your tenant in the UK or US, the license should be bought (activated) in
 UK/US. In other words, if you bought the license from the UK, it can’t be activated in the US.</p>
<p>Also, if your license is bought from your tenant registry region, you can assign it to any user from anywhere of the world. (The exceptions are listed in the articles you provided.)</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p>as this is primarily a user to user forum, if you wish to voice your opinions, your best bet would be to click on the Contact Us link at the top of this page. there are some Nokia employees here, but they moderate these boards only and do not provide assistance
 with enquiries. therefore may be better to give your feedback via the Contact Us link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also, from what i see, the 5700 hasn't received a firmware update for about a year now, the last was 5.11 dated June 2008. as it is an older model, Nokia may have decided that the stability and reliability of the model was adequate enough to justify not
 producing any further firmware updates. however, it doesn't hurt to provide your feedback.</p>

<p>Hi, adrianhughes,</p>
<p>You're mentioning here that the 5700 firmware v05.11 dated June 2008 are already out there. But, still I haven't been lucky enough to discover these updates through NSU. Or, there is other way on how to get this updates? In my place where I come from, the
 available updates is only on v03.xx. But I've manage to update my phone to v04.21 after changing my product code to 0548931.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firmware v05.11 that you're mention here has been talked in almost 2yrs by now. Still, there is no luck by getting it via NSU. This is, what I'm talking about. Nokia people has already aware about this matters, and there is no need to tell them about it
 anymore. As for your info, this update is what I'm waiting for so long. I'm not asking for new firmware, as what we've already know that 5700 was an old product and there was no production of it anymore and so does the firmware upgrading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I'm looking for in this user-to-user forum, so that people like you and me can talk about it. And maybe, there's someone out there can provide some usefull info on how to get the update other than NSU. Perhaps, you could post any suggestion
 on "how to" in is forum rather than complaining?</p>

<p>first of all, i'm not the one complaining that they can't get access to the firmware. i simply answered your question, and nowhere in there did you state what you are stating now, that you are after the newest firmware. you simply asked if there was going
 to be new firmware. so i answer the question based on the information given to me. please don't make baseless accusations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you may have a branded handset so perhaps this is why you cannot get your hands on the 5.11 firmware. read here for a detailed explanation by one of our senior users Grschinon on branded handsets:
<a href="http://linux.sgms-centre.com/nokiafaq/branded-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://linux.sgms-centre.com/nokiafaq/branded-phones/</a> &nbsp;we are not allowed to speak of unofficial methods of de-branding your phone on these forums, so if you wish to know more,
 then Google for that information (i.e. other product codes that do have the 5.11 firmware provided to them). there is no other way to get the update other than NSU except by going to a Nokia Care Centre for them to do it for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Since the upgrade to 17046.rs_prerelease.171115-1403 whenever I plug in a USB flash drive I get the audio tone saying it is plugged in but I cannot access the drive.</p>
<p>My USB mouse and Keyboard work fine.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if I use a USB 2 or 3 slot&nbsp;</p>

<p>You do not say anything about what you have tried to fix this problem.</p>
<p>So I will guess a little.</p>
<p>Have you tried the Settings/Update &amp; Security &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Troubleshoot &nbsp; tab and select&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>Have you looked in Device Manager to see if any of USB controllers&nbsp; Have any trouble? This is where you could Uninstall any that look like they could have a problem and then look for hardware changes to replace the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you used the Admin command prompt to run sfc /scannow&nbsp; to see if it could find and fix anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many things to try.</p>

<p>You could make sure that the USB flash drive is OK by trying it in another computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If it is OK look on Disk Manager or at the Properties to see how it is formatted which on some build could make a difference.</p>

            I had the same issue with one of my USB drives. It occurred with the update to 17046 from 17040. I had an issued with another program as well, so I rolled back to 17040. It updated back to 17046 and the drive now works although the device manager still
 shows an error. I did notice when it re-updated, that the prerelease number increased from 17111<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">5</span>-1403 to 17111<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">8</span>-1403.

            <p>I have found a solution that seems to work for me but it is only for Windows 7.&nbsp; Our problem was with the Windows 7 Credential Vault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7:<br />
&nbsp;1. Close Outlook.<br />
&nbsp;2. Click Start.<br />
&nbsp;3. In the search box enter "Credential". You will then see Credential Manager.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select Credential Manager.<br />
&nbsp;5. Under Generic Credentials, you will most likely see an entry that has Outlook in the name.<br />
&nbsp;6. Delete it. In fact, you can delete all the entries in Generic Credentials if you like.
<br />
&nbsp;7. Close the Credential Manager window and open Microsoft Outlook.<br />
&nbsp;8. If it asks for a password, enter the password and check for it to remember the password.<br />
&nbsp;9. A new entry will be created in the credential vault with your latest login and password.<br />
&nbsp;10. Problem fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem for us has been that the saved password in the credential vault file doesn't appear to work (especially if we've changed the password recently) so by deleting it, another credential will be created the next time you log into Outlook with your
 latest password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Thanks for that, Gina. I've downloaded those files, but they will be used later when&nbsp;I&nbsp;revisit the use of Visual Basic with Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime&nbsp;I am still hoping to find out how to access the "normal" help files that were attached to the Office component applications.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, Gina</p>
<blockquote>Unfortunately, I have not seen hide nor hair of those help files since Access 2003.&nbsp; That said, what kind of help are you looking for?&nbsp; There are plenty of sites out there with *help*... I know, not the same but it would be

<p>
</p><p>The Help files I wanted are the standard ones attached to the query mark in the Ribbon of the various Office components or the F1 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft yesterday via the chat service and they spent several hours investigating, uninstalling &amp; re-installing stuff through a remote access connection to my PC. &nbsp;After re-installing Windows 10, as well as having done this at least four times
 to Office 365, it eventually worked. &nbsp;Apparently Office had not installed properly (though I had had it working at one time until it mysteriously vanished).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it involved three technicians, who were very helpful, and it now all works correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An interesting point is that it has always been OK on a second PC &nbsp;(also Windows 10) that I have. &nbsp; The Office version numbers were slightly different, however: 16.0.6001.1034 and 16.0.6001.1038. &nbsp; The original installations were done one immediately after
 the other. &nbsp;The only difference I can think of that may have affected it is that the "good" one had used Win 8.1, while the other had been a Win 7 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your comments on this.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - get rid of the hamburger menu - use app bars and ribbons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mihaicosmin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - get rid of the hamburger menu - use app bars and ribbons instead</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I marked this specifically as a windows desktop problem, it applies to the entirety of Windows 10 devices (that have screens ofc).</p>
<p>Anyway, the big UI problem of this system is the hamburger menu. This is one of the trendy and quite frankly, extremely annoying UI designs that have slipped through the world like the black plague (I have used this comparison on purpose, because the hamburger
 menu is much like the black plague of UI designs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, you would ask yourselves, what is wrong with this hamburger menu? Well - everything.</p>
<p><strong>First of all, its very appearance.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It brings no indications whatsoever that it actually hides important stuff. In most windows applications, the hamburger menu hides stuff that is relevant to the user -&gt; like the settings, or worse, navigation panels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've often found myself trying to figure out where the **** are all the options in my app. Nowhere to be found. Then I look, and I see the horrifying 3 line icon in the top left corner of the screen. Oh look, now all my navigation goes through there: one
 extra useless click! this makes a huge difference. Which brings us to the second problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Its positioning in the top left corner is awful</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of all the corners on the screen, the left corner is the worst, especially on mobile devices. Most people on this planet are right handed. And phones don't tend to get any smaller. I often find myself uninstalling apps on sight when they ask me to stretch
 my fingers across the screen just because of a trendy yololololo design pattern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse, it forces you to use the 2nd hand for your phone, which in some cases is not possible, or is simply not desirable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The business world sticks to the tried and tested horizontal bars</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why? because they display the obvious information to the user all at once, and there is no necessity to hide anything. The users won't just roll their eyes across the screen, see the horrific hamburger icon and uninstall the app. They see all their options
 available to them, and they proceed from there. Do you remember why the ribbon UI was added to office instead of the plain old hidden menus on a gazzillion levels? because the users have an easier time doing what they came to the app to do instead of playing
 hide and seek with the app options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The app bars and ribbons fix the problem</strong></p>
<p>Not only do these UI elements do everything the hamburger button does (i.e hide stuff if the user so desires), but they are also pretty damn obvious on your screen and they also present all of your options all at once.</p>
<p>And of course, they are neutral when it comes to left hand or right hand users on mobile devices, and of course, neither of them forces you to do awkward finger gymnastics to get what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People are ignoring the windows store on desktop because of the awkward navigation and waste of screen. Contrary to popular belief, people don't really care about how cool your UI is, if it doesn't help them get the job done faster. Yes, the hamburger is
 a quick way of getting a slick UI. But it hurts your app in the long run.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>wrapping up the story</strong></p>
<p>a) Get rid of hamburger menus. They are lazy. Stop encouraging the developers to adopt them. It will only slow down adoption of the app.</p>
<p>b) Replace hidden menus and finger gymnastics with tried and tested patterns: Pivots, tabs, hubs, app bars on mobile</p>
<p>Ribbons, tab view on large screen devices. There is a reason you wrote a 1000 pages long research on ribbons and why they are the superior design. Don't just ignore them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UIs are a means to an end, not the end itself. Keep that in mind. All the major developers who went for the hamburger menu for navigation quickly changed their mind (facebook, NBC are a few examples). When will you?</p>

    <title>Sorting Sharepoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farnarkler5150  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorting Sharepoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Sharepoint as a central problem register in which multiple work areas (HR, Finance, Property, etc) enter problems and then update their status as and when the problems are resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statuses are: New, In Progress, Outstanding, Complete, etc. A new problem has ‘New’ as the initial status (as you’d expect) and the statuses are updated as problems are resolved:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is, can Sharepoint be sorted by work area rather than status? If so, how do I set Sharepoint up to sort a new problem entered into work area rather than status.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Account verification email never received. Can no longer use Skype account.</h2>
                    <p>Anyone else have this annoying problem?</p>
<p>When trying to connect an email address to my Skype account, supposedly a 'verification email' was sent to that email address.</p>
<p>But it never arrived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter how long I waited, no matter how many days and times I tried to have it resent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing. Ever.</p>
<p>Now I can no longer log on to my Skype account, because it keeps asking for that verification code I never received.</p>
<p>All my contacts and history are in that account, and I urgently need my access back.</p>
<p>I cannot call Microsoft to speak to an actual person, and that 'support robot' is utterly useless.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>alas, the problem is the same when using Skype on my Android phone. That version too prompts me for a code from a verification email.</p>
<p>I kept a close eye on my spam/junk folder in my email right after requesting a re-send of the verification email, but nothing arrived there either.</p>
<p>Lastly, I do not know how using a different browser would make a difference. Can you elaborate on that?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ruben</p>

<p>Hi Ruben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still not receiving the code, I suggest you to recover your Skype account using this
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a different browser will help especially if the browser you are using is not updated.

<p>Hi team,</p>
<p>I did as you suggested, and I'm right back where I started. Very frustrating.</p>
<p>Account recovery worked (on the second attempt), and I was able to reset the password for my account. I even received an email confirming that I changed my password,
<p>Then the system prompted me to sign in fresh, and it accepted my new password!</p>
<p>Next it reminded me: "Your email address has not been verified", and the whole circus started from the beginning. I tried multiple times to have a verification email sent to me, from my browser and through Skype, and I never received it. Of course not.</p>
<p>So, stuck on square one again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's your advice?</p>

<h2>            Excel Live Will Not Load in IE</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows Ten with IE. I can open Outlook online, but when I try to open the online Excel - it just looks like it's trying to open the wed page, but after awhile, it just gives up and tells me I have a communication error. (It times out and gives
 up.) This happens using IE and Chrome on the Win 10 machine. It's only on Win 10. Excel will open for me in Win 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reset IE and and rebooted the machine, a few times. Any ideas??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I couldn't get IE to play videos from TV Land. Chrome would play but, IE won't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><p><span>Thanks for your answer. I had tried to download OpenOffice from openoffice.us.com which was a big mistake. I never ran the openoffice install, but somewhere it loaded some malware, which I just couldn't get rid of. I tried resetting IE, turning it

<p>For those who may not know, the only legitimate current versions of open source OpenOffice are from:</p>

<p>https://www.libreoffice.org</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original openoffice team is no longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also points out the need for better antimalware than what is pre-packaged with the operating system.</p>

            I have had a few restarts with with my N85 also. I have only noticed them while it has been charging and it looks like it happens when the Phone is reaches its maximum charge.<br />
<br />
Hopfully it is a bug that will be fixed fairly quickly.

            My N85 restarts when it's charging (totally unrelated to the amount of charge the battery has). It's been doing so both before and after the firmware update... So, which one is it: a hardware or software problem?<br />
<br />
Cheers!

<p>I am also affected by this problem. The N85 will restart, often when I am in the middle of typing a message. This is unacceptable, and has caused me to lose all faith in Nokia as a phone maker. My phone was more than $400, and I am regretting the purchase
 at this moment. Please, resolve this issue. I need a phone that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a reason why Apple is selling so well Nokia, take care of your customers, please.<br />

<p>Same problems here. Phone restarts, it happened a lot lately. Especially when playing games (very frustrating) en during charging, when the battery seems to reach the maximum. Hopefully Nokia will do something about it, because the N85 is a perfect phone
 without these issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw, I agree on the post above, Nokia could take care a bit more about their customers... installing 3rd party software for example is a real challange, seems to be only for the experts...</p>

<p>I got my N85 less than a week ago. On the day that I got, I tried connecting it to external speakers while playing music. The music keys didnt work properly and the phone just stalled for 5 mins before I had to forcibly reboot it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd, the slider panel and the battery cover does not fit well, there are tiny gaps which make the entire phone creak like an old taxi. Very saddening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Widet app is not there in phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, could not find the Voice recorder app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camera pictures are not very clear. Auto focus works slowly to get the right focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Naviwheel is pathetic. Useless. Sometimes, it doesnt work at all, other times its hyper-sensitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few instances where the centre key would not work while trying to open apps in menu mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope there's a good software upgrate coming up soon to resolve all minor issues.</p>

<h2>            Outlook mail keyboard stream interruption</h2>
                    Hi anyone seen a problem when typing email in outlook on windows desktop, where keyboard strokes randomly get interrupted and are used to create 1-3 calendar appointments? I find that happens multiple times a day.&nbsp; The appointments are all set at the current
 time of typing and have single or a few character appointment titles (based upon what was being typed). Outlook version 1904 (build 11601.20144). This has been happening over the last 8-10 weeks quite spasmodically. Any ideas or suggestions?

    <title>using more than one header in a large doc file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyshow  say:</h3>
<h2>            using more than one header in a large doc file</h2>
                    
<p>I write novels. My current manuscript is over 106,000 words. That's about 366 pages. I have the content formatting complete but I need to format the headers. The first six pages - Acknowledgements, Dedication, Copywrite, etc, use 'i,ii,iii, etc'. the content
 - the actual story, will have 'Different Odd and Even' headers including centered text and page numbering.</p>
<p>I have been working with computers, technical writing, editing and programming, since 1971. I spent many years in Software QA for some large software companies, and I cannot get Word 2007 or Word 2010 to do this. Please, please, please, somebody come up
 with a solution.</p>
<p>One fellow did answer and suggested that I pay attention to the 'Link' 'Unlink" option in the Header Navigation&nbsp; section of the Ribbon. I did. It does not change at any time, wether I have Headers formatted in the doc or not. It stays grayed out in both
 2007 and 2010 versions. I need help, please!</p>

<p>You need to insert a Next Page Section Break (Page Layout tab&gt;Page Setup&gt;Breaks&gt;Section Breaks&gt;Next Page) to separate the body of the document from first six pages, and then with the selection in the header of the second section of the document (the one
 that begins on page 7, the Link to Previous button in the Navigation section of the Header &amp; Footer Tools section of the ribbon will have an orange background if the header is linked that in the previous Section (by default it will be).&nbsp; Click on that&nbsp; button
 to unlink the header in the second section from that in the first section and also check the Different Odd &amp; Even Pages box in the Options section of the Header &amp; Footer Tools tab of the Ribbon.</p>
<p>Then, by moving to an appropriate (Odd or Even) page, you can set up the Header as required for each.&nbsp; Before setting up each Header, check to make sure that the Link to Previous button does not have an orange background. With your particular configuration
 (not having different Odd and Even in the first Section), it probably will not, but click on it if it does.</p>
<p>-- Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Meeting Requests not appearing in POP3 account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Meeting Requests not appearing in POP3 account</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are two seperate companies, Company A is running MS outlook 2010, whenever we send internal meeting requests to eachother via MS Exchange Server 2010, meeting requests are received by the mail clients fine and processed as normal, ie: they appear as meeting
 requests in the users calender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However if we send a meeting request to Company B, which is also using MS Outlook 2010, but a POP3 Internet mail account, the meeting request is always received as a plain text email. I have verified that the "Read as Plain Text" setting is&nbsp;not activated
 in the Trust centre setting as indicated on a previous reply,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Company B never receives Meeting Requests from Company A, all meeting requests are received by Company B as plain text mails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone shred some light on a possible solution ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could there be a setting on the Server that needs to be changed ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Stephen</p>
