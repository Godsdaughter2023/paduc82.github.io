<h2>            Word document not retaining outline formatting.</h2>
                    My document is not retaining its formatting (decimal outline formatting). It looks fine when I open it on my computer, but when I send it out it does not retain the outline formatting, even though it is the other person's default template.

<h2>            Unable to send email from Outlook Android app</h2>
                    I have been having problem sending emails with my Outlook Android app.&nbsp; I can receive emails with no problem but emails that I send just sit in the outbox and doesn't get sent. I tried resending the same reply a dozen times and finally gave up and used
 the web version instead.

            As I'd said in the original post, after a number of unsuccessful attempts, I accessed Outlook.com using the web browser on the same phone and was able to send the email that way. This shows that everything else was working apart from the app.<br />
<br />
There were no error messages, the messages simply sat in the outbox (could be for hours) and didn't get sent. During that time I was able to access other websites/ FB/ etc so my phone's internet connection was definitely working.<br />
<br />
It had happened a couple of times before (not sure if the same recipient or not). In the previous incidences, I could simply copy the text from what's in the outbox and resend the email. Even though that's annoying (as I wouldn't normally find out that an email
 didn't get sent until hours later) but at least I could resolve that pretty quickly. But, this time, it failed even after attempting to copy, paste and resend the email a dozen of times.<br />

            <p>I am having the same issues.&nbsp; I do get an error message "Unable to send, go to Outbox to resend".&nbsp; But when I do that, they still are not sent.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when I go to outlook.com, the 2 messages that I could not send were nowhere to be found.&nbsp; As you said in the original post, receiving is not an issue.</p>

            <p>The problem is very likely your oldest message in&nbsp;your Outlook-for-Android app's Outbox.&nbsp; In my case, my FOUR oldest messages were each problems.&nbsp; I began by&nbsp;deleting them one at a time,&nbsp;the&nbsp;oldest&nbsp;one first.&nbsp; Following each&nbsp;individual deletion,&nbsp;I returned
 to the Inbox, and clicked the Sync button.&nbsp; Upon syncing after the fourth oldest one was deleted,&nbsp;more than entire month worth of email messages that had been jammed up in my Outbox without me realizing it&nbsp;all got sent in a&nbsp;long, multi-minute sync-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE TO MICROSOFT:&nbsp; Made the Outlook-for-Android app somehow prominently display that their are unsent messages in the Outbox, like a pop-up that has to be "OK'd", rather than having to open the drop-down list of folders to see the Outbox, at which time
 I am usually on my way to a specific folder, and immediately start scrolling without even noticing that their are one or more messages indicated in the Outbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail's individual email message attachment size&nbsp;limit is still 10MB, I believe--has been for many years.&nbsp; All of the messages blocking my Outlook-for-Android app's Outbox were less than 10MB (Hotmail, itself, as opposed to the Outlook app,&nbsp;had given me
 an error when I tried sending them together as one email message, so I broke them up into four separate messages).&nbsp; So, I don't think the problem had anything to do with size of the attachments.&nbsp; Maybe&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;had something to do with&nbsp;the&nbsp;fact that they
 had attachments, at all,&nbsp;however, and&nbsp;maybe not--personally, I don't think so.&nbsp; What I am pretty certain&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;had to do with was&nbsp;my connection status when I tried sending the messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All four of them were attempted sends from the same physical location at approximately the same time.&nbsp; At that time, I was vacationing&nbsp;in a location that was not serviced by my carrier, and although my voice service was roaming, roaming was not available
 for data service unless I&nbsp;paid for it (T-Mobile in Montana), which I didn't, so I only had a data connection if and when I was connected to Wi-Fi.&nbsp; I don't believe I had turned off my phone's mobile data radio, however, so I believe&nbsp;my phone (an LG&nbsp;Nexus 4)&nbsp;was
 making attempts to link up to data towers, and I believe my phone was in some sort of limbo or error state between the Wi-Fi radio and the mobile data radio when I attempted to send the emails (I believe all email activity is via&nbsp;data connections, but even
 if not, these four messages would definitely have required a data connection, due to the images I had&nbsp;attached to them).&nbsp; I believe this limbo or error state&nbsp;caused some sort of malfunction that either Android or the Outlook app wasn't able to rectify, even
 after an eventual data connection was established.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole process created a bit of a&nbsp;headache for me, as I didn't know whether recipients would receive them in their Inbox as current ("Today's") receipts, or whether they would&nbsp;be placed in&nbsp;their Inboxes chronologically by the date I originally created
 them and tried sending them, in which case the recipient&nbsp;may never even notice them being received--except for them showing as "Unread" messages, I suppose.&nbsp; In my "Sent" folder, they displayed as though they had been sent on the date I created and first tried
 sending them.&nbsp; It turns out that the messages were received by recipients the same way--as&nbsp;if they&nbsp;had been received&nbsp;the dates I had created and originally attempted sending them.&nbsp; Many people were unaware of their existence, therefore,&nbsp;and so I sent follow-up
 duplicates with an explanatory note included.</p>

<p>I am having similar issues but my sent item just goes to drafts. Resending from drafts fails again. I have deleted the account and readded with the same result. I have uninstalled and reinstalled with the same results. I can send properly with the Web app
 and with desktop outlook. Why can't I send with Outlook for Android?&nbsp;</p>

 to a landline phone, the incoming audio becomes garbled after about 5 minutes. Since I pay money to call landlines, I expect Skype to work. Else, give me my money back!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Sound Settings showed that there were <strong>two</strong> instances running of the "ALSA plugin for skypeforlinux".&nbsp; The mute box of one of them worked, while the other was ineffective.&nbsp; Why two?<br />

Curiously, the bottom edge of the settings window was unsteady, flickering at a rate of about 3X/sec.</p>

<p>Why I say this, there has always been strange bugs in Skype/Linux since Microsoft bought it. Specially the low resolution seemed like a "programmed" bug that however looks more like an OS problem and as such discourages people to use Linux.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I installed the new skype I was positively&nbsp;surprised that all of that was gone ... until I experienced these audio noise&nbsp;disabling feature which again looks like a programmed one. It is used in Audio SW a lot, to disable demos for serious use.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2016 for Mac with Office 365 for Students</h2>
                    
<p>I have Office 365 for students. I only see Excel, Word, Power Point and Notes.</p>
<p>The software that I actually needed was Access 2016 or 2013 for my Database class this semester. However, I only found a $79 (for students) version of Microsoft Office 2016 For Mac Ultimate Essentials Bundle (Student Download) MAC. The only problem is that
 the Windows version comes with Access 2016, but the Mac version doesn't. I can't seem to find how I can get Access for Mac. Could anybody help me find an affordable version?</p>
<p>My college works with Microsoft Alliance (Dreamspark) which doesn't have Access for Mac, only windows, and the $79 software I found was through CollegeBuys, but it doesn't come with Access.</p>
<p>Please give feedback ASAP because the semester already started and I already have to start working on my assignments.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you in advance.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per your query, I understand that you want to dial contacts using your phone. As of now, there is no such feature in Outlook 2016. But you will be able to call using Skype. Please check
 and verify if Skype Add-in is enabled in Outlook.<br />
<br />
Please follow the article for information on Skype 6.1 for Windows Desktop with Outlook Integration:</span></p>

            If the table has merged cells, there is a known problem, with a simple enough fix:
MERGED TABLE CELL IN WORD OR OUTLOOK DON’T WORK
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/After-installing-KB-3213656-or-KB-4011039-merged-table-cells-don-t-work-correctly-in-Word-or-Outlook-8c7af9eb-9e48-4e1e-8c13-6340ede4acdc 

•	If you merge vertical cells in a table, the cell content disappears, and you can’t select the merged cell.
•	If you open an existing document that has a table with merged cells, the cells will appear to be blank.

Fix: uninstall KB 3213656 and/or KB 4011039

<p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>Adding *.1stsource.com to your Trusted Zones list should do the job (also accept the default security settings for all zones)</p>
<p>If you still have problems after doing that, go to the Advanced tab of Internet Options and press the "Reset Advanced options" button.</p>
<p>If you still have problems go to <a href="http://www.enhanceie.com/ua.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.enhanceie.com/ua.aspx</a> to test your browser's userAgent string (this is what web sites use to determine which web browser you are using).</p>
<p>Sometimes the userAgent string can be corrupted by other programs and cause web sites to wrongly identify your browser (banks don't usually allow webbots on their secure sites). The instructions at enhanceie will identify if you userAgent string is corrupt
 and give you instructions on how to fix it.</p>
<p>If your userAgent string is too long (max. 200 characters... again enhanceie will tell you this) contact your System Administrators and tell them of such as they may have a Group Policy setting (that you can't change) that alters the browser's userAgent
 String.</p>
<p>Get them to post back on this thread as they will need detailed instructions on how to correct the issue.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>I had a closer look at the web page.</p>
<p>Check your computer system clock time. Has it switched to DLST (Daylight saving time). Possibly your CPU battery is flat and needs replacing. (Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Date and Time)</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

                    Hi, I'm Alessandro from Milan and I always use nokia pc suite. In this new version 7.0.7.0 I find an error or maybe a problem about the possibility to check the total amount of sent items(messages) in the Nokia Communication Centre. I see that in the english
 version there is no problem but in the italian version there is. I attached also a photo of the problem. I hope to be clear.<br />
Here a photo of the problem: <a href="http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/5340/problemaxg4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi ale_spa,<br />
<br />
Are you using the same language (in your case it is italian language) in Nokia PC SUite, Phone and PC, because, as per user's guide of Nokia PC SUite, "You should use the same language in the phone, the operating system, and Nokia PC Suite, if possible. This
 allows your phone to function properly with all Nokia PC Suite applications."

            hi cricfancy . Thanks for your fast reply.Maybe I explain the problem in a wrong way.<br />
Well, I try both italian and english pc suite. I have italian phone but in the italian pc suite version I see the visualization problem of the number of sent items (see photo). In the italian version there is the problem ( in the photo you can read "messaggi
 inviati..." and I can't resize the column to see the number of items). Is it possible to fix that problem? I hope to be clear..<br />
<br />
Here a photo of the problem: <a href="http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/5340/problemaxg4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi ale_spa,<br />
<br />
If your issue is about no of sent items, what you can do, select all the messages in sent folder and export it into .csv file and you can find out how many messages are sent from your phone :)

<h3> gbutchee  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m having trouble with data types importing from Excel 2010 to Access 2010</h2>
                    <p>My son, a football coach, and I have almost completed&nbsp;an Access 2010 application that will help him maintain statistics for the games his team plays.&nbsp; This component will integrate with the personnel and weight ligting components that already exist.</p>
<p>The currently existing application is in Excel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The coaches manually fill in the required statistics on a piece of paper during the game.&nbsp; After the game, these values are entered into an Excel spreadsheet.&nbsp; That remains the same.&nbsp; The Excel sheet takes care of updates and calculations as the values are
 entered.&nbsp; For example, the current yard line is updated by the amount of the gain or loss from the previous play.&nbsp; I was unable to imagine how to create this functionality in Access.&nbsp; So, the coaches will continue to create a spreadsheet that contains the
 game's values.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When completed, the spreadsheet is imported to Access using VBA code, docmd TransferSpreadsheet.&nbsp; It took a lot of futzing around to get it to work, but it finally does.&nbsp; The new spreadsheet is appended to the table that contains the previous seasons and
 games.&nbsp; All of that works and I'm happy with that.</p>
<p>The problem is in a field called 'Dist', which stands for Distance to go for a first down or for a touchdown.&nbsp; If the down is inside the opponent's 10 yard line, the value in that field is a 'G', for goal to go.&nbsp; That requires complex formulas to calculate
 what happens next in the spreadsheet, but that also works.</p>
<p>The fields are defined as text.&nbsp; I even moved the type definitions to the last act of the VBA module so that the spreadsheet would understand that the field contains text, not numbers (although most of the values are numbers).</p>
<p>The Dist field in the Access receiving table is also defined as text.&nbsp; And the calculates on the G and the numeric valuse work in Access, too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But -- the G values don't transfer.&nbsp; Then end up in the error table of the transfer, the problem listed as Type Conversion.</p>
<p>From Internet searches, I understand that the import functionality doesn't pay attention to defined data types, rather it reviews the first 'x' number of values and determines the data type.&nbsp; So, if the first few values are numbers, even if they are defined
 as text, the whole column of values are expected to be numbers.&nbsp; So, when the import facility encounters a G, it is considered a Type Conversion error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I can create an edit in Access that allows the user to enter a G, but I would prefer that the values transfer correctly. Is there any way to be entirely sure that this transfer works as expected, every time? It has worked, but only intermittently and that
 is not enough security.</p>

            Don't import the sheets. Link to them and then do an Append query into your table. Int he Append query, you can convert the values.

            I can not test Excel 2008. But, this MAY work:<br />
1) Define a name in the workbook, call it SheetNames, and have it refer to "=get.workbook(1)"<br />
2) On a sheet, enter the formula: =index(sheetnames,1)<br />
<br />
If this gives you the name of the first worksheet in the workbook instead of a #value or #Ref error, then you can enter the formula in A1 as =index(sheetnames,row()) and fill this down.<br />
<br />
This does NOT work in Excel 2011, but it MAY in 2008.<br />
<br />
If it does not work, I'm afraid that there is no way to get this list without using a macro.<br />

 keep getting an error back saying (from Outlook.com):</p>
<p>We couldn't sign in to your POP3 server. Please make sure your username and password are correct.</p>
<div>
<div>[ Server Response: -ERR Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password. ]</div>

<div>I can sign into Office 365 with this user name and password with no problems. &nbsp;Recently renewed my subscription which migrated me to Office 365 Business Essentials but that was a couple weeks ago. &nbsp;Any help you can provide is very
 much appreciated.</div>

<div>Thanks!</div>

<h2>            Error synchronizing folder &#91;800CCC0E-0-0-560&#93; code</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ever since I installed MS Outlook 2016, I have been unable to find my trash folder. &nbsp;I have realized the above error code shows up. &nbsp;I did read answers to a similar question, but it was always about
 some other folder, or because someone has added a new email address. &nbsp;I haven't done anything and I need my trash folder. &nbsp;I am not technical enough to do some of the things that were suggested in the answers. &nbsp;Someone needs to clarify a bit for me. &nbsp;each
 statement seems to have a small difference in the answer, like for you it was the inbox folder that wasn't syncing. &nbsp;For me it is my trash folder. &nbsp;It hasn't appeared or synced since I installed ms Outlook 365. &nbsp;It always gives me this sync error. &nbsp;I need
 access to my trash folder. I am not extremely technical and cannot fathom doing some of the things mentioned earlier in the thread. &nbsp;I really feel the Microsoft should be responsible for giving us a working product. &nbsp;I haven't done anything with the program,
 didn't add any new emails or anything like that. &nbsp;I simple never did work. &nbsp;I need this to work. I also have no idea what edition of ms office i'm using since I downloaded it, I don't have a box to look at and don't know how to check the computer for that
 information. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure it is Office 2016. I totally resent the amount of time I have to spend trying to get a brand new program that I just purchased to work properly. &nbsp;If this were an item I bought at the store, I would be able to return it. &nbsp;Instead,
 I don't even have a technical support person that I can speak with and I am at the mercy of maybe getting a response here that I am technically equipped enough to accomplish and MAYBE it will work. &nbsp;I do not think that is a good was to do business.</span>

            To be honest, I think the second picture (Lumia 925) looks more natural. However, if you think it is off, contact your local Nokia Care center to see if they can do something about it.

<h2>            Is there going to be a Windows 8 . . . . . .</h2>
                    Is there going to be a Windows 8 music player to replace Zune? It is such a great interface that I would like to get my kids involved, but they do not need phones. I have Nokia Lumia 920 and it is fantastic. I was hoping that Nokia would put out a device
 without the phone functionality.&nbsp;Any information on this would be great!

<h2>            Saving Drop Down Lists - Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating email templates in Word and would like to be able to save and use multiple drop down lists. I would prefer not to remake a drop down list every time, if it's going to be used 20 times in the document.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>OK, this will be fairly simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select one of the dropdown list content controls that you want to repeat, by clicking on the "handle" with the three dots so the handle and the down arrow area change from gray to blue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c78a5e9e-e619-4e3f-b5a0-698aad973298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c78a5e9e-e619-4e3f-b5a0-698aad973298" /></a>&nbsp;
 or &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d6857b8-b419-44a6-a8bd-018bb698e509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d6857b8-b419-44a6-a8bd-018bb698e509" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Alt+F3 to open the dialog where you can define a building block. Enter a name for this list, and set the Gallery to "Custom Quick Parts" (scroll down the list of gallery types to find this). In the Save In box, select the template for which you're
 defining this list -- the default of Normal.dotm probably isn't appropriate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeat the preceding steps for each of the other repeatable list boxes, choosing a different building block name for each one. If there are lots of list boxes and you have some reasonable scheme for classifying them, you can set up various categories (in
 the Category box, choose the Create New Category item) and group the building blocks that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use these building blocks, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Quick Access Toolbar. Set the top left dropdown to All Commands, scroll down the left list and click on Custom Quick Parts, and click the Add button to send the button to the list on the right. You'll
 now have a button on the Quick Access Toolbar that opens a gallery of your list content controls. They'll probably all look alike, so you'll have to choose the one you want by its name alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also add a custom group to the Insert tab of the ribbon and put a button for the Custom Quick Parts gallery in that group. That would be less convenient than the Quick Access Toolbar button, though.</p>
