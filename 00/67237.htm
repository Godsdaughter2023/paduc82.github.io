            It depends on what device you are attempting to install, however in 95% of cases the answer to this question is no. If there are no Windows 7 drivers available from your device manufacturer then you should download the Windows Vista driver for your device.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, have a great day!

<h2>            Windows Cant Update &#40; Errors 0x8e5e03fa and 0x800703fa&#41; Format solution&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For at least 2 months, i tried a lot of ways to update my computer to the "last" patch
<strong>KB4015438 </strong>but everytime i try, the same errors keep poping up. here are one of them:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Error 0x8024a105</strong></li><li><strong>Error 0x8e5e03fa</strong></li><li><strong>Error 0x800703fa</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Im driving crazy because it looks like i need to format my computer. In the case i needed, i have another question. If I format my computer, does the video drivers (nvidia geforce) will be lost or they will still there? In case they got deleted, can i reinstall
 those drivers?<br />
<br />

<p>If so try a hex representation of the wireless key...</p>
<p><a href="http://easycalculation.com/hex-converter.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://easycalculation.com/hex-converter.php</a></p>
<p>In general though you really need to be running WPA2 or at a minimum WPA with a long random key. Personally I use WPA2-Personal (aka WPA2-PSK [AES]) with a 63-character random ASCII key. The router and
<strong>ALL</strong> clients must support whatever encryption type you choose.</p>

<h3> sheybey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dumpchk hangs on minidump file</h2>
                    <p>My laptop bluescreened with this bug check earlier today:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-check-0x18--reference-by-pointer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not much of a kernel programmer, but I was at least going to look at the generated minidump to see if I could figure out what was causing the issue. However, trying to run dumpchk on the minidump causes it to print a bunch of 'Cannot get _ERESOURCE type'
 messages and then hang and peg a CPU core until I kill it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b43b0dfa-01a4-4c82-9b27-5fe368d61251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b43b0dfa-01a4-4c82-9b27-5fe368d61251" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate some help either looking into the minidump further or submitting it to the appropriate area of support. I'd rather not open a paid issue just to send a minidump and the live chat agents aren't paid enough to know what a minidump is.</p>

                    <p>i want to install a 32 bit operating system on my laptop with windows 8 installed, thus I am trying to install Microsoft virtual machine 2007 for 64 bit version from the Microsoft webstie. I have downloaded the installer Windows6.1-KB958559-x64-RefreshPkg
 but when I try installing it the error comes "Windows update standalone installer</p>

<p>The certificate for the signer of the message is invalid or not found."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me on how to resolve the error as there are many of my previous software which run on 32bit operating system. And also let me know which operating systems can be installed in virtual machine?</p>

            <p>Windows 8 does not support Windows Virtual PC 2007</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 Pro includes a built in Hypervisor called Hyper-V.</p>
<p>This requires that your processor supports Secondary Address Translation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find out if your processor is supported:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Programs and Features</p>
<p>Click Turn Windows features on or off</p>
<p>See if you can check off Hyper-V and all its sub options</p>
<p>If not, it does noT support Hyper-V.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use alternatives such as Oracle VirtualBox or VMWare Player.</p>

                    <p>I am working on a Mac, and I cannot access my onedrive through browsers. It always says "Something went wrong, please try again and refresh the page." I've tried chrome and safari, neither of them works. However, the onedrive app is able to sync the content.
 Does anyone else has seen the issue and know how to resolve it? Thanks!</p>

            Hi Hawk, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Would you be able to provide a screenshot of your error? That will help me diagnose the issue properly.
<br />
<br />You might fix the problem by reinstalling or updating your graphics card drivers and reinstalling GeForce Experience. Here's a link to the download:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.geforce.com/drivers</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need more help! Thanks!

<h3> catministrator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cat locked my keyboard - how to unlock in Win 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, here is my problem: I have a desktop computer and a laptop. I recently upgraded my desktop to Windows 10. I did some work last night on the desktop computer logged in as administrator. Well, it got late, I went to sleep. I forgot to log myself out. Big
 mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come today, I wake up in the morning and wanted to do some work on my laptop that runs Windows 8. However, the keyboard seemed to be malfunctioning. I was able to log on to Windows, but once inside, the keyboard was dead. I didn’t think much of it, there
 was the update warning in the corner bugging me for the past two days, so I ran it thinking it will fix the problem. It didn’t. I upgraded the laptop from Windows 8 to Windows 10, and sure enough, once inside of Windows 10, the keyboard remained locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I switched to my desktop computer (wanted to google keyboard shortcut to unlock). Three things became painfully obvious: logged in as administrator, both computers are synchronized, BOTH keyboards are locked and I have a very naughty cat who was walking
 on the keyboard last night. I could tell by the gibberish she left me on my open Word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Long story short, my cat played administrator and locked the keyboards on ALL MY SYNCHRONIZED COMPUTERS</strong>. So here is the big question: how do I unlock the keyboard(s) in Windows 10?
</p>
<p>I’m typing on virtual keyboards right now and it’s a giant pain in the wrist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: the function keys do work</p>

            <p>I too had a similar problem. After I boot, all keys I press come paired with an 'ALT'. I could type no text in google, outlook, MS Word, explorer and the like where a text input is expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all methods suggested by various community members like removing battery and putting it back, typing CNTL+ALT+SHIFT+DEL. Tried pressing CNTL key for 5 seconds, CAPS LOCK ON and OFF, NUM ON and OFF.... kept on pressing all keys at random.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Couple of times keyboard got activated, but when rebooted it went back to original dead mode !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stumbled across an accidental solution. Whenever I activate EXCEL and type something, the keyboard gets activated and remains so until shutdown. Though result is same when I reboot, I have a temporary workaround (activating EXCEL before I do anything else
 !!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has consistently worked for me. I dont know if it will work for others. Anyway it is worth a try. Please let me know if it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also any possible explanation for this unusual behaviour will be welcome !!</p>

            <p>I have read through many replies concerning this issue, not only in this thread but in many threads in the community that have been posted about the keyboard being locked for some various reason and from what I have found NO ONE really helps with the problem...at
 least for me, nothing that was suggested helped.<br />
<br />
My cat did walk across my laptop keyboard. &nbsp;And after she did that I realized my keyboard was now locked and would not type inside of windows. &nbsp;I restarted my laptop and could use the keyboard to type my password to log me into windows, but once inside of windows
 the keyboard would not type anything.<br />
</p>
<p>I thought it was a laptop issue so I moved to my desktop to search for help only to find out it is synced to my laptop because they both are running windows 10 and require my microsoft login to use. &nbsp;So it was NOT a laptop issue, it is however a keyboard
 and windows 10 issue. &nbsp;I will post my resolve here to help others who have this issue, but I can say that Microsoft did not help me solve my problem and I'm becoming very disappointed in that microsoft does not seem to help much with any of the problems that
 I have had to deal with in using their OS. &nbsp;I had to search my laptop's online help in order solve the problem. &nbsp;This also helped to unlock my desktop lockup, and it is NOT the same brand as my laptop...so again, it is a keyboard and microsoft problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was suggested that my right shift key had been held down for longer than 8 seconds which in turn locked my keyboard...and thus then synced with my desktop because of microsoft. &nbsp;I held my right shift key down again for about 8 seconds and heard a 'tone'
 which then when I tried to type something, it was fixed. &nbsp;I also had to go to my desktop and do the same thing to get the keyboard on that system unlocked also. &nbsp;Again, held down the right shift key long enough to hear the tone and it was unlocked.<br />
I certainly hope this helps someone more than reading through all the threads did for me.</p>
<p><br />
Add on info....<br />
During the night my laptop did an automatic update. &nbsp;After opening it back up this evening and logging back into windows, I found that the keyboard was locked again. &nbsp;Again I held down the right shift key and again I heard the 'tone' and things are unlocked
 again. &nbsp;...and yes, both machines, laptop and desktop were locked.<br />
Now I have to question if this is going to be an ongoing problem?</p>

 I am typing and gaming as usual. I really hope this solves the problem for some people.</p>

<h2>            How to edit boot.ini to boot from partition with Windows 7 install files</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Here is my situation. &nbsp;I have a slightly older&nbsp;computer. &nbsp;I still run Windows 2000. &nbsp;It satisfies the requirements to upgrade to Windows 7, so I purchased the upgrade CD. &nbsp;Here is the problem. &nbsp;I have a serial ATA DVD drive, and the computer will not boot
 to that drive. &nbsp;My floppy drive is dead, so I cannot boot from that floppy to execute the setup CD either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution I came up with is to make a small partition on my secondary file storage drive, make that partition bootable, and put the contents of the install CD there. &nbsp;Now, the BIOS does try to boot from there. &nbsp;I copied the boot files from my windows
 2000 install onto that partition.</p>
<p>Is there a way to edit the boot.ini file to tell it to boot the Wiindows 7 install files? &nbsp;Should I be putting different boot files on that partition to correctly tell it to boot from the partition? &nbsp;I feel&nbsp;like&nbsp;I am so close to getting this to work, but
 I do not know how to proceed. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Windows 2000 Professional cannot be used as a qualifying product for the upgrade version of Windows 7. You need a full version. There is also no in place upgrade path from Windows 2000 Professional to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Upgrade paths:<br />
When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. In your case, you can upgrade to Windows 7 depending on edition and architecture of Windows Vista
 you have installed. If you are running a 32 bit version of Vista and want to upgrade to a 64 bit version (edition of Windows 7), you will have to a do clean install, this applies vice-versa.<br />
<br />
If you are running consumer editions of Windows Vista such as Home Basic or Premium, you can only upgrade to either Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. Also, you cannot do downgrades, which means, if you are running Windows Vista Ultimate now, you cannot downgrade
 to Windows 7 Home Premium. You must do logical upgrades:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista Home Basic &gt; Windows 7 Home Basic, Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Business &gt; Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Enterprise &gt; Windows 7 Enterprise<br />
Windows Vista Ultimate &gt; Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>System Requirements:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver</p>

            Hi Alexandra, your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />If there is no roll back available or that does not work, go to the Support page of the manufacturer of your PC/Laptop 
<br />
<br />Download the Device Driver they recommend for your Display Adapter/GPU and install that version, until Microsoft come out with a fix . . .

    <title>Converting a dual boot system disc to single boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> panagiotis_melas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting a dual boot system disc to single boot</h2>
                    <p>Good day to the community</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just finished building a new PC, intended to be used by my son. My initial thought was to have it operating with two independent Operating Systems, Windows and Linux. Given this, I installed Windows 10 Pro first, leaving a smaller space to my system
 disc as a second partition and after completion of the Windows installation, I installed Linux Cinnamon Mint in the second partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatically the system disk became a dual boot disk, so every time I start the computer, the Boot Manager prompts the user to choose which OS has to be chosen for booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this became impractical and I decided to cancel the Linux OS and its partition and let the computer only with Windows 10. Especially because this PC will be operating by my son, it will be almost a headache to leave with two different operating
 systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I need to erase the Linux partition and extend the existing partition to the end of the disk limits (it a Trion OCZ SSD, 240 GB total). I wonder if I can do the erasing through the Control Panel -&gt; System and security -&gt; Create and format disk
 partitions -&gt; Disk management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, will the dual boot menu from the Boot Manager, appearing at startup, disappear?</p>
<p>If it does not disappear, what do I have to do, to make it disappear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Panagiotis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Management is a built-in tool in Windows 10 which helps you manage hard disk partitions without rebooting the system and any interruption. Some of the features of Windows 10 Disk Management are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Create, delete and format partitions.</li><li>Change drive letter and paths.</li><li>Mark partition as active.</li><li>Explore partition to view files.</li><li>Extend and shrink partition.</li><li>Add mirror.</li><li>Initialize a brand new disk before you can use it.</li><li>Convert empty MBR to GPT disk, and vice versa.</li><li>Convert empty dynamic disk to basic disk.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, once you have erased the Linux partition, the Boot Manager should not prompt you to choose which OS to be use in booting. Otherwise, we strongly suggest doing a Windows 10 clean install. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other concerns, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

<p>Thank you, Jose, for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand, just deleting the Linux partition from the disk, will automatically allow me to boot from Windows directly, without having to take any other actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct in this or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it seems that the Boot Manager in my computer has been created (or modified) by Linux, as soon as I installed Linux Mint in the second partition. I am saying this, because when I start my PC and after passing from the motherboard BIOS indications, the
 first thing I get on my screen is the Boot manager menu, which prompts me to choose between the following (in that order):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <strong>Linux Mint 17.2 Cinnamon 64-bit</strong> (<em>this is the Linux version installed</em>)</p>
<p>2. <strong>Advanced Options for Linux Mint&nbsp;17.2 Cinnamon 64-bit</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>Memory Test (memtest 86+)</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>Memory Test&nbsp;(memtest 86+ serial console 115200)</strong></p>
<p>4. <strong>Windows 8 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)</strong> (<em>"</em><em>Windows 8" appears perhaps because the first Windows OS in this PC could be Windows 8, upgraded later to Windows 10, something that now I can't remember</em>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked a friend (<em>much more expert in computer software than me</em>) about it, who understands from above that perhaps the Linux Boot Manager may have taken over, after installation of the Linux OS. If this is true, I may have to modify the Boot Manager
 from Linux, before deleting its partition in my disk. I can see that the Boot Manager offers a simple "Settings" menu, as soon as it appears on the screen, but I haven't dug into it further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have to wait for my friend to see it and then to set it appropriately, so I avoid any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your opinion?</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here is info how to choose default system - and you can also remove others.<br />
<br />
How to Choose a Default Operating System to Run at Startup in Windows 1<br />
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21934-choose-default-operating-system-run-startup-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21934-choose-default-operating-system-run-startup-windows-10-a.html</a>
<br />
<br />
It would be best to remove the Linux partition with Linux and then re-make it in Windows. However you can try using Windows Disk Manager to remove it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            <p>It looks a little strange which a device showing as "connected", it is not functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how your Bluetooth device is configured but on my systems, I also show&nbsp;a Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator.&nbsp; The driver for that is BthLEEnum.sys.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would uninstall the BT Dongle and check the box to uninstall all drivers.&nbsp; If there are Windows 10 drivers for it, try reloading.&nbsp; I do see it shows Bluetooth 2.0.&nbsp; My new system shows BT 4.2, so the device may be old enough to cause a problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check to see if I can find any updates for that device.</p>

            I am having this exact same issue. The first scenario which is the most puzzling is with a Surface 3 and the BT Surface mouse. You would think all being Microsoft products, they would work without a hitch. This also happens on my HP Spectre 360 with a
 Logitech MX Anywhere 2 mouse in BT mode. I don't want to waste a USB port using the Logitech USB dongle, so BT would be the prefered method to connect. I can hit the Connect 2 and 3 button and it connects and works flawlessly with my wife's MacBook Air and
 our iMac. &nbsp;I have not tried the Surface mouse with the iMac or MacBook Air, but I suspect I would have the same flawless experience as I do with my MX Anywhere.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's odd and yet somewhat refreshing to see a lot of other people having the same problem with Windows 10 and mice connected over BT. &nbsp;Sometimes restarting the Surface or the Spectre will reconnect the mice, other times I have to unpair and re-pair the mice
 to get them to work. Inside of Settings &gt; Devices as mentioned above, I see that the mice are connected yet not functioning. With the Spectre it seems to happen when the laptop goes to sleep / hibernates or when I shut the lid and then bring the computer back
 up. &nbsp;With the Surface, there is no noticeable pattern... it just randomly decides when and when not to work. &nbsp;The Surface 3 and mouse, I use at work and within a broadcast environment. My first thought was all the RF running through the building from our tower
 with TV and radio microwave antennas and Sprint LTE antennas as well as all the other things like STLs and such might cause interference, but I ran a bluetooth speaker for a week hooked up to the Surface and it never lost a beat. We also have no problems with
 BT headsets paired with phones. So it's not RF interference... Windows just seems to forget that the mouse is there and paired. &nbsp;the MX Anywhere works perfectly on other devices, the Surface mouse works great when Windows allows it to, so it seems more isolated
 to Windows or how it handles the BT stack and maybe low energy devices.

            Same problem here. Surface + MS Designer mouse. Or also Surface + Logi MX Anywhere 2. And I thought it would be like Apple: buy from the same vendor and it just works - but nope. Loosing my nerve rebooting, re-pairing, reconnecting...

<p>OK this is how I fixed my problem in Windows 10 Boot Camp on MacBook Pro 2016. Apple Magic Mouse recognized, paired but kept disconnecting almost immediately if it connected at all. The problem was related to the
<strong>Power Management</strong> under Bluetooth Radio, Properties in Device Manager. I had to uncheck 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power'.&nbsp; This has worked for me I'm relieved to say :)</p>

<p>Worked through this today where my Arc Touch SE shows as connected but listed under 'Other devices' and not as a 'mouse' so it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performing a clean boot, was the only thing that worked. Rebooted, mouse back as a mouse, then reconfigured all services back in, reboot again then voila - Mouse still working as a mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea what the issue was, but a clean boot worked for me!</p>
<p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, this gets rid of the default Microsoft calibration tools and pen drivers. After installing Wacom's driver&nbsp;and you go to the pen preferences, you will be able to set different functions to the pen button from a dropdown list. You'll also get some
 more advanced pen settings that you can tweak.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ea1220e-edb2-4894-ad70-de5cfe91308a" /></p>

            Something like this perhaps:<br />
<br />
Windows could not start because of an error in the software.<br />
Please report this problem as :<br />
load needed DLLs for kernel.<br />
Please contact your support person to report this problem.<br />
<br />
...and when you choose to boot in Safe Mode, the last thing you will see loading is:<br />
<br />
...system32\BOOTVID.dll<br />
<br />
then you will see the same message as before:<br />
<br />
Windows could not start because of an error in the software.<br />
Please report this problem as :<br />
load needed DLLs for kernel.<br />
Please contact your support person to report this problem.<br />
<br />
Did you contact your support person and what did they say?&nbsp; (just kidding).<br />
<br />
If that is what you see,, tell us what your antivirus/antimalware applications you have installed, more about this "restoring to an earlier date" - and what prompted you to do that, what are these "3 choices" and is the installation CD you are using a genuine
 bootable XP installation CD or some kind of system recover CD that came with your system?<br />
<br />
I also don't know what "ran the installation CD" means, so that may have done more harm than good or what these 3 choices are.&nbsp; The original problem is not hard to fix, but now you may have other problems.<br />
<br />
If you are seeing the above and the same behavior when you choose to boot in Safe Mode, that usually means that this file has somehow gone AWOL (assuming XP is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32\kdcom.dll</b><br />
<br />
Since that is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection cares about, it should never be missing.&nbsp; If it really is missing, it may have been quarantined (effectively deleted) by your unspecified antivirus/antimalware application.<br />
<br />
There are likely to be good copies of the file on your system here:<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32\dllcache</b><br />
<br />
or here (depending on how you installed SP3):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386</b><br />
<br />
If just so happens that the kdcom.dll is the same for SP2 and SP3 so somehow or another you need to boot on something to replace your missing or corrupted one.&nbsp; If you can't find a backup copy on your system, you can download one from my SkyDrive, but you are
 going to have to boot on something in order to replace the file.<br />
<br />
I am going to recommend you use Hiren's boot CD (it will also go on a USB flash/thumb stick/drive).<br />
<br />
This is good for you because it has many more tools on it that on the XP Recovery Console CD, does not care about your Administrator passwords and you will not have to futz around in your BIOS if any afflicted system has SATA drives - Hiren's can deal with
 that.<br />
<br />
You will have a whole bunch of cool tools that you don't have in the XP Recovery Console...&nbsp; a registry editor, password resetter, and a desktop that looks like Windows XP so you will feel comfortable maneuvering.<br />
<br />
You can also easily copy your personal data (documents, images, music.) to an external drive.<br />
<br />
From a working system, first download Hiren's Boot CD from here (it is a substantial download but worth it):<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (look near the bottom of the page).<br />
<br />
Unzip the file to extract the Hirens ISO file and use a free and easy to use program like ImgBurn to burn the ISO file to create a bootable Hiren's CD.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/<br />
</a><br />
When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar or any other extras or toolbars that might be offered.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
Boot on the Hiren's CD and from the Windowsy looking desktop, open My Computer and look for a copy of the file in the listed places, copy it and paste it into the c:\windows\ssystem32 folder where it belongs, remove the CD and restart the system.<br />

<h3> markrogers75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 taskbar issue.</h2>
                    <p>Ok Ive used windows 10 since release but there is one issue I cant figure out what causes it or how to stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a habit of not turning off my PC for extended periods of time and what I happens after I think its 3 days are that programs that are running in the right hand side of taskbar disappear. Not only do they disappear&nbsp; but they are shutting off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One example is that my EVGA Precision X shuts itself off after 3 days and sometime I load up a game and dont catch it right away then I have alarms going off because my GPU is starting to overheat since the fan will not spin up to full speed like it shut
 by the fan curve I have set. EVGA X isnt theonly program that does this, there are several others that will do this too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember reading awhile back that a program that Windows 10 considers to be at idle too long will be shut off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Well how can I stop this from happening?</strong></span> Really getting annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont see why this feature is there if its true. I'm sure its a windows 10 feature because this happened on my old PC with WIN10 Home and my new PC with a fresh install of Win10 Pro.</p>

            Hello Mark.  I'm Greg, an 8 year Microsoft Windows MVP, here to help you.

Windows 10 does have default Power Options that assure Ram won't wear forever in Sleep, as long as Hibernate has not been disabled and you're running a proper driver for Display that allows Sleep and Hibernate.  To be sure of this: 

Right click Start button to open Power Options.  Set Screen at 5 minutes battery, 10 minutes Plugged in; Sleep at 15 minutes battery, 30minutes Plugged in.  Then click Additional Power Settings, choose Balanced Plan, under Change Plan Settings, then Change Advanced Power Settings:  Under Sleep, change Hibernate to 60 minutes on Battery, 120 minutes while Plugged in.  

If Hibernate is not available update your Display driver to the latest from the PC or Display device's Support Downloads webpage.  You may also need to take one of these additional steps:  https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/   I have found another hurdle in the latest version of Windows 10, which ma

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a desktop PC. I do not use hibernate or sleep features. I have no battery to save power on. My pc is almost always doing something so I dont understand why Windows is shutting some of these programs off. As I stated I DO NOT use sleep or hibernate
 functions on a desktop PC.</p>
<p>I just want certain programs to not shut off after 3 days.</p>
<p>This is a gaming pc and not a laptop.</p>
<p>i5-7600k</p>
<p>16gb DDR4 2666</p>
<p>EVGA 980 </p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most importantly is my EVGA Precision X. This program controls the fan to my GPU (EVGA 980 Video Card). If windows shuts it down my fan will NOT kick into higher RPM's. So when that happens my video card will jump to 90+ degrees Celsius instead of the 55-60
 degrees it usually runs while playing games. Not only that but because windows is shutting down that program its also shutting down a program that will set off an audio alarm when the card gets to hot, so now Im also losing my only warning sign that my GPU
 is overheating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These programs are not shutting down because I have woken the PC, my PC will just be at idle and they shut off for no reason after 3 days. I'm sorry but as long as my PC is on nothing should be getting turned off that can cause a $550 video card to fry(thats
 what I paid at the time and thats what it will cost to replace when it finally does have a melt down).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not sure the reason for freeing up space. My C: drive has 145gb free on my SSD.</p>
<p>The other drives have plenty of free space. Im running 2x's 1tb drives,3x's 750gb, and 1x's 320gb plus my 250gb SSD.</p>

            I understand Mark.  But this is unusual use of Power Options which are normally trying to go easy on the power as much practical to avoid situations like 24/7 operation overheats frying an expensive graphics card.

But it does have a plan for what you want.  I would set it to High Performance and then check the Advanced Settings to make sure they're what you want.  

The only other reason anything would get shut off I can think of is if the ScreenSaver at Settings&gt;Personalization&gt;Lock Screen is accidentally engaged by installing a Theme that inexplicably sets it at Blank or Bubbles at 1 minute.  It should be set to None and stay there.  

Otherwise the overheat could be a clue. Is your monitoring program like CoreTemp also logging these events?  It might be an overheat throttling or shutdown.

<p>Yes I use core temp on my 2nd screen. The card does not overheat unless EVGA Precision is shut down.</p>
<p>I have been sitting at my desk using my PC web browsing and such and looking at core temp when it gets shut down. Unless Im in game my GPU sits at 35-37 degrees Celsius. It even gets shut off while playing games when my GPU is only hitting about 55-60 degrees
 Celsius. AS of right now my GPU idle temp is 34c and my CPU is 38c with ambient room temp of 77f.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have watched this issue since windows 10 released and have learned the only thing shutting down programs is 3 days passing since my last PC reboot. And its not just one program at a time. Windows usually shuts down 4-6 programs all at once.</p>
<p>EVGA Precision X</p>
<p>EVGA Precision Server</p>
<p>Pedable</p>
<p>Canon Network Scanner</p>
<p>Universal Control ( control panel app for my Presonus Audiobox USB, music recording interface.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are more but those are the main ones that it will always shut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My screen saver is set to 5 mins and the SS is Mystify, stock windows SS. I also use the stock Windows 10 theme that is used when windows installs.</p>
<p>Im using high performance power options. As I have done since somewheres around Windows XP, maybe earlier I cant remember it the power feature dates back to Windows 3.1. Been a PC user since DOS in the mid 80's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off display-Never</p>
<p>Put the computer to sleep-Never</p>
<p>Power setting-High Performance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what your meaning shutting down with a overheat with COreTemp.</p>
<p>My PC is not shutting down or OFF. The software is being turned off as if I have closed the above software. No overheats or anything. Again Windows 10 will
<strong>shut down Programs like EVGA Precision while playing games </strong>and making full use of the software. Its not just one game causing this, it is any game. Again I read a couple months back somewheres that windows 10 will shut down programs that it
 feels are not being used to save resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example, yesterday I was Project Cars and with a GPU temp of 61c core temp set off my audible alarm that I have set to go off at 85c. Reason EVGA Precision was shut down while I was playing a game of which disables the fan curve I have setup inside that
 program. So instead of my GPU fan speed being a around 3600 RPM it drops down to about 1700 RPM then my GPU overheats.
</p>
<p>Again I have done a PC reboot and marked the time and sure enough after 3 days of normal PC use windows shuts down those random programs almost to the hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe Im misunderstanding you here or vs versa. Reiterate, PC does not shut down just programs so Im not seeing why an overheat will shut down software/programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help.</p>

            You can program CoreTemp to shut down, sleep, or hibernate when it begins to overheat.

Next analyze at the power supply to see if its adequate.  http://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/

<p>Yes I can program Coretemp to shut down the PC if the CPU overheats. Coretemp is for the CPU and not GPU.</p>
<p>We got mixed up there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im using GPU Meter and EVGA Precision to monitor the VIDEO CARD temps. </p>
<p>I am not overheating and the PC is not shutting down, EVGA Preicsion software is being shut off and then I overheat on the GPU but PC never shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the PSU Im running a 750 watt 80 plus gold rated Corsair modular PSU. More than adequate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to stop windows from shutting down programs that are being used after the PC has been running for 3 straight days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like we are getting things confused here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. PC DOES NOT OVERHEAT or SHUT DOWN.</p>
<p>2. GPU DOES NOT overheat or shut down.</p>
<p>3.EVGA PRECISION SHUTs DOWN after windows 10 has run for 3 days, not from overheating, only overheats because the software is being turned off.</p>
<p>4. DOES this WHILE playing games or anything else.</p>
<p>5.Something within windows 10 is causing this to happen. I just cant figure out what it is that is doing this.</p>

            I know of nothing within Windows that would cause that strange behavior.  My instincts are to suggest breaking down the build to check everything with a fine tooth comb.  But I am not a hardware expert - I am a Windows expert, so will try to guide you to rule out Windows on this because I don't think it is a software problem though I don't' mind being proved wrong in these cases.

Go over this checklist which checks over WIndows most thoroughly, optimizes it best, repairs anything needing it:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00

<p>i5-7600k</p>
<p>16gb DDR4 2666</p>
<p>EVGA 980 windows 10 Pro fresh install, no upgrades and retail version.</p>
<p>Samsung SSD and new hard drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previously mentioned software I also used for several years on my old PC.</p>
<p>This has been an issue since I originally upgraded to windows 10 Home and now still persists even with all new hardware. Im still using 2 of the hard drives from the old PC build but they were formatted so that this new system build was 100% fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also this happens on my wifes desktop PC with totally different hardware using windows home and the only software that I know for sure doing the same on hers as mine is EVGA Precision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I have come to the conclusion that it is a Windows 10 issue. I will also look on EVGA's web site and see if I can locate where this issue was being discussed.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I just looked over the links you provided. As I stated here I had this issue on my old PC and now on this newly built with most all new hardware. I always do a 100% fresh install with a new system...I keep nothing. Any files of importance stays on
 my external hard drive that is never connected unless Im adding files to it.</p>
<p>Issue is also on my wife's PC.</p>

<p>Those links I did when I built this PC and installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I uninstalled EVGA Precision X and installed MSI Afterburner.</p>
<p>I will wait 3-4 days to see what happens with this program and report back if it does the same as EVGA Precision.</p>
<p>If not then I guess it could be the program itself but doesnt explain why the other programs are getting turned off at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install finished at about 12am CST on 9-26-2017. So like I said I'll see what happens in a few days give the results here.</p>
<p>I also did quiet a bit of searching last night and now Im not finding the forum post I was reading where someone had the exact same issue and where it was being reported as a Windows 10 issue/feature/bug or what have you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thank you for helping. </p>

            Mark, if the same problem with apps turning off is happening on your wife's PC with the only thing in common the Evga Precision then it's likely the culprit.   What exactly do you use this software for?  Normally the larger display software package is only needed for specialized settings and because it can interfere and cause issues I would not have it otherwise.
