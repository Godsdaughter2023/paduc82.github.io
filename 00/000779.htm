<h2>            Show Formatting Marks</h2>
                    <p>I am running a Windows 10 laptop with Office 365 Home. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This question is about Publisher.&nbsp; I want all of the formatting marks (tabs, spaces, etc.) to show, not just the paragraph mark. (I have the paragraph mark button in the paragraph section of the Home tab checked.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instructions on the Microsoft Office Support website say to: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>File</strong> tab, choose <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Display</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Always show these formatting marks on the screen</strong>, select the check box for each formatting mark that you always want to display, regardless if the
<strong>Show/Hide</strong> button is turned on or turned off. </p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2ff5cc9771-1070-4ebf-bd7a-4d3dc245966f.png" /></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Several problems here: First, when I click on the File Tab, then Options, there is<strong> no "Display" option</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eca7a981-5c73-4fcf-96ca-3cbc86f3a576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eca7a981-5c73-4fcf-96ca-3cbc86f3a576" /></a></p>
<p>So I checked out these available options and found that there is a "Display" option category available under "Advanced", but no where else.
<br />
</p>
<p>However, there is <strong>no "Always show these formatting marks on the screen" available</strong> under "Display!"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2388731-620f-4ebb-9bdd-ef9bf3668251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2388731-620f-4ebb-9bdd-ef9bf3668251" height="413" width="523" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the formatting marks to display? I have been using Publisher for over 20 years, and have always had the all of format marks showing and I want them back! Publisher doesn't look right without them &amp; it messes me all up!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Word set up to display all the marks as in the above instructions, why isn't Publisher the same?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me?</p>

<p>As I stated, I have already clicked on the ¶ button. If what you posted is correct why am I just seeing the paragraph marks and not ALL the formatting marks as you listed above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does &nbsp;<em>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/show-or-hide-formatting-marks-c2d8a607-5646-4165-8b08-bd68f9d172a0</em> say that the instructions I quoted above "<span>Applies To:

<p>Why does Microsoft keep "fixing" that which is not broken?? I have depended on the formatting marks in Publisher for more than 20 years!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it that Microsoft feels it's OK to outright LIE on your so-called support website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, during these past 20+ years people have told me over &amp; over again that Publisher is garbage &amp; that I should use something else. I have always defended Publisher, saying that I knew it well, liked it and that it always did the job for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, if I said any of that now, I would be lying... Publisher has become garbage pure &amp; simple. It's no longer worth my time or the space on my computer. Every time I have asked Support for help on something that I was always able to do that I no longer
 can, I get the same basic answer: "Oh, well, gee, the Support site is wrong. Windows 10/Word/Publisher/Excel/etc. doesn't/can't/won't do that any more. You prefer the better features &amp; functionality of the previous versions? Too bad! So sad! You are a captive
 audience, there is nothing you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>can</em></span> do about it and there is nothing we
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same thing when Windows 10 corrupted my computer. I could no longer access the start menu and I kept being logged off whenever I tried. Support gave a list of things to try, none of which worked. The last solution was to do a refresh. I was fed, and unfortunately
 believed, the lie that my personal files &amp; settings and any apps I got from the store would be maintained. Over a month later and I am still trying to get the computer back to the way it was before the Windows 10 refresh screwed it up on me! I could be wrong,
 but I swear the formatting marks were available before I had to reinstall Office 365! I have had numerous issues with Word &amp; Excel since the refresh too. (Note, I had to
<em>reinstall</em> Office 365 even though "support" said it would still be there!)</p>
<br />
<p>Looks like I am now in the market for a new desktop publisher. I might as well just ditch Office 365 Home and cancel my subscription all together because the only reason I chose it when I upgraded was because of Publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every interaction I have had with Microsoft lately, from the destruction of my computer by Windows 10 and now this and other **** with Office has proved to me that it is time to get away from Windows and join the Apple crowd. I wish I could sue to get back
 the vast amount of time &amp; money I have lost in the past month or two because of Microsoft's so-called fixes &amp; updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sick to death of dealing with it. Customer "support" indeed. (End of rant.)</p>

<p>I have been using Publisher since Pub97 and have all versions through 2013. I refused Pub 2016...way too buggy and too much functionality gone. I too like the format marks but only remember the paragraph, space, tab and hard return (shift+return key) marks.
 Are you saying that only the paragraph symbol remains with Pub 2016? I don't even know what those other symbols that are available in Word are all about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have been using Publisher for 20 years then that suggests you have the installation media and keycodes of older versions of Publisher. You can run all versions of Publisher back to Pub 2000 on Win10. Why don't you just install one of the older versions?</p>
<p>
</p><div><span>Reference: A look at running older versions of Microsoft Office on Windows 10:

<div><span>- Andre Da Costa found all versions back to 2000 would run with the exception of Outlook 2000.</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note that you <em><strong>cannot</strong></em> run Office/Publisher 2013 with Office 2016 programs. But you could install Pub 2010, 2007 etc. if you want to run Office 365/2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I don't like the direction MS has taken Publisher either and feel that Pub 2007 was probably the best version...pre-ribbon. I use it and Pub 2000 for my production work.&nbsp; I would skip Pub 2013 and 2016...too buggy and missing functionality I value.
 I also refuse to run Win10...but that is another story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind response to last night's rant! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely wish I could go back to an earlier version of Office! Unfortunately however, I don't have access to the installation CDs anymore. I had installed it on both my old desktop &amp; old laptop using the disks under the license keys of a former employer
 (with permission) so I could work from home. Unfortunately, both of those computers have since died and 2 years ago I had to replace them with the laptop I am currently using. (I was lucky to get my files off of them before they completely died!) Being suddenly
 self-employed, I couldn't afford to buy Office outright, especially the version that included Publisher, so I subscribed to Office 365. If I remember correctly, the last version I had installed was 2003... maybe 2007. If the old computers weren't packed away
 somewhere, I'd try to fire one or both up to see which version I was used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current laptop (an HP bought directly from HP) came with Windows 8.1 installed.&nbsp; The Windows 8.1 version that was installed on the machine was so horribly messed up that HP had to send me a free set of 8.1 recovery disks before I could even use it! When
 10 became available, I was able to upgrade to 10 free of cost. (Not such a great perk, I guess!) I waited quite a while before I did the actual upgrade to 10 to give them time to work out some of the bugs. That didn't do me much good either!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I have never really liked Office 365, I honestly don't remember having the issues I am currently having before I had to do the Windows 10 refresh a month or so ago. Nothing on my computer seems to work quite right since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Publisher on a nearly daily basis since around 1996 and dabbled with it before then. I very much miss the older versions. Maybe I will check out Ebay and see if I can find an older version of Office that includes Publisher for a reasonable
 price that I can use until I can afford an Apple computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, at 56 years-old, I have become fairly set in my ways... I don't want or need this kind of agita, lol!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, I can certainly learn new things, but the disruption to my productivity because I have to keep learning how to do things I used to know how to do like second nature, is a major hit to my bottom line. I often find that things that should and used to
 only take me minutes are now taking hours because I have to figure how to do it all over again. (Don't get me started about how things like to changes themselves back after you think you have it all set!) The Support website is no help at all because the "support"
 they give is wrong most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't appear that Microsoft gives a flying fig about what their customers want and need. They know we are stuck with them whether we like it or not. Perhaps however, they should stop &amp; think about the fact that we Baby Boomers are becoming the largest
 demographic in the country (if we aren't already.) Microsoft should be working to make things easier for us, not more complicated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last thought, I went to school for computer programming back in the early 1980s graduating with a 4.0 GPA. I learned COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, etc. At the beginning of my working career it was DOS &amp; the Pick operating systems that I was working with. When
 Windows came out, it was a revolution! The first word processor I used was WordPerfect. When a board or something went bad in the physical computer, I was the one to figure out what the problem was then order &amp; install the part. I say all this to show I am
 not stupid. I am not a computer illiterate. I am fully capable of learning. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway David, thanks again for listening to my rants. <strong>Microsoft, I SURRENDER</strong><strong>!</strong> Apple, here I come.</p>

<h2>            Email telling me to reconfirm my account because my mailbox has exceeded the limit of 30GB- genuine&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've basically had an email from the "Outlook Customer Services Team" titled:&nbsp;E-MAIL ACCOUNT CLOSE[RESET]!‏</p>
<p>The email is from: Outlook Customer Services Team (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and it's telling me to verify my email address to avoid immediate closure because my mailbox has exceeded the limit of 30GB.
</p>
<p>They're telling me that different computers have logged in to my mailbox account &amp; multiple password errors have been entered so they're suspending my account for fraudulent purposes? I don't know about the password thing because I'm normally permanently
 logged in but I am NOT a victim of fraud, I have MORE THAN ONE computer. </p>
<p>Then they told me to reconfirm my account information (my name, my username, password, reconfirm password, date of birth, country or territory) or my account will be suspended permanently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, is this a genuine email from the customer services team or some con artist trying to get my details? Has anyone received an email like this one? Please help! Thank you</p>
<p><br />

<p>Is there a requirement that you download 10122 if you don't feel comfortable with it? Nope. It's been 3 weeks since the last build release. WAY overdue.</p>

<p>Agreed, it shows - again - how REALLY out of touch MS are. 'Twitter' is nothing to do with the insider program. I personally do not know anyone who uses this service - I certainly would class it&nbsp; (twitter) as the same futility and pointlessness as facebook.

<p>They will be moving all announcements to facebook next. Sheesh... !</p>

            <p>Thanks Ronnie, I know who Gabe is since I get the occasional e-mails from him.&nbsp; I am sure there is some reason a company like Microsoft has chosen to use a third party application to disseminate information about the Insider Program..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use Twitter, as you could&nbsp;probably guess.&nbsp; Maybe some consideration could be given to sending e-mails about
<strong>important</strong> information concerning the program so we could all be involved.</p>

<p>I agree too.&nbsp; Twitter has nothing to do.&nbsp; There is Insider Hub for all the announcements which I think Microsoft neglects and does not pay much attention.</p>

<p>Your snip shows you are not set to receive any preview builds.&nbsp; The Release Preview Ring only receives quality and security updates for build 15063.&nbsp; Preview builds do not receive quality and security updates.&nbsp; Please read and heed the red-letter text.&nbsp;
 Your settings are messed up.&nbsp; Change them to reflect what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type "winver" in Search/Cortana and check what build you are on.&nbsp; That is, the build, not the version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are, as you say, on 16353 you would not expect to "upgrade" to 16288.&nbsp; That is a lower build.&nbsp; Also, 16353 and 16288 are on different Fast Ring branches and have nothing to do with each other.&nbsp; Based on your settings you are about to be moved out
 of Skip Ahead if that's what you, in fact, are on.</p>

<p>Ok, so the current build is 16353.&nbsp; I get that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, if you don't change "Just fixes, apps, and drivers" to "Skip ahead" you will get nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, what do you want with 16288?&nbsp; (In any case, there is no ISO for it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quiz follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is greater, 16353 or 16288? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If upgrades go from a lower number to a higher number, where can you go from 16353? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you upgrade from 16353 to 16288?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving on, a new update released this week for the Fast Ring Skip Ahead branch.&nbsp; Build 16362 is now available for users currently on 16353.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new update released this week for the Fast Ring Active Development branch.&nbsp; Build 16288 is now available for users currently on 16281 or before.</p>

<h2>            Replacement for a Nokia 6310i</h2>
                    I have had 2 of these now.&nbsp; No other phone for 8 years because&nbsp;it did everything I needed and was very reliable.&nbsp; I now need to replace the most recent as it is starting to go.&nbsp; Can anyone recommend a suitable product to upgrade to?&nbsp; I want a good reliable
 phone, easy to use&nbsp;with good battery life and keys that you can actually use are hardwearing and don't stick.&nbsp; Some of the facilities you get now, such as camera and GPS might be useful, but I don't envisage accessing the internet very frequently.&nbsp; I wwould
 be grateful to hear what other former 6310i users have done.&nbsp; Thanks

            Thank you for your reply. Yes,&nbsp;the 6700&nbsp;was recommended to me by the Orange shop but I was put off by the comments about it that I have read in&nbsp;the discussions.&nbsp; Now I'm not sure.&nbsp; Hence the appeal for information.&nbsp; Did you move from the 6310i to the 6700?

<p>yes depending on what platform you want to use is another option as to limitations of phone choice as the 6300 and 6700 are s40 platform you could look at the s60 platform which is much better so this can give you a choice of other phones reading storys
 should not put you off choice there is always good and bad posts about every phone so moving forward the 6700 is the new 6300 and both the succesor of the 6310i</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so s40 phones selection to choose from are the 6300/6300i/2730/3720</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>s60 phones 6720/6730/e55/5630</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>these are all candybar phones as we like to call them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then you have a wide range of sliders to choose from if that takes your fancy</p>

<h2>            User-defined functions in Excel for Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone have instructions on inserting a user-defined function in Excel for Mac 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try the usual way as in previous versions, I am stuck with the following issues:</p>
<p>1) When I open VBE, I see no option to insert a module</p>
<p>2) To get around this, I use record macro to create a new macro and then step into it to get to the editing phase of VBE. There I enter a new user-defined function. However, when I try to use it, the function shows up but it returns the #NAME! error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. I spoke to Microsoft Support and they had no answers for me - all they said is there is no information in their resources so use support.microsoft.com or answers.microsoft.com.</p>

<h2>            Copy &#47; Paste Contact information</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed what seems to be a simple oversight in functionality of the Microsoft Lync 2016 (for Mac). On the Windows version of this application (Skype for Business 2016), I am able to view a contact card and can copy/paste the contact phone number (and
 other data). On the Mac, I am able to view the contact cards without issues, but it will not allow me to highlight any data from that window. As such, I am unable to copy/paste phone numbers. It seems like a simple feature that should be included, but for
 some reason I am unable to do it. To be more specific, I am referring to the "pop-up" contact card (that appears when you click someones name in the contact list). I am unable to copy from that window, but if I right-click and choose to view the full contact
 card, I am able to copy from that window.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33; Paid for download Failed. Support email bounced back&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I am hopeing there is someone out there that can help. I had heard that nokia had offically lunched the ovi store so I gave it a go and downloaded some free apps and it worked a treat. Then I tried to download "Need for Speed Underground" but this is
 my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I paid for the game but then it crashed my phone during the download. When I went back into the ovi store it said downloading but never started the actual download. so i switched the phone off / on. This time when I went back It wants me to pay for the game
 again. I assumed you would be able to download it again within 24 hours or something. I had heard there were a few problems with the high demand at launch of the service, so I tried again late at night. no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I am £4 down with no game. I have tried sevral times to contact support but the support page sends you to a form to fill in and sends an email. which just bounces back! There is no phone number to speak to anyone. HELP!!!!!! I am damed if I am going
 to let this one go. I know there are teething problems with the service. But at least sort out the support email system so people can tell you about the prblems they are having.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any I deas</p>
<br />

<h2>            Mouse clicks 1&#47;2 lines above where I have it&#63;</h2>
                    I have a dual touchscreen-type laptop and lately, I've been noticing an odd trend in my word document. If I tap the screen, say to change lines, the document acts as if I'm touching the screen in a different place, about an inch up from where I actually
 directed it. This problem is the same with&nbsp;both the touchscreen and the mouse. I've already tried restarting the document, restarting my computer, and typing in different places. If it helps for information, this document is a 600-page thing at this point.
 I haven't had this problem in any other app or word document. Thank you for your help.

            Hi RebeccaFrailey,
<br />
<br />Is it possible to copy the text into a new document? Perhaps not, if it's 600 pages, but it sounds like an issue with that one document if any others are working correctly.
<br />
<br />Perhaps a repair of the document will help if you can't copy into a new document.

            Navigate to a file you want as a ringtone using file explorer.&nbsp; Click on the file and a drop down menu will appear.&nbsp; The last option in the list&nbsp;is Set as Ringtone.<br />
<br />
A reminder that using entire MP3 files as ringtones will use a lot of memory.

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you referring to multiple tabs in Internet Explorer?</li><li>Are you referring to multiple Internet Explorer pages NOT as tabs?</li></ul>
<p>You can use both the options in Internet explorer. You can click on the blank square next to already opened page on top which is called tab and use another page as tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also open fresh new Internet Explorer by right clicking Internet Explorer icon at the taskbar and click Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your query is still unanswered, kindly let us know more so we can answer accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

                    We need Symbian OS v9.3 with Feature Pack 2 in Nokia N82 in new firmware upgrade because lower price and specs mobile N79 has this latest OS so why don't we can't get it? HTC Mobile users can upgrade Latest Microsoft Windows Mobile OS in their device so
 why don't we get latest Symbian OS in our mobile? N82 has sufficient hardware spear that it can handle this latest release. So ask to Nokia all N82 user that give Symbian OS v9.3 with Feature Pack 2 in Nokia N82 in new firmware upgrade soon.

We get updates of our current O/S version but not new versions.<br />

If you want FP2 then you need to get a phone that had it right from the beginning.

            N95 first release was without FP1 but now it loaded with FP1 by firmware upgrade. &nbsp;Then why Nokia don't give latest OS releases in supported mobile. &nbsp;HTC mobile users who purchased their mobile with Windows Mobile v6.1 can upgrade Windows Mobile v6.5 and
 now they can upgrade their same mobile with Windows Mobile 7. &nbsp;My question is why Nokia doesn't give latest OS releases in supported mobile and only gives bug fixes?

            ^ Because Nokia Doesn't Care. If they cared they would definately give us a good firmware change in the 5800, Everyone's asking, Kinetic Scroll, More option on the homepage and more important upgrades, has Nokia given us that ?? and I doubt that they will,
 they took your $$ and are now $$ richer by your money, deal's done, we've lost, Nokia just doesn't care.

<p>Buddy, if they give all what you're saying, who will buy other creepy models that Nokia are producing? About their "FUNNY

<p>The N82 has evrything you might need, a dedicated GPU, Lots of RAM and I MEAN A LOT MORE THAN OTHERS, a Xenon Flash, Dual CPU!!</p>

<p>That's for sure, I'm starting to see a pattern here, first the buggiest ever 5800 and now to top it off with the N97 after 12 years of nokia for me it's time to change and many feel that way, they are just not up there, with a phone like N97 and 5800 that
 could do a lot, they put in a **bleep** processor that after some apps installed, totally lags, and it's not different with N97 as well. Look at Apple, They have that huge processors and they know that their phone is going to last years. Nokia still has that
 buggy OS, the firmware change doesn't help at all cause they bring in more bugs...and they</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is incorrect, the N95 had FP1 from day one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far no nokia phone has ever received a new OS in a firmware upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy may change for future models but it's highly unlikely to change for older models like the N95 and N82.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple fact is that if you want a new OS you need to buy a new phone.</p>

            N95 was launched at 30 months ago and they have Symbian OS v9.1 and N82 has v9.2. Check both models, you can't find and differences in these 2 mobile. Frankly, Nokia's N95 is a successful model so it's still available in market. Nokia has stopped manufacturing
 many models after it but N95 is still available. N82 is perfect model but Nokia don't want to support this model. I have post this matter because somebody who is well known of LAW for this matter and sue no Nokia that getting software update is our right.
 Microsoft and many other big software Co. gives support and updates lifetime. You can get service Packs and updates for XP or Vista lifetime. Them why should Nokia don't gives latest updates while our model's hardware support it. Nokia want only money and
 somebody has to strongly claim and sue no Nokia. This is beneficial for all Nokia handset user. Somebody think about it. Please don't sit on your chair who is in LAW field and know the LAW for this matter and sue on Nokia. Please pass t

<p>You are still incorrect.&nbsp; Both models launched with the same operating system, S60v3FP1 (Symbian 9.2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N95 never had the original S60v3 (Symbian 9.1). If you do not accept this truth please post a link to a reputable website that confirms your incorrect information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact still remains that if you want a new OS you need to buy a new phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for spouting about law you are still incorrect as no law applies that says that nokia has to give you new operating systems.&nbsp; Your comparison to windows is also flawed as nokia do give you "service packs" in the way of firmware updates for your current
 OS.&nbsp; XP users did not get vista for free so why should nokia give their latest OS away for free?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is irrelevant that the hardware can support S60v3FP2 (Symbian 9.3) because nokia are not going to spend the time and money adapting it for the older models.&nbsp; It would also take valuable staff away from projects that look to the future, not to the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The policy is likely to change for the newer models, but not for the older ones. You need to get over this and move on or be happy that your N82 is still a great phone, regardless of it's OS. No law is going to help you here but if you are unable to accept
 that feel free and use the law, just don't bang on about it on a forum.</p>

<h2>            Merging a hybrid on prem&#47;office 365 deployment with a second office 365 tenant.</h2>
                    
<p>We are merging a business units' hybrid deployment with our primary office 365 tenant.&nbsp; There is good documentation on tenant to tenant moves, and on prem to Office 365 migrations, but nothing I've been able to find addresses issues specific to the hybrid
 to a different tenant scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One option would be to migrate all the on prem users&nbsp;to the cloud first, then do a tenant to tenant migration.&nbsp; This has been rejected.&nbsp; There are about 7,000 users to be migrated, half of them still on prem desktop Outlook users so:</p>
<p>1) We don't want to put 3,500 people to go through essentially two migrations.<br />
2) We don't have the resource to support migrating 7,000 users on the same day, as would be required by a tenant to tenant migration.</p>
<p>The other option is essentially a tenant to tenant migration followed by a on prem to office 365 migration (not using a hybrid config).&nbsp; Just wondering if there are any existing doc on how to modify each independent plan to accommodate the hybrid config?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 If not we've got a plan that we think will work that I'll share to see there are holes, and result in at least some kind of doc for this scenario.</p>

            <p>Hi &lt;removed&gt;</p>
<p>For the scenario you described, I suggest you use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Off-boarding the Office 365 mailboxes from the old tenant to the on-premises Exchange servers by referring to:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/o365e_hrcmoverequest_fl312271(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/o365e_hrcmoverequest_fl312271(v=exchg.150).aspx</a>.
</li><li>Remove the hybrid settings for the old tenant by referring to: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn931280(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2012/12/05/decommissioning-your-exchange-2010-servers-in-a-hybrid-deployment.aspx</a>.</li><li>Remove the other settings on the old tenant like domains.</li><li>Configure new hybrid deployment with the primary Office 365 tenant by using the
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn756393.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Exchange Server Deployment Assistant</a>.</li><li>Then move the corresponding mailbox to Office 365.</li></ol>
<p>Also, to reduce the migration time, you can let the Office 365 mailbox users to archive some of their mail items on their PC using Outlook, then import to their new Office 365 account once the tenant is moved successfully.

<p>Yes, I reviewed the suggestion, and that isn't going to be possible for a couple reasons. &nbsp;Most importantly and I should have mentioned this earlier, the business unit has their own independent AD forest and there is currently no plan to integrate that or
 even establish trust relationships with our primary forest. &nbsp;So setting up a new hybrid config is out of the question. &nbsp;All the users in that forest already have users in the primary forest and accounts in the primary Office 365 tenant. &nbsp;The primary forest
 does not have Exchange installed and the The Powers That Be have decreed that doing so is not an option even the limited hybrid coexistence only version.</p>
<p>One good thing is that we aren't concerned with the size of the mailboxes. &nbsp;We just completed a migration from another mail system to Office 365 for 60K+ mailboxes and nearly 40 TB of data. The migration server farm from that is more than capable of handling
 these users comfortably. &nbsp;I'll try to succinctly describe what we have come up with and post that soon for feedback.</p>

<p>The primary tenant is domainA.onmicrosoft.com and uses the @domainA.com mail domain. The unit’s tenant is sub.onmicrosoft.com which services the sub.DomainA.com mail domain. Sub.DomainA.com is using a hybrid configuration, while the primarily domain is cloud
 only.&nbsp; Both are using AADSync and ADFS to their respective independent AD forests.&nbsp; What we are looking at right now is essentially:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Tenant to Tenant migration, followed by </li><li>An on premise to Office 365 migration, NOT using a hybrid configuration. </li></ol>
<p>The steps we are planning to do are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do all the prep as per the Tenant to Tenant migration document.&nbsp; MX record still points to the on premise exchange server at this point.
</li><li>Change the MX record to a non-existent (or holding service) destination to stop external inbound mail flow.
</li><li>Migrate all the cloud mailboxes using 3<sup>rd</sup>party tool.&nbsp; (Actually this is more of a merge as all users have accounts in both domains already.)
<ol>
<li>For each account, once the contents of a mailbox is migrated.
<ol>
<li>Update the remaining user object in the sub.domainA.com AD to be mail enabled so they still show in the on premise GAL once their mailbox is removed.
<ol>
<li>Set targetAddress attribute to the new @domainA.com address and clear proxyAddresses resulting in a mail enabled user.
</li><li>Do a disable-remotemailbox in the on prem exchange environment to remove the Office 365 mailbox for the user.
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li><li>Make the necessary AD and/or AADSync changes so that these accounts are no longer synchronized and the AAD user is deleted.
</li></ol>
</li><li>Once all mailboxes are migrated:
<ol>
<li>Remove sub.domainA.com from the sub.onmicrosoft.com tenant.
<ol>
<li>Un-federate the domain and turn off directory synchronization. </li><li>Remove the sub.domain.com domain. </li></ol>
</li><li>Verify the sub.domainA.com in the primary tenant as an internal relay. </li><li>Create a new connector to the sub.domainA.com on premise Exchange server. </li><li>Add the @sub.domainA.com aliases to the migrated users’ proxyAddresses in the primary AD.
</li><li>Configure the on premise system with connectors to the new primary domain. </li><li>Change the MX record for sub.DomainA.com to the primary domain’s: domainA-com.mail.protection.outlook.com
</li></ol>
</li><li>A lot of the tenant to tenant related cleanup items like the Outlook nickname cache will still apply.
</li></ol>
<p>At this point it would essentially be at the early stages of a standard on premise to Office 365 rolling migration where hybrid isn’t used. &nbsp;That we can handle. My big concerns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I missing anything above? </li><li>When should the hybrid configuration be removed?&nbsp; Before the next phase of the migration? Or can it be left as is and then simply done as part of the Exchange server shutdown and removal?
</li><li>What will the on premise connectors mentioned in #6 above look like? The sub unit currently routes all mail through a spam/malware/secure messaging appliance located on premise for both cloud and on premise users. They need the secure messaging features
 of the appliance in particular for mail being sent externally.&nbsp; I think…
<ul>
<li>Add a rule based connector to send all messages to the @sub.domainA.com domain to be sent to domainA.mail.protection.outlook.com.&nbsp; That way all messages go to Office 365, and it forwards those for users not yet in the cloud back to the on premise Exchange
 system. </li><li>Mail to all other domains continues to route through the appliance, allowing them to continue to use the secure email there until they are migrated and begin using Office 365 Message Encryption.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

            <p>Hi &lt;removed&gt;<br />
<br />
I have checked your requirements and Neo’s suggestions above. And I’m afraid we cannot directly answer those questions you asked because what Neo suggested is the only official supported way to achieve a goal like this. The plan you have described in detail
 contains a lot of things which our forum cannot support or would not suggest, such as using a 3rd-party migration tool and changing the MX record to a non-existent destination.<br />
<br />
I fully understand that building a new Exchange hybrid deployment is not feasible under the current circumstances, but we have no other way based on the current official technologies. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, we will help you monitor this thread in order to see if any community members can share some relevant experience.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Interesting. &nbsp;"cannot support or would not suggest", yet the official tenant to tenant migration guide (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-migrate-mailboxes-from-one-Office-365-tenant-to-another-65af7d77-3e79-44d4-9173-04fd991358b7)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../How-to-migrate-mailboxes-from-one-Office-365-tenant-to-another-65af7d77-3e79-44d4-9173-04fd991358b7)</a>
 clearly recommends a 3rd party migration tool and suggests the MX record change to soft bounce messages while the domain transitions from one tenant to another. &nbsp;I think your right hand should have a discussion with your left hand. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&lt;snark=on&gt;The lack of an officially provided tool to migrate mailboxes from one tenant to another is.... disappointing. &nbsp;That is if your definition of disappointing is "You have got to be kidding me." &nbsp;But WHY would we EVER want to do ANYTHING that isn't
 supported or suggested?&lt;snark=off&gt; </p>
<p>You know, I think every one would understand if you said "This isn't recommended, suggested, or supported, but yes this should work if....{blather blather} ...but remember we can't guaranty it or support it."</p>
<p>This project has four more months to go. &nbsp;Not because of technical issues but due to human process issues like updating the provisioning procedures between the organizations. &nbsp;Hopefully someone can weigh in on the technical stuff above before then and if
 not, I'll post back what we ended up doing for others who might find themselves in a similar "unsupported" situation.</p>

            <p>Hi &lt;removed&gt;sysadmin,</p>
<p>Sorry that we may not express the situation well.</p>
<p>As you may have already known, currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> party migration tool is recommended when migrating from one Office 365 tenant to another. However, due to that we may lack of the experiences about the 3<sup>rd</sup> party migration tool, we’re not
 able to provide official support when using the tool in the forum. To get a better migration experience when using the tool, it’s recommended that we turn to the 3<sup>rd</sup> party migration tool for expert assistances. Your understanding is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Word and installed fonts not showing up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian e_642  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word and installed fonts not showing up</h2>
                    <p>Here's the problem. &nbsp;I am using both Word 2010 stand alone and Word 2016 online. &nbsp;I found the System font though the Control Panel, but the System font is not showing up in either Word program in the drop down. &nbsp;I've tried re-installing the font on both
 systems, re-starting, and starting in safe mode, and normal mode and the font still doesn't appear in either drop downs for either Word product. &nbsp;The font is available in Microsoft Word Pad and is listed in the Control Panel. &nbsp;I'm not sure why either Word
 program can't find the font. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I am trying to use this font is because I use a Java based database that has a field for typing essays/reports etc. &nbsp;I typically type my information in Microsoft Word and then cut and paste it into the java based program. &nbsp;Once entered into the
 java program, all the quotation marks and apostrophes are converted to question marks or backward question marks. &nbsp;The only font that I've found that doesn't do this is when I cut and paste from Word Pad with System font into the Java program. Now, when I
 cut and paste the same from Word pad with System font into Word and then cut and past from there (Word) into the java program, it works. &nbsp;However, when I type new information next to the newly pasted text in Word and then paste that into the java program,
 it gives me the same question mark problem. &nbsp;This may be hard to follow, I understand. &nbsp;It seems that Word recognizes the original formatting from Word Pad, but when I try to add to what has just been pasted --even in the center of the original sentence that
 was pasted I type ''' """", it automatically converts it to what Word thinks system font should be, but not the font that was originally there. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I've also tried to save the document to RTF or TXT in "save as" and choose MSDOS or plain text and try to cut and paste from that in to Java and it gives me the same question marks with all the apostrophes and quotation marks. &nbsp;Keep in mind that the System
 font I want is already on the system I'm using and not downloaded from the internet - Word Pad uses it. &nbsp;Also, in regards to Java, I don't have access to the Java coding for the program I'm using. &nbsp;By the way, when I cut and paste this """""''''''""'" from
 this text box into the Java program, it doesn't convert it to question marks or backward question marks. &nbsp;What font does this forum use for typing in the inquiry box? &nbsp;</p>

            I tried installing the new font in that manner through Word 2010. &nbsp;I cannot install in Word 2016 since I don't have administrator privileges. &nbsp;However, the [system bold] font is located on both machines in Wordpad and in the control panel. &nbsp;Once the font
 is finally recognized by Word 2010, I will type something in the system bold, embed it in the document, and email the document to the Word 2016 system and maybe that will work somehow. &nbsp;Still need to get it to work in 2010, for some reason even after install,
 reboot, reboot safe mode, open and close Word 2010, it still doesn't recognize the font in the drop down. &nbsp;I've tried the above several times and Word just doesn't seem to find it. &nbsp;

            Does anyone have the standard, no frills, system font or system bold font or terminal font that they can email? &nbsp;The system fonts were all included in Windows, maybe mine are corrupt? &nbsp;OR I can send someone the System Bold font and you can try to get Word
 to recognize it on your end.&nbsp;

            I installed the program and ran it on &nbsp;1 system with Office 2010 Professional Plus, but not on the Word 2016 machine since I don't have administrator rights. &nbsp;When ran on the Office 2010, &nbsp;updated to Service Pack 2 and installed the security updates. &nbsp;The
 only issue is the virus scanner is not up to date. &nbsp;I rebooted and Word 2010 does not show the System Bold, System font, or Terminal fonts installed, but they are listed in WordPad. &nbsp;A check through Control Panel was also done and those fonts were listed.
 &nbsp;I went to try and install them again, but they were grayed out - I guess indicating that they were already installed. &nbsp;Can someone confirm through their Word2016/2010 if system font/system bold is listed and if not, try and install it to see if they have
 the same problem. &nbsp;I'm having the problem on 2 separate machines and 2 separate versions. &nbsp;Curious if this is a common problem.&nbsp;

<h2>            Norton Securty - Beta</h2>
                    <p>For Insiders running Norton and getting BSOD on Norton Scans or at idle, Norton has released a Beta edition that seems to resolve this issue.&nbsp; I am using this Beta edition on a W10 Pro without any BSOD.&nbsp; The Norton issue started 2 or 3 Builds back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am limping along on another Insider PC with a little bit of a work around.&nbsp; I go to the Norton Icon with a right click which offers to Turn On Silent Mode for 1 day max.&nbsp; This stops the idle BSOD when some Norton activity kicks in after 15 minutes or so
 of idle time.&nbsp; I am not able to do scans on this Insiders PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the Norton link -&nbsp; https://manage.norton.com/beta?page=register</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you register, Norton will send you a Product Key of unknown duration.</p>

            <p>Norton is not required for Windows 10&nbsp;&nbsp; neither is Avast, Kaspersky, AVG, and many others...Windows 10 is fine with Defender and MalwareBytes as an occasional scan...</p>
<p>after running many Windows 10 systems I don't recall ever getting a virus anyways...besides Win 10 does'nt like third party antivirus software that runs in the background...and there are many threads posted related to Anti-virus issues , so forget it.</p>

            That is a limitation of the RSS feed, not Outlook. Most feeds are self limited to no more than the last 10.
