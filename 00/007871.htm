<p>Can we use Project Pro 2013 instead of&nbsp;Project Pro for Office 365 for Project Online.</p>
<p>If so, what are the implications and risks?</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>

<p>Yes. To compare the&nbsp;differences, here is an article for your reference:</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had an ongoing problem with my Windows Media Player settings clicking the Organize/drop down/clicking Options. 10 options appear for specific setting Library to Network, all having specific reason default to advanced. DOES SOMEBODY have a link
 that is tutorial or shows exact settings needed to run at default level or even an advanced instruction video? After running advanced troubleshooter, these are the details. HELP!

<p>Hello <em><strong>Maximus95928</strong></em>, <br />
<br />
<br />
To provide you the appropriate steps that can resolve your concern, I’d like to verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which version of Windows Media Player are you using? To check, in Windows Media Player window, press
<em><strong>Alt + H</strong></em> keys and select <em><strong>About Windows Media Player</strong></em>.</li><li>Are you getting an error messages or error codes upon using Windows Media Player? If so, a screenshot of it is highly appreciated.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I'd recommend running the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter to reset its settings to default. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <strong><em>Search</em></strong> box, type <em><strong>Control Panel</strong></em> and press
<strong>Eniter</strong>.</li><li>In the <em><strong>Large icon</strong></em> view, locate and select <em><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></em>.</li><li>Click on <strong><em>Program</em></strong>.</li><li>Click on <em><strong>Windows Media Player Settings</strong></em>.</li><li>A new window will appear. In the lower-hand side of the window, click <strong>
<em>Advanced</em></strong> option.</li><li>Make sure the box is checked to the left of <em><strong>Apply repairs automatically</strong></em> before clicking
<em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em>.</li><li>The current window will close and reopen using the new permissions. Make sure that you have the proper permission to perform this action. You may be prompted for a username and password to continue on.</li><li>Click <strong><em>Next</em></strong> on the troubleshooter window, and the troubleshooter should begin scanning the Windows Media Player settings.</li><li>Once done, click <em><strong>Apply this fix</strong></em> and check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</em></p>

<p>Hi AhmedRiyaz,</p>
<p>Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>Yes, you can use the trial plan for one month.</p>
<p>Regarding the question “Also can we use two E3 trail subscription and one business premium trail subscription together in a single tenant?”, the answer is no. We can just have one (not two) E3 trial and one Business Premium trial in a single tenant, one
 subscription has 25 free licenses. Since you are now using E3 trial, please go to<b> Portal</b> (<a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com</a>) with your Office 365 admin account, navigate to<b> Admin – Purchase services</b>, select the
 Business Premium plan and click <b>Start Free Trial</b> to use the Business Premium trail plan.</p>
<p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p>Hi Robert, </p>
<p>Is there any way to match my concern without buying licences for the one month only? I need 75 licences to migrate all the existing email users to office 365. or is there way to create connectors for switch mail flow to existing email server after been pointed
 MX to office 365? that means i need co extance between two servers. initially i will migrate 30 users to office 365 and the same time i need to manage mails though EOP by doing so for understanding is we need to point MX to office 365 and create a smart host.
 if you will help me out with the configuration it will be helpful .</p>
<p>Thnaks</p>

<p>Hi Riyaz,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>By saying “I need 75 licences to migrate all the existing email users to office 365”, do you mean you need 75 trial licenses? If yes, you can set up the free trial for one Business Premium and one E5 plan under your current E3 plan as three of the plans
 have Exchange services. Please refer to the steps mentioned in my last post to get the trial plans.</p>
<p>Regarding “i need co extance between two servers” and “i need to manage mails though EOP”, do you want to receive emails in Office 365 and keep your current email service to test Office 365? If yes, to meet your requirements, you can use the Simple Domain
 Sharing. Here are the detailed steps:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/exchange/simple-domain-sharing-for-smtp-email-addresses</p>
<p>Please let me know if anything is misunderstood, we will do further analysis for you.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            How to get out of &#39;thread view&#39; in the new Outlook preview and back to &#39;chronological view&#39; the &#34;old&#34; Outlook has&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a legitimate question for help, please. Here's a brief intro and feedback first:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too was surprised to log in in September or October and see the so-called "new and improved" preview of what Outlook is supposed to look like... based on a bunch of programmer's ideas who probably don't even use the service.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been a loyal hotmailer --now outlooker-- since the last 90s. Same address. It puts my spam in junk and puts my real messages in the inbox. No problems with hotmail or outlook until now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This switcheroo stuff is really annoying. People hate it when you surprise them like that. Worst of all, the new Outlook is by default a thread-based inbox... like Gmail's default.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>WE USE OUTLOOK (HOTMAIL) BECAUSE MANY OF US DON'T LIKE GMAIL.&nbsp; Doesn't Microsoft realize that? Stop trying to be more like Gmail and be glad you are not Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people logged in that fateful day, needing to see an important message in their inbox... and, whoa, none of the new stuff is showing up because it's not part of an existing thread.&nbsp; I logged out and logged back in and it took me to the normal good ole
 Outlook that I love. </p>
<p>
</p><p>***So... my question is:*** How does one turn the thread option off and list emails chronologically? I need to know NOW, please, before the switch is permanent. I don't like thread-based inboxes. My brain works chronologically. I know the approximate time
 and date such and such person wrote. If it's important I can put that email from a day or week or month ago in another file. I don't think in threads/conversations online. I DO in person lol, because that's how people talk. But who has ever truly had a real
 conversation with multiple people about ONE topic... over several or a dozen emails? Threads are dumb. Leave them to Gmail. If you want to offer the option of thread-based inboxes, that's great. Some people like them. But make the default like the old Outlook,
 please. If this cannot be done, at least guide people through how to switch their new Outlook (sometime this winter I'm assuming) back to chrono view instead of thread view.
</p>
<p>

            16299.15 is not a preview.&nbsp; It is the Fall Creators Update release.&nbsp; Use the product key you received at the time you purchased Office, either in an email or in a box to re-install.&nbsp; If you purchased from the Microsoft Store online, go to your Microsoft
 account to retrieve the key and download the software.&nbsp; If you upgraded to the FCU in the last ten days you can roll back to your previous version of Windows and then recover the Office key with one of the key finder programs.

            We originally install Nitro for creating our online order forms.&nbsp; Before we installed the Outlook preview was working perfectly well, there must be something in the Nitro program that changed the Outlook previewer.&nbsp; I was just wondering if there is any
 way to override this and put it back to what it was?&nbsp; No I can't open it in Explorer, as that&nbsp;also seems to be set to the Nitro PDF - normally this isn't a problem though.&nbsp; Any ideas??

            Your best option is to set it to open using adobe reader. That should work.<br />
Else you could check with nitro support once.<br />

salauddin nomaan.</a> You may try performing a hardware reboot. This reboot will not delete any personal data on the phone. To do this while the phone is turned off, press and hold the volume down and power button keys at the same time until it vibrates and
 it will restart. After setting the date and time correctly and the problem with Yahoo exist, remove the Yahoo mailbox and add it again. If the issue with the app download exist, you may try checking this

    <title>One drive online folders empty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williammcmillan2  say:</h3>
<h2>            One drive online folders empty</h2>
                    <p>OK, a bit complicated, but will try to keep it simple as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Laptop and Windows 10.</p>
<p>To free up some disk space, went into the settings and selected various temporary files to permanently delete / compress. After this, I then emptied my recycle bin and restarted my computer.</p>
<p>On restart of computer I noticed various differences to my files / pics etc that I had on my Desktop. All the icons had 2 little blue arrows on their top right corner.
<strong>Now this is where the real problems are lying.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>All these files/folders/pics etc were originally downloaded from Onedrive cloud and stored to my desktop. Finding this a bit strange, I then went online to my Onedrive cloud, only to discover that every folder is empty of contents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onedrive online is showing all my folders and sub-folders, with their proper names , dates , when they were created etc. It is not showing any modifications to them, and no previous versions. On opening every folder, sub-folder or photo, it is saying this
 folder is empty. No contents whatsoever, no modification, no previous version.</p>
<p>I contacted online support, but all they kept saying was go to Onedrive recycle bin, select items and restore. Have tried to explain to them, the recycle bin in there is empty and always has been, as I have never deleted anything from Onedrive, so there
 is no files to restore. Like banging my head against the wall.</p>
<p>Never at any time have I deleted any files from Onedrive, but now every single folder I have is completely empty.</p>
<p><strong>Next problem,</strong>&nbsp; I thought I had auto back-up, but turns out not. So cant reset computer to earlier time before my clean up of space.</p>
<p>Have spoken to friends that know a bit, and they say that deleting temp. files from computer should not affect Onedrive. Maybe someone knows different.</p>
<p><strong>I said this was complicated, so here's the rest of it.&nbsp;</strong>Last week I got an email from Microsoft to say that my security details had been deleted from my MS account. Another email about 1 min later saying security details had been added to
 my MS account.?????? Being wary, I went in and changed my password.</p>
<p>As Onedrive is the same sign-in as MS, is it possible that someone has hacked my Onedrive and cleaned it out, and if that is the case, how come there is no trace. It is as though all these files/folders never existed.</p>
<p>Sorry for such a long post, but I desperately need access to these files, so any help from you people out there would be more than welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>This may sound silly but had many a times with customers just a simple OOPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st&nbsp; make sure the one drive is actually linking correctly. To do this, drop a file (doesn't matter what) into the One drive on your computer, look for it to sync, by the two Blue arrows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1de10dd-c047-4966-be6c-3978e982b8d6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1de10dd-c047-4966-be6c-3978e982b8d6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Once its done, it will go to a green tick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to the online One drive and make sure its actually synced to the account.</p>
<p>If it has then its recovery time, if it hasn't then its either a corrupted one drive , OR&nbsp; a wrong account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had it happen with one customer, he was jumping up and down saying MS had deleted all his years worth of data, then on investigation discovered when he installed office 365, he had used a different email address and it was the Office Onedrive that was empty,
 NOT the one on his computer, basically he has two accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All this is doing is tracking down where the problem actually is.</p>

</p><p>The Portable one is good enough, run it, up top see if there's a date from the drop down box prior to the problem happening, if so select it, navigate to your one drive folder or where ever the files were, export all the data back out.</p>

<h2>            how to delete &#34;the bundled&#34; media files in sony ericsson XPERIA&#63;</h2>
                    i just bought a sony ericcsson XPERIA<br />
the pocket pc is shipped with James Bond movie trailer, jazz videos and some big mp3 songs<br />
I tried to find the file using File Explorer<br />
These big media files is stored at phone storage memory (in Windows folder)<br />
I dislike them, then i try to delete them to conserve phone memory<br />
<br />
The problem is the File Explorer does not allow me to delete them<br />
The DELETE popup menu is disabled<br />
<br />
Then i tried to explore the phone by using desktop PC and delete these big useless media files<br />
A popup message window displayed telling that those files cannot be deleted<br />
<br />
Are all files in the windows folder of Windows Mobile all are in ROM?<br />
Any available tool to delete these useless files?<br />
Please advise

            I'm only guessing that these files are included in the ROM of the device Wang.&nbsp; If that is the case, then they are really not deletable.&nbsp; That said, you might be able to change the properties of the file using a program like RESCO file explorer then delete
 them.&nbsp; Of course, a hard reset will bring them all back if they are part of the ROM.<br />

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have created a three day Schedule on MS Project. It is a 24 hr project and I have set the working times for actual hands on work. The project is scheduled by the hour. Non-working hours for lunch and shift change are not included in the working times
 and I would&nbsp; like to visually show them on the gantt chart the same way a nonworking day is shown. Any suggestions?

<p>Perhaps you will need to create a calendar which is the inverse of the working day. Working days become nonworking days. Working hours become nonworking hours. Then apply this calendar to a task.</p>
<p>And, specifically for what you ask, you already have nonworking time on the chart but you have to select which calendar's nonworking time to display. You only get one in any given view. You might want to make a new view, identical in every way to the standadrd
 Gantt chart view except the chart displays a different calendar for nonworking time.

<h2>            Windows Phones 10 - Option for Traditional Desktop - Remember change is difficult but not changing can be fatal&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that Windows 10 will be a smashing success because you are listening to the customer and not forcing your preconceived ideas about what a customer likes or dislikes thus offering real choices. Although, I have participated in the PC version of
 Windows 10 Technical preview since its inception, I have shied away from windows phone because it lack real choices in how the phone is used. For example, the metro interface is thrust on the user without the choice of a traditional desktop. Since, I purchased
 my windows phone in June 2014 it has been relegated to a bin on my desk because I prefer the traditional phone desktop. Although, I was hoping that windows 10 preview for the phone was adding choice where the user has the option to select the metro interface
 or traditional desktop it appears that I am disappointment yet again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the goal is to gain market share from your competitors then choice is essential to achieve this goal. A traditional phone desktop would make it easier for non enthusiasts to easily transition from similar desktops that are found on the Android and Apple
 phones. In the business classes that I have taken the number 1 percept is to give the customer what they want and they will buy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To this point, I have watched many potential customers shy away from &nbsp;the windows phone because it so different and the change from Android and Apple is so extreme. Please don't make the same mistake a second time by assuming the customer wants the uniqueness
 of the metro interface. In fact, I would suggest that similar to the PC version you should hide metro in a start menu or task manager view that allow users to multitask by opening &nbsp;multiple windows tasks views and desktops. This would accentuate the new windows
 10 functionality and unlock the true potential of the windows phones which is multitasking while users talk, text, play games and draft powerpoints and documents in word. &nbsp;Oh and Spartan, which I have not seen on the phone but use on the PC is literally a
 game changer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A small change such as providing a traditional phone desktop with a neat arrangement of apps would push Windows 10 phone to a new level. It was never about the apps but more about the drastic change to an unique interface.&nbsp;<strong>Remember change is difficult
 but not changing can be fatal!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't let your inability to change destroy windows phone 10 which is a great concept, however, so far&nbsp;executed poorly. I still have hope in Microsoft.</p>
<p>

            Im afraid you may be disappointed here.<br />
<br />
The "Look" of windows phone (which you clearly detest)&nbsp;IS&nbsp;THE FACE&nbsp;of windows phone. desktop computers have "desktops" the phone being touch centric does not NEED a desktop interface.<br />
MS realizes there will&nbsp;be a shift in&nbsp;useablilty, one&nbsp;where your desktop computer acts more like a mobile device, (more and more people everyday&nbsp;are opting for tablets&nbsp;and phones over desktop computers) They realize the public is becoming more "touch-centric".&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps
 gen-one of windows 8 was a little jarring, so for desktops, the desktop stays. brilliant!... but MS is not going to put "iphone-like" icons on their start screens my friend. Perhaps I am misunderstanding but, -the&nbsp;tiles&nbsp;ARE the icons. The issue you have is
 solely&nbsp;aesthetics. on Android&nbsp;or iphone, you click a tile and the app opens, Windows phone has not changed this fundamental action, it is only PRESENTED in a different way. You cant hate it because its different can you? After all,&nbsp;A wise man once said, &nbsp;<strong>change
 is difficult but not changing can be fatal</strong>

            <p>Publisher can be used to create fillable HTML forms, which you could post to a web server and collect the data. Publisher could also be used to create a form that you would print to PDF, to which you could add form fields in Acrobat. But it's not a form-filling
 piece of software on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Publisher doesn't have layers either, though you can stack objects and change their order, much as you can with almost any other piece of software. It does have Master Pages, so you could use an identical master page to create a series of form variants on
 different pages. Perhaps if you gave us more details about what you're trying to accomplish, we can give you more specific advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The three biggies for forms are web forms, PDF forms and Word forms. Web forms are universally available to anyone who has a web browser installed. The downside is they need more setup on the web server to collect the data. PDF forms are almost as universally
 available as web forms, since Acrobat Reader is so widely distributed. You need a full copy of Acrobat to make forms, but they can be fillable and saveable in Reader. Word forms are easiest to construct, but users need to have Word installed to fill them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I create all three kinds, so I can help you with whatever solution you decide to pursue.</p>

            <p>In general you can make a static printable form but not the dynamic form you want using Publisher in the way you describe. Here is a recent thread where we discussed something similar:

<h2>            Some parts of web page do not print out</h2>
                    <p>Since I had to do a system restore recently, I have been having problems printing from internet pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I bring up a page and look on print preview it looks OK.&nbsp; Typically some parts of the web page appear on the printed out page, but some parts don't.&nbsp; For example when I try to print the Guardian crossword, the grid prints, but not the numbers or clues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Vista Home Premium running Explorer 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have done already:</p>
<p>Tried the online printing troubleshoooter from Microsoft</p>
<p>Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the printer</p>
<p>Tried installing Explorer 9 (but same problems)</p>
<p>Tried another system restore to an earlier date (so now back on Explorer 7)</p>
<p>Used Microsoft tool to reset Explorer settings</p>
<p>Used tool to disable add ons</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp; It's driving me mad!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the link Imran.&nbsp; I tried all the steps and was just starting to despair when I accidentally found what the problem was.&nbsp; It's a bit embarrassing that I didn't spot it, but just in case it helps anyone else, here is what happened:</p>
<p>I could see all the page on print preview, but when printed only some info appeared.&nbsp; If I did PrtScn and put into say Photoshop I seemed able to print from there OK.</p>
<p>What I just realised was that, although on the printer box which appears onscreen it looked like all my ink cartridges were full, actually the black was empty!&nbsp; The parts of the page which were printing out were actually dark grey, and parts which needed
 pure black were not printing.&nbsp; I can only assume that by using PrtScn into Photoshop, somehow the computer amends its information about what colours it needs and was able to produce the 'black' parts by using a combination of the coloured inks.</p>
<p>So - I was just being a bit thick, not checking inks.&nbsp; Because this problem&nbsp;came along with my other issues and system restore I assumed it was connected, and because the ink level&nbsp;reading looked OK, I didn't check.&nbsp; Just goes to show, check all the basics
 first even though they appear on the surface to be OK.&nbsp; Hope this helps someone else....</p>

<h2>            Forward unanswered calls to external number</h2>
                    I am trying to set my answering rule in outlook so that if a caller reaches my voicemail on my office number it gives them the option to ring my cell phone. The issue is I keep getting this error: The phone number you entered doesn't comply with the dialing
 restrictions configured by your voice mail administrator. I have googled and looked through the community but unable to find a solution. Any assistance is appreciated even if it is pointing me to the right question that has already been asked.

            Hi Anthony,<br />
<br />
Are you referring to this article to set up answering rules to forward unanswered calls?<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335138(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335138(v=exchg.150).aspx</a><br />
<br />
If yes, from the error message, it seems that the phone number you entered conflicts with the dialing restrictions configured by your voice mail admin. Depending on how a call answering rule is configured, an incoming call may result in a call transfer. When
 this happens, the transfer target phone number will be subject to the dialing rules and restrictions on the UM mailbox policy that the called party is associated with. When a call is placed to an external telephone number, Outdialing happens. Outdialing is
 the process by which users call in to a UM dial plan using an Outlook Voice Access number and place or transfer a call to an internal or external telephone number.
<br />
<br />
For outdialing to work correctly, the following settings must be configured correctly:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Dialing rules</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dialing rules define the number that is dialed by the UM-enabled user and the number that will be dialed by the Private Branch eXchange (PBX) or IP PBX.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Dialing rule groups</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dialing rule groups determine the types of calls that users within a dialing group can make.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Dialing authorizations</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dialing authorizations determine the restrictions that will be applied to prevent users from incurring unnecessary telephone charges or from dialing long-distance calls.<br />
<br />
So, please confirm with your voice mail admin that the above settings are configured correctly.<br />
For more information, please refer to:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb232172(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb232172(v=exchg.150).aspx</a><br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mouran

            Yes. you can run MSE in Safemode. Although, the real-time protection is disabled since the service will not run in SafeMode. You can perform all scan options at this point Quick, Full and Custom.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had the very same issue and have spent ages hunting around to find that it is in some pesky settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Head to File -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced in Visio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down to the display section where you will find a section called "Stencil spacing", for some reason this is set way too low and short -&gt; like 5 characters and 1 row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So beef this up with using say 15 characters over 3 lines per master or whatever makes it work for the text on your stencils.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next pass if this does not work is then to close out form Visio, find a stencil file and edit it.&nbsp; then choose say "Icons &amp; Names" to see the text to the side or "Names under Icons" to see the text below them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that should fix your and also others with the same problem as it has worked for me.</p>
<p>
