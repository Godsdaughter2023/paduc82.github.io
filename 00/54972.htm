                    <p>I accidentally blocked a site in microsoft family in the list of sights visited in my weekly email review by touching the "block" in blue and it is now black in the words saying "blocked". It will not change if touched again. &nbsp;How do I unblock this site?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>What you are seeing with multiple versions of the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable installed is normal.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>When a developer builds a program using Visual C++, the version that they use may be the current version or an older version. The version
 that they use will be installed on the computer, when you install that program. A later version&nbsp;may not work with that program.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Occasionally, these versions may be updated to fix newly discovered problems or vulnerabilities, or to add enhancements.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>When Windows Update distributes an update for an older version of C++ and it detects that version is installed on your computer, it will
 apply that update.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstalling any of these versions&nbsp;can result in some installed programs no longer working properly.</span></p>
<p><span>These&nbsp;updates are usually very small.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

<h2>            At what age can a child buy games with Microsoft points </h2>
                    
<p>We allowed our son to purchase 2100 Microsoft points at the weekend at the supermarket via a prepayment card.&nbsp; He is 9 - will be 10 next month.&nbsp; He has been unable to redeem his points and purchase Minecraft and I was told on Saturday this was because he
 is under 10 and you need to be 10 or over to purchase games.&nbsp; After nearly 3 hours on live chat with a representative of Microsoft they agreed to refund the points to my account so I could purchase the game for him to play as he didn't want to wait&nbsp;until he
 turns 10&nbsp;(I dont personally even want an account but had to set one up as he is a minor!).&nbsp; I am still waiting for the Advocacy team to refund the points and have had to contact the live chat team again to verify information on my sons account - am still talking
 to them (just 90 mins so far this evening) and they are now saying that he will not be allowed to purchase any games using his prepaid Microsoft points until he is 18!!! Seriously????&nbsp; How many 17 year olds want Mum buying their games for them with their Microsoft
 points??!!&nbsp; Is this really the case??&nbsp; What is the point of him&nbsp; buying Microsoft points if he can't buy games - and please don't say to dress his Avatar which one representative suggested he do with £18 worth of points!!&nbsp;&nbsp; At what age can a child buy age
 appropriate games with their prepaid Microsoft points.&nbsp; I have set security settings limiting what games he can access.&nbsp; He has an iPod and can spend his iTunes card on his own with no involvement from me at all (age limits have been set) so why is this so
 complicated??!?&nbsp; Regretting having ever agreed to an xBox at&nbsp; present!!</p>

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to ask you the following questions so we can isolate the cause of the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did the Windows update successfully went through to your computer?</li><li>Are there any interruptions when you were doing the update on your computer?</li><li>Can you tell us more about the issue? When you say that it has a very poor loading startup, how long does it take to boot to the desktop screen?</li><li>Have you had any error codes/messages? Does it go to a black screen before loading the desktop?</li><li>What troubleshooting have you already done regarding this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>

    <title>ReadyBoost ALL Explained - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coccamocca  say:</h3>
<h2>            ReadyBoost ALL Explained</h2>
                    
<p>Thread startet by IT-M coccamocca from Norway. (20.september 2009)</p>
<p>If you're visiting the thread via the 'ReadyBoost ALL Explained' question thread, I've rerouted you here. Welcome!</p>
<p>After checking ALL OVER the internet for updated information on ReadyBoost it seems I had to take things into my own hands. The information from Microsoft is very limited and very bad handled.</p>
<p>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/12428141-2e4c-43ab-8dd2-a6ed6e3b87761033.mspx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1_ The information directly from the leading developer are over 3 years old. *</p>
<p>2_ Windows Vista ReadyBoost issues.</p>
<p>3_ Windows 7 ReadyBoost issues including USB 3.</p>
<p>4_ Compatible USB / SD / CF cards for ReadyBoost.</p>
<p>5_ A Guide on how to use ReadyBoost</p>
<p>6_ Personal Example and Experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1_ The information directly from the leading developer are over 3 years old.</p>
<p>*Matt Ayers, who is the Program Manager in the Microsoft Windows Client Performance group and basically owns the ReadyBoost feature.</p>
<p>Matt Ayers: (June 2006)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"I'm the Program Manager in the Microsoft Windows Client Performance group and own the ReadyBoost feature. I wanted to give some offical answers based on the excellent questions and discussions that I've seen in this blog, to date. Also, I'll be using this
 as a starting point for the official ReadyBoost FAQ. <br />
<br />
Overall, as many posters have pointed out, the feature is designed to improve small random I/O for people who lack the expansion slots, money, and or technical expertise to add additional RAM. As y’all know, adding RAM is still the best way to relieve memory
 pressure. <br />
<br />
Thanks, again, for your interest, questions and ideas".</p>
<p>Q: What perf do you need on your device?<br />
A: 2.5MB/sec throughput for 4K random reads and 1.75MB/sec throughput for 512K random writes<br />
<br />
Q: My device says 12MB/sec (or 133x or something else) on the package but windows says that it isn't fast enough to use as a ReadyBoost device... why?<br />
A: Two possible reasons: <br />
The numbers measure sequential performance and we measure random. We've seen devices that have great sequential perf, but horrible random
<br />
The performance isn't consistantly fast across the entire device. Some devices have 128M of lightning fast flash and the rest of the device is really slow. This is fine for some applications but not ReadyBoost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What's the largest amount of flash that I can use for ReadyBoost?<br />
A: You can use up to 4GB of flash for ReadyBoost (which turns out to be 8GB of cache w/ the compression)<br />
<br />
Q: Why can't I use more than 4GB of flash?<br />
A: The FAT32 filesystem limits our ReadyBoost.sfcache file to 4GB<br />
<br />
Q: What's the smallest ReadyBoost cache that I can use<br />
A: The smallest cache is 256MB (well, 250 after formatting). Post beta2, we may drop it another 10 MB or so.
<br />
<br />
Q: Ok... 256M-4GB is a pretty big range... any recommendations?<br />
A: Yes. We recommend a 1:1 ratio of flash to system memory at the low end and as high as 2.5:1 flash to system memory. Higher than that and you won't see much benefit.<br />
<br />
Q: Isn't this just putting the paging file onto a flash disk?<br />
A: Not really - the file is still backed on disk. This is a cache - if the data is not found in the ReadyBoost cache, we fall back to the HDD.<br />
<br />
Q: Aren't Hard Disks faster than flash? My HDD has 80MB/sec throughput.<br />
A: Hard drives are great for large sequential I/O. For those situations, ReadyBoost gets out of the way. We concentrate on improving the performance of small, random I/Os, like paging to and from disk.<br />
<br />
Q: What happens when you remove the drive? <br />
A: When a surprise remove event occurs and we can't find the drive, we fall back to disk. Again, all pages on the device are backed by a page on disk. No exceptions. This isn't a separate page file store, but rather a cache to speed up access to frequently
 used data.<br />
<br />
Q: Isn't user data on a removable device a security risk?<br />
A: This was one of our first concerns and to mitigate this risk, we use AES-128 to encrypt everything that we write to the device.
<br />
<br />
Q: Won't this wear out the drive?<br />
A: Nope. We're aware of the lifecycle issues with flash drives and are smart about how and when we do our writes to the device. Our research shows that we will get at least 10+ years out of flash devices that we support.<br />
<br />
Q: Can use use multiple devices for EMDs?<br />
A: Nope. We've limited Vista to one ReadyBoost per machine<br />
<br />
Q: Why just one device?<br />
A: Time and quality. Since this is the first revision of the feature, we decided to focus on making the single device exceptional, without the difficulties of managing multiple caches. We like the idea, though, and it's under consideration for future versions.<br />
<br />
Q: Do you support SD/CF/memory stick/MMC/etc.?<br />
A: Mostly. In beta2, we added support for a small number of SD/CF cards on internal USB2 &amp; PCIe busses. RC1 has a much broader support range.
<br />
<br />
Q: Why don't you support SD on my USB2.0 external card reader?<br />
A: We unfortunately don't support external card readers - there were some technical hurdles that we didn't have time to address. In general, if a card reader shows a drive without media in it (like a floppy drive or CD ROM does), we can't use it for ReadyBoost.<br />
<br />
Q: Will it support all USB drives, regardless of how they are ID'd to the OS ("hard disk drive" or "Device with Removable Storage")?
<br />
A: We have no way to tell what is on the other end of a USB cable so we do some basic size checks (since no one has a 200GB flash device ;-) ) and then perform our speed tests. HDD will not, however, pass our speed tests, and there is no benefit to using a
 USB HDD for ReadyBoost.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you use an mp3 player to speed up your system?<br />
A: Not currently. MP3 players use the 'plays for sure' interfaces to expose themselves to Windows. We require that the device appear as a disk volume. These aren't currently compatible.<br />
<br />
Q: How much of a speed increase are we talking about?<br />
A: Well, that depends. On average, a RANDOM 4K read from flash is about 10x faster than from HDD. Now, how does that translate to end-user perf? Under memory pressure and heavy disk activity, the system is much more responsive; on a 4GB machine with few applications
 running, the ReadyBoost effect is much less noticable.<br />
<br />
Q: I can't get my device to work with ReadyBoost... can I lower the perf requirements?<br />
A: Unfortunately, no. We've set the perf requirements to the lowest possible throughput that still makes your system faster. If we lowered the perf requirements, then there wouldn't be a noticeable benefit to using ReadyBoost. Remember, we're not adding memory,
 we're improving disk access.<br />
<br />
Q: Which manufacturers support ReadyBoost?<br />
A: Well, I hope that all of them do, eventually. Right now, we're working with manufacturers to create a program that will allow them to identify ReadyBoost capable devices on their packaging.</p>

<p>Updated Questions and Answers Follows:</p>
<p>Main issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2_ Windows Vista ReadyBoost issues.</p>
<p>OS RAM LIMITS Vista Edition 32-bit memory support - 4 gb ram</p>
<p>Vista Edition 64-bit memory support<br />
Home Basic 8 GB Home Premium 16 GB Ultimate 128+ GB Business 128+ GB Enterprise 128+ GB</p>
<p>As stated by Matt, the ReadyBoost limit are 4gb on PC that runs XP/Vista 32bit. It does not state anything for NTFS nor does this apply to Vista 64 bit users or Vista users that runs NTFS.</p>
<p>Microsoft recommends the amount of flash memory for ReadyBoost acceleration to be 1 to 3 times the amount of RAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3_ Windows 7 ReadyBoost issues including USB 3.</p>
<p>The maximum possible system ram in w7 are 4gb for 32bit systems and 192gb for 64bit systems. This goes for all editions of w7.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft ReadyBoost now works with most flash storage devices in w7 and supports up to 8 devices and up to a maximum 256gb of additional memory. A total of 448gb (192gb+256gb)</p>
<p>W7 can also read/support itself from USB devices in other PC's that is located on the same LAN according to Jim Allchin at Microsoft. ReadyBoost will disable itself on a Solid State Disk (SSD)</p>
<p>W7 supports the exFAT filesystem. How would this apply to ReadyBoost?</p>
<p>Does the ratio rule of 1:1 or 3:1 recommended by MS still apply for Windows 7 with ReadyBoost?</p>
<p>As the HD devices have developed into s-ata with much faster I/O would ReadyBoost still give a faster PC in W7?</p>
<p>How would USB 3 and ReadyBoost operate on a Windows 7?</p>
<p>A desktop usually have HD devices of s-ata 7200 RPM, how would this apply to ReadyBoost?</p>
<p>A laptop usually have HD devices of s-ata 5400 RPM, how would this apply to ReadyBoost?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6_ Personal Example and Experiences.</p>
<p>I just bought a notebook from ACER, a mid-range one, with the following specs. Vista64 Premium, 4gb ram ddr3, s-ata 5400 RPM, HD 500gb 2ms, 5,5ms</p>
<p>To expand from 4gb to 8gb ram cost today $1000. With a ReadyBoost USB stick I can get 32gb as low as $100.</p>
<p>The PC support the w7 update program. MS Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>I plan to run both large video and music programs like Sony Vegas and Steinberg Wavelabs on the notebook.</p>
<p>How would ReadyBoost help me during edit/making of large projects that often/alwats make use of the cache?</p>

            Dear,<br />
<br />
I just bought one of the fastest flash-drives, the Datatraveler HyperX 16GB USB-stick for using Vista readyboost. The packaging
<br />
says that the device is Vista Readyboost capable. Now when I plugin the device, <br />
it works fine, but I cant use it for readyboost. Device didn't passed the <br />
readyboost requirements .... For readyboost is a 2.5MB/sec throughput for 4KB <br />
random reads needed. Now when I test the device on 4KB random reads I get only <br />
1.3MB/sec. So I cant use Readyboost<br />
<br />
I tested the drive on the same machine, using a dual-boot configuration. <br />
<br />
This is what I did, startup Vista or Windows7, test the drive using ATTO, leave <br />
device in usb-port, restart computer, boot-up XP, test the drive again using <br />
ATTO.<br />
<br />
So its exact the same hardware, only different operating systems.<br />
<br />
In&nbsp; XP its an excellent flash-drive but I bought the drive for using readyboost <br />
in Vista or Win7 …on this speeds this isn’t possible L.<br />
<br />
You can view the speed difference here:<br />

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Thank you for your respond.<br />
<br />
Yes, ist the Datatraveler HyperX 16GB, I also tested Windows Vista x64 bussiness and the same results here, xp is 5 times faster then vista.<br />
<br />
You can view the speed difference XP-Vista here:<br />

When I contact the Kingston support they tell me:<br />
You are right the speed is to slow but please notice that Kingston does not support any 64bit OS. :( ...<br />

            for it to work. right click the flash drive or usb stick under my computer and format the drive. in doing so windows will recognize it as its device and will then be usable.

<h2>            &#34;Find devices and content&#34; switches itself off</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 Pro on one of my PCs.&nbsp; I have enabled file and printer sharing on my private network.&nbsp; I have not enabled file and printer sharing on guest or public&nbsp;networks.&nbsp; After successfully being able to access shared resources on that PC
 from other PCs on my home network, I began to experience issues.&nbsp; I eventually deduced that the problem was that the PC with the shared resources had somehow toggled off the "Find devices and content" setting.&nbsp; This was causing my private home network to be
 labeled as a public network.&nbsp; I turned it back on and sharing worked fine again.&nbsp; However, the setting keeps switching itself off.&nbsp; It stays toggled on for a day or two and then mysteriously toggles itself off.&nbsp; What might be causing this?&nbsp; Could it have something
 to do with syncing settings (I sync settings across five PCs and a phone)?

<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate your efforts which you’ve put in to resolve the issue and I will assist you with troubleshooting steps further.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform a <strong>System Restore</strong> and then check the behavior.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System Restore helps you restore your computer's system files to an earlier point in time. It's a way to undo system changes to your computer without affecting your personal files, such as e‑mail, documents, or photos.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the section “<strong>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time”</strong> mentioned in the following Microsoft Article:

 that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if we could be of any help further and we’ll be more than happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>Have a great day.</span></p>

    <title>Doc recovery after unexpected system update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dvan heusen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Doc recovery after unexpected system update</h2>
                    During the most recent update on my system, which happened overnight, a rather large word document that I was editing on my desktop was closed by my system&nbsp;and not saved with my edits. I tried to recover it but don't see it as having been saved as recoverable
 when I opened the word program.&nbsp;This is upsetting, to say the least, because I spent quite some time&nbsp;making edits and now find myself in the position of trying to recall all the changes made. Is there a way of recovering this document?

            <p><span>Hi Dvan, </span></p>
<p><span>I realize that you want to recover an edited word document that was not saved. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to check if that helps:</span></p>
<p><span>1-End all Word related processes:</span></p>
<p><span>Press Ctrl+Alt+Esc to open the Task Manager dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>On the Processes tab, click any instance of Winword.exe or Microsoft Word, and then click End Process. Repeat this step until you have quit all instances of Winword.exe and Word.</span></p>
<p><span>Note If this is your first time using Task Manager, click More details to see all processes.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Windows Task Manager dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Restart Word and then see if the missing file is displayed in the Document Recovery task pane. By default, Word searches for Auto Recover files each time it starts.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Double click the Auto Recover files one by one. If you find the lost Word file, save it immediately.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep us informed to help you further.</span></span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

            I wish I had good news to share, but I don't. I was not able to recover the document. FYI, the auto-recovery is set and timed to save docs&nbsp;at&nbsp;10-minutue intervals, which I thought is a failsafe built into the software just for such instances.&nbsp;I also&nbsp;searched
 sub-folders with no success.&nbsp;Oh well, if you have any other suggestions I would love to hear them.&nbsp;

            I followed the steps outlined in the article, but was unable to recover the document; I will have to attempt to recreate my edits. I assume there was some tech glitch that prevented the auto-recovery from working properly. Thank you for the assistance.

    <title>Wireless keyboard lagging and missing keystrokes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sforzand0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless keyboard lagging and missing keystrokes</h2>
                    <p>I have a new wireless HP 2.4 GHz keyboard and mouse, and I'm running Windows 10. Both the keyboard and mouse connect to the same USB dongle. The mouse was so jerky and uncontrollable that I ditched it and I'm using another wired mouse. The keyboard is sometimes
 quite passable, but sometimes it lags quite a lot, and when it's really bad it misses keystrokes and is almost unusable. I'm a typist by profession, so this is a major problem for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought if I could get the dongle closer to the keyboard it might fix the problem, so I got a powered USB hub and have experimented putting it on either side of the keyboard, only centimetres away. It hasn't helped at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure whether it's the keyboard or the computer. I have a feeling it might be something on the computer, because I have a foot pedal which I use for audio control, and in the past it's been playing up/lagging in a similar way with this computer, but
 I think it was more to do with a template I was using in Word rather than a consistent fault. At the moment the keyboard is typing okay with this message, but using Word it's dodgy. So is it something to do with Microsoft Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated!</p>

<p>What kind of account are your using to log in to your computer? Based on my research, it seems like this issue occurs when the computer was once connected with a Microsoft account, but then, connected using a local account. Kindly check this article to ensure
 that you are logged in using a Microsoft account:</p>

    <title>My Gaming Headset Is not Appearing as a Seperate Microphone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dalmango  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Gaming Headset Is not Appearing as a Seperate Microphone</h2>
                    <p>I have an Asus, Cerberus Arctic Headset which has audio ports (not usb) and I cannot get the microphone to work properly. I've tried:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Realtek Audio HD: Removing suppression and echo reduction; if the microphone is up high - it needs echo reduction or it over sensitizes itself (if that's a thing);</li><li>Realtek Audio HD: Microphone volume down; better with not having blank voids of sound where the above "over sensitizes itself" however it's still unusuable;</li><li>Realtek Audio HD: Disabling and going through Windows Playback Devices; no improvement;</li><li>Realtek Audio HD: Trying all variations of settings; Nearly a whole day recording sounds and playing back to listen for improvement;</li><li>Changed sound output to come from the monitor and not through the headset when recording; better with interferance/ clarity but still unusuable;</li><li>Updating Drivers; newest is installed;</li><li>Troubleshooting in Windows 10; unsuprisingly it says fine;</li></ul>
<p>Suprisingly reviews seem to be quite good for this headset but this was the same with the Asus Sika mouse but I found this to be unusable.
<br />
<br />
My question is - <strong>The problem of Windows 10 with a low sounding microphone seems to be quite common and leads me to think it's a software issue. I cannot afford to spend another day trying to configure the microphone headset and I only need a microphone
 really (not for gaming for screen movies, presentations things like that). <br />
If I was to purchase a better microphone would this eradicate the problem or is the usb connection better for microphones? I would've thought analogue would be better for sound.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recording via the laptop microphone is not bad, the problem seems to be that the Headset Microphone is not being picked up.</strong></p>

<p>Hi Dalmango,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Tell us more about your concern. Was it working before? When did the issue start happening? What changes have been made to your device since then? If this is a new device, it could a hardware issue. Have you run the automated hardware and devices, and recording
 audio troubleshooter in Settings app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response, it's a brand new device, 1st time setting up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned I ran the automated trouble shooter; says it' working fine.</p>
<p>When I plug in the microphone I'm not getting the green sound graphical display as I speak and it records really quiet. If I unplug the microphone it uses the laptop microphone which works fine.</p>

            I assume that you already play around setting up the headset as the default recording device. If your current user profile is corrupted, this should be working on other users.
<span><span>Create a<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>test</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>user
 account and check if the issue replicates</span></span><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Follow

 Otherwise, </span>this could have been a hardware issue. Try to get in touch with the device manufacturer.

<h2>            No incoming calls shows on my screen, but the caller hears it ringing until it goes to voice mail. I can make outbound calls OK, though.</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed a new Skype phone number in order for me to have a direct phone line on my computer. I have already configured it to receive calls from anyone, and also have already disabled the "do not disturb" in windows 10, which could also be causing
 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I call my Skype number from my mobile number, it rings normally, but nothing shows on my screen. Latter Skype tells me that I have missed a call and I have a voice mail from the caller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, I have spent nearly five hours trying every possible setting and configuration. But it still not show incoming calls at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not work, please cancel my account and refund me the Skype Phone number I have paid for, and refund my calling subscription as well.</p>

    <title>Display monitor on my laptop is multicolored. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jstaff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display monitor on my laptop is multicolored.</h2>
                    For some reason my display monitor color scheme is off. It is showing everything in off colors like blues are violet and stuff like that. This all happened after I tried to update my display driver with the wrong driver software.<br />
<br />
I've been having problems with my display driver crashing when I play World of Warcraft. Periodically when I would play the screen would all of the sudden would go black for a couple of seconds and come back on. There would also be a message on my toolbar in
 my desktop that said that "Display drivers igfx has stopped responding and has resumed" or something around that. This would happen about 1 or 2 times every five minutes. I tried to fix it by manually updating the driver again from the manufacturer's website
 but I accidentally downloaded the wrong driver software.<br />
<br />
When I realized this I uninstalled the driver software and reinstalled the latest version and restarted the computer, but the color was still messed up. Then I deleted the driver software again and reinstalled a earlier version and restarted my computer. This
 seemed to actually work, but if I restarted it again, the color would go back to being messed up. This happens every time I redownload the earlier version of it.<br />
<br />
I have a: <br />
<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium 32 bit laptop.<br />
Mobile Intel 965 Express Chipset Family<br />

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Xbox! :) I can recommend looking for some folks to play with in the Groups section on your dashboard, or even considering joining a site like
<a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TrueAchievements</a>, where folks get together to help each other with achievements &amp; anything inbetween. I've made MANY friends there over the years. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hi Jay&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest looking through the public clubs on the games you enjoy. To try and make friends :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When on the xbox one, Press the xbox button on the controller, Go to the people tab &gt;&gt; club under the official has some clubs under the social side of things. Joining the clubs or the looking for groups can help you make friends :)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            Hi there is many ways to make friends on xbox easier than ever before including the clubs and other third parties sites as mentioned above. Id also recommend spending time on mixer or twitch as many streamers are gamers like yourself and want to meet fun
 entertaining gamers to be with. Also check out all the local cons and make new friends you be surprised how big the community is and how you meet.

<h2>            Spider Solitaire game issues on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Spider Solitaire woes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly my Solitaire is feeding me instantly solvable decks. Spoils the fun, becomes just mechanical. This is nothing I requested (how you request anything or adjust anything is a mystery), just an unwanted gift that has showed up. Anyone know how to get
 normal deals again? Or change levels of difficulty, if the algorithm has these? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Edge - No option to remember htaccess login details</h2>
                    <p>While Edge is a slick browser I am finding myself using Internet Explorer more and more due to annoying issues. While I have problems with the way favourites are displayed - too much white space and extra unneeded information, my biggest issue is the removal
 the option to "remember my credentials" when logging into web pages secured using htaccess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some pretty complex username/password combinations for such areas and while I do not mind typing them in once each day, having to do so every single time I visit a site is time consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get the check box back to "remember my credentials"?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. The option to save passwords is switched on already. Just double checked to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue only applies to passwords using the .htaccess system. The login dialog box always had an check box to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"remember my credentials" &nbsp;but this is not present using the Edge browser.</span></p>

            <p>Same issue here, it's a real shame as for anyone managing multiple logins of this nature, it really makes Edge unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By all means have the default as not to be able to save, I don't mind if the option to save passwords in this format is hidden away somewhere, but the option needs to be there (as it is on pretty much every other browser, including IE).</p>

Not sure if the forum moderator re-reads these posts, but as the OP said, and we have said since, it does not cover any logins via .htaccess and .htpsswrd - there are millions of sites that use this form of security, so hopefully Microsoft is listening and
 will reinstate this ability - have had to go back to Chrome until fixed.

            <p>I have spent 2 hours connecting to the Support Chat application. It was a total waste of time. Support staff unhelpful and just keep apologising and saying there are lots of Windows 10 issues and they will all be fixed soon. I don not think they even understand
 the issue to be honest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be good to be able to report the issue properly and know that it is either in a long list of things to be fixed or a "feature" we have to live with.</p>

            <p>Official support still refusing to even talk about this issue just saying we have lots of bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the moderators of this forum even bother? PranavMishra5582 posted something 17 days ago and asked for feedback. Despite this feedback nothing more from him or any other moderators. Not having a dig as such, but it would be nice to know how a bug is formally
 reported and how we check what the status of it is. Anyone?</p>

            <p>I hate to beat a dead horse, but I just migrated from Windows 8 to Windows 10 yesterday, and yes, I have the same problem.&nbsp; We run a community website, for a seniors community in Canada, and use .htaccess and .htpasswd to keep our site safe.&nbsp; And now, I
 have had to re-enter my username and password every time I go into this site.&nbsp; It's a real pain.&nbsp; I can see this confusing a lot of people who use this site.&nbsp; Internet Explorer used to work fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I just&nbsp;tried Internet Explorer with Windows 10, and it still works fine - but I assume it'll be removed in time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I also tried Firefox, and it still works fine.&nbsp; So at least we've got options.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But I would like to have Edge as an option, since a lot of people in our community use Internet Explorer, and will therefore probably migrate to Edge.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw, I have had this problem before, but with Ipads.&nbsp; They don't keep the password for sites with .htpasswd protected pages.&nbsp; They do keep the passwords for all other sites.&nbsp; My Ipad users have been at me to change our password system, to handle their Ipads,
 but I have not done it yet, because 90% of the users were still fine.&nbsp; This Edge problem might push it enough to make us change.&nbsp; Microsoft kind of implied that Edge would be compatible with Internet Explorer.&nbsp; It's NOT.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi Aidahdz,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Quick question, do you have any 3 party software running in the background of vista? Let's try clean booting the system to remove
 3rd party software and see if that clears up the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to place your computer in “clean boot”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>msconfig </strong>in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under Selective Startup, click to
<strong>clear the Load Startup Items check box</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to <strong>select the Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then
<strong>click Disable All</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong> OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Are you still getting the same error?<br />
<br />
If this <strong>does</strong> resolve the issue, then see the following Microsoft Article on “Clean boot” and the section “How to determine what is causing the problem” to determine which program or service maybe causing the issue.

<p><span><span>How to set your computer back,&nbsp;to boot normal:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Start Search</strong> box. Type <strong>msconfig</strong>, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;<br />
Click the General tab.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Normal Startup</strong> - <strong>load all device drivers and services</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>When you are prompted, click Restart to
<strong>restart the computer</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this will fix it for you. Please post back and let us know.</span></span></p>

            <p><b><span>Hi,</span></b></p>
<p><span>Are you able to use internet with wired connection?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>For DNS server follow the below steps and check for any errors listed in event viewer–</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start. Type cmd in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>ipconfig /flushdns (there is a space between ipconfig and / )</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>It will show the message successfully flushed the DNS resolver cache.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>ipconfig /registerdns (there is a space between ipconfig and / )</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ipconfig /all (there is a space between ipconfig and /)
</span></p>
<p><span>The ipconfig /all command display Windows TCP/IP settings for all your network adapters.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your IP address for your Local Area Connection is either 0.0.0.0 or 169.x.x.x (where x is any number), then your computer is not getting
 an IP address from the router.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>If that is the case, try this:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ipconfig /release in the command prompt and press ENTER</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ipconfig /renew in the command prompt and press ENTER</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Test it again by typing ipconfig /all to see what the address is?<span>&nbsp;
</span>(If you are on a home router, it should start with either 192.168.1.x or 192.168.0.x or 10.x.x.x)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists you may refer and use the steps provided below and as mentioned in the provided link -</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Start and then Control Panel.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to Networking and sharing center and then click on Change adapter settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on Local Area Connection and choose properties.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Highlight Internet Protocol Version 6 and click on Properties.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose Obtain DNS servers address automatically and press Ok.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose Obtain IP address automatically.</span></p>

<h3> marchetto  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS7 G45&#47;G43 intel graphic card working only on VGA and not sending HDMI&#47;DVI output AFTER DRIVER UPDATE</h2>
                    good morning, few details on the issue i'm facing with:<br />
<br />
Desk PC<br />
Mainboard is G43 twins from ASROCK<br />
<br />
Installed win7 and everything was working, my desk monitor hooked via DVI was working (still windows update was not been runned)<br />
<br />
I installed ASROCK driver and the issue was, that after bios booting and bootloader screen(displayed ok), BEFORE LOGON page the display goes in stand-by mode due to "no input".<br />
<br />
The same issue is by installing windows update suggested driver AND installing driver most update of the previous 2 from intel website. I think other people was facing issues with HDMI audio, but i don't care, because i'm using dvi only for video. Btw i noticed
 that with the INTEL most updated drivers a new device under sound card shows up named "hdmi audio"<br />
I also noticed that someone was facing with overscan issues (to fullhd 1080p?), and i thinked that maybe my monitor was going out of range, but i think that in that case, it should tell the proper message of out of range and not no input....And i also clicked
 th box in driver settings, keep ratio, don't know, please help. <br />
<br />
The only way is to use VGA (analog video) but i don't like to, also because everything is working good under winxp.<br />
Going to check in advanced device list, and showing up "hidden devices" i found that there are listed 2 video cards named the same.<br />
The description is slightly different, the first, working (i believe is VGA) is DEVICE 2 FUNCtION 0,&nbsp; and it has 2 lines of memory range and one line of memory I/O<br />
The second (hidden), is DEVICE 2 function 1 and has only one line memory range FDB000000-FDBFFFFFFFF
<br />
<br />
<br />
