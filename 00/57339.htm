<h2>            Windows 7 Build 7600 Windows Update Failures&#58; Error Code 80096004</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I try updating my Windows 7 Home Edition Build 7600 through Windows Update, I get most of my updates reported as failures, and then trying to update again results in the failed updates failing and failing again, as in they are always failing. This
 computer is only a couple weeks old, and I have never been able to update windows properly and I always get "Error(s) found: Code 80096004."</p>
<p>I'm running Alienware BIOS A09 if that is any help, and windows is genuine through the OEM. I have received previous non-genuine windows errors that were due to windows update failures, and yesterday I restored my computer back to factory default which removed
 all errors except the windows update errors. So, getting these updates properly will hopefully alleviate other problems I have.</p>
<p>I used to receive error codes like 80096003 and another one that was something similar (don't exactly remember the code) to 8001b010. Shutting off windows firewalls has removed these errors from happening in windows update, or so I believe.</p>
<p>Anyway, the real culprit right now I believe is the "Error(s) found: Code 80096004." How can I fix this error in my Windows Update so I can continue updating? Whenever Windows Update tries to download updates, the "downloading" process will always result
 in a constant 0% and won't ever move and will always fail. I have about 30 updates I need to download/update and catch up on. Most are critical/very important updates.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h3> mike bass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business Delegates</h2>
                    A few people inadvertently set me up as a delegate in SfB (shows up as a group called "People I Manage Calls For").They went back and removed the delegation, but their names still show up in my SfB client as under the "People I Manage Calls For" group.
 How can I remove them? We have verified that they removed me as a delegate from their client.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support and I am glad to follow up on this thread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, the common method to remove the group is the delegator (the user who sets up you as his delegate) right clicks the delegate (you) in the delegate group and then choose "Remove from Group". You can find the troubelshooting step of common issue 1
 in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/set-up-skype-for-business-online/set-up-and-troubleshoot-skype-for-business-online-delegation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/set-up-skype-for-business-online/set-up-and-troubleshoot-skype-for-business-online-delegation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the above article, it also states that the delegator also needs to add the delegate in the Outlook client. As a result, it is recommended that you contact the delegator to re-confirm whether he has removed you from his delegate list in the Outlook client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all the steps have been performed but the issue persists, please try configuring your Skype for Business account with another user's client to see if it makes a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<h2>            Sony vaio laptop freezes and stutters until reaching blue screen</h2>
                    The problem has been persisting for a few months now and happens usually during video playback. My vaio freezes and the sound stutters for a few seconds and then displays a blue screen which states a SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION. I noticed that other errors
 have hotfixes by Microsoft but I cannot find one for this error.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>I am on a new Dell laptop computer using Microsoft 10 enterprise version 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Mac is a MacBook pro and I am not sure which version but I started using skype years ago on Macs and haven't had any difficulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to use the skype portal (on the Dell computer) through the Web and think I had the same problem.</p>
<p>

            PS - I can't work out what Skype platform it is - but it is for Microsoft ....and appeared on this new Dell laptop computer (less than 6 months old from a University) so I am guessing a reasonably recent version.

<p>i removed the hard drive and re-loaded the game (call of duty black ops) it did not freeze until like 5 minutes later... i also tried call of duty 4/modern warfare 2/ the only game that works 90% well is battlefield bad company. I say 99% because it has
 some graphical issues (characters have like a huge rectangle-shaped figure in their body) i cleared my cache &amp; re-updated my cosole but it still freezes. also my xbox made a tiny circle scratch on the disc a few weeks before do you think that's the problem?
 i'm going to get a new copy of black ops just incase sometime later like a week. Any other tips that don't require sending my console for repairs? Thanks. :)</p>

                    I<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">'ve been trying for days to compile a project which uses Windows.h, but cannot because it fails to find it. I did provide additional include and lib directories for it, but noticed that all the SDKs

    <title>Black and White 2 crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craine2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black and White 2 crashing</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently bought Black and white two again after playing it a long time ago, i still have my old box and cd key but i was missing the Cds. I downloaded the game and download the two patches in the correct order (didn't download the fan patch because
 it seemed incompatible with my specs), i run the game from the Cd directly and run it as an admin in compatibility mode. I also run the command prompt with the 'sc config secdrv start= demand' command and the "sc start secdrv" command(i also ran command prompt
 as an admin). after doing all this i can play for around 5-10 minutes before it crashes randomly or when i attempt to save i haven't found any patterns in what i'm doing when i crash so i think its just a random thing, I've searched all over the internet and
 haven't found anything hope someone can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit OS</p>
<p>Intel Core i5-3570K CPU @ 3.40GHz </p>
<p>8 GB Ram</p>
<p>AMD Radeon HD 7800 series</p>
<p>Intel Hd graphics 4000</p>
<p>134 GB free of 931 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note- The computer i'm playing on now is a completely different one from my old computer back in 2006, i haven't had any black and white data on this computer before a few days ago, also i've wiped the installation and reinstalled multiple times with
 new saves. I'm using a original non "cracked" code for the game so i don't think that could be the problem that i've seen with a lot of other forum writers.</p>

            <p>- What sort of crash ? Black Screen or Back to Desktop ? BSOD ?</p>
<p>- Probably won't help, but has been known too... If you are using a driver released in the past year,
</p>
<p>try using one that came out before Win10 ( pre 'Crimson' ).</p>
<p>I reckon there would be little or no advantage in using a newer driver with this series card anyway.</p>
<p>- If the game runs without crashing on your HD4000 graphics this would help verify if the recent AMD drivers
</p>
<p>are behind the crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You can also eliminate corrupt saves as a source by backing them up and starting a new game and playing long enough to make a&nbsp; couple of saves.
</p>
<p>If the game has multiple saves, roll back two or three saves and see how that save goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- There could be a conflict with a Service or a Starup program. You can verify this by running in Clean Boot ...</p>

            <p>Hey thanks for the response the crash comes up with an error message sometimes something like "Black and white two has stopped working" with the loading bar and cancel option etc. I have completely uninstalled the game a couple times and started new saves,
 so i don't believe it is a problem with my save files but i keep multiple files just in case. Ive also kept my old drivers as far as i know from pre-windows 10, i read that post windows ten had all the issues with the new "security" features put in place.
 Ill run the HD4000 test and the clean up bot test now and respond with the results. And just as a side note i tried to mention everything i tested i obviously forgot to say i've rolled back on saves and reinstalled multiple times with complete wipes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>--So i have now tried the Clean Boot option, this time when i tried to quick save it crashed on me and gave me the same error message after less than five minutes, i kept all unnecessary programs off and did my typical boot up for the game but to no avail.
 Im assuming that when you said to try the HD4000 test that was it, but i'm not sure if you meant to do more, am i supposed to disabled my AMD graphics card manually or just the drivers. Thanks for the help so far by the way.</p>

            <p>If you can run off the HD4000 by simply moving the cable to the motherboard outputs (and maybe enabling</p>
<p>the HD4000 via Device Manager, and rebooting) you don't need to disable the AMD card.
</p>
<p>We only need to know if the game runs OK on the HD4000 graphics.</p>
<p>If not we can assume the source of the crash is not from the AMD card or drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Bad RAM or HDD faults can also cause random crashes such as this. Try running tests on both.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"i read that post windows ten had all the issues with the new "security" features put in place. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This would be the DRM Blocking, which is built into Win10, leaving no option other than to use a noCD fix/hack</p>
<p>to run games that used SafeDisk DRM and the secdrv.sys drive. Apparently some later versions of SafeDisk</p>
<p>don't use the secdrv.sys driver. This can be verified by Opening the disk and looking for a secdrv.sys file.</p>
<p>It this file is on the disk DRM Blocking will raise it's ugly head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- However, this same malware is being subversively installed to Win7.8.8.1 via Windows Security Update -
<em>KB3086255</em>.</p>
<p>At least wtih Win7/8/8.1 you have three options to circumvent DRM Blocking. </p>
<p>Use the commands to disable DRM Blocking, as you have done, or uninstall the 'Security Update'
</p>
<p>(and why not. Using the commands makes the 'update' ineffective anyway. That's assuming someone does one</p>
<p>day write a malware that they direct at secdrv.sys ). </p>
<p>Or us a noCD fix, which I reckon is the best option as it circumvents the whole mess, which makes secdrv.sys a non-issue, and gets around any bugs in the DRM as well.&nbsp;
<br />
(If you downloaded the files, I suppose you may already be using a cracked .exe ?&nbsp; If so the commands to disable</p>
<p>the DRM Blocking would be redundant).</p>

            <p>Right so as of right now I've always had both the AMD graphics card AND the HD4000 card going at the same time, not sure how but under device manager that's what its telling me. Should i disable one or the other and then test the game? I'm not to savvy so
 i just wanna run this by you before attempting it. Also the only way i can even start the game up is by disabling that new "secdrv.sys" mess so i have been doing that through a command prompt before starting the game up through the CD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And by the way at the start menu of the game it has a "diagnostics" tab under it everything passes except my system memory which the game says is 256.5 out of a needed 512.0 (not sure if that's true or its just not accessing all the required memory) and
 it also says FAIL under my OS which i am running in compatibility mode for this game in windows 98 and the game says it require Windows XP/2000 any suggestions? The diagnostics page also has 'Unknown Compatibility' for Display device (AMD), Display driver
 (8.17.10.1429), and sound driver which has nothing under my system.</p>
<p>Is the 8.17.10.1429 the new driver you were speaking about that i can disable somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- Update real quick, i ran the game in compatibility mode this time in Windows 2000 and its now passing the Diagnostics test for the OS although the memory now says its at "1.0" out of 512.0, I've also ran the memory diagnostic test and no problems were
 found. Oh and i did the HDD clean up which took about two hours and then ran the game for a couple minutes before it crashed when i tried to save.</p>

            <p>- Are you at a point where the game is only crashing when trying to save ? Does it only happen when</p>
<p>trying to quick save, or does it also happen when doing a manual or auto save ?</p>
<p>- Maybe there is a conflict between the downloaded files and using the disk ? </p>
<p>As you are already using 'unofficial' downloaded files, you may as well also use a noCD fix<br />
<a href="http://megagames.com/games/black-and-white-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">black-and-white-2 (use the first one in 'Fixes')
</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- The game was released in '05, so if you need a Compatibility setting at all, use
<em>XP sp2.</em></p>
<p>I would be inclined to not use any Compatibility setting if the game launches though.</p>
<p>- Your machines hardware is probably a bit to new to expect the diagnostics tool in the game to be accurate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Having the HD4000 and AMD card both enabled in Device Manager does no harm. <br />
You may need to set the amount of system RAM that is set aside for the HD4000 graphics in BIOS though.</p>
<p>If your motherboard defaults to 64MB, or other low amount, this could cause the type of message</p>
<p>you are seeing - if using the HD4000 at the time. If your motherboard BIOS has an option for 1GB this should</p>
<p>be adequate for any game the HD4000 is capable of running well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"Is the 8.17.10.1429 the new driver you were speaking about that i can disable somewhere?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned disabling your AMD HD7800 series card while running on the Intel HD4000, but if you don't need to</p>
<p>do this for the HD4000 graphics to run, you don't have to. Just shut down, swap the cable and reboot.</p>
<p>- I have no idea which AMD driver download version number that one corresponds with.</p>
<p>It's confusing the way <em>dxdiag</em> reports some insider type number, while we commoners only see the</p>
<p>version number used for the download ( your AMD control panel may also have the download version number somewhere).</p>
<p>- Anyway... The last driver for your HD7800 series card before they came out with the 'Crimson'</p>
<p>(optimised for Win10 ) was version 15.12 .&nbsp; You may already have a driver of similar vintage ( '14 or '15) which would
</p>
<p>work as well as this one anyway. </p>

            <p>So starting from the top i haven't downloaded any unofficial files, the site i got the patches from wasn't the official site for the game although the patches themselves were the official patches the game used to offer but no longer does. i believe the patch
 you are suggesting is the second patch that i have, i also have v 1.1 and then the 1.2 so either way whether you consider official or not i have both of those already applied to the game. I have yet to download the fan patch because it seems kind of sketchy
 to me and i don't want my game to become completely broken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stopped using compatibility mode and the game ran twice as long as it usually does until it crashed so that's at least getting somewhere. The crashes in the games are sometimes me doing a hard save or a quick and it just crashes while loading, or cosmetic
 glitches will begin to appear and i am unable to load previous saves and if i attempt to make a new save the game completely crashes and then the save is unusable. If i try and play with the cosmetic glitches, they appear between 10-20 min of playing now,
 the game will crash after about a min of having the glitch. The glitches include, textures inverting their colors, audio being broken on occasion or words becoming just black bars, a few other things happen but those are the main ones i notice until i try
 and quit and it crashes or try and save and it crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried accessing the BIOS and i guess i'm doing it wrong because it only showed my AMD card options after i pressed F11 in the first start up screen. The options shown didn't make much sense to me and i didn't see anything that had to do with the HD4000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came back to the Device Manager and went into display adapters for my AMD card and the driver version to my surprise was crimson (driver version&nbsp;15.300.1025.0, Driver date&nbsp;11/17/2015). So do i need to uninstall this driver completely or do i need to rollback
 or what? I'm a bit confused on how the whole driver situation works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your great help again, I feel like we are getting close to resolving this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update i decided to go ahead and do the fan patch since i talked to the creator of the patch and he explained and helped me out, this patch made the game usable from the shortcut and it also made it so i no longer have to use the command prompt to even open
 the game and i also don't need compatibility mode. So overall the fan patch is a help but not a complete fix.</p>

            <p><em>"So do i need to uninstall this driver completely "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. Graphic driver need to be fully uninstalled, and reinstalled clean. </p>
<p>Normally all you need to do is uninstall the current driver via Programs and Features -
<em>AMD Catalyst Install Manager.</em></p>
<p>You don't want to uninstall non-graphics related AMD drivers your machine may use, so use the first option
</p>
<p>(<em>Uninstall manager</em>) and select <em>Custom</em> in the next page.<br />
Next select the options as shown below (the other two are <em>not </em>graphics related) -</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/638e17a5-f27e-4c02-aa28-e1cea05c8787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/638e17a5-f27e-4c02-aa28-e1cea05c8787" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Take it from there, following the prompts. </p>
<p>- Always reboot before installing the new drivers, and again after... For good luck. &nbsp; ;)</p>
<p>When installing the new driver install only what you use. This may be only the Display Driver and CCC if</p>
<p>you don't do any video camera stuff. I leave it to you to do a search for exactly what the other features do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when there is a problem with a driver it can be beneficial to use DDU (
<em>Display Driver Uninstaller</em> ) as</p>
<p>this will remove a few files and registry entries that get left behind during the normal uninstall procedure.</p>
<p>Reboot before installing the 'new' driver.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You can find more details, and help on the AMD forums, if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Do the same for the motherboard. </p>
<p>Go to the mfg's web site. If you don't have a user manual to reference regarding the Intel graphics you
</p>
<p>should be able to download one, or post for guidance on their forums.</p>
<p>But if you have not yet moved the cable to the Intel HD outputs do so, and see what happens. We just need</p>
<p>for you to have a quick play to verify if the game still crashes (If the game lags just lower some in game settings).</p>
<p>You may not need to do anything in BIOS (I tap Delete during bootup to enter BIOS).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"this patch made the game usable from the shortcut and it also made it so i no longer have to use

<p><em>the command prompt"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- This 'patch' would be a noCD fix/hack, or it's a patch that fixed some issues and included a noCD fix/hack.</p>
<p>Gotta love noCD's...</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"cosmetic glitches will begin to appear"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Another reason for getting your HD4000 going. 'Glitches' or Artifacts are often an indication of a problem</p>
<p>with the graphics card. It could be the VRAM or gpu is going. It could also be overheating, but don't worry</p>
<p>too much as crashing while saving would more commonly be an issue with the game itself eg- corrupt install</p>
<p>(back to the downloaded files and unconventional install method ).</p>
<p>- Run a temperature monitor to verify neither the gpu or cpu are overheating.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Once all the above is sorted, and assuming your somewhat unconventional way of installing the game is not the</p>
<p>root of the problem, if you still have problems, posting an <em>Event Viewer</em> report may reveal something that is conflicting with the game at the time of the crashes.</p>

            <p>Alright so i uninstalled the previous drivers that had anything to do with graphics/video on my computer and installed the drivers that you suggested on the ninth&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Anyway... The last driver for your HD7800 series card before they came out with the 'Crimson'</span></p>
<p>(optimized for Win10 ) was version 15.12 .&nbsp; You may already have a driver of similar vintage ( '14 or '15) which would</p>
<p>work as well as this one anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/previous/detail?os=Windows%207%20-%2064&amp;rev=15.12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/previous/detail?os=Windows%207%20-%2064&amp;rev=15.12</a>&nbsp;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i installed this driver and it said it was under the crimson edition although the version contradicted that so im not sure if its before crimson or not? Anyway i uninstalled, restarted, installed, restarted and then launched the game and it did the no
 save no load thing after i deleted a corrupted save. I figured i oughta give it another go so i relaunched the game reloaded and when i tried to quick save it crashed again, im thinking of wiping my saves although that would really suck to have to do everything
 again but do you think i possibly have some broken file or something? Maybe i should uninstall the patches and the game and reinstall everything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried clicking 'delete' in the stat up and really loud beep came from my tower and then the same menu as before when i pressed F11 came up and i still didn't see any RAM options so any suggestions about that or should i just forget the BIOS. The temperatures
 of my computer are the normal at 46 and 32 degrees Celsius so i think that is perfect or at least not unhealthy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Once all the above is sorted, and assuming your somewhat unconventional way of installing the game is not the</p>
<p>root of the problem, if you still have problems, posting an&nbsp;<em>Event Viewer</em>&nbsp;report may reveal something that is conflicting with the game at the time of the crashes."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not sure what in unconventional besides the three patches. I downloaded the game from the discs with an original cd key, the game barely functioned without the 'patches' so im not sure if thats it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might sound like a really dumb question but when you say to swap the cables do you simply mean to plug my monitor directly to the HD4000 or do you mean internally swap the cables in the tower, gonna try the simple option just because i don't see the
 danger but it dawned to me that this might be more complicated than that. I switched my monitor cable and the game ran well besides the graphics being slightly worse but after about 15 minutes the game just froze and the audio repeated and i had to task manager
 shut it down which when i did, the typical error message came up. I didn't look into the driver (yet) because I've never used the HD4000 graphics for my computer so unless its on an auto update kinda deal i haven't touched it. You said something about checking
 the motherboard &nbsp;"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Do the same for the motherboard.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Go to the mfg's web site." Am i supposed to do the same thing for the HD4000 as i did for the
 AMD? I gave the game another go with the HD4000 and the same jazz played it went for about 15 minutes and completely froze this time i couldnt cntrl atl del so i had to do a force restart&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">unfortunately so for now im back
 to the AMD hooked into the monitor as before.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thank you for the help you've been awesome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was attempting to play a few minutes ago and the 'glitch' where the terrain colors become inverted occurred. I alt tabbed to try and take a screenshot to show the forum or something and when i came back the game was back to normal! Although a few minutes
 later it did the random crash that didn't really have any warning and just brought the error message up.<br />

<h2>            Brighter Blacks &#47; Blacks too dark</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm having a Problem with my Microsoft Surface Pro 2018 since the beginning. I love watching TV Series, but I often switch to my very old Dell Laptop because of the Blacks of the Surface. In dark Scenes it's hard to see anything. But as a retoucher I don't
 have that much Problems with dark parts in Images. So it's only on movies and tv series.<br />
I saw mentioning the Problem on reddit, but I am not sure what to do: https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/7a2716/surface_pro_new_screen_too_dark_for_movies/<br />
<br />
Is there any way to see the black parts brighter, with Details?</p>

</p><p>Thanks for bringing this up to Surface Community. We deeply apologize for the late response since we are also reviewing it. To fully isolate your concern I do have few questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using an application in playing a movie or a TV series, or is it played on a specific browser? If yes, what is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your other PC, when you play the movie or TV series is it the same setup on your Surface Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to adjust the resolution or the brightness in your Surface Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your other PC, if its running windows 10 try to compare the&nbsp; Surface Pro if they having the same
<strong>OS version</strong> and <strong>OS build</strong>.</p>
<p>(You can check it by clicking <strong>Windows Icon </strong>on your taskbar&gt; Type there "<strong>Winver</strong>".)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us posted..</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Edd, thank you for helping me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes I play them on browsers, but that doesn't seem to be the problem, Microsoft Edge, Chrome.. it's all the same dark</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes I watch them on the other pc also via browser</p>
<p>
</p><p>the brightness on my Surface is at 100% (but I don't know if there is more to set than the brightness adjustment I can chose on the tastatur)<br />
changing resolution? how will this affect the brightness?</p>
<p>
</p><p>the other Laptop has Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>so there is something up with the brightness on Videos via browser, like it is mentioned on reddit? do you konw what they mean how to set it, because they seem to have a solution but I don't know what to do exactly.</p>
<p>It's really odd, because YouTube for example is not a problem, doing work in photoshop neither, I know there are details in the videos but they aren't on the Surface. It's like the discussion about the episode of game of thrones where everyone said they
 couldn't see anything. I'm happy to have watched it not on the Surface, but I knew what they meant, it's really annoying.</p>

<p>You can adjust the 'gamma': the ratio of output contrast to input contrast.</p>
<p>There is a 'Calibrate Display Color' option in Control Panel (Cortana will find it).</p>
<p>Push the 'Gamma' slider up a bit. Ignore the 'hide the dots' instruction - make it do what you want!</p>
<p>You can also ignore the 'Brightness', 'Contrast' and 'White Balance' - just accept defaults by clicking 'Next'.</p>

            If you are watching video files, rather than video on demand (Netflix, youtube, hulu etc) you can get a more granular control of gamma, contrast, color etc using Klite mega code pack and using the controls inside the Media player classic (MPC) application.
 It is by far the most configurable video file player out there, and it's freeware !&nbsp;

    <title>Why Do XBOX LIVE allow Cheating to go on with in the XBOX LIVE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> le monarchy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Do XBOX LIVE allow Cheating to go on with in the XBOX LIVE UNIVERSE &#40;patented&#41; and &#47;or Support Vendors that do</h2>
                    
<p>(MOD REMOVED TAGS)&nbsp;are CIVILIZATION REVOLUTION CHEATS ...just tried to play the game ever since 3:00am...and I have watched 3 regular warriors take out my whole GERMAN ELITE WARRIOR ARMY like they was nothing. One even took out 2 armies so I id all the reporting
 all *#!@ morning. I bought an XBOX TO HAVE A FUN EXPERINCE AND ALL I GET IS CHEAT IN ALMOST EVERY GAME EXCEPT INDIE GAMES THIS HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF UNFAIR BUSINESS LAW THAT YOU ARE BREAKING BY NOT DOING ANY REAL AND SERIOUS ABOUT THE ISSUE. TO HAVE SOMETHING
 SO FUNDUMENTALLY DISHONEST AS CHEATING IN A VIDEO GAME LINK AND/OR ASSOCIATED TO THE BILL AND LINDA GATES FOUNDATION IS SHAMEFUL.</p>
<p>The Straw that broke the camels back was when I was playing with&nbsp;(MOD REMOVED)&nbsp;and I was dominating the game..&nbsp;(MOD REMOVED)&nbsp;was taking my cities without even a fight from my guy or a message all I get is a quick flash of the event and a color change on
 the city. mean while the game stared playing the battles in hyper speed and/or sluggish slow either way I had armies after armies get wiped out. I could go n and on about that game I just played... Sid Meier is a genius for this one AND I KNOW HE NEVER WANTED
 PEOPLE TO CHEAT... THEY ARE HANDICAPPING RANKED MATCHES SOME HOW.</p>
<p>HONEST GAMMERS AREN'T YOU SICK AND TIRED OF CRAZY SCORES OR NUMBERS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN TOP SPOTS ON THE LEADERBOARDS? YOU KNOW YOU ARE A GREAT GAMER BUT YOU CAN NEVER PROVE IT BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER BE #1 BUT YOU HAVE SOME CON ARTIST LIKE MAJOR NELSON
 SELLING YOU A PIPE DREAM EVERYTIME A NEW GAME COMES OUT. YOU WASTE ENDLESS HOURS TRYING TO PLAY A GAME THAT EVERYONE EXCEPT YOU KNOW IT IS RIGGED.</p>
<p>THEY ALLOW CHEATING TO FRUSTRATE YOU SO YOU CAN THEN SPEND MONEY TO WIN. THAT IS A PRETTY LOW CLASS WAY TO DO BUSINESS. INSTEAD OF SELLING A GREAT PRODUCT (and the XBOX is a great product hands down) to make money. No, now they just want to use your WILL,
 DRIVE and DETERMINATION to win just to turn a buck. This is why you now have games like HAPPY WARS and SPARTACUS which they offer free play but IN THE WORLD OF VIDEO GAMMING THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A FRUSTRATED SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE and they will SPEND
 TO WIN all while playing a free game.</p>
<p>WAKE UP!!!!!! HONEST GAMERS LET YOUR FRUSTRATION BE HEARD, NOT BY SPENDING MONEY BUT BY NOT SPENDING MONEY. BOYCOTT XBOX LIVE UNTIL THEY DO SOMETHING REAL ABOUT THE CHEATING AND HACKING OF GAMES. WITH THIS BOYCOTT I PROPOSE THIS:</p>
<p>ALL HONEST GAMERS THAT AGREE WITH ME JOIN ME IN THIS EFFORT TO MAKE CHEATING A SHAMEFUL AND PUNISHABLE ACT LIKE IT USE TO BE. TAKE THIS VOW WITH ME. THAT UNTIL XBOX LIVE DOES SOMETHING ABOUT THE CHEATING BESIDES HAVING SOME LAME *** REPORTING SYSTEM THAT
 DOESN'T WORK FAST ENOUGH TO FIND AND BAN THE CHEATER, WE WILL NOT SPEND A SINGLE SOLITARY DOLLAR ON ANOTHER XBOX GAME.</p>
<p>NOW YOU CAN STILL PLAY YOUR FAVORITE GAME BUT DO NOT SPEND ANY MORE MONEY UNLESS YOU ARE BUYING THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF YOUR FAVORITE GAME OR YOU CAN DO LIKE ME AND&nbsp;JUST STOP SPENDING MONEY ON THEIR HACKED UP LEADERBOARDS AND GLITCHED UP GAMES.</p>
<p>LIKE BATTLEFIELD 4.. BATTLEFIELD IS MY MOST FAVORITE GAME EVER..SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER ME IN BATTLEFIELD 1943 I was unstoppable and most feared. when I start playing every hacker in the game tries to disrupt me but I am a genius that kills people in shooter
 games but BATTLEFIELD 3 TURNED OUT TO BE ANOTHER HACKED LOBBY GAME LIKE COD AND MMW SO I SAID F-IT AND I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT NOR WILL I GET BATTLEFIELD 4. I AM WILLING TO MAKE THAT SACRAFICE IN ORDER TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE FORCES OF EVIL. HONEST GAMERS OF
 JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS UNITE WITH ME IN AND EFFORT TO TAKE BACK WHAT RIGHTFULLY BELONGS TO US... GAMING.... REMEMBER CHEATERS NEVER WIN UNLESS SOMEBODY STANDS TO MAKE MILLIONS THEN CHEATERS WIN AND WINNERS AND LOSERS LOSE.</p>
<p>I KNOW I WILL GET A FEW NEGATIVE RESPONSE FROM ALL THAT I HAVE WRITTEN AND I WELCOME IT BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE ISSUES WITH WHAT I HAVE SAID ARE CHEATS, HACKS, AND THE POWERS THAT ALLOW THEM TO OPERATE.. SO *** EM''. I WRITE THIS FOR ALL HONEST
 GAMERS THAT DON'T CHEAT.. DON'T WORRY I AM BULIDING A TEAM THAT WILL HELP US MAKE A MORE LOUDER SPLASH WITH OUR MESSAGE USING SOCIAL AND MAINSTREAM MEDIA. IT WILL BE EPIC</p>
<p>SO I HOPE YOU JOIN ME IN TAKING UP THIS GOOD FIGHT. BUT EVEN DURING THESE DARK TIMES I STILL SAY</p>
<p>MAY GOD BLESS XBOX, XBOX LIVE AND THE PEOPLE THE PLAY IT</p>

<p>Sorry you are not allowed to name and shame on the forums as this is a violation of the terms of use, if you have problems with other gamers you need to file an complaint via the option on their profiles on xbox live. It is also upto the game developers
 to make it so people cant hack or mod their games, Microsoft cant do nothing about it if it is not their game.</p>

<p>Well maybe a little name shame is needed because it is clear that the reporting system is useless based on your statement that "Microsoft cant do anything" so then why have a reporting system if you can do nothing. and so far as a violation of the term of
 use. Acts of civil disobedience are within my rights as a United State citizen not to mention I served my country so I can get cheated on a system that I bought all due to what Xbox turning a blind eye to what every one knows is going on everyday non stop
 and XBOX LIVE is the facilitator of these action, action I might add which could be argued as a type of fraud against the consumer and Xbox Live would be an accessory to that fraud due to negligence or wanting negligence, in any case Xbox Live could be found
 culpable</p>
<p>EVEN if we go with the XBOX LIVE LEGAL DEPARTMENT TALKING POINTS that you gave Xbox is one of the mediums in which this fraud against consumers is committed. The game developer only creates a product, IT is XBOX 360 name that appears at the top of every
 game case and game disk or now its XBOX ONE. You promote the games and advertise fun and excitement all while the young and old are getting treated unfairly as an XBOX LIVE CONSUMER. Getting treated unfairly on an Xbox console playing a game with the XBOX
 LIVE name and logo (even if it is an EA game Xbox name appears above it like top billing).</p>
<p>If it is the developer that make it so people can hack or mod their game WHY DOES XBOX HAVE TO TAKE PART IN THAT IN ANY SORT OF WAY? just to make a buck. It is not XBOX LIVE that need the developers to make money, its the developers that need Xbox Live to
 pull off their money making con in order to make MILLIONS dollars off of Honest Xbox Live consumer. It is a type of consumer fraud.</p>
<p>Its like saying a store owner has no responsibility if he or she knowingly allows criminal activity to happen in front of their doors everyday and all while turning a profit from the activities conducted by elements in front of their store. and in Xbox Live
 case they are selling the product from their store and sending it across their own media stream.</p>
<p>So with all do respect PA you have to do better than that. but more than likely you won't because the statement you gave is all that the Legal Department came up with but we can both be certain about this sooner or later the new CPA (CONSUMER PROTECT AGENCY)
 well take this issue up. it would be wise for Xbox to get in front of it</p>
<p>XBOX LIVE/MICROSOFT MAKES A HEAP OF CASH OFF OF JUST ONE GAME THAT IS KNOWINGLY CHEATING A PART OF ITS CONSUMER BASE. FOR ALL THE WASTE HOURS TRYING TO GET ON A LEADERBOARD THAT IS FACILITATED BY XBOX LIVE. FOR ALL THE MONEY SPENT TRYING TO LEVEL UP SO YOU
 CAN WIN ONLY TO FACE A GOD MODE MOD CHEATER AND THE PROFITS ARE PARSED AMONG THE GAME DEVELOPER AND XBOX LIVE... HONEST GAMERS IF YOU ARE SICK OF THE HACKING BS THEN TAKE UP MY BOYCOTT OF XBOX LIVE IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THEM UNDER STAND CHEATERS NEVER WIN
 AND PEOPLE SHOULD NOT PROFIT FROM SUCH DISHONESTY.. UNLESS XBOX LIVE IS WILLING TO ADMITT IT IS A COMPANY THAT IS PROFITTING FROM THE DISHONESTY OF OTHERS.</p>
<p>God, I wish we was in court right now</p>
<p>Anyway I do appreciate you taking the time to respond to me my concerns. and I won't name shame anyone else</p>
<p>but I will make another thread of my statement minus the game names of the guys who cheated me but I guess Xbox doesn't deem their actions a violation of the term of use</p>

<p>I suggest you read the suspension forums here <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../41.aspx</a> </p>
<p>Pretty much every person posting there about a ban or suspension were caught as a result of a complaint fied against them via a console by a xbox live member so xbox live enforcement does work.</p>
<p>Once you file a complaint via your console it will get investigated &amp; the appropiate action will be taken,just remember the enforcement team get 1000's of complaints per day &amp; they all have to be investigated so it can take time.</p>

<p>Now that's how you answer a question/complaint. I totally disagree but I can understand the enforcement team is getting swamped with complaints. Xbox should and can do more to. Like LIFETIME BANS for cheating. It is up to XBOX to ensure that the integrity
 of the game play is secure. They can pressure game developers to create &nbsp;games that the XBOX LIVE consumer can play with being cheated.</p>
<p>XBOX LIVE CAN START GETTING VOLUNTEERS TO JOIN THE ENFORCEMENT TEAM and XBOX CAN START BY SIGNING ME UP AS ITS FIRST VOLUNTEER ENFORCER. I AM A 24/7 ALL DAY EVERYDAY XBOX LIVE GAMMER. I HAVE ZERO CABLE AND NO SATILITE DISH. MY FAMILY FULL ENTERTAIMENT IS
 RAN OFF THE XBOX LIVE. I PERSONALLY PUT IN 14 HOURS OR MORE ON MY XBOX and you can see that I have a large distaste for cheating. SO think about it Xbox could increase its amount of enforcers with volunteers and give it honest law biding costumers their XBOX
 back</p>
<p>Well Daft Badger you gave a great answer in defending XBOX LIVE but may I ask:</p>
<p>How long does it take to investigate complaints? and what is XBOX LIVE doing in order to limit the amount of complaints?</p>
<p>What is the proper amount of time that an enforcer has to investigate complaints? Is XBOX proactively trying to improve the reporting system? If so, in what ways if you are able to tell me.</p>
<p>Well thanks again for taking the time out to respond to me. I am still arranging the BOYCOTT OF XBOXLIVE. SO HONEST GAMMERS HELP ME SHOW ARE BELOVED XBOX THAT THEY DO NOT NEED DISHONEST GAME DEVELOPERS OR THE HACK GAMES THEY PRODUCE TO MAKE HUGE AMOUNT OF
 PROFIT. LET SHOW XBOX THAT THE QAULITY OF THE GAME PLAY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE QAULITY OF THE GAME. LETS MAKE XBOX SAY "NO" TO AI CHEATING AND TO CHEATERS WORLD WIDE.</p>
<p>I WILL NEVER STOP BEING AN XBOX CONSUMER BUT I BELIEVE WITH THE HELP OF OTHER HONEST GAMMERS WHEN CAN SUSPEND OUR SPENDING OF DOLLARS ON HACKED GAMES AND MOD LOBBIES AND FORCE XBOX TO TAKE SERIOUS ACTION AGAINST THIS FRAUD BEING COMMITTED ON ITS CONSUMER.</p>
<p>THERE IS MORE TO COME. THIS POSTING IS NOT THE ONLY ACTION BEING TAKEN TO END THIS FARSE THAT IS HAPPENING WITHIN THE GAMMING WORLD</p>

<p>to be honest I don't think anyone will join your boycott of Xbox live, as it is not just Microsoft and Xbox Live fault that people can hack, mod or cheat in games. Personally I don't play game like world at war just for this reason, but I don't blame Xbox
 Live or Microsoft. I personally blame the game developers for not caring about their old and new games or allowing their games to easy for people to cheat, hack or mod on. Also how is hacking, modding or cheating in a game fraud?</p>

<p>I'm not defending anyone or anything,just giving you the facts.I don't work for microsoft or the enforcement team,i'm just a gamer who gives up a bit of free time every day to try &amp; help out other gamers,so i can't say how long an investigation takes or
 what steps are taken to speed up the process.</p>
<p>As Alice said,it's more down to the developers to ensure people cant hack games,these games get modded on the PS3 as well.</p>
<p>If you want to boycott xbox live then feel free but if your being serious you will need to boycott just about every game developer as well.</p>

<p>G'day BAAL SHEM TOV. &nbsp;So sorry to hear about your frustrating experience and thank you for expressing your concerns. It's never fun to come across cheaters in game, and we always recommend you report them as ProjectAlice recommends. Enforcement investigates
 each complaint and always takes action when appropriate. You can read up on the different types of suspensions and their length/severity

<br />
Unfortunately, I'm unable to provide further assistance here as you've mentioned legal action multiple times. If you're serious in that desire, please refer to

<h2>            Headset no longer working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have a Turtle Beach Recon 50 headset which was working fine for months. It suddenly stopped working, so my son can no longer hear or speak to his friends when playing a game. We thought it was the headset, so replaced it with a brand new one, but it still
 doesn’t work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have tested it with other devices and it is fine, so it must be the Xbox. We have rebooted it, checked the privacy settings etc to no avail. We are subscribed to Xbox Live. It doesnt work on either controller.</p>
<p>Can anybody help please?!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            It could be the controller itself. How old is the controller ? You may need to replace it. The headset jacks can wear out over time&nbsp;

            Hi, there are other threads about this isse and the fix that has been suggested is to buy a headset adapter. As choppyseize states, the jack socket can get worn out or damaged and using a headset adapter is a cheaper option than a new controller.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Xbox-One-Headsets-Headphones/Official-Xbox-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/B00I41H7US/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1550069677&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=adapter+for+xbox+one+headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Xbox-One-Headsets-Headphones/Official-Xbox-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/B00I41H7US/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1550069677&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=adapter+for+xbox+one+headset</a>

 for the inconvenience but we are currently looking into this situation. Unfortunately it appears that Microsoft has introduced an incompatibility between controllers and consoles that is impacting the 3.5mm headset jack. It is unknown how long it will take

 Another workaround to the issue is the Microsoft Chatpad. While this may be a bit more expensive than the headset adapter, it has some added benefits:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            I have also found myself in the same boat. Such a shame that Xbox1 has yet to update this malfunction being that we have been advocate user of Xbox for years. I sure do hope that they realize that the last update they did about a month ago caused this
 issue and that they fix it sooner than later! Making the consumers dish out even more money having to buy extra pieces so that our headsets work for our kids is unbelievable and quite disappointing to say the least! I am really thinking about switching over
 to Playstation after this.

<p>The reality is there's only so much one can physically do in order to prevent a wear &amp; tear issue - unless of course we want to go down the route of "lets over-engineer the daylights out of it" which would arguably make things prohibitively expensive!&nbsp; In
 all honesty I've had my Xbox One for 4 years now, I had the Xbox 360 before that &amp; Xbox before that and in the 17+ years never once had an issue with the headset port, but I'm also only using it 2-3 times a month at best.&nbsp; That's the sort of use it's engineered
 to be dealing with, not Fortnite popularity levels which have been seen of late!</p>

<h2>            Computer no longer connects to phone via USB</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 computer suddenly stopped connecting to my Android phone via USB. The phone will charge from the computer, but not connect. The phone can still connect to another Windows 10 via the same cord, so it's not the phone or the cord. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks. I ran that and got 'USB Controller is in a failed state or not installed.' I tried uninstalling all the USB controllers in Device Manager, including a bunch of hidden ones, and then restarted. The 3 USB controllers are showing up in Device Manager
 again, but no hidden ones, so presumably they reinstalled with the reboot, but I'm still getting 'USB Controller is in a failed state or not installed.' PC Manager is showing everything up to date and working. Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1, Windows update, bad pool header error and memory management error</h2>
                    A few weeks ago I tried to upgrade to the free Windows 8.1. I got a message to say it failed to install. My husband complained that he was having problems using the internet and thought the computer might need clearing and defraging. I did the system clear
 up. I also remembered my printer had broken so uninstalled all the drivers etc for the printer. I also uninstalled some other programs that I don't use anymore. I then ran windows update which said there were 22 important updates. I then for a message to say
 that updates had failed to install. I tried again and for the same message. During the restarts I got 2 different messages first was memory management error then bad pool header. I've googled both error messages and have checked Windows start-up settings and
 have done a clean boot both have not resolved the issue. I have also tried a Windows memory diagnostic tool. Once this had completed and I signed back in it did not show any errors and I'm not sure where they would be if I need to look for them. Any help would
 be appreciated.

<h2>            Refund for unusable game</h2>
                    I purchased a game that was downloaded to my Windows 10 machine.&nbsp; After installing, I realized it required a subscription to Xbox live, which I don't have, so I can't use the game.&nbsp; I would like a refund.

    <title>BSOD - WHEA Unrecoverable Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSOD - WHEA Unrecoverable Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked into this and noticed that it could be one of many things but so far I am at a loss as to what it may be.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occassionaly I get BSOD with the WHEA Unrecoverable error message. This is sometimes followed by the boot device not being found and I have to resort to a complete power off and then power on to get it to find the drive again, resetting the pc is not enough.
 Whilst this leads me to think it could be either the motherboard or the ssd I know that things are not always so simple. I have tried swapping the various bits of hardware... memory, cpu, gpu, ssd with another system and so far not been able to confirm what
 the problem is. I have followed the procedure to pull the minidump, sys info and sys configuration an I am hoping if somebody might be able to help me?</p>

</p><p>Many thank yous in advance.</p>
