<h2>            How to stop Office installation in the background</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to download the free office software using my work account and it has been installing in the background for days without much movement. How do I stop the installation? I tried following the FAQ but I can't find the file name listed in the task manager,
 if someone could help, would be much appreciated.</p>

            You have not said which version of Office you are referring to. Try rebooting your computer or turn off your internet connection.&nbsp; You can also then run the Microsoft Uninstall tool.&nbsp; Use

                    <div>
<p>Twas the night before shipping, on every device<br />
Not a byte was astirring, no keyboards or mice.<br />
The Ethernet cables were strung with great care,<br />
In hopes that Nadella soon would be there.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The laptops were nestled all snug in their cases,<br />
While flightings of new code were off to the races.<br />
Backups were whirring, and lights were a flashing,<br />
Desktops were waiting in hopes of not crashing.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Now Firefox, now Google, on Opera and Maxthon!<br />
On SeaMonkey, on Edge, on Explorer and Avant!<br />
To the front of the queue, to the top of the list!<br />
I want to be first, that's all I could wish.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Browsers are silent, the dots are still running<br />
In Windows Updater the stillness is stunning.<br />
Am I on the wrong wave? Am I on the wrong node?<br />
This quiet is awful, it doesn't well bode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Smartwatch creeps forward toward Midnight and one,</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>and my Fitbit's recording my dryness of tongue.<br />
It's here!&nbsp; It's beginning! Oh what a great sight!<br />
Happy downloading to all and to all a good night!</p>

<h3> sherryroth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Band</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Microsoft band&nbsp;a while ago.&nbsp; After a short time the battery would not recharge.&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft and eventually received a replacement band.&nbsp; The same thing happened.&nbsp; I dutifully contacted Microsoft again and they asked me to return
 the second Microsoft band, which I did using the courier slip they sent.&nbsp; That is when the problems really started.&nbsp; After not hearing back for some time,&nbsp;I contacted Microsoft again on line- it was much harder this time and took a few calls and a big chunk
 of time.&nbsp; I was told that they hadn't received the Microsoft band back and essentially suggested I hadn't returned it.&nbsp; Thankfully I had kept pretty detailed records and could prove I had returned it.&nbsp; After several more weeks, I contacted them again and they
 said they were processing a refund.&nbsp; I received and email, filled in the payment info and waited.&nbsp; That was April.&nbsp; It is now September and I have not received any payment.&nbsp; When I contacted Microsoft, they said payment had been made.&nbsp; I have double checked
 my account - no such payment.&nbsp; I have now asked them twice for the date the payment was made and some reference number so I can see if my bank can track the payment.&nbsp; To date, I have not received the payment.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced similar?&nbsp; Is this just Microsoft's way of reducing costs for a defective product - wait long enough and throw as many road block in the way and eventually people will give up trying to get their money back?&nbsp;
</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing an issue with some of the Exchange 2010 mailboxes move request to O365.</p>
<p>Some of them are running since 6 days and doesn't want to complete.</p>
<p>It is impacting large mailboxes 20-30GB as the small mailboxes 3-4 GB.</p>
<p>I have already synced about 150 mailboxes but the other 50 seams to be stuck.</p>
<p>I noticed that the amout of BytesTransferred is constanlty increasing and have exceeded the size of the mailboxes.</p>

<p>Hi Kyle,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is Brook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the migration, it’s reasonable that the transferred data is 30-40% percent larger. The mailbox size calculation mentioned in the shared article is just one factor. Double, triple (or even more times) transferred data could also happen. This is caused
 by many reasons. For example, some corrupted message will cause the email transfer start over again, in which conditions, transferred data could increase multiple times.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have checked your reports. There’s no error message. Given the situation that these affected mailboxes are so large, it’s expected that it takes much more time to migration them to Exchange Online. We suggest you be patient and keep waiting for the completing
 of the migration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<h3> sid234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spam&#47;Junk Filter Stopped Working on Hotmail.com Account</h2>
                    <p>My hotmail account is getting flooded with spam and phishing scam emails for the past few months. It's like the MS Spam filters just decided to stop working one fine day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reporting the emails as junk or Phishing scams doesn't seem to make a difference, as the same spam emails still end up in my inbox the next day, and the day after that. Right now, I have to take time out, log in my hotmail account on the internet and report
 the emails as spam every time one comes in as the Outlook android app doesn't give me the option to report as Junk or as phishing scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-osend/spamjunk-filter-stopped-working-on-hotmailcom/c396e9ad-4701-4b44-8b84-3ca28ae91fe0?rtAction=1485233228686">
thread</a> that i found on this that was marked as answered before the actual issue was seriously even looked at by anyone. There are still users reporting the same issue occuring</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been several users who have reported the same issue and also an in-depth explanation as to why it's happening and how it's not an issue on the user's end but rather a failure of hotmail's spam filters. I know no one uses hotmail anymore but that
 doesn't mean you ignore users who created a hotmail account years ago and have been using it as their primary account for so long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried reporting this issue several times but have had no response, and none of the "look here for suggestions to filter spam" links have been of any use of help. If this isn't the appropriate place to Beg for MS to do something about this issue, please
 direct me to someother place I can try cause my hotmail account is currently unusable.</p>

</p><p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is over 30 years I use computers (mostly Mac) and receive spams. We must admit that it is impossible to filter them at 100%, but we can call
 it “reasonable” to be spammed when it occurs just few times per week.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About 2 years ago, I purchased a PC with Windows 8.1 and this is what I noticed:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As soon that I registered with Microsoft, I suddenly had (few hours after) 10 time more spams on my private mail address (own domain name). I noticed
 a similar phenomenon once I registered office 365.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This fact tells me that either between my (new) computer and Microsoft, a machine is somehow intercepting mails address while registering
 or someone has been able to hack Microsoft registrations list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This lasted a while but cool down after a while, my provider having a good filter. I still get more spam than before but I can live with
 it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, very strange thing:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once we register with Microsoft, we have automatically access to internet Outlook, using the same mail address registered to login.&nbsp;</span><span>I
 never used this mail box and surprisingly, I received absolutely no spam in it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But on my “anonymous” mailbox (used to register on sites that may have security issues), which is also with Outlook, I receive so many
 spams that it is discouraging to use it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Conclusion: there are 2 problems, the Microsoft one with registration, the second one with the Outlook spam filter</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What can be considered “normal” is to be spammed when giving a mail address to unverified sites, but what is not is to get spammed when
 registering products with Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest Microsoft to invest a little more thinking about this issue, because people remember how they have been treated by those
 supposed to take care of them (I pay for few Microsoft apps)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope what I just said can help somebody</span></p>

            Just wondering if there are any updates to issue or should I just close my hotmail account. My phone is burning up all day from no joking 100s of spam emails received. I can't keep up with reporting them while picking out the 1-2 emails that are important.
 This is completely out of hand...

            My email is still getting spammed on a regular basis. 10-20 emails/day on average. Looks like Microsoft is incapable of simple spam filtering even. It's been about 20 days since I reported this and looks like this issue isn't very high on their priority
 list.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have receiving reports from several customers who started receiving lots of spam emails on their mailboxes. Our Product Group are aware of this and working on a fix. However, we do not have any estimated time frame as to when this will be resolved.
<br />
<br />
We are in constant watch and tries to provide protection to our users to the best that we can however, the system that is behind the emails you are getting circumvents the rules in our spam filter system and rules that users can create. The programmers of these
 spam-generating servers also change their IP addresses from one location to another and use different kinds of masking techniques.<br />
We recommend that you religiously report this kind of emails as junk in that way our system can determine where these emails are originating from. Lastly, please avoid posting email address from a site that is not trusted and always make sure that you give
 your email address to persons whom you trust and know.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can learn more whether an e-mail is a scam by reading these articles:</p>

<p>This issue was originally reported months and months ago by countless numbers of Outlook/Hotmail customers, yet we are still waiting on Microsoft 'Product Group' to actually put a stop to it. We all really enjoy wasting precious time attempting to block
 all the spammers' rubbish - might as well be banging our heads against a wall! </p>
<p>I read somewhere that a more recent issue is with spam addresses which contain "<strong><em>silent hyphens</em></strong>" because Outlook's filtering system doesn't recognise them, and that is why there are so many more slipping through to us customers.
 In desperation I've even attempted blocking the source IP addresses of these nuisance emails to see if that makes any difference but no, they still get through.</p>

            <p>As Ellju said, this issue was originally reported month and month ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, it is a "caring" issue, when a big company, because of its dominance on the market, don't think they have to "compete" anymore to offer a good service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After over 30 years of use of computers, if there has been a great progress with technology, there has not been any, in the contrary, for the caring for the users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as users, we have no protection because there is no free market, Microsoft can do what ever they want, nobody's going to explain them that customers (I pay for services that bug all the time) could go elsewhere to get services (I tried to use Apple services,
 witch is factually much better, but unfortunately not compatible with the majority), simply because the world function under Microsoft...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This spam issue could become a socio-political one, exactly how we can observe the way people are voting today, with no trust for their elites and institutions, Microsoft is deceiving just like politiciens: they always come up with new stuff, but never come
 up with well finished and bug-less products...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can say folks, if you can change mail provider, do it, it is not Microsoft that is going to take you seriously until they loose something!</p>

            I have been having the same issue. I have had this email account for over 10 years but the past few months keep receiving 20-30 spam emails a day. Today I received 669! I searched on Safari for Microsoft Tech Support and the Microsoft symbol and a phone
 number was the top result 800-642-7676 &nbsp;(I later realized it was a scam). I called and the representative asked me to go to www.support.me which was LogMeIn123 to remote into my computer and supposedly change my email filters. I said I was not comfortable
 with that and asked him to simply tell me the steps and I would follow. The line went dead. Please resolve this asap.

            <p>HI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My spam filter is set to 'exclusive' but some are even getting through to my inbox with that. That should not be possible.</p>
<p>Dozens of spam emails per day and multiple Phishing scams- I flag these and it is pretty disheartening that you don't do anything about them. I know that the scammers use different emails each time, but if the name comes up as Butlers@Bingo every time on
 my end, AND i report it as a scam, surely you guys can filter it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on guys, it's been months now. I've had the same email address for the last 12-13 years and I'd rather not change it. Just let me know if it will ever be fixed- if not I'll shut down my account-&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span><span>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
There are only few things that can be customized in the project Spartan.<br />
a. Open Project Spartan.<br />
c. Click on Settings.<br />
d. You can see few options that can be customized. Only those options can be customized.<br />
<br />
We don’t have option to customize home or history button, However you can provide feedback so that it can be implemented in new build.<br />
<br />
</span>Updates and feedback<br />

Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

    <title>Word for Mac 2011 Mail Merge Print Blank - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travisdaggett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for Mac 2011 Mail Merge Print Blank</h2>
                    <p>I have successfully completed a mail merge, i.e. I can preview the letters and everything looks correct.</p>
<p>However, when I merge to printer, it shows blank pages for the preview and prints blank pages. Also, it appears to have double the number of pages.</p>
<p>When I merge to a new document, it looks fine-except for double the number of pages. When I print, though, it has the same problem as above.</p>
<p>Help?</p>

Does your MailMerge Main Document contain any page breaks?<br />

Go to File-&gt;Page Setup..., then in the Settings dropdown, select "Microsoft Word", clcik "Margins...", then the Layout tab. If the "Section Start" setting is not "New Page" (e.g. is "Odd Page" or "Even Page"), change it to "New Page".<br />

<p>That would affect the Print Preview, though! The description suggests the text may be formatted as hidden - with Word configured to show, but not print, hidden text.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure I understand your description correctly... Are you saying that every other page is blank when you do the merge?</p>
<p>
If this is a form letter it sounds like you may have an empty ¶ at the end of your Main Document following all of the text. It's causing each copy of the letter to comprise 2 pages each instead of 1. It may also be other content/layout parameters in the merge
</p><p>
</p><p>If you continue to have the problem it may well be related to the printer. Check the mfr's web site for a driver or possibly a firmware update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other possibilities exist as well so check back with your results if neither suggestion resolves the issue. Also, be sure to include your OS X &amp; Office version info -- Of course, if my interpretation of your description is inaccurate, please try to provide
 a more exact description.</p>

                    I have a Macbook Pro running OSX 10.8, which I have not updated because I still use Office 2008 (I don't like the newer versions). &nbsp;Will this version of Office still run on the newer versions of OSX, including the newest 10.11?

            <p>At the moment, yes, but with some degree of glitches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that Office 2008 has been discontinued for some time &amp; all support has been withdrawn. There will be no more updates. As the OS advances it will leave obsolete software behind. Eventually, Office 2008 will fail completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not being sarcastic, but if you intend to use the most current version of the OS you'll need to upgrade your other software [not just Office] as well.</p>

1、是否每个账户都要独立开启，还是在建立账号的时候加入备份策略？ 具体怎么做呢<br />
2、如何实现备份7年，进出邮件，实施备份？<br />
3、备份的邮件，是否支持按需求筛选导出？

<p>Hi Sky Pei,</p>
<p>
</p><p>感谢联系微软技术支持。首先您需要了解，Office 365 本身具有默认<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/office365/securitycompliance/retention-policies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">保留策略</a>和<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/office365/securitycompliance/labels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">保留标签</a>（保留策略由保留标签组成）。该默认保留策略会应用于所有新建立的用户账户。该策略中，所有默认文件夹(不包含自定义文件夹)里的邮件将会保留2年，之后这些邮件不会保留在服务器端，而是移动到本地的<strong>存档(Archive)</strong>文件夹中。因此，邮件会首先根据保留策略进行相应的操作（存档或删除）。您可以在Exchange管理员中心或安全性&amp;合规性中心设置保留策略和保留标签，并将此策略应用于单个邮箱或者所有邮箱。<br />
</p>
<p>同时，Office 365 Online提供<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-archiving-service-description/exchange-online-archiving-service-description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">在线存档(Online Archive)</a></strong>功能来保留邮箱数据。您可以<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/office365/securitycompliance/enable-archive-mailboxes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">在安全性&amp;合规性中心启用存档邮箱</a>，并设置相应的保留策略和保留标签来将数据导入到存档邮箱。您也可以手动导入.pst文件或拖拽.pst文件以及直接拖拽邮件到存档邮箱中，这些数据将保留在Exchange服务器端。当然，保留策略同样适用于存档邮箱。</p>
<p>
</p><p>另外，Office 365还提供<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/exchange/policy-and-compliance/holds/holds?view=exchserver-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">就地保留(In-Place Hold)和诉讼保留(Litigation Hold)</a>，当开启时，它们会应用于用户邮箱和存档邮箱。这两种类型的保留可以将邮箱无限期保留或保留指定天数。</p>
<p>
</p><p>因此，您可以设置相应的保留策略来保留数据7年，或者启用就地保留和诉讼保留。关于如何设置保留策略，您可以参考以下链接。</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/office365/securitycompliance/set-up-an-archive-and-deletion-policy-for-mailboxes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/office365/securitycompliance/set-up-an-archive-and-deletion-policy-for-mailboxes</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>启用就地保留或诉讼保留，请参考以下链接。</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/exchange/policy-and-compliance/holds/in-place-holds?view=exchserver-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/exchange/policy-and-compliance/holds/in-place-holds?view=exchserver-2019</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/exchange/policy-and-compliance/holds/litigation-holds?view=exchserver-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/exchange/policy-and-compliance/holds/litigation-holds?view=exchserver-2019</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>对于备份的邮件，我们建议您在存储时进行分类。当然，您可以在安全性&amp;合规性中心中创建根据条件进行的<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/office365/securitycompliance/content-search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">内容搜索</a>并导出相应结果。</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<h2>            E-Mail Focused Inbox - used to work OK, now too much stuff is getting sent to Focused</h2>
                    <p>I use outlook.com with the web interface - and I also access e-mail through the outlook app on IOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Some time ago, Microsoft introduced the Focused inbox feature, and it seemed to work pretty well and I actually kind of liked it.</p>
<p>But then sometime in the last couple months, suddenly all kinds of e-mails are going to my focused inbox.&nbsp; It is terrible and makes the feature basically useless.</p>
<p>I have been diligently moving items from my Focused inbox to my Other inbox since then, and selecting the option to "Always Move".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
The "always move" option doesn't seem to work consistently, and in any case it is not a good answer to the problem at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to configure or set a preference on what is considered "focused"?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
How does Outlook decide what is focused, and why did it suddenly go from doing an OK job to a terrible job of this?</p>
<p>Is there anyway to reset whatever rule base Outlook goes by and start from scratch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Focused Inbox separates your inbox into two tabs. The <strong>Focused </strong>
and the <strong>Other </strong>tab. Focused tab consists most important emails while the rest are on the Other tab. Focused Inbox intelligently identify your important emails, those are the email that you always respond to.&nbsp;The more you use it, the better it
 gets. You can easily reclassify emails between Focused and Other. Just open an email, then select "<strong>Move to Focused/Non-Focused</strong>" by doing right-click on the email then select
<strong>Move</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may consider creating a rule on your Outlook.com. Inbox rules automatically perform specific actions on email that arrives in your inbox. Rules works like Focused Inbox, the only difference is that you can create a specific condition when
 creating Inbox rule. For more information, please check this article: Use inbox rules in

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

<p>I do appreciate your responding to my post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand how the feature is supposed to work; i was just surprised and disappointed at the change.</p>
<p>When the feature was first introduced; I don't know what logic it used to route e-mail to focused, but it actually worked pretty well.&nbsp; Several weeks ago this changed and the feature started to work terribly.&nbsp; E-mails started routing to focused from senders
 where they had never routed to focused before, and I had never moved them.&nbsp; Everything is going to focused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You asked to state how the issue is progressing, and I have to say, not well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I make a point of moving items to the other inbox, so the system has an opportunity to learn, but I still spend a lot of time moving items. And I can't really tell that the system is learning anything.</p>
<p>The description you shared says that Focused Inbox intelligently identifies important e-mails.&nbsp; What intelligence is it applying; what rules does it use?&nbsp; I have e-mails coming into focused inbox that may not be out-and-out spam; but I cannot imagine any
 definition of important that they fit.</p>
<p>I have all kinds of mass mailings that keep routing to Focused even though the sender is not in my address book, I have never responded to this sender, I have never forwarded, I have never moved the e-mail to focused.&nbsp; Why would Outlook think this e-mail
 is important?</p>

    <title>how do I activate Office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marc deblois  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I activate Office 2010</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Office 2010 on ebay and am trying to activate, but it won't let me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried online, but it tells me that this product cannot be activated because the product key is not valid.&nbsp; I tried over the phone, but it won't work either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The product certainly looks legit as it was sealed when I received it, it does have the microsoft label. a genuine product key label inside the cover and the CD certainly appears to be genuine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could it be that&nbsp;I bought the produsct from the USA and I'm trying to register it in Canada?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at a loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>If there are previous installations of Office presently on the computer, there is a chance that such installations are conflicting.&nbsp; Uninstall them, restart twice, then try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no other installations of Office, sorry, you inadvertently purchased nongenuine software on eBay.&nbsp; Whoda thunk it?&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Open a case with eBay to get a full refund from the seller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, keep in mind that there ain't a lotta genuine software on eBay.&nbsp; Buy Office from well-known online or local retailers.</p>

</span></span></span><span>If none of the above</span> conditions apply, before, or after trying the following procedures you may want to do a Phone Activation and ask the service rep to explain what the specific problem is.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><u>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </u></b></p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys for retail licenses, but not for Retail sale. They are intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a
 subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. It is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>What probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><u>Validate Now:</u></b></p>
<p>You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/</a> Click the 'Validate Windows' button. If the validation check fails, then you are going to have to buy your product again. You should contact
 the vendor for a refund. Depending on where they are in the scam cycle they may give you the refund or they will string you along with delays. You should also contact your credit card company to cancel the transaction or to at the very least give them a heads
 up on the scam so that they can deny the scammer any further sales.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to report the vendor to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/windows-7-ultimate-activation/www.microsoft.com/piracy">
www.microsoft.com/piracy</a> .</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>If it is a legitimate purchase, then you are possibly having a known problem with Win7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are 3 possible causes, 4 possible fixes:</b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>First confirm that you are not making a simple typing error.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Second, it may be an access rights problem. There are 2 possible fixes for it. Either activate using "Run As Admin" or "Take Ownership" of the problem drive folders and registry entries. I have provided links to several articles for these
 types of fixes. Pick one that you can follow and try it.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Third do a phone activation. Do not enter anything until the phone system offers you the option to talk to a live service rep. Explain the problem to them. You are transferring the installation from a “dead” computer, or you are getting
 an invalid product key and would like to know the exact reason</p>

<h2>            End of life Windows Live Admin Center</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><strong>Dear Windows Live Admin Center </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It was sad &nbsp;indeed to see the end of outlook domains. Most of us were very happy with the service and families like ours benefited a lot. But now we are forced to pay minimum $5 a month to&nbsp; obtain the service&nbsp; with office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My kind request for Windows Live Admin Center&nbsp; is to&nbsp; allow at least 3 -5 email accounts free per domain so people using it for family/personal use would still benefit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not please introduce a email only service for $1-2 dollars a month aimed at personal users ( maximum number of email addresses can be capped at 5-10)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other alternatives but nothing even comes to Windows Live Admin Center , I hope MS will think about us personal users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Refund for a Digital Product</h2>
                    <p>I'm looking to get a refund for Excel for Mac which I just purchased as digital download. When it logged me in to my Microsoft account I then realised I still had access to an older version I purchased years back, which I downloaded completely fine, and
 will suit my needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read there are no refund for digital programs. Is there a loop hole for this considering I had already purchased the program years ago and didn't realise I would still have access, and haven't yet downloaded the new one purchased today?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a small child so calling Microsoft (from Australia) between the hours of 6pm and 5am is completely impractical. Could someone please email me?</p>

<h2>            Potential Word file corruption &#40;Word for Mac 2011&#41;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I am worried that Word files may be getting corrupted on my 2015 MacBook Pro (Retina). I worked on a Word 2011 (version 14.7.4) document on my Mac running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 for several hours and then hit Command-S to save. Suddenly parts of my document
 were in Chinese characters.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
It looked like this, with English characters intermixed with Chinese (this displays the same in post preview on Safari on my Mac as it does in Word, so hopefully others can see it):</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
seen t 漀爀 椀渀 愀 洀甀猀攀甀洀 挀愀琀愀氀漀最甀攀⸀ 圀栀攀渀 䤀 昀椀爀猀琀 挀愀洀攀 愀挀爀漀猀猀 琀栀攀 椀洀愀最攀 椀 琀 he caption informed</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I poked around in Word and found no setting or command that seemed related to this. I confirmed in System Preferences that I do not and I think never had a Chinese keyboard enabled. All typing in the document, other Word documents (I had two others open that
 look fine) and in other applications was unaffected. After poking around (I'm not sure if this was true immediately or happened a little later), I noticed many menu commands were grayed out in Word and Word also stopped letting me enter text (although I could
 place the insertion cursor) the either the messed up document or the other documents I had open.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I closed everything and opened Word again. Now everything seems normal, and I can enter text without an issue. But that one document still has Chinese characters where my writing used to be. I copied and pasted the text into TextEdit and also opened it in LibreOffice
 and in both cases it looked the same.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have four questions:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
1. Has anyone ever encountered this behavior before? At first I thought I had accidentally pushed some keyboard command while trying to hit Command-S instead, and turned on some Chinese language feature. But this similar problem:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

 ters-after-save</a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
makes me think that it is in fact a file corruption issue that occurred when I hit save. Which is frustrating because how can I save my work regularly in order to avoid data loss when the act of saving it corrupts the file!?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
2. Once a file has become corrupted like this, is there any way to undo it and get my writing back? Word's Undo command had no effect when I tried right away. Is this a character encoding issue or something else that I can somehow reverse and recover the roman
 letters?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
3. I understand my software (Word 2011 and Yosemite) is somewhat out of date. I've been working on an "if it's not broke, don't fix it" principle, particularly because I am a grad student and would like to avoid any interruptions in my work unless it's necessary.
 However, if this is a bug in Word or Yosemite, then it may make sense for me to upgrade. If this is a known bug, is it fixed in later versions?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
4. Any other thoughts about what I can do to prevent this happening in the future? This case wasn't so bad, because it was only a few hours' work, but it was discouraging and it would be much worse for it to happen to a longer document. I am now worried about
 doing future work on this computer because I don't want to lose it.&nbsp;<span>Any
 guesses about whether this kind of corruption would be a one-off thing, or should I start worrying about drive failure or other serious problems? I just ran Disk Utility and it says the volume appears to be OK.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

<span>While I was messing around after it happened, I did get an error that "There
 is insufficient memory or disk space. Close extra windows and try again. (AutoRecovery save of [my file name]...)"</span>&nbsp;I have 45 GB of free disk space so I don't think this is a disk space problem. In addition to Word, I was running several other programs
 (PowerPoint, Rhino, SketchUp, Spotify). But I have 16 GB of RAM and I feel like my MacBook Pro should be able to handle running those programs without corrupting my files. I need to run these programs for my work, so I really do not want to have to be afraid
 that I will try to save a document I have been working on for months and potentially corrupt it. I use Time Machine regularly but I really do not want to lose the work that I would do between backups if there is anything that can be done to reduce the risk
 of corruption like this happening in the future.</p>

<h2>            installing office professional plus 2010 on Surface Pro</h2>
                    I'm trying to install Office Professional Plus 2010 on my new Surface Pro from the CD.&nbsp; When I enter the Product Key I get a message saying it isn't a valid product key?&nbsp; This is a legitimately purchased product.&nbsp; I get the same message when I try to activate
 it online too.&nbsp; I am using the software successfully on my Windows 7 desktop and laptop (which the Surface pro will hopefully replace).&nbsp; How can I successfully install this software?

            <p>That is the reason why it won't activate.&nbsp; The license covers (2) computers (a primary and a secondary).&nbsp; The license also got changed recently but don't know if it was changed back though.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once you activate to the limit number of machines, that is it.&nbsp; You can possibly uninstall it from the laptop and then attempt to install it on the tablet and when the activation fails, it will give you a toll free number to call.&nbsp; You can tell them what
 you are trying to do and they may let you activate it as long as the machine limit is not exceeded by the license.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may also go to <a href="http://office.Microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.Microsoft.com</a> and contact support before installing and ask them about it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have Home &amp; Business 2010 on disc and it is permanently in its' box now because I reached the limit on it.&nbsp; After that, I had subscribed to Office 365 and said to heck with the disc version altogether.</p>

            ...you can call Microsoft and have them 'divorce' the serial from one of the other devices&nbsp;if you plan on retiring it,&nbsp;thereby free-ing it up for the Surface.

            <p>Either that or get a Product Key Activation Card and reuse the discs.&nbsp; That is why I didn't throw it plus I also have the disc version of Home &amp; Student 2010 as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think that Microsoft is trying to get rid of the disc version and get people to either activate the free trial copy that comes with computers or download the 60 day trial and activate it with a key card.&nbsp; It is a push to cut the costs of the discs plus
 you eliminate inventory.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do believe that Visio and some other programs are going to go the subscription plan in the future as well.</p>

            I have a similar issue, I want to install MS Office Pro+ on my surface and when I try to activate, I get the message that the product key is incorrect. I have only loaded one copy of this software on my laptop.

            <p>Sheryl, in your case, the first thing to do is check in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features to see if you have a "Free trial" factory installed copy of the Office 365/2013.&nbsp; If you do, and you installed a copy of 2010, then the activation system is getting
 "confused".</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Uninstall </strong>the Office 365 trial, </li><li>do an <strong>Office repair </strong>of your 2010 installation.&nbsp; </li><li>You <strong>MAY</strong> also do one more activation of your 2010 installation to finally clear up your issue.</li></ol>

<p>I really must wade in here and say that I too have this issue, and as someone who increasingly is developing as I bootstrap my startups minimum Viable offering, to me it is shocking that Microsoft, the richest software company on the plant have&nbsp; incoherency
 in their upgrade issues which have failed to first acknowledge its users current /previous installations of their products.&nbsp; More heads must roll. Microsoft have been slow to integrate without headache to the web.</p>

            <p>Actually what Microsoft should have done was to put the installer of Office 365 on the tablet instead of pre-installing it.&nbsp; That would allow people to just delete the installer and install what they wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This applies to any program: you always uninstall a 'same' program from a computer if you have a newer or older version you wish to install.&nbsp; This also applies to games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A mix-match of libraries will happen and the installer gets confused.&nbsp; It will not replace the pre-installed files and then end up with a program that will crash.&nbsp; And, on top of that, you can attempt to uninstall that Frankenstein installation and the uninstaller
 will error out and then you have to manually uninstall the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had a problem in installing Office on a computer even one with a newer version pre-installed.&nbsp; You simply uninstall it before installing the version that you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only time you can install both of the same is if there is a beta version which is installed in a different location.&nbsp; Office 2016 is now available as a beta for both Windows and Macs.&nbsp; Those can live 'side by side'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft also has the Preview versions of the Metro UI versions of the Office apps in the Store as well (at least, in the Windows 10 beta Store).&nbsp; You can check on those as well.</p>

<h3> tjf13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stack Overflow Error - IE 8</h2>
                    
<p>I just installed Internet Explorer 8 ...&nbsp; I have a Windows XP OS ... now when I access certain websites (such as<a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cnn.com</a>), I get multiple Stack Overflow error messages (i.e. Stack Overflow at line: 0).&nbsp; Then usually, eventually
 I get a message below the tool bar that states "Internet Explorer has modified this page to help&nbsp;prevent cross-scripting."&nbsp; I didn't get the Stack Overflow errors with IE 7 ... Can someone tell me how to resolve this issue?&nbsp; Do I need to uninstall IE8 and
 go back to IE7 until this is resolved and they get the kinks out of IE8?</p>
<p>BTW ... I have done the following already to try and fix the issue:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Ran IE8 without Add-ons and then accessed the website ... the stack overflow errors still occur.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Viewed the website in "Compatibility View" ... the stack overflow errors still occur.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;"RESET" my Internet Explorer settings as suggested in other posts, but it still did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>Please help ... It is very&nbsp;frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Groove Music metadata mess - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Groove Music metadata mess</h2>
                    <p>Groove Music sucks so badly. I turned off 'automatic update meta data', yet Groove keeps adding and changing metadata.
</p>
<p>- a song can be sang by different authors and Groove always change author to the 'right' one, although it is not</p>
<p>- Groove renamed my song title from English to Hebrew or whatever that language is (and it's not just one song)</p>
<p>- I formatted all my song titles and metadata, but Groove screws every single song title - example - I formatted song title to be 'Lovers on the sun', and Groove renames it to 'Lovers On The Sun'</p>
<p>- Groove added WRONG titles to the songs</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get rid of annoying metadata Groove has created and how can I permanently disable such annoying option. I don't want to ever use it, not on my PC and not on phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>MP3 file name is Jay Sean - Down, author is set to Jay Sean... And Groove translates it into... Hebrew? Whatever, really... annoying... Windows language is set to English, region set to US</p>

            <p>There are dozens of issues reported in Feedback from the get-go which have many up-votes and were never addressed before the official release of Windows 10. The user decided to ask here to maybe get some help addressing how to stop Groove Music from messing
 with his metadata.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems the only way to fix the problem is to stop using Groove Music altogether (and also stay away from Media Player) to keep your tags just the way you like them.</p>

            <p>Groove Music is a bit of a mess. I personally prefer MediaMonkey (or foobar2000, but it requires more technical knowledge for customization). Or Winamp, but it's a bit of a resource hog. I suggest switching to one of those, fixing the metatags, and discontinuing
 use of Groove Music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That language, by the way, is Japanese (the simplified kana form, specifically).<br />
And capitalizing each word in the title is the standard format for music, movie, &amp; film titles. That's why it does that (though I agree that it should let you overwrite that format, if you want).</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the document in Word and choose <strong>Office button&gt;Save As&gt;Other Formats</strong>.</li><li>Create an empty folder.</li><li>Change the <strong>Save as type:</strong> dropdown to <strong>Web Page (*.htm:*.html)</strong>, give the file a name like Photo.htm, then click on
<strong>Save</strong>.</li><li>In Windows, open the folder you created, then open the <strong>Photo_files</strong> folder (the first part of the folder name will be the file name you chose).</li><li>Change to <strong>Details view</strong>, so you can see which graphic file has the larger size. That's your photo.</li></ol>

    <title>pptx to pdf always crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mosaicgirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            pptx to pdf always crashes</h2>
                    
<p>I have several large Powerpoint slide decks ranging in size from 100-300 slides per deck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to print these files to pdf as notes pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My method has been as follows:</p>
<p>Open the pptx file</p>
<p>Select Print</p>
<p>Select Adobe PDF on the printer name pull-down</p>
<p>Set Print Quality at 300 dpi (or less)</p>
<p>Click to Save the file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "Creating Adobe PDF" dialogue comes up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PDF Progress says "Creating... FILENAME.pdf"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PDF Name: FILENAME.pdf</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sending Page: 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is when it crashes. I get the following crash message:</p>
<p>"Microsoft PowerPoint has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.<br />
The information you were working on might be lost. blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Send Error Report"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried using a program I paid $39.99 for called PDF Complete. It messes up the notes completely; wherever quotation marks or em dashes appear it inserts strange spacing in the notes pdf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help in figuring out what I should do here...</p>

    <title>Taskbar Icon vs. Application Icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> self untaught  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar Icon vs. Application Icon</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I hope I can explain this properly...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have created several different Taskbar icons that all launch the same FrontEnd.mde file, however they launch it with different /x startupmacros so
 that the user is taken to specific forms when they launch. They typically keep 3 copies of the frontEnd.mde file open at all times, so they can easily switch between A (appointments), L (log notes) and D (deadlines):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f5b7a3b-680e-44b8-8bb8-b2612d642b99" /></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Notice in the above image, A and L have been launched, but D has not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This worked beautifully for Access 2003 runtime, because after launching, the icons remain as their own individual icons on the taskbar without grouping,
 and the user can easily identify which copy they need to switch to without having to hover over the icon for a thumbnail preview.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since I have upgraded to Access 2010 runtime, the behavior has changed: As soon as the user clicks the "A", the "A" program appears as a second image
 on the taskbar and loses the "A" icon. It assumes the icon of the database's Tools, Startup, Application Icon (he dollar sign). Then when they click the "L", the "L" program groups together with the first open program, again, of course, with the Application
 Icon ("$") instead of the taskbar shortcut icon (L):</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7df4cdc0-4eef-4739-b6bd-97a71925e581" /></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Notice in the above image, A and L have been launched, but D has not. &nbsp;A and L are not highlighted...Instead, they appear as a separate image to the right of D, and
 assume the database's Application Icon ("$").</span></p>
<p><span>If I change the properties of the Windows Taksbar to never combine, the running programs A and L separate, but both maintain the Application Icon instead
 of their original taskbar icon:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/958a32d9-8a73-4b98-9b58-f4dd50ea70c1" /></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there a way around this? (Most of my users in the office are on Win7. This image was captured on my Win8)</span></p>

</p><p>Now, re-pin the icon.</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes and no...It DOES change icon to behave as it did before. However it creates numerous runtime errors throughout the database, so it is not a solution for us. I tried adding Run as administrator to see if that might clear up all the runtime errors, but
 that didn't help.</p>

</p><p>I able to run rather complex and full featured mde applications using the 2010 runtime, and using the XP compatibility setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible you have a shortcut to the mde, and NOT the runtime?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try a shortcut like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\MSACCESS.EXE"</strong><br />
<strong>"c:\RidesDev\SkiRides\RidesXP\RidesXP.mde" /runtime </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The above is on two lines for this post, , but in practice, the above is one line in the shortcut with a space between the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do above, the pinned icon works just like 2003. And I not receiving any additional errors when using the XP mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your shortcut might be to the actual mde, and it needs to be to msaccess.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can’t think why checking the xp mode would cause errors in the application, but try a shortcut like above to msaccess.exe, and not directly to the mde file.</p>

            Yes, my command line is complete...includes the msaccess.exe info as well as the database name, just like your sample. Also includes the startup /wrkgrp C:\...\secured.mdw.

            <p>I also using a workgroup and ULS security</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try compatibility as Vista 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ZERO ideas why setting the application in compatibility mode would cause any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have UAC in windows 7 set to “never” notify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, setting my shortcut as windows XP, or Vista solves the taskbar icon issue, but either choice has no effect on the “normal” running of my application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect some other “serious” issue exists with the application if it cannot run under Vista compatibility mode!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So try compatibility set as Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact the icon issue goes away EVEN if I set comparability to windows 7 (and when doing so on windows 7!!!&nbsp; I don’t quite know what this setting actually does!). (I suspect allows one to run on windows 7 without existing SP updates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So try a few other settings. I would during testing ALSO disable UAC. While you might not want or be able to have all machines run with UAC turned off, for testing, you would at least “know” if this issue can be resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for me, using windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 for the compatibility settings works just fine and resolves the icon issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also don’t mention what kind of errors you see when the application is run, but I would try a few other settings, and also during testing ensure that UAC is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also consider during all testing run with the shortcut “run as administrator” option checked (as you have - this&nbsp;can trigger a UAC prompt, but we disabled that for testing – right???).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also before you pin the icon (you have to un-pin to change settings anyway). Try a right click and troubleshoot compatibility mode, and see if that works.</p>

            <p>Thank you and I apologize. I am not getting errors when I launch it. &nbsp;My mistake...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your advice to set XP compatibility is working as you describe it should. &nbsp;I did, however, have to change the UAC's to never notify, and the user has to answer "Yes" to the UAC prompt every time they launch with XP compatibility set. &nbsp;I have removed the
 "Run as administrator" setting, and all is good except for the UAC prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you advise? Should I keep UAC off (not advisable), or is there a workaround?</p>

            <p><span>EXCELLENT!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At least we know this can work!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And always double check - make you sure you removed the “run as admin” check box?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Remember, you cannot modify the properties when the icon is pinned, you have to un-pin. Change the settings, and re-pin.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since this “can” work, then don't test with "too many" changes at at once.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would start with the MOST recent compatible OS version settings. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So try the most recent versions of compatibility (windows 7 – likely will not fix this, but Vista should).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am able to make this work with Vista, and do have NOT checked run as admin.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And without the run as admin, you should not receive a UAC prompt</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So try the “most” close and least disruptive settings – that suggests Vista is the best choice here.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I personally always have UAC turned off, and have things like show file extension (so I can modify them) on my development computer.&nbsp; I really don't know your situation and company policy in regards to turning off UAC. It really comes down to the kind
 of users and an appropriate company policy. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There never one suggestion that fits all here. Depending on their levels of competence, then turning off UAC may be ok or very bad - such cases likely have to be evaluated on a case by case in regards to users skill levels.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hopefully using Vista compatibility will work for you without UAC prompts.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you. I do, as a practice, try to change one thing at a time when troubleshooting. But thank you for the reminder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I unpin, then change properties, then re-pin.</p>
<p>Yes, I do have run as administrator UNchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several options for Visa compatibility. Which should I use, or should I try them all, starting with the most current, as you indicated? I only ask, because I don't know anything about Vista, as I skipped that one altogether, and don't know if there
 are any known issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vista</p>
<p>Vista (SP1)</p>
<p>Vista (SP2)</p>
