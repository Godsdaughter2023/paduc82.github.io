<h2>            WU and Store not working</h2>
                    Recently I upgraded to build 9926 from build 9879. I use proxy for internet access. Previously I was able to use all the services through proxy connection. But in build 9926 I am not able to download apps from Windows Store and even WU is not working.
 I used the command "netsh winhttp import proxy source=ie" but it is also not working. All the features are working except Windows services, I am also not able to download .NET frameworks through WU. WU is giving this error code :&nbsp;0x80240438 and STORE shows
 this error :&nbsp;0x80072efd. Please help me. I am stuck in this network issue. PROXY system works fine in all other version of Windows, only build 9926 is showing such behavior. Please help!!!!!

            <p><span>Hi Shashank,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Modern UI apps including Windows Store will not work due to the proxy settings. You may have to disable and check with the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Use the Modern UI apps as well as Windows Store without proxy settings. Follow the steps to disable the proxy connection:
<br />
a. Open <strong><span>Internet Explorer.</span></strong><br />
b. Click on <strong><span>tools</span></strong> and select <strong><span>Internet Options.</span></strong><br />
c. Click on <strong><span>Connections.</span></strong><br />
d. Click on <strong><span>LAN</span></strong> Settings.<br />
e. Remove <strong><span>check mark next to proxy server.</span></strong><br />
f. Click on <strong><span>OK.</span></strong><br />
g. Restart the <strong><span>browser.</span></strong> </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue still persists, you may also try resetting the store cache and check:</span></p>
<p><span>a. From the desktop press <strong><span>Windows + R</span></strong> keys.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type "<strong><span>wsreset.exe</span></strong>" on run window and press
<strong><span>enter key</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: Make sure that the Date and Time settings are correct.
</span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span>Some secure sites require that the date and time match the date and time of the secure site. Make sure that the Date and Time settings are correct on the computer. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
a. Double click on the time and date on the right hand side bottom of your screen.
<br />
b. Click on <strong><span>change</span></strong> <strong><span>date</span></strong> and
<strong><span>time</span></strong> <strong><span>settings</span></strong>.<br />
c. Click on <strong><span>Internet</span></strong> <strong><span>time</span></strong> and click on
<strong><span>change</span></strong> <strong><span>settings</span></strong>.<br />
d. Place a check mark at “<strong><span>Synchronize time with internet server</span></strong>”
<br />
e. Click on <strong><span>Apply</span></strong> and <strong><span>Ok</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The screen Resolution should be at least 1024x768.</span></p>

            <p>I live in IIT campus and I have to use PROXY to connect to internet so I can't disable proxy.</p>
<p>Disabling proxy does not work in my case.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">In previous builds of Windows

<p><strong>This problem exists only with BUILD 9926 of Windows 10. Here the metro apps are working fine behind the proxy. The only problem is that I am not able to download any WU and STORE apps.</strong> I think that there is some problem between my PC and
 Windows Server because only the stuffs from Windows Server are not downloading. Rest all the metro apps are working. I also tried "netsh winhttp import proxy source=ie" but no result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried your's suggestion too but didn't work.</p>

<p>This is actually very strange issue as I am constantly using W10 TP from it's first release in 2014 and I was able to use all the METRO apps and WU services without any difficulty behind the PROXY network. This problem started only after upgrading to Build
 9926. After that I have rolled back to previous builds and this problem is not there. Only W10 Build 9926 is behaving like this. NO WU/Store Apps downloading behind proxy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Anish,</p>
<p>Your answer is so irrelevant. Are you really a support engineer at MICROSOFT, well it's not only you almost all the SUPPORT ENGINEERS on this forum has given the same answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HAVE YOU GUYS NOT READ MY PROBLEM CORRECTLY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its clearly written that I USE A PROXY CONNECTION TO CONNECT TO INTERNET ( I AM A STUDENT IN IIT CAMPUS AND WE HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET THROUGH PROXY ONLY) . AND YOU GUYS ADVICE US TO DISABLE PROXY. By disabling PROXY how would i be able to use internet.
 Well at MICROSOFT perhaps you would be having such a fancy technology where one can connect to internet without proxy in a proxy environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very frustating that NONE of the support engineers have an appropriate answer for this problem. &nbsp;Why does Microsoft hires such engineers?</p>

<h2>            New flight is brewing and may be today.</h2>
                    There is a twitter dialog going on between various members of the team and various Insiders about a possible flight today.&nbsp; The team (Jason) says it is possible if update work on the targeting system finishes.&nbsp; I assume the "targeting system" is what decides
 who gets builds and which variants, etc.&nbsp; There is no indication of problems with the candidate build preventing a flight, just that the delivery system is being updated.&nbsp; So if not today, then tomorrow.&nbsp; Of course, anything can happen.

            Yeah, clearly the build is selected and for a brief time the number 17074 appeared in a graphic but it was edited out again.&nbsp; 17074.1000 was Saturday's compilation and is comfortably within the four-day vetting cycle.&nbsp; Jason has been teasing the Insiders
 following him today and is making jokes about it so the atmosphere isn't gloomy.&nbsp; Jason is the one working on the targeting system update and is normally the publisher-in-chief.

<h2>            920 battery swollen up for 2nd time&#58; I DEMAND PHONE RELACEMENT&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>I really need your advice.</p>
<p><span><strong>Is there any way for a Nokia 920 owner to demand a full phone relacement?</strong></span></p>
<p>I'm really tired and dissapointed because my 920' s battery became swollen up (nflated) for 2nd time.</p>
<p><strong>The 1st time was the very first moment I took the phone out of its packet the day I purchased it
</strong>(10/2013). There was &nbsp;a huge strange spot (like a lake) on the screen. I thought it was a defective screen, and went immediately to the&nbsp;Nokia care in my city (Heraklion/Crete/Greece). 5 days later the&nbsp;technician&nbsp;called me to visit him, he&nbsp;showed me
 my phone, it was a round shape almost like a footballl ball due to battery over swollen up! I received it 1,5 month later repaired (12/2013).</p>
<p><strong>Yesterday I noticed the same problem again</strong>, a&nbsp;<span>huge strange spot (like a lake) on the screen, in a different place than the 1st time. The plastics on the left side were&nbsp;unbuckled due to the pressure of the swollen battery. I delivered
 it to&nbsp;<span>Nokia care again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So now I demand a&nbsp;<strong>full hone relacement </strong>for the following reasons<strong>:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>1)</strong> </span>Now I have to wait another 1,5 month for my phone to be repaired ? This is crazy!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>2)</strong></span> If it happened for a 2nd time, it is probably to happen again for a 3rd time in another 8 months ? And maybe the warranty will expire, so is it fair for me to pay the repair in the future for an existing problem
 ?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>3)</strong></span> The first repair left some permanently problems to my phone: 1) the&nbsp;<span>strange spot remained on the screen for ever but is less visible than before the repair, 2) the back&nbsp;camera aluminium panel is permanently&nbsp;<span>unbuckled
 leaving distance of 0,5 ~ 1mm from the back plastic cover. Now after the new repair I will have a new permanent spot on my screen ? And maybe the&nbsp;<span>plastics on the left side remain permanently&nbsp;</span><span>unbuckled ? Is this fair for an owner who has
 payed 350 euro (300 usd) for a &nbsp;high end phone ?</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So, is it possible for an owner to demand formally a full phone replacement ?
</strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I stated this to Nokia care and the answered that it is not their responsibility to replace the phone, it has to do with manfacturer's policy. But with their experience they were almost sure that the phone<strong> will not be
 replaced</strong>, and <strong>moreover the battery has only 6 months warranty and maybe now I will have to pay the repair</strong>!!!
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Unbelievable!!!!</span></span></span></span></span></p>

As this is a non removable battery its not as quick a turnaround as a device with a removable battery,i would be demanding a replacement to be honest anyway..

<p>Obviously this will yield no results as long as it is not certain that Nokia is the party responsible for this, which frankly is doubtful based on what seems to be the problem with the phone. As you hopefully are well aware Nokia Care Points are independent
 retailers and NOT part of the Nokia organisation. So it is well possible this is actually an individual shop owner doing a hack repair and as such Nokia/Microsoft is not to blame here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally starting a kicking and shouting campaign will only be counter productive unless you can be sure you are accusing the correct party of something. Since Nokia may well have no real obligation to help out it will be much less likely they will do so
 on the basis of goodwill when you start spreading unfounded and/or baseless accusations towards them.</p>

<p>No, they can’t.&nbsp; As I said before, the SSO only applies to the internal users who belong to a common Office 365 tenant or organization, even if they have the Office 365 accounts.</p>

<h3> jenniferp14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call options&#47;buttons - keep putting people on hold or mute. Please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased the Nokia Lumia 710 &amp; the biggest problem I have is that when I'm on&nbsp;a call, I inadvertently put the person on hold or mute simply by my cheek touching the screen.&nbsp; I know others have had this problem, and I don't know why the screen
 doesn't lock while on a call or that I can't change a setting to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still within my window to return or exchange my phone, and I'd really appreciate if anyone knows of a solution.&nbsp; If not, I think I may return the phone as this is an extremely frustrating problem for myself and the caller on the other end!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<div>My Omnia has always done this too - I end up holding it diagonally away from my head, or I use the headset ... And earrings make things worse. Whoever it was that suggested that the buttons should be at the bottom rather than the top of the screen hit
 the nail on the head. The proximity sensor may be slightly out of kilter, but on balance I'd rather the screen was on when I didn't want it, rather than off when I did, so I can live with it ....just.</div>

                    I received a phone call from an Indian accented speaking male who informed me he was from Microsoft and that he was trying to fix my computer from unwanted programs being downloaded without my knowledge. &nbsp;he asked me to press the fn key and the letter
 r together at this point a folder search box popped up. He then asked me to type inf wich brought me to a folder file section said these were the unwanted programs then asked me to input www.sharemypc.com in the search box I started a search on chrome to inspect
 this site and i get the feeling that it was some scam to gain control of my computer.once i was delaying his request to cooperate and press ok for that site to gain access he quickly made up an excuse as to why he would need to call me back to fix said issue.Has
 anyone else had this happen and is this a scam...if so how do i report this and could the damage be done already how can i set my laptop so it can not be controlled from an outside source.

Hi Blackdeath23.<br />
<br />
The lastest version available of My Phone application is 01.00.1516.0001.<br />
<br />
You can see that version number of the build that you're using under Menu -&gt; About<br />
<br />
Also, the lastest version is available under <span>http://myphone.microsoft.com/install</span>
<br />
Open that URL in your <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">mobile phone's</span> browser and follow the installation instructions.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Lopes.<br />

            nokia has manufacturing plants all over the world, depending on the region where those units will be shipped to. so most phones for europe will be produced most likely in the european plants tho that is not always the case etc. any nokia phone is made
 the same way, adhering to the same standards across the boards irregardless of the location of the production plant.

            I know that E seria usually produced only in Finland and Germany and I am interested in when they started manufacturing in Hungary. Quality must be the same everywhere but I know that some complain about the phones produced in China. Do you know whose
 phone markets are designed and manufactured in Hungary, is there a practice of transferring production of certain models from Finland to other countries when these models become older or when there are new models that are first produced in Finland, such as
 e72?

            Hungary has been used for years its nothing new. most of my Nokia phones are made in China, NEVER had any issues with those but my n95 that was made in Finland was a disaster that had to go back to nokia care. and no e series are no different from all
 other phones produced it just depends on the market where they are destined to. I live in the US so Nokia phones for US mostly come from the factory in China. Again never had any issues with those, so NO it does not matter where the phones are made as long
 as they are made by Nokia.

            it is correct that the e designation is for business minded users, just like n series are designed for multimedia, c series are medium end phones and so on, the x series i believe at least initially were designed for music emphasis and i think this still
 holds true. im not sure that they r better they r made for different audience like other series. hope this helps

</p><p>- Snipping tool: it's not easy to use and to know which keyboard shortcuts to use etc. I had to install a third party app called Gyazo to get something easier.</p>
<p>- After this is done I have to upload the file to the website. In order to do this, I have to click on the file explorer button on the website, which opens a certain view on the File Explorer window. And here I have a certain frustration, which is that the
 File Explorer section does not necessarily take me to a Recent Files "section", like it does in Linux's Nautilus file explorer. Which means I never really know where I am and I have to do additional clicks to get to the Quick access section. In which I, at
 the beginning, do not get a details list that gives me the ordered recent files, but the other problem is also that when I scroll down to the screenshots, and because I am in a list view, I cannot see the image that I am selecting and therefore I have to make
 a choice and upload based solely on the name of the file or just "assume" that it is the latest screenshot because it's on top of the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Nautilus at least what I got under Linux was that when I was scrolling on an image in Detailed list view the explorer would give me a "preview" of the image so that I can "check" that I am sending the right image. Not all software makes you create/download
 image files that have intuitive naming, so being able to see the preview before uploading an image can be extremely useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly encourage to take a look at Nautilus and how it works in that regard, don't know if this is something that Microsoft already does but it could be nice inspiration.</p>

    <title>Can I create an Outlook 2010 template that will have the encrypt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertsouthwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I create an Outlook 2010 template that will have the encrypt feature toggled&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking to create an email template in Outlook 2010 that has the encryption feature on. Whenever I open up the template, even though I saved it with the encryption toggled on, it takes the encryption feature off. I will be sending out a lot of emails
 on a weekly basis from this template and it would be nice if I didn't have to toggle on encryption every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>
<p>Robert</p>

            <div>Hello,</div>
<div>Thank you for posting. We would need some clarification on the issue before proceed to assist.
<div>How are you trying to encrypt the emails?</div>
<div>Are you manually doing emails by going to Options tab&gt; More options group&gt; Message Options Dialog Box launcher&gt; Security Settings and selecting Encrypt message contents and attachments?</div>
<div>If so, this setting is for one email only and the setting will not be retained if the message is saved as template.</div>
<div>If you want to encrypt all the emails then you need to do it from ‘Trust center’ settings in Outlook.</div>
<div>You may refer the below article which provides information on this:</div>

            <p>Hey Nayana,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is actually an option in the top left corner of my new message box that, upon selection, will encrypt the email. So I did not use either one of the options you mentioned above. I don't know if that's something which was programmed/setup for Outlook
 options by the organization I work for. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to encrypt all emails by default, just the ones which I send from this one template. I am attaching a letter in this template which I will be sending out maybe 20 time a week and so it would be a lot easier if I could have the encryption ability
 already active when I opened the template so I didn't have to toggle it myself each time but mostly in case I forget to toggle it as I deal with a lot of confidential information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll check out your other option, I know I read from your online help that I can set up an email signature which will automatically encrypt the messages so I'm not sure if that's what you're referring to but that seemed pretty complicated for what I was
 doing and I just need an encryption not the signature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help. Let me know if I have any additional options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you want me to take a screenshot of? You want me to take a screenshot of a new email message so you can see the encrypt email button that is on the tool bar? I'm not sure how that would help the situation, I want to know if it is possible
 to have an email template which will always have the encryption active. This is something that either Outlook is capable of or not.</p>

    <title>Add Delta Tickets to Wallet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robbattaglia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add Delta Tickets to Wallet</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering how to add my Delta itineraries and boarding passes to my Windows Wallet on a Nokia Lumia Icon. &nbsp;I find it odd that this does not seem to be an option since all of the flight attendants on the planes are using Windows Phones to take credit
 card info when you purchase something. &nbsp;I would think that MS would have Delta as its' main travel partner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that I would like to have this option is so my phone can warn me of changes to my flights the day of and give me advise as to when to leave for the airport, etc. &nbsp;I know that 8.1 with Cortana can do that but just not sure how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
                </div>

            <p>If you open Cortana then press the three lines on the three lines in the top right corner then settings you will see a tick box saying detect tracking info, such as flights, in emails on your phone. then open an email that has the flight details and the
 flight details will be underlined simply press it and Cortana will do the rest, if you say/type "is BA 738 on time" and it will show the information shown below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you press the show BA 738 updates it will keep updating the Cortana homepage with the flight updates.</p>

                    <p>I'm a seasoned Outlook client user and been able to resolve nearly all issues, but I'm stumped by this one - so can anyone help please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For nearly a year, on a new computer, I've been using Win 10, Office/Outlook 2016, IMAP for email, and am an Office 365 subscriber.&nbsp; (I changed from my old computer with Office/Outlook 2007, POP3, in Windows 7.)&nbsp; I've had this issue for some months, but
 don't recall exactly when it started.&nbsp; I've had two tech support calls with Microsoft (including with remote access) but neither techie was able to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Problem</span>: I have hundreds of organized email folders and have tried "Apply Current View to Other Email Folders" to any or all of them, but it does not work on literally 99% of them.&nbsp; I made a spreadsheet
 of which folders it works on and which not.&nbsp; It works for a few folders, but not any sub-folders, or Archive folders or other accounts.&nbsp; I see that "Reset View" or "Reset Current View" is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">always</span> greyed out, which suggests it is in default view.&nbsp; I have used the /cleanviews command line switch to reset all of them, but it does not fix it.&nbsp; Do I need some sort of privilege status to change this behaviour?&nbsp;
 I'm hoping it's something that simple!&nbsp; If it helps, it seems that the folders where it works are ones I've accessed more recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Sorry about delay in responding.&nbsp; The issue is still there.&nbsp; I had tried various things, including applying the view from the Inbox to other folders: that did not work.&nbsp; So I set a view in another folder and applied that to other folders and it worked, although
 not 100% as I'd have expected.&nbsp; The column spacing is different on folders I'd previously managed to set the views on.&nbsp; Why could I not change those ones, I'm curious?&nbsp; Also the "Apply view to subfolders" checkbox did not seem to work, so I had to check each
 one individually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to Virfranz Man, the last technician (on Feb 5 for 1.5 hours) concluded the folders were corrupted and recommended I use this forum for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I don't know why this has changed in this update, but you can still have access to the Radio by going to FM Radio in the app list which was added in 8.1 but you will need earphones for it to function but the radio can still come out of the speakers.

            <p>The radio is when you select an artist and xbox music creates a radio station around that artist, however it seems like Microsoft are changing this to be part of the xbox music pass subscription.</p>

<p>I've moved several mailboxes for this domain so far, but I have one that exceeds 40GB, and now it fails with a transient error issue. &nbsp;This is Exchange 2010 fully updated, running on Windows 2008 R2 fully updated. &nbsp;Connection to internet is 50Mbps down,
 about 10Mbps up.</p>

<h2>            Configure Outlook Without an Email Account</h2>
                    How do I remove all email configurations from Outlook 2013, so that i can only use it for calendar and contacts synced with my Windows Mobile Device (phone)? Upon initial configuration on my home laptop, I configured Outlook to connect to my work Exchange
 account. However, this setting won't allow the calendar on my phone to sync with the Outlook calendar. Same for Contacts. Now, I can't delete the configuration with the work email without first listing another account. In other words, I now want to go back
 to initial configuration and not have any email specified. How do I do that?

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Thank you Palcouk. I have learned some more since first posing my query, and I will now fill in some details about how to set up a new account without email option. The key is getting back to the starting point where excluding email is an option (the MS Outlook
 Setup wizard). Close Outlook if it is open. In Win7Pro go to Control Panel. Then, Mail &gt;&nbsp;Show Profiles button&nbsp;&gt; General tab. Add a new profile. Delete the old profile. Click on the radio button for "Always use this profile" (when starting Microsoft Outlook),
 and be sure that the new profile is selected in the drop down&nbsp;box immediately below. Now, open Outlook, and follow the Account Setup wizard selecting the option to setup without an email account, but be prepared for the warning that an email account is required
 for "full functionality" of Outlook.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Having removed the unwanted email association, I am still unable to sync my smart phone addresses, calendar and tasks with outlook. To avoid confusion, I will post this as a new question in this forum.</p>
