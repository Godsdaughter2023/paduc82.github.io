            Hi <span>jnunie,<br />
<br />
It is possible that you are receiving this error message because the parent account is not yet logged in when you try to create a child account. To resolve this, please login the parent account before creating a child account. Here are the detailed steps:<br />
<br />
<span>1. Login your account at

</span><span>2. Under
<b>Family Summary</b>, click <b>Add a new child.</b></span><span>
<br />

    <title>Desktop Icon Remains Highlighted After Closing the Program - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop Icon Remains Highlighted After Closing the Program</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have a question regarding the icons on my desktop. &nbsp;It seems that recently, when I close the program I am using, the desktop icon remains highlighted until I click somewhere else on the desktop. &nbsp;For example, if I double click
 the Internet Explorer icon, the program opens. &nbsp;If I then close the program, the icon on the desktop stays highlighted until I click somewhere else on the desktop. &nbsp;This did not always happen, and it does not happen on my other computer. &nbsp;I have already checked
 to make sure that the icons are not locked and that "Use Drop Shadows for Icon Labels" is checked. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>What you describe is normal. That's the "currently selected icon" highlight. &nbsp;If you touch your arrow keys, it will move to the next icon for example. &nbsp;It only happens if the desktop is the current active window. &nbsp;If you got done using something and clicked
 on the taskbar instead (so the taskbar is the one "with focus"), then you wouldn't see the highlight.</p>

            <p>Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;After having checked another computer running Windows XP, I saw the same desktop icon behavior. &nbsp;I find it strange, however, that both my computers running Windows 7 do not do this. &nbsp;In other words, if I click on an icon on my
 desktop and then close the program, the icon does not remain highlighted. &nbsp;Is this something that is particular to Windows XP?</p>

            I am having the same issue. My Amazon account is not synching properly to windows 8 or visa versa. I did not turn Norton on immediately, not fond of it, and that makes me think it is not Norton. There are no error messages, it just returns me to the sign
 in page. I did call amazon, it seems that the Gateway is not compatible some how? Very odd but I got rid of 2 tablets because I cannot use them with my kindle account. I will return this if I cannot get an answer. I have 2 days to get one before the return
 policy runs out...

            <p>Know this is late. I just dealt with the sign in issue today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it, I removed all of the old Kindle application from Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log into you Amazon account and pull the application from your purchased applications in your account.
</p>
<p>Download and open the file with a right click.</p>
<p>Select compatibility mode and set it to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the install and it should work now. </p>

The next version of Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703 is another release users will need to prepare for before upgrading. The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that. If you have been making attempts to upgrade without success, you probably need to check the manufacturers website for your computer model to find out if its compatible with the Creators Update or Anniversary Update or not.">Check

    <title>Low memory warnings when gaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saucedog81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Low memory warnings when gaming</h2>
                    My new laptop (MSI CX61) that I just bought a month ago has been getting low memory warnings ever since it was upgraded to windows 8.1. For every game I try to play I get a popup warning my my memory is low and that I should close the application (I have
 6GB, and often the games don't require more than 1GB - in fact my system memory usage has NEVER been above 35% even while gaming, I have monitored it carefully).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the following to stop these annoying and invasive warnings:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Upgrade all Nvidia and Intel graphical drivers to the current releases</div>
<div>- Change my native resolution to the maximum support, as well as matching that resolution in all games (my desktop resolution is 1366x768 so all games are set to run at that resolution, though lower resolutions HAVE been tried as well)</div>
<div>- Run games in windowed mode</div>
<div>- Changed the virtual memory (currently set to Initial Size 1,664mb, Maximum Size 4,076mb). Is this a correct amount?</div>
<div>- Attempted to reset my system but it would only reset back to 8.1 install (I only have an OEM install) which still has the same problem</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help! This is very annoying. Most forums online state this is an issue with Windows and how it handles the memory with devices that have duel GPU (Intel onboard graphics AND a Nvidia cards - mine is the GeForce GT 720m with 2GB DDR3 memory). However
 updating all drivers and software did nothing.</div>

            <p><span>Hi Gareth,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the Event Viewer to see what exactly is causing the issue. Try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Move the mouse to the bottom left of the screen and right-click to get see a list of options.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select <b>Event Viewer</b> and click an event log in the left pane.
</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Double-click an <b>event</b> to view the details of the event. Events are classified as error, warning, or information, depending on the severity of the event.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Which anti-virus software are you using on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run
<b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b> for any spyware or malware infection:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: The
<b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b> expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again. Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting
 the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the chipset drivers by downloading it from the system manufacturer’s website and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the Memory Diagnostic Tool to check for RAM issues:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press
<b>Windows key + W</b> on the keyboard and type "memory" without quotes.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Select the recommended option to run the tool.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Try to configure Windows 8 to manage the page file automatically:</span></p>

            Strange but my coworker has loaded 2 software packages now with a twin laptop to mine and I still cannot load this stuff. We are both running Win7 Professional. The Software is MELSOFT GX WORKS 2 for the Mitsubishi PLC, and NetEdit 3 from Automation direct.&nbsp;
 I tried different Compatibility modes and running as Administrator, no luck.

            <p>Are they both 32 bit Windows? It looks like this is a 16 bit installer and 64 bit Windows will not run 16 bit programs apart from a few well known 16 bit installers which it recognises and emulates.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded NetEdit3 V3 dated <font>11 September 2012 and started the install OK. I got to the choose location screen and then cancelled. Does the error occur later than that? I don't really want to install it.&nbsp;Running Windows 7 SP1

<p>As an added precaution on that, if you opt to cancel the auto-renew be sure to do so *before* you see the charge on your bank account as otherwise it may be too late to request a refund. (For myself it wasn't charged until 30 days after the 'billing date')
 Also be sure to have all of your account information when you call.</p>
<p>Hope everything works out!</p>

<h2>            WIndows 8.1 says it  can not connect to network drive</h2>
                    <p>But it's there after a short time after start up,and when I click on it it opens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 on an old desktop, and Windows 10TP in a partition on the WIn8.1 laptop&gt; neither of which have problems 'seeing' the network drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have suggestions as to why this only happens with the Win8.1 OS?</p>

            <p>There can be several reasons why you are not able to connect to the network drive. You can try running Network troubleshooter and see if that resolves the issue. To do this, you can follow the steps below:<br />
1.&nbsp;Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Search (or if you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search).<br />
2.&nbsp;Enter Identify and repair in the search box, and then tap or click Identify and repair network problems.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, you can perform some more troubleshooting options mentioned on the following link:<br />

            <p>OK, I'll try that AGAIN. It didn't find a problem last time I did the troubleshooter, but who knows maybe this time it will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Odd that it is only in Win8.1. Win10TP on the same machine finds it without it being a mapped drive.</p>
<p>and yes, I have tried it without it being a mapped drive.</p>

            <p>Don't mean to sound harsh, but I remember that search thing now, and why it didn't do any good.</p>
<p>All it does is open a Bing search with a bunch of garbage that has nothing to do with not being able to connect to a network drive.</p>
<p>Like this evening. First start up it connected the drive fine. Then I had to do the MS monthly updates, and after the restart I got the message bout not connecting the network drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hard wired to the router, and will try pulling that and turning wi-fi on to see if that helps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to do an update to the Qualcom network adapter, but the internet search went into 'not responding' mode. &nbsp;Hell, I CAN'T EVEN FIND DRIVERS FOR THE QUALCOM ADAPTER IN THIS MACHINE!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you posted is about the same as that stupid bing search. &nbsp;Nothing there points to my problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DO NOT HAVE PROBLEMS CONNECTING TO THE NETWORK! &nbsp;My connection to the internet is fast and so far trouble free.</p>
<p>Win8.1 HAS A PROBLEM SEEING THE NETWORK DRIVE!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I will look into 'trying' to contact MS at that link. &nbsp;They have never responded in the past.</p>
<p>And if I do, get through, I have this feeling they will want me to Refresh, Recover, and/or Reinstall or otherwise go through a bunch of hoop jumping. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as I can still click on the 'x'ed out network drive and have it open damned near immediately, I'll probably just leave things alone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If ti was consistent across machines and Windows operating systems I would be more ready to delve into it. BUT&gt;&gt; It's only Win8.1 the current MS flagship that is the problem!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some flagship! It is worse than ME was and maybe worse than plain Win8!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warranty almost up on this machine, so if I can find a 64bit WinXP it will go on this machine.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Bill,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can certainly understand your concern. This issue can be caused due to the device driver settings or antivirus on your computer. Hence please
 follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Resetting DNS (Domain Name Server):</span></strong><span> Please
 follow the steps mentioned below to reset DNS on your computer: </span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Hit on the <strong>
Windows Key</strong> on the Keyboard and type in “<strong>Command Prompt</strong>” in the search bar.</span></li><li><span>Once the Command prompt reflects in the search list right click on it and “<strong>Run as administrator</strong>”.
</span></li><li><span>Type the following commands in the command prompt:</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ipconfig /flushdns</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ipconfig /registerdns</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ipconfig /release</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ipconfig /renew</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NETSH winsock reset catalog</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NETSH int ipv4 reset reset.log</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NETSH int ipv6 reset&nbsp;reset.log</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Exit</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Restart the computer.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Disable Third party Antivirus: Please follow the steps mentioned below to disable the antivirus on your computer.
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;Locate the
<strong>antivirus icon</strong> in the <strong>system tray</strong> at the lower right corner of the desktop.
</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;<strong>Right click
</strong>on icon, and a list of options will appear in the popup menu. Select the “<strong>Disable</strong>” option to temporarily close the
<strong>virus scanner</strong>.</span></li><li><span>A message box will appear asking you to confirm that you want the antivirus to disable. Click
<strong>Yes</strong> to disable antivirus.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your antivirus is now disabled. Remember, the next time you restart your computer; the antivirus will again be activated. You can also double
 click the icon to activate it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Antivirus software can help protect your computer
 against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or
 a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Accessing network drive using run command:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows key + X</strong>, select <strong>Device manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Network adapters</strong> to expand it, locate the <strong>network adapter</strong>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Right click</span></strong><span> on the network adapter to select
<strong>properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Network Connection Properties
<strong>window</strong>, click on Driver and Select Driver Details.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Copy the location reflecting under driver details and paste it on the run command in the format: //(path) and check if the file exists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also like to know the make and model of the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Please let us know if it worked. We will be more than happy to help you.

</p><p>Before I go through all of that, this machine is a Toshiba S70-A series laptop with 4GB RAM, 2GB on board video and an nVidia 2GB video card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wireless network adapter is an Intel Wireless(R)-N760&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ethernet adapter is Qualcom AR8161 PCI-E Ethernet Controller(NDIS 6.30)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The router is a Netgear Nighthawk R-7000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My anti-virus is Windows Defender. I do not use a third party AV. Also, I DO NOT now, NOR have I had a virus or malware that has been reported by WinDefender.
</p>
<p>MS in it's infinite wisdom doesn't allow the WinDefender icon in the system tray.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>And I need to correct something from my above posts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</del></p>
<p><del>Win8.1 AND Win10TP are both on this machine in separate partitions and </del>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><del>both do not</del></em></span></strong><del> 'see the network drive' upon start. &nbsp;Somewhere above I said Win10TP didn't have the problem)</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><del>The problem is there with both wireless and Ethernet, so Again I am assuning something in Win8.1 and Win10TP.</del></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The problem only happens in Win8.1 regardless if Wireless or Ethernet connect.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Yet when I click on the red 'X' out network drive it open s right up. &nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Win8.1 and Win10TP both share the same network equipment.</p>
<p><del>(I haven't yet &nbsp;tried to remove Win10TP to see if there is a conflict).</del></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BUT&gt;&gt;&gt; My Win7 Dell desktop and my wife's Win7 Toshiba C70-A laptop AND Win10TP ON THIS MACHINE ALL connect that drive immediately. The Dell desktop is a 'mapped drive' and C70-A laptop is not) and I'm not sure if I mapped it in Win10TP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So, in my mind the network adapters are not the problem.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Maybe the DNS thing, I haven't went through that yet.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>QUESTION&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What do you mean by 'location reflecting' in your post under STEP 3?</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yeah, there area a couple of Bluetooth adapters there as well. But it won't be a problem for me to DISABLE them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do the DNS thing but it will need to be done in Win8..1 <del>and Win10TP I assume.</del></p>

</p><p>But it didn't work when I did again this evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scratching my head here trying to figure out why is says not connected, yet when I double click that drive, it opens right up, and I can do read/write/execute operations as always.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked in the Netgear router setups and information, and can't find anything there to point me to a USB network drive not connecting in one(1) operating system.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>I can certainly understand your situation. I would like to know to which device/ operating system is this USB network drive
 connected. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>Step 1: Disable Antivirus:</span></strong><span>
 You can try disabling the Firewall on the computer and check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span>
 Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as
 you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>Step 2: Remove Network Drive:</span></strong><span>
 You can try removing the Network Drive from the File Explorer. Please follow the steps mentioned below to remove the network drive:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

</li><li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Under the menu list select
<strong>File Explorer</strong>. </span><span>Click on
<strong>This PC</strong> from the left pane.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>On the top ribbon of the screen click on
<strong>Computer</strong> and under the drop down list select <strong>Map Network Drive</strong>.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Tap on
<strong>Map Network Drive</strong> and select <strong>Disconnect network drive</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The resulting window displays all networked shares your have mapped to your local computer. To remove one, select it from the list and
<strong>click or tap OK</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If you’d rather manually <strong>disconnect </strong>the mapped drives, open <strong>
File Explorer</strong> and <strong>click or tap</strong> <strong>Computer</strong> from the left pane.
<strong>Right-click or long-press</strong> the <strong>mapped</strong> drive in question and click or tap Disconnect.</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Keyboard functions keys not working - Ctrl C has moved to Alt C</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just received a new Dell Latitude E5470 and I try and use the keyboard short cut keys however they seem to have changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alt Tab to go to another window is now Ctrl Tab</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ctrl C is not Copy, Alt C is copy</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the master functions of Ctrl and Alt have changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Bern</p>

            I am getting the same thing. Update pre-downloaded&nbsp;on the&nbsp;28th,&nbsp;fails to install in Windows&nbsp;Update every time.&nbsp;If I delete&nbsp;everything&nbsp;in the software distribution folder and&nbsp;run the wuauclt.exe/updatenow in admin command prompt it retriggers the download,
 prepares it for installation, and then&nbsp;displays a screen saying Windows Insider Preview is ready to install, but I need to Check my PC first. When I click&nbsp;the&nbsp;"Check your PC" button it errors out and says there are no updates available.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2c44992-bbcc-4dd7-b222-01eac47203fe" />&nbsp;I believe it has something to do with the fact we have Windows&nbsp;Media Center. I still have not found any solution yet...we might
 just have to wait it out a while.

                    So I got a wireless mouse for my first time and it won't even install to my computer. It isn't the mouse because I tried other wireless mice and none of them work. In my device manager under other devices there are 2 USB Receivers listed both with question
 marks next to them. It says they can't find the drivers for the device. Then Under my HID I tried to update the HID-compliant device and the USB Input Device, neither could update. THis is the message I get.&nbsp; Windows encountered a problem installing the driver

            Okay I found the solution just in case anyone has the same problem.&nbsp; Apparently some update caused wireless not to work on many computers. So you go into device manager and for all of those drivers search manually. Then you search under C/windows/winsxs.
 Then the wireless mouse/keyboard should work.

    <title>How To Power Level GTA V&#8217;s Stats - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hmbn corp  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Power Level GTA V&#8217;s Stats</h2>
                    
<p>GTA V, in my opinion, is a masterpiece. I think this is the first truly great game to come out of Rockstar’s studio for a long time; it’s unprecedented in terms of depth, replayability, detail, ambition of world and storytelling. Indeed, regarding depth,
 there are a plethora of gameplay mechanics in action at any one point when the player is in game. Perhaps you’re on mission, and the mechanics in play are dialogue and driving. Perhaps you’re free roaming around San Andreas and the mechanics are the sublime
 Character Switch, and shooting, or buying clothes.</p>
<p>But no matter what you’re doing in the game, one mechanic is consistently present.
<strong>The player-character Stat system.</strong> In GTA V, as you all will know, there are &nbsp;seven stats for all three main characters; Michael, Franklin, Trevor. All three, and your multiplayer character, have these stats:&nbsp;Stamina, Shooting, Strength, Stealth,
 Flying, Driving, Lung Capacity, and Special.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not only do all three protags begin with unique levels in each stat, but&nbsp;<strong>some stats are definitely harder to level than others</strong>. Shooting for example, increases to max almost without effort as you play the story missions and
 the Strangers and Freaks side missions.&nbsp;<strong>Stamina</strong> increases quickly too, as you tend to spend your spare time sprinting everywhere- and are forced to do stamina-buffing sports as parts of side missions.</p>
<p>As I said, some stats are incredibly tough to improve, even when you’ve nearly finished the game. So here’s a “cheat sheet” (maybe “tip sheet” is more appropriate) on the best ways to max out the tougher stats in
<strong>GTAV</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer Stats</strong> seem to be a totally different ball game, I imagine skills level up by the same means, but it takes&nbsp;<em>ages</em> to do so. Can anyone confirm this in the comments?</p>
<p>The toughest stats in my opinion are:&nbsp;<strong>Stealth, Lung Capacity, Driving,&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Strength</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Easy Stats</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shooting:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As said above, basically by doing story missions and just&nbsp;<em>playing the game</em>, you will quite quickly level up your shooting skill to max. I had all three characters at, or near, max, by halfway through the story (probably 35/69 missions in). If you&nbsp;<strong>really</strong>
 want to power-level it, go to an Ammunation shooting range with the character. The target-shooting minigame is surprisingly good.</p>
<p>Only a couple of tips are needed for the Ammunation Shooting Range:</p>
<p>- Don’t do all the Pistol Challenges until you have the AP Pistol unlocked. On the 3rd Pistol challenge, you need to use the AP Pistol’s automatic fire, and walk left to right (or right to left) with the target, shooting constantly, trigger always pressed.
 That way your aim stays steady and every shot hits the target, so your combo goes up.</p>
<p>- In fact, if a challenge seems too tough in general- just quit it if you don’t have the third weapon yet. This means you’ll have to get at least Silver in challenges 1 or 2 to unlock it. Some of the challenges can only be done when you have the best weapon
 option.</p>
<p>- In&nbsp;<strong>GTA Online</strong>, I recommend finding a Survival mission, and&nbsp;<em>farming the heck out of it</em>. These unlock after level 10, I believe (anyone can keep me right in the comments section.) Shoot hundreds of dudes. Get that level up.
<strong>It took me about an hour or two of straight grinding on the Industrial Factory Survival Mission to get&nbsp;<em>half</em> a Shooting level.</strong>&nbsp;This will be a long one.</p>
<p>- Apparently also in GTA V (including Online), shooting vehicles gives you stat improvements. So standing on top of a bus, and shooting it repeatedly with your pistol, should result in your level improving pretty quick. It’ll still probably take 10-20 minutes
 to max out.</p>
<p><strong>Flying:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Do the flying school to about Tutorial 7 or so, and you should be maxed, or nearly maxed out, on your flying skill. Peasy.</p>
<p>For GTA Online? I don’t have a technique yet. I imagine there will be a good Flying Race you could do to power level it. I haven’t found much use for Flying in GTAO, as even at level 0 or 1, flying is easy to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Special:</strong></p>
<p>Special stats improve by using the special ability.</p>
<p>- Do Trevor’s Rampage missions. Beat people up. Be crazy. (Be Trevor.)</p>
<p>- Race as Franklin, this’ll force you to use that driving special ability repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Tough Stats</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:&nbsp;</strong>Corey Matchitt has provided a great tip in the comments:</p>
<p>- He says that &nbsp;if you use a car to get on top of a bus (while it’s still being driven)</p>
<p>- You can repeatedly press the right trigger (R2 on PS3 or Rt on X360) to stomp on it</p>
<p>- This counts as an attack, and the bus won’t be damaged. It won’t eventually explode (unlike a car).</p>
<p>- Using this method&nbsp;<strong>you can power-level Strength in 12 minutes.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>- But watch out for cops, as you’ll probably gain a star for damaging property. However, you won’t fall off because buses are long and heavy and standable. Unlike a car, you won’t fall off when they move. Just keep on stomping.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:&nbsp;</strong>- I have personally found it best to:</p>
<p>- go to the Western freeway and get on top of the large (though not juggernaut-sized) trucks that travel there in early morning/ later evening. They’re the haulage trucks which are slightly bigger than Armoured Vans.</p>
<p>- These trucks begin to flip out and drive really fast when you start stomping on them, so even if you get a star, the cops tend to have trouble keeping up (they’ll get out their cars to pursue you as if you’re on foot).</p>
<p>- On top of that, you can vault onto these trucks via the front cabin-&nbsp;<strong>you don’t need a car like to get on top of the bus</strong>.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<strong>The user Ty</strong> suggests also beginning a private game with a friend, and doing above to&nbsp;<strong>any vehicle, or even better,&nbsp;</strong>your friend’s personal one. Cops won’t come to get you, and you can do it until
 you max out the stat.</p>
<p><strong>Original post:&nbsp;</strong>One of the most frustrating stats. There are only two good ways I’ve seen to do this:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Punch people</strong>. <strong>A lot.&nbsp;</strong>If you get in fights&nbsp;<em>constantly</em>- that is, every time you see a couple of dudes on the street while you happen to be walking by them,
<strong>fight them-&nbsp;</strong>you will level up the stat quite quickly. However, it also gets very tiring quickly, and what’s worse is you’ll end up getting&nbsp;<strong>1 star</strong> constantly as people nearby call your actions in. Apparently your stat goes up
 1% for every twenty punches or something. Christ. But it’s the best way- just&nbsp;<strong>get in fights all the time.&nbsp;</strong>I’ve seen quite a bit increase in Trevor’s Strength stat after punching almost everyone I see for about five hours of Singleplayer gameplay.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Play golf.</strong> Other sports seem to increase Strength, but the only one which made any noticeable mark on the stat’s bar seemed to be golf. Even then it was marginal.</p>
<p>- In&nbsp;<strong>GTA Online</strong>, I’m pretty sure getting a friend and grinding Strength at an Armwrestle, or playing a sport, or just punching folk will do the trick. I haven’t researched time improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Stealth:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: t<strong>he_bst_666&nbsp;</strong>provides an&nbsp;<strong>incredible</strong> tip:
</strong></p>
<p><strong>- get your character up a mountain, enter stealth mode, then walk down the mountain</strong>.</p>
<p>- Gravity will make your character walk down faster, almost at a run when it’s a steep part (watch you don’t fall.)&nbsp;<strong>Stealth levels up by “distance walked” not “time spent sneaking”</strong>, so this gets your&nbsp;<strong>Stealth</strong>
 level up to max in no time!</p>
<p>- The user<strong>&nbsp;Ty&nbsp;</strong>recommends using a rubber band to push your thumbstick forward while your character’s in a safe place, like the beach or a long stretch of country side. This definitely works.</p>
<p><strong>Original post:&nbsp;</strong>Stealth improves the more you walk around in Sneak Mode, and the more guys (who can’t see you) you knock out by pressing B or Circle while behind them. A really great tip I saw for stealth is this:</p>
<p>- Go to a theatre</p>
<p>- Put on a movie</p>
<p>- Put on Sneak Mode, and creep around while the movie plays.</p>
<p>This way you’re entertained, AND you get to powerlevel Stealth! It’ll probably still take some hour or so to powerlevel it to 100%.</p>
<p>For GTA Online? I have no idea. Stealth doesn’t even seem particularly useful (although I have a suspicion you don’t shot up on people’s minimaps in Deathmatch when you sneak).</p>
<p><strong>Driving:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong>The user&nbsp;<strong>Ty</strong>&nbsp;has a great tip for levelling up&nbsp;<strong>Driving&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>GTA Online</strong>:</p>
<p>- go to the airport, and host the race there (the figure of eight around the airport runways.)</p>
<p>- Choose&nbsp;<strong>Motorcycles</strong> for the race.</p>
<p>- You apparently zip around the track setting a track speed of around 46 seconds</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Ty</strong> says that after 25 laps he had <strong>
maxed out his&nbsp;Driving stat,&nbsp;</strong>going from level 1.5 to max, level 5.</p>
<p><strong>Original post:&nbsp;</strong>I found a&nbsp;<strong>really</strong> good hack for levelling this up.</p>
<p>This isn’t official, but the stat seems to improve&nbsp;<strong>the more near-misses you have</strong>. I haven’t heard any official line on this- it’s meant to only improve by driving itself and doing stunt jumps- but it’s the same mechanic by which&nbsp;<strong>Franklin’s
 special</strong> ability levels up. Get near misses and drive into oncoming traffic. Considering that Michael’s&nbsp;<strong>Special</strong> also levels up exactly the same as&nbsp;<strong>Shooting</strong>, I wouldn’t find this too surprising.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<strong>I very easily power-levelled Trevor’s Driving skill by doing this. It took me perhaps ten or twenty minutes to get him from Level 2 to Level 4, and it wasn’t boring:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>- Wait until it’s after 8pm, that’s 2000 in-game.</span></p>
<p><em>- </em>Get a motorbike</p>
<p>- Go to the Olympus Freeway (the big, dual-carriaged road on Los Santos’ North-Eastern side, which runs straight North-East out of the city.)</p>
<p>- Ride into oncoming traffic while it is exremely busy at this time.</p>
<p>- Sit in between the two lanes, weaving between the heavy traffic on either side, and drive straight until you hit countryside, then turn and come back in (still on the wrong side of the road).</p>
<p><strong>Trevor’s Driving stat&nbsp;</strong>is notoriously hard to increase- and nobody knows why. But using this method, I honestly increased it incredibly fast. I experienced the best traffic in-game around 2100, but there may be a better time (or several better
 times).</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, I don’t know if this works for GTA Online</strong>. Driving, like all of the Online stats, seems to increase&nbsp;<em>so slowly</em>. I’m almost at Level 3 after TONS of driving. I reckon stealing cars and getting them to Mod Shops will
 be a good way of power-levelling driving, as it keeps you on the move. Or getting a bounty and going on the run.</p>
<p><strong>Lung Capacity</strong>:</p>
<p>Lung capacity is the absolute worst. I wish it was just incorporated into&nbsp;<strong>Stamina&nbsp;</strong>(which could have been made twice as hard to improve anyway).</p>
<p>Basically, to improve lung capacity, all you can do is swim. Underwater. Which you can only do for about ten or fifteen seconds, at a stretch, to begin with. Even with&nbsp;<strong>Lung Capcity</strong>&nbsp;<strong>fully upgraded, you still only get perhaps a minute
 of underwater breathing</strong>. Which isn’t very realistic (some people IRL can be underwater for several minutes), and also makes the game less fun. Bummer. They misjudged this one, I think.</p>
<p>- Seeing as the only way to improve lung capacity is to swim underwater, I timed how long it takes you to gain a level. For me to get from&nbsp;<strong>Level 3</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>Level 4</strong>, it took me about twelve, maybe fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>- To get from&nbsp;<strong>Level 4</strong> to <strong>Level&nbsp;5,</strong> it took me about ten minutes also, give or take a minute. It seemed shorter. But that may have been because I accidentally swam into the Navy’s base and got four stars (all of these skills
 are easier to power-level when you’re running away from cops. An incentive!).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;So, to get <strong>Swimming</strong> all the way up, I’d say it’ll probably take near enough an hour. &nbsp;<strong>For each of your characters, you’re probably looking at an hour and a half, straight, dull (and kinda dangerous) underwater swimming.&nbsp;</strong>At
 least forty minutes, from the general starting value of Level 1.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>- The way I levelled up</strong>, was simply swimming from the East coast of San Andreas, all the way down to the city. I would swim underwater until my “air bar” was flashing, then I surfaced for a stroke or two, and immediately dove back underneath.
 Doing that constantly, it took about twenty five minutes, and got me most of the way to Los Santos. Then I simply swam about until I reached max level.</p>
<p><strong>The only way to improve Lung Capacity is to put the time in.&nbsp;</strong>If you intersperse it for each of your characters your looking at a&nbsp;<em>pretty big chunk of game time</em>.&nbsp;<strong>Yoga</strong> also increases
<strong>Lung Capacity-&nbsp;</strong>but not by much.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;<strong>GTA Online</strong>, again, I don’t know how much longer this will take. You might be looking at 4x more time grinding underwater.</p>
<p><strong>Roundup</strong></p>
<p>So I hope these tips have been useful! I’m very grateful that Rockstar revived the Skill Stat system from San Andreas in GTAV, and it’s definitely improved here. If it weren’t for total *** skills like&nbsp;<strong>Stealth</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Lung
 Capacity</strong>. Still, it’s a good system. And I hope my cheat sheet has helped in any way!</p>
<p>If you know better than me on any of these, or have any of your own tips, let&nbsp;me know in the comments!</p>

<p>(My online advice)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You can get <strong>stamina/shooting/stealth/driving</strong> all maxed easily without going out of your way for them.</span> Just play the game and do missions etc. As you drive/kill/run around they'll max out fast
 without you needing to pay any attention. For <strong>stealth</strong>, just click in your left stick any time your aiming at enemies and strafe around as you shoot them. For
<strong>flying</strong>, if you for some reason can't just wait for it to naturally go up as you fly around in the game, I imagine getting a helicopter and rubberbanding the sticks and right trigger is your best bet.
<strong>strength</strong> seems to be the trick where you beat up a vehicle someone's in.
<strong>Lung capacity</strong> I think you just need to grind since there's not much of a reason to be swimming underwater yet, and there's no trick I'm aware of to speed up the process.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The complex in-depth guides aren't necessary for getting stats up, it's pretty simple. For the most part, just play the game.</p>

<p>Another great and much easier way to build lung capacity for each character is to go scuba diving. This is only available after having done the maryweather mission and purchasing the sonar property with micheal. It is much more fun if you wait until after
 micheal does the mission to collect submarine parts in the dingy but can be acomplished from the sub as well. The character must first enter either of the two vessels and upon exiting will be wearing scuba gear. As you swim with the gear on lung capacity does
 go up. I didn't time it though. Be careful not to walk to far onto land though as they will drop the gear.

<p>For online: Shooting, stamina, and driving will come as you play the game. Stealth I found not as difficult as others. I would walk outside my house and stealth kill AI. I never found that any length of time walking would make a difference. I guess if you
 wanna do it the cheap way then use a rubber band (lame). Once you kill two run back into your house and wait out the cops then repeat. I found it to be most enjoyable. Breath was a bit harder just go for a nice swim in the ocean. Maybe 10 minutes a day for
 like 3 or 4 days. Flying will come as you play missions. Higher level Ron missions have the most flying missions. Although there is nothing quite like joy flying around a public server. Strength cannot be done with beating a regular car. They patched it. I
 found stealth and strength to go hand in hand if you dont use the walking/rubber band way for stealth. As you stealth kill an AI you gain strength. I do play a lot of golf although I never noticed if it makes a difference. There is the always fun run somebody
 over on foot and hope they pick a fight with you then clean the floor with them. It works on guys. Never girls unless your in Sandy Shores those chicks are hardcore. They still get their a*s beat. LOL. There is no 7th special move for online mode. This is
 how I maxed them all out. Advice: stop listening to what others say and go out there and play the game. Your skills will come faster then you think. You just gotta put some time in.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Flight Simulator X Installation Error&#58; 1628 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 Flight Simulator X Installation Error&#58; 1628</h2>
                    Hi, I installed Flight Simulator X Gold Edition once on Windows 8. But when I installed Acceleration, something went wrong with the installation. So, I un-installed Flight Simulator X and restarted my PC. When I tried again, Install Shield started to load
 but when it said: Preparing to Install, it just froze and then displayed the error: 1628 Failed To Complete Installation. I tried contacting support but their Phone Lines are down. (I called 3 times). I ran through all the things I could find on the support
 website and the internet. Everything I tried failed. Even the Fix-It solution I found said that the&nbsp;particular&nbsp;fix-it wasn't made for my OS. I have no idea what to do next. Please help guys, this thing is getting really frustrating. Thanks in advance.

            <p>Can you use System Restore to get back to the point where you are about to install "Acceleration"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to repair the operating system and how to restore the operating system configuration to an earlier point in time in Windows Vista (or 7)<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can achieve the above, try right-clicking on the actual Setup.exe for "Acceleration"&nbsp;&nbsp;and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This EXAMPLE (ONLY) might or might not work for you with your program it uses the built-in Administrator account to perform the install?</p>
<p>"It seems that the "Run as administrator" command only gives you some administrative privileges, and they're not enough to install Java (and OpenOffice, by association). In order to get around this, you need to actually log into the built-in administrator.
 Open a command prompt with admin rights by clicking start, typing cmd into the search/run box, and hitting CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER. At the prompt, type:</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:yes</p>
<p>Then log out of your regular account and back in as the built-in administrator, where you might be able to install the program. When you're done, log back into your regular account and, for security purposes, disable the built-in administrator account using:</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:no "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There does seem to be a problem with your program and Windows 8.</p>

<h2>            Hyper-V Manager opens Microsoft Management Console - Can&#39;t use VMs</h2>
                    <p>Running an activate version of Windows 10 Pro 64 bit (v1709 build: 16299.309)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks ago I tried to run a VM on Hyper-V which previously worked fine. I clicked start, type Hyper-V Manager, right click and choose run as Administrator (as I typically do). It then opens Microsoft Management Console which is not what I want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the shortcut target it's pointing to: %windir%\System32\mmc.exe which doesn't seem right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried turning off and turning back on Hyper-V using Windows Features on/off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've confirmed Hyper-V Host Compute service is Running and&nbsp;Hyper-V Virtual Machine Management is running (which they are).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run vmconnect.ext as admin it shows the VMs and tries to start them but I get errors about a virtual port. I can't fix that because I can't get into Hyper-v manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been trying to get this to work for weeks and about to scrap it for VirtualBox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
