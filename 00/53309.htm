<h2>            Service Pack for Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know when the first Service Pack for Windows 10 will be ready? I hesitate to attempt another upgrade from 8.1 because the last one was a disaster. Hoping the SP will fix the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            There will be no service packs for Windows 10 as in the past with previous versions.&nbsp; Instead, there will be periodic upgrades that will include new features and improvements of existing ones.&nbsp; The first is due in November.

            <p>The problem with Upgrades is corruption or factory bloatware choking or passing issues, which can be avoided if you&nbsp;

Create Windows 10 Installation Media</a> then run the Upgrade media from desktop, choose to Save Nothing, while turning off everything at Startup and uninstalling the anti-virus in the old OS.&nbsp; Everyone who's tried this has had no problems.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If you activated the Upgrade already, at any time you can do a superior <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">

<h2>            Icons not displaying properly on task bar</h2>
                    <p>I have a new computer (Microsoft Surface with Windows 8.1) and have only downloaded Adobe software on top of what the computer came with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer has already crashed once (it froze and restarted itself) and after recovery, the icons of Windows apps do not appear on the task bar. A square appears and I can click it and it will take me to the open app however the square is blank with no
 icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that the box is ticked next to the "Show Windows Store Apps on the Taskbar" option through the control panel but to no avail. I have also run a sfc/scannow command but this did not find any integrity violation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts as to how to fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Then you are not using Windows RT (subject of this forum) but Windows Pro.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I think Iconcache is the keyword you need to find a fix.&nbsp; The solution described should actually work on Windows RT too.&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

            <p>Glad u worked it out now so that you only reinstall the mail and calendar app...</p>
<p>apparently, on the day that I had the problem, you could not uninstall, and then reinstall just the Calendar app...</p>
<p>that same day, I asked the online MS tech help.. he tried his best but at the end, even did a remote operation of my laptop... nothing worked.. eventually, I had to restore my laptop to factory settings, then reinstall everything.. &nbsp;wasted 5 hours that morning..
 Not Fun. &nbsp;</p>

            This was worthless. Troubleshooter does not find a thing but cannot remove or even reinstall mail or calendar apps both of which lost my accounts for NO apparent reason.

<h2>            FPS on Surface Pro 4 Camera</h2>
                    I'm looking for the frame rates on a SP4's cameras. I don't see the specs listed anywhere. I'm sure this is an easy question to answer. I coach girls's softball and a fast capture rate is critical to catching the release phase of my pitchers. My iPhone
 6 plus captures video at 240fps while my iPad mini 2 is at 60fps. I own a SP4 and would like to use it for video and real-time playback. &nbsp;It would be nice to replace the iPhone as my go-to device considering is screen size for playback. Thanks. &nbsp;

<p>Hi Leon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there are two types of format, FAT32 and NTFS, make sure that all of the files have the same format or else it will not work and will give you an error like the one you have encountered. To help you resolve your issue, we suggest formatting the chosen
 files to NTFS first then try to back it up again and see if the same error will still occur.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 100MB Fat32 should not be a problem... It is normally a "EFI" partition that is the location of the Boot Files on a UEFI machine... Or the partition is Initialized as GPT...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Unallocated 128MB Partition indicates that the drive, at least at one time, was in fact Initialized as a GPT drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machines Image the 100MB FAT32 without a problem, so there is something else happening...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you upgrade from Win 7 to 10, or do a clean install, or maybe both somewhere along the way ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... Is it possible that the error message is referring to the drive that your image is supposed to go to... Flash Drives won't work, for instance...</p>

                    <p>
Hi,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I have Adrenalin 18.9.1 installed and I use the Powercolour Vega 64. I play Forza Horizon 3 on Windows. Before Adrenalin comes out, I can not add the game Forza Horizon 3 in the program and in the Adrenalin I can not too.</p>
<p>
If I add the .exe file of the game, windows say I have no authorization.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What can I do? I need different profiles for the games... other games such CS GO or GTA V works fine.
</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue may have been caused by corrupted system files, or due to a software conflict.<br />
<br />
Let's perform a clean boot to check if the issue is caused by a software conflict. A
<strong>clean boot</strong> will help eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program, update, or when you run a program in Windows 10. For instructions, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After the troubleshooting, boot your computer in normal mode by checking the same link and look for the
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> section of the article.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, you can consider creating a new user account. This is for us to check if the issue due to a corrupted user profile. For instructions, refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />

    <title>Compatibility windows 7 and Adobe Acrobat 7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertneufeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compatibility windows 7 and Adobe Acrobat 7.</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use Adobe acrobat 7 on my widows 7 computer. When installing I get "warning 20225.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"&nbsp;Adobe Acrobat 7.0 was unable to create a new item.: Adobe PDF Port Printer. The Adobe PDF printer may be unavailable".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a compatibility issue. Is there anything I can do about it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result is I cannot open web based PDF's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also my scanner a Fujitsu Siemens Scan Snap S500 does not seem to work with this computer. Is this a related problem? There doesn't seem to be a driver upgrade for the scanner available for Windows 7.</p>

<p>Hello, my TV screen goes black after the Xbox one start up and does nothing I've gone through troubleshooting steps I've changed television's,HDMI's I've even cleaned my Xbox also I've checked on YouTube and nothing seems to work&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the system isn't starting up at all and you've tried all the power up issue trouble shooting,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/tv-or-monitor-screen-is-blank-while-connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../tv-or-monitor-screen-is-blank-while-connected</a>,</p>
<p>then you may have a corrupted OS and may need to restore the system back to factory defaults. &nbsp;Give all the above trouble shooting a shot and if none of that works then we can go with the Nuclear Option and restore the system. &nbsp;To do the restore just follow
 the steps here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool</a>, and when you get to step 2 just pick the file for the Restore Factory Defaults.</p>
<p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>I'd give the restore option a shot, it's really not that hard if you have a thumb drive and access to a computer. &nbsp;And honestly it beats waiting to either get a new one or get your repaired and sent back, but it's your call.</p>

<p>@bigbenx88 Thank you. Unfortunately I had to resort to the restore option (Nuclear) but it got my box working again and save me from having to ship I off for repairs. Fortunately thanks to my external drive and the xbox cloud restoration was not too difficult.
 Thanks again</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a screenshot of the resulting dialog then post in a reply here.</p>

<p><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see KMS in the dialog that pops up, then it means you are running a non-genuine Windows 10 license.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whoever installed it, might have installed a volume license (organization key) on your computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise volume license clients are used by large organizations that deploy Windows 10 in bulk to hundreds or thousands of computers. Sometimes, users will copy these organization keys off the Internet and use them to install Windows 10
 Pro/Enterprise, but they are blocked from activating because it can't reach THE appropriate KMS host (Server computer) which handles the activation request.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would need to purchase a genuine license for Windows 10 Pro from the Microsoft Store. If you can't afford Pro, you can purchase Home, make a bootable copy then perform a custom install.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/cat/categoryID.70036700?=en_US_Store_UH_software_Win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/cat/categoryID.70036700?=en_US_Store_UH_software_Win</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system was never licensed for Windows Pro or Enterprise editions, but it originally had a genuine license, such as the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 Starter</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Basic</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>Windows 8.0 Core (also known as Windows 8 Home) </p>
<p>Windows 8.1 Core (also known as Windows 8 Home) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you can perform a custom install of Windows 10 Home to correct the problem with your activation status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will mean backing up your files:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to reinstall your applications:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card</p>
<p>https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD or USB, you should see this option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the indicater, everything should be ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Install now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait while Setup starts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accept the license terms and click Next</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Custom</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the Primary Partition then click Next</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait while Windows installs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart and reboot into setup again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of Box Experience</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows will check if there is an active Internet connection. If it does not find one, you will be presented with the following screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a Local Account and click Next</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait while Windows finalizes your settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continue to wait while Windows installs modern applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When setup is complete you can retrieve any personal files from the Windows.old</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browse to C:\ Local Disk and open the Windows.old folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don’t want to do any of the following, your only easy option out of this is to purchase a full genuine license for Windows 10 Pro if thats what you ended up installing. It will activate it so you can preserve your configuration.

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Surface Pro &#40;2017&#41; Type Cover brightness keys not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So recently, I'm unable to adjust my brightness settings completely using my type cover (I was able to in the past). Hitting F1/F2 on my type cover would only change the brightness settings of my laptop to 30% or 50% only. If I want to use a different brightness
 setting, I would have to open the battery tab. Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

<p>Nevermind, I solved my issue by reinstalling the type cover driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For others who might have the same issue, here are the steps I took to fix it:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Search 'Device Manager' in start menu.</p>
<p>2. Expand 'Keyboards' tab and right-click on 'Surface Type Cover Filter Device'.</p>
<p>3. Click 'Uninstall Device' -&gt; 'Uninstall'.</p>
<p>4. Restart your Surface Pro (2017).</p>
<p>5. The device should be automatically reinstalled upon restart (you must be connected to the internet) and keyboard functions should work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

<h2>            C drive &#40;Windows 10&#41; shows low disk space after 1803 update</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After about 20&nbsp;failed attempts&nbsp;with Windows Update and hours of running diagnostic software, I used the Windows Update assistant to create an update disk and after a few more hours of fine tuning I&nbsp;finally got it to install. I thought it would be clear
 sailing from here until I opened Windows Explorer and saw my C drive highlighted in red with 11 GB of free space left out of 185 GB.
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>"WHAT THE F***"!!!! </strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now I run chkdsk, Disk Clean-up and a few other utilities trying to figure out what happened. I went to open Internet Explorer to search online, but guess what.
 Internet Explorer is not responding except for the "Try Microsoft Edge" pop-up. Well, after a few more hours I get IE working but still can't find what happened to all my free space. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated&nbsp; (except RESET)
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for listening&nbsp;</span></p>

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<h2>            Skype Sounds &#38; History</h2>
                    <p>I just updated to the newest Skype and exported all my history. Will I have to keep doing this every year or so since Cloud only saves it for 2 years?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed a feature that seems to be missing that I liked, I had it set up so that the sounds for messages would go off every time someone messaged. I don't typically have my speakers up that high so sometimes the sound can be drowned out by the videos
 I am watching. That feature helped me notice messages if I was zoned out cuz it would keep pinging me. Is it going to be re-added or am I just honestly not seeing it?

            Que. Will I have to keep doing this every year or so since Cloud only saves it for 2 years?
<br />Ans. Export is one way and as a best practice, you should do it. Since, you also store this on your device, hence you need not do it. You should do it as a backup strategy. The device stored conversations will not be deleted after 2 years.
<br />
<br />Que. Missing Feature
<br />Ans. May I request a small help from you? These forum posts are not read by Microsoft engineers. This feedback should go to Microsoft engineers for them to consider this. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback

            The conversation history on the classic Skype will not be carried over to the new Skype, you can only view the recent messages in the new Skype. This means that the old conversation history is saved in the classic Skype's folder specifically in the main.db.
<br />
<br />As long as this file is still saved on your device, you should still be able to recover the old messages. Install the classic Skype and sign in to your account, make sure that you're accessing the correct account and check if you will be able to access the old messages.
<br />
<br />As for other features and functionality that you are not seeing in the new Skype.
<br />
<br />File a bug report so the engineers are aware of the problem.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This message usually indicates that the boot sector is damaged or missing. The boot sector is a region of your hard disk that contains information that is used to load your operating system. If a boot failure is detected when your PC is starting, you
 may receive this error message. </span></p>

<h2>            Wireless Icon, Networks, and Drivers have disappeared after Windows 10 critical update</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo desktop, and after a critical update nearly two weeks ago, my access to my wireless network disappeared. It's as though it doesn't exist. My wifi works fine for all of the other devices in my house (laptop, tablet, phones), but it's just
 gone on my desktop. I did a system restore, a system refresh, updated my computer from the Lenovo site, updated again from the MS site...I've done A MEEEEELION different things. No success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see a wireless driver (realtek) is installed in the programs, but it does not show up under network adapters. Only the ethernet driver shows up there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under network and sharing, my only option is ethernet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm using a wired connection for now, but I'd REALLY like my wifi back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Bonnie</p>

            It would be best to contact Lenovo support regarding this concern for us to isolate the issue if it's a software or hardware related. This is to check as well with them on why the issue is still persistent after you've installed and tried new adapters
 to fix it. <br />

<p>my Precision pro in general works fine in Win7.&nbsp; However, originally part of the selling point of the device was that it had software with profiles that you could make for specific programs, much like Saitek devices.&nbsp; Now in XP that was removed but I could
 permanently map the buttons in the window joystick configuration, not as handy, but perfectly functional.&nbsp; But now, in Windows 7, I cannot assign keypresses to the buttons.</p>
<p>Is there anyway of doing that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, it is INCREDIBLY sensative, can this be adjusted?&nbsp; Basically when I move it out of the deadzone and you feel it starting to move its at full speed turning.&nbsp; Feels like the difference between trying to slowly apply breaks for a stoplight, and getting
 a 2 foot ABS panic stop.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per my research, I found that the Microsoft SideWinder Precision pro II USB game controller is not compatible with Windows 7. Check the following Microsoft article for the
 compatibility details.</p>

Slowness usually indicates that your computer is busy performing some type of operation. There are many reasons this might happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many programs are running (even programs your computer&nbsp;<a href="http://cmdrkeene.com/ask-a-geek-bloated-computers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ask a Geek:  Bloated Computers">came with</a>)</li><li>An intensive program (like a virus scanner) is busy scanning your computer</li><li>Your system is busy working on updates</li><li>Your system is processing backups or performing other maintenance</li><li>Your computer is busy indexing your files for the instant-search system</li><li>A virus has infected your computer</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
If you have an up-to-date virus scanner and are reasonably sure you haven’t downloaded any suspicious programs, then it’s probably not a virus. That’s just one of the many possibilities for slow performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Side note: If you don’t have an up-to-date virus scanner (such as you had one, but it is expired and needs a payment), let me suggest that you remove the outdated one and install the free<a href="http://microsoft.com/security_essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Security Essentials</a>&nbsp;(Windows XP, Vista, and 7 only) instead. It is free and never requires a subscription to keep you protected.</li><li>Windows 8&nbsp;forward has this protection built-in (named “Defender”), but it won’t work if you have something else installed. So if your non-Microsoft antivirus is outdated or your subscription is expired and you don’t
 want to renew it, you need to remove it to allow the built-in Defender to take over that job instead.</li></ul>
<div style="text-align: center; color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/cmdrkeene.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/defender.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi2.wp.com%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f07%2fdefender.png%3fresize%3d610%252C429" height="423" width="602" /></a>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">
Windows Defender on Windows 8 onward includes antivirus protection. Earlier versions have to get a separate product, such as the free MSE.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
If you’re sure it’s not a virus, I would first restart your computer to see if the issue continues. If it does, here’s some steps you can try.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Turn off auto-start programs<br />
</strong>Over time as you install programs, some of them will add entries to your Startup and auto-run themselves when you turn on your computer. This means less working memory is available for the programs you are intentionally using. Here’s how to turn off
 the automatic startup programs:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows XP, Vista, and 7: Type&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi2.wp.com%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin7.jpg%3fw%3d610" height="16" width="17" />+R
 to show the Run box, type msconfig and click OK. On the Startup tab, uncheck any programs you don’t need auto-running all the time.</li><li>Windows 8/8.1: Press Ctrl-Shift-Escape, then disable anything on the Startup tab that is listed as “high impact”. And even if it’s not high-impact, consider disabling everything on that tab that you don’t really really
 want to launch itself every boot-up.</li></ul>
<p>You can use these programs anytime you want, all this does is stops them from running by themselves.&nbsp; While your at this, turn off or extra browser plugins and toolbars.</p>
<p>

<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">
Find and disable startup apps from Task Manager or MSCONFIG. Right click column headings to add details for finding an app’s origin.</p>
</li><li><strong>Let the system catch up<br />
</strong>As mentioned at the top of this page, your computer might simply be busy. After you install the upgrade, many background services, cleanup processes, as well as services that provide caching (such as SuperFetch) are still in the process of running,
 initializing, and building the caches. Most of this is paused if you are using the computer. Leave the computer on overnight one night would not be a bad idea.</li><li><strong>Find out what’s really causing the slowness<br />
</strong>If the problem still continues, here’s how to find out what’s actually hogging all your computer’s performance.PressCtrl-Shift-Escape, then look through the Processes tab to find any program using a lot of CPU % or Disk %.Thiswillidentify which program
 is busy. It could be a program you recognize (like Google Drive or Drop Box syncing a lot of files), and you can try exiting that program to see if performance improves. If it’s a program you don’t recognize, you can search the web to find out more about what
 it is, and why it’s making your computer run slowly.

<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">
Unless an app is busy (calculating, printing, or playing media, etc.), its&nbsp;load on the CPU should be close to zero. Even with all these programs running, my CPU is only 8% busy.</p>
<p>If you suspect or find that the Indexing system is a culprit,&nbsp;search for and run the built-in Search Troubleshooter, which will repair the indexing services.&nbsp; Don’t worry about memory usage unless it’s consistently
 85% or greater under light use.</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
These tips are about diagnosing ongoing slowness, but there are more tips you can take to keep your PC is top shape. Leaving your power settings&nbsp;on the “balanced” setting and&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-readyboost-on-off-storage-device#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">using
 a flash drive to speed up your computer</a>&nbsp;are two great steps to take. While defragmenting and cleaning up old files was a manual chore on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 onward all take care of this automatically in the background each week.&nbsp; Also
 remember that slowness is never a result of too many programs installed or too many files and pictures. Unless the program is running or the file is open, just being stored on the computer doesn’t affect performance. Freeing up disk space by deleting programs
 and other files won’t improve performance (but you should still back up your files on other drives).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
Above all else: do not use “registry cleaner” or “pc optimizer” programs. At best these will just slow down your computer more. In fact, many of these are scam programs, sometimes referred to as ransomware — because they always say you have a problem that they
 can fix for a price. Don’t fall victim to these scams and extra programs (which will only slow your computer down further). Use the tools and knowledge above to fix the root problem.</p>

<p>Hi tigerscc1,<br />
<br />
I will need some more information to assist you better.<br />
a)&nbsp;Do you come across the same problem while playing games other than Diablo and Hellfire?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you run the game in different compatibility mode and check if you come across the same problem. (For example: Windows 98 or Windows 2000)</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a><br />
<br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to update the Display driver and check if you come across the same problem.<br />
<br />
Steps to update the Display adapter driver:<br />
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.<br />
ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expand Display adapter and right click on the sub item and click update driver.<br />
