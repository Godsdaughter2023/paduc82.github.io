<h2>            Access Switchboard</h2>
                    <p>I have set up a switchboard on my access DB. Initiallly this all worked fine. However, I noticed that the selected fields, with the exeption of the first link in each page, disappeared. This fault occured when I attempted to amend the design of the S/Board(I
 think)! I cannot find out why this has happend?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Switchboards rely on some pretty complex code in the background and a table named SwitcfhboardItems (if I remember the name right). If you want to add anything over 8 items you have to alter the code and manually add the item to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to look into creating your own "switchboard" form where you can add buttons to open other forms. Either way it will take some amount of effort other than relying on the wizard.</p>

<p>Did you use the Switchboard Manager to create your Switchboard? What edits did you make?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Switchboard Mgr since 2007 is different from the one prior to that. The newer one uses a Continuous form where the older one was limited to 8 items per page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without knowing what changes you made its hard to assist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can try is to rename the Switchboard Items table and the Switchboard form. Then use the Switchboard Mgr to create a new one with only one option. From there you can copy all the records from the renamed table to the newly created one. That should
 get your Switchboard back.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t insert link into cell in Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kejones4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t insert link into cell in Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a very simple spreadsheet for my own use. I want to type some text into a cell and then add a hyperlink--imagine "text text text - [hyperlink]". Pretty basic right?&nbsp; But it won't let me do it! Maybe because I've typed and then deleted
 within the cell, almost all of my options as shown in all the tabs of the toolbar are grayed out, including the options for creating a hyperlink. If I go to another cell, they suddenly light up. If I then click on that original cell, they stay lit up...until
 I start typing, which makes them gray out again. On top of that, the text I type comes in looking like a hyperlink, though it doesn't connect with anything. (I have at least tried to make this work I'm sure there are some formatting codes left behind in the
 cell, but I don't see an easy way to get rid of them.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read several places that this may be related to workbook or file sharing, which I don't think I clicked but who knows. So I tried to turn off sharing. I followed the instructions Microsoft gave to a T, unhiding buttons and putting them in my but still
 was left without the necessary tabs and buttons that let me turn it off...if it's on in the first place. Meanwhile, even when my toolbar is lit up and active, there's a tab that says "Unshare workbooks" in the "Review" section...but it's grayed out. Of course,
 this could be because sharing was never turned on in the first place, but that's the straw I was grabbing at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi kejones4, though the options are grayed out, check to see if you can you insert a hyperlink in that cell using the Hyperlink formula?
<br />
<br />=HYPERLINK(Location,"Text")
<br />
<br />for example:
<br />
<br />=HYPERLINK(A2,"Jump to A2")
<br />
<br />=HYPERLINK(A2,A3)
<br />
<br />=HYPERLINK("https://www.google.ie","Google";)

            Actually it makes sense. Excel is looking for HTTPS, HTTP, WWW to identify web links. When you put someint in front of that, with a space, it is no longer a recognizeable hyperlink. 
<br />
<br />The problem is Excel's automation is too "smart". I even tried pasting an already formatted hyperlink and excel defeated it.
<br />
<br />The only workaround I can see is to put the text and hyperlink in separate cells. When I used concatenate() to join the text to hyperlinked cells, the hyperlink is no longer active in the concatentation.  
<br />
<br />Excel is just "too smart" for us ...

            Do following -
<br />
<br />Option 1. Put your text in the Cell
<br />Press Enter
<br />Select the cell again where you put the value (Click it once not twice)
<br />Press CTRL+K
<br />Give the link here and OK
<br />
<br />Option 2. Put following formula
<br />=HYPERLINK("http://www.microsoft.com","Whatever text you want to put")
<br />
<br />Here, I am linking to microsoft.com
<br />
<br />If you are looking to link to a cell
<br />
<br />=HYPERLINK("#Sheet2!B2","Budget")   # Means within the same file

            When you select the letter, you are selecting only the document body. The document into which you paste has its own header. To paste the letterhead and watermark, you will need to access the header pane and copy the header (to which the watermark is anchored),
 then paste that into the other document.

            You can do them in either order. But if you're inserting the entire letter in a new document, why not, as Doug suggests, just save a copy of the document?

</blockquote>
<p>A document contains several independent 'layers', in effect like a pile of transparencies which when stacked produce the finished document. The header is in a different layer from the body text of the document, so you cannot copy them together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Doug and Suzanne have suggested you could create a copy of the document, or you could use the document as a template to create a new document. Otherwise you will have to copy the elements separately.</p>

<h2>            Conditional formatting for cells with the same value in two sheets</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to use conditional formatting to highlight a cell that I type a value that already exists in a range cells in sheet1 and a range of cells in sheet 2. Here is the&nbsp; full scenario:</p>
<p>in sheet 1 there is a range of cells B1:B360 used for customers names.</p>
<p>in sheet 2 there is a different range of cells B1:B486 for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Well, when I insert a cell in between of either B1:B360 or B1:B486 range and type e.g. "George", I want that cell highlighted if "George" already exists in any of the ranges.</p>
<p>Please note that both ranges have empty cells that I don't want highlighted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Microsoft endeavors to help those who participate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello Sam and Mike. I was talking to y'all the other day about your security issues which have turned into my security issues now and I wanted to thank you</p>
<p>for the upbeat response I got from you guys. If you remember, we were talking about fake Microsoft certificates and hackers using your ever growing technology</p>
<p>to hack other Microsoft users? ? ?&nbsp; I contacted google and you people yesterday through your site links with an unsupported computer that was hacked to death</p>
<p>and I was sorry I hadn't gotten back to you as you had requested, but I was having a dilemna; my VERY hacked computer was giving me trouble along with the people who have hacked it, and I was seriously beginning to worry for my safety! Anyway, I did receive
 your packet through Google along with numerous other items from drivers store to PPS APPS: ( THEY are some efficient boys over there. ) There was so much stuff in that download I seriously though I would have to open my desktop to get any of it out! Anyway,
 I was battling with hackers and lost before I could retrieve all of the information that you sent or any of the other requests, i.e. driver for this PIXMA printer, PPS APPS from Google for same to get more funtionality, and downloads to re-establish my hacked
 and stolen I-Tunes</p>
<p>account and extensive library. I did read some of your stuff and was quite interested; I have had such a hard last three months trying to get hacker out of my computer. I have paid y'all for 1 yr. of tech service, i have paid Dell for 1 yr. of tech service
 and I have spent many hours at computer and dealing with techs from both companies. I AM STILL HACKED! I had a Dell technician last night who couldn't even get on remote service do a "quick assisted restore", because every time he opened a connection box the
 hackers would disrupt the connection: after this he said that my computer was clean and not to worry about it! I replied that I did not think he could state that since hackers were why he couldn't get a remote connection and he said he just knew! I gave that
 up and asked him if he knew the Factory specs. for my dual disk-dual processing PC and the correct terms and setting for them in Net-Bios and Boot Sequence and such as half of that stuff has been changed and renamed or disabled and I need to get that back
 in line so I could then wipe and de-frag disk and then put my disk format back the way it was. He said that he thought I didn't need that and that he couldn't and wouldn't give me any assistance with that.. . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the really coincidental thing that happened; my computer fragged out shortly after hanging up with Dell and I ended up doing a system re-installation for the 10th time with just a legitimate Window Vista Upgrade Assistant to Windows 7 back when
 I first upgraded. It had absorbed enough of 7 to actually function as an operating system after a couple of tries back and forth when I did the legitimate upgrade. That is probably the 10th system re-install I have done in the past three months. HERE is the
 KICKER; When I logged on with this system after getting it cleaned up and completely disconnected from the hackers, I logged on and went to system to rename and saw that you thought I was on same legit WIN 7 Ultimate you last reactivated. NIRVANA for me. Then
 I was testing some XP files the hackers had used and Y'all sent me an interactive trouble shooting device and wondered if I could try and load an up date and run one of those programs&nbsp; to see if they would run better after installing the update, I was tripped
 out and I had alot of things going but I tried to assidt YOU in your stuff. I really wanted to help, but the program they were running XP was a malware tool left on this machine by one of YOUR techs and it was just the free version. It wasn't going to run
 until activated (PAID for)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It just really tripped me out that I had you guys on a three or four hour old hodge podge system wanting me to assist you in an experiment; and I was amazed at your device that would lash a tounge with questions out in response to what I picked on
 question card to initiate ineraction! However, sadly however, that is when things just went sonic! When I loaded your update as you requested, I noticed that your update asisster had not loaded 7 Intel processor and chipset driver updates, so I loaded them
 as well. I couldn't tell you that the XP program wasn't legit enough to test ( I did try ) because when it loaded the processor and your updates (You had sent a message once saying my Realtek Adapter needed updating) All those updates in this mutant system
 started turning on functions that had been off for months like the PCI bridge and the controller arms and data storage controller, as well as taking a just barely enabled drive that could just store data and turning it back into one processing data. I just
 couldn't keep up. BUT, I have to say that I was overwhelmed at the coincidence of all of it. I got the Credential you sent and I think a Key , but I couldn't get them safely stored and the hackers turned my credentials into saying:
</p>
<p>Name: Microsoft IC3FBI-Spy MIDDLE: Rectum Last: Never say die til he explodes; along with some other disparaging things. I appreciate your efforts and hope to talk to you soon. I have learned so much from this, at some cost, but it got me to thinking: I
 am medically disabled at 56 and I have not kept up with the technnology as well as my 24 yr. old son, but Right Now, I bet I could give as good or better tech service than 90 % of the techs I have dealt with and I most certainly could do it for people my age
 in a much more sensitive and helpful way. You said you had a big vision and it's results were: " Nirvana!" Keep me in mind; maybe I could help expand this vision into my age sector and enlighten folks as I hope I have enlightened you. IT IS YOUR PRODUCTS,
 THE WHOLE WIDE REALM OF THEM THAT I HAD TO FIGURE OUT TO UNLOCK WHY HACKERS, were talking to me on my screen and Techs were saying that there was nothing wrong. Your technology ( with replicated certificates ) allows this hacker to basically take ownership
 of my computer and people ( technicians and family) were telling me nothing was wrong even when I show it to them. YOUr products are so functional that they can be turned against you without most people ever being the wiser.. If I can be of service concerning
 this or any of what I have written; you have my phone # on the credential you sent me and on the service accout currnetly opened for 11 more months. It wasn't fun, it wasn't boring, and it wasn't for non-problem solvers, but I came through enlightened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, thank you for your interaction. I hope we will interact more. I am at your disposal...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke A. Vradeburg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's enough to find my acct.</p>

<p>That is correct</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the corrupt PDF files, if you send those by manually attaching the files - do they still get received as corrupted files - simply trying to isolate whether this is an Outlook issue or being caused by the program generating the email with the attachment.
 Unfortunately, given that this involves '2003 - really doesn't matter where the problem is coming from.</p>

            Thank you for your answer. It is somewhat like I expected. I believe that it is possible that the accounting program is the main problem. Office Outlook will, I believe, &nbsp;send the file if I send the PDF to the desktop and attach it from there. I do like
 the Live Mail but my program for some reason does not recognize that it is MAPI compliant although what I have found it is claimed to be so.

<p>You must use the same extension if you rename the file<br />
It is not possible to only change the extension.</p>
<p>You can hide known extensions if you want.<br />
It is easier then to rename the file without having a problem with the extension</p>
<p>1: Open Windows Explorer<br />
2: Win XP : Click on Tools&gt;Folder Options<br />
3: Vista : Click on Organize&gt;Folder and Search Options<br />
4: On the View tab uncheck “Hide extensions for known file types"<br />

<p>There are times when you may want to change and extension, for example some firewalls won't allow exe, dll, xlsm files through for obvious security reasons.&nbsp; Sometimes renaming the file with a different extension will get it past the firewall.&nbsp; Of course
 the user on the other side should change the extension back to the correct one.</p>
<p>If as is more likely in your case you are change the extension of a xls file to xlsm or xlsx, that is not a good idea.&nbsp; The file structures of 2003 and earlier versions of Excel (xls) is completely different than 2007 file structures.&nbsp; You may get away with
 it but its not a good idea.&nbsp; If you want to change the file type from 2003 to 2007 open the file in 2007 and do a Save As and pick either xlsx or xlsm.&nbsp; If you are trying to change an xlsx or xlsm file to a&nbsp; xls file, changing the extention is not going to
 do what you want.&nbsp; Again, you should open the file in 2007 and Save As a 2003 (xls) file type.</p>

            Hi,<br />
You could create a separate Contacts folder and move the contacts you don't want to sync there.&nbsp; Then you sync them with the original Contacts folder.<br />
<br />
The message you are referring to is the option to merge or delete the contacts stored on your device with your PC.&nbsp; This is normal<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The manufacturer appears to be <a href="http://www.dvrviewer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dvrviewer.com</a>.&nbsp; The website appears to be unaccessible right now, but that might be temporary.<br />
<br />
You can see the content of the CAB file by opening it with an unzipper, then see what's inside and look for references in the registry. But if the add-on is installed, it should be visible in Tools, Internet Options, Programs<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<p>Yay - got the answer from a previous posting - thanks!</p>
<p><br />
As you've already found out, you can't remove the battery on the E7 unless a NCP does it for you. What you can do is to turn it off by pressing the powerbutton for about 8 seconds untill you feel 3 quick buzzes. Then you can release the powerbutton and press
 it once more to turn it on (as normal - one buzz only). As Nokia has said, this is pretty much the same to the E7 as pulling out the battery of another phone.<br />
<br />
The hard reset button wise isn't recommended as it wipes the phone for ovi store which I don't know yet if can be installed again without going to a Nokia care point. From a few other posts regarding the N8 it seemed like it was fixed with that phone, but I
 can't tell you if it's fixed for the E7 yet. Maybe someone else can? You are better off doing the soft reset as carman has already mentioned in his post above.<br />

    <title>VBA code to append text with formatting into a Word table cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sfcsfcsfc  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA code to append text with formatting into a Word table cell</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Word table with cells that contain multiple paragraphs into which I need to append text with its formatting. Basically I'd need a line of VBA code that once the cell is selected, goes to the end of the last paragraph into the cell and appends to
 it the text+formatting that I have already copied into the clipboard. I just do not know how to perform the append (concatenating text string is not an option, as formatting would be lost in the process).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>The aim of my reply is to understand what you are doing in order to provide the best method of achieving the end result. It was not even clear where the formatted text was coming from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to add to a selected cell then you need to set a range at the end of the cell and insert the formatted text in the range. The following covers two methods with annotations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Option Explicit<br />
<br />
Sub Macro1()<br />
Dim oCell As Range<br />
Dim oRng As Range&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'required with the second option<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oCell = Selection.Cells(1).Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oCell.End = oCell.End - 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Lose the end of cell character<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oCell.Collapse 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'collapse the range to its end<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oCell.Text = vbCr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'optionally add a paragraph break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oCell.Collapse 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'collapse the range to its end again<br />
Option1:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'add the formatted text e.g.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'oCell.Paste 'Paste from the clipboard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'OR<br />
Option2:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oRng = ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Cell(2, 1).Range 'The range to be copied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oRng.End = oRng.End - 1 'It's a cell so remove the cell end character<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oCell.FormattedText = oRng.FormattedText 'duplicate the formatted text<br />

<h2>            Invisible mode</h2>
                    Hi<br />
Am from Egypt and I have been unable to receive or make calls via Skype for the last 3 days.<br />
It always shows that am invisible and whenever I try to change it to available it turns back &nbsp;automatically to invisible.&nbsp;<br />
I uninstalled the application and restored it twice but nothing has changed.&nbsp;<br />
Am using Skype on wifi and using android mobile&nbsp;<br />
Any clue what is wrong?&nbsp;

<p>Hi JM,</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Compatibility View Settings, check "Include updated website lists from Microsoft"</p>
<p>should fix it...</p>
<p>If you are still getting the error after the above fix... go to</p>
<p><a href="http://enhanceie.com/ua.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://enhanceie.com/ua.aspx</a> and follow the instructions on that page to detect and correct your browser's userAgent string (sorry for the technical jargon.... but there is no other way to explain it).</p>
<p>Alternatively return to nhl.com and this time when you get the error message, click the 'Copy' button on the error message dialog and paste into a return post on this thread....</p>
<p>If you don't get an error message popup, but only a 'triangle' on the IE Status bar, double click it (the triangle icon on the status bar) to display the error message popup and then copy and paste it back to us.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

Copy the error and post it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It probably means there is a coding error there.</p>

<p>Hi JM,</p>
<p>Both sites work fine for me on all Windows versions. No coding errors on the pages....</p>
<p>I also tried disabling Flash, but this did not produce the same error message. The only possible cause in your case is an IE Addon.</p>
<p>Do you have IE(7)Pro Installed?</p>
<p>Test by running IE in no-Addons Mode and navigating to the above sites.</p>
<p>Start&gt;(All) Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System Tools&gt;Internet Explorer (no Addons).</p>
<p>The error messages tells us that something is blocking some of the pages contents (streaming Flash videos). This could possible be IE7Pro's Ad blocking, IE8's InPrivate Filtering or your Firewall.</p>
<p>Toggle IE8's InPrivate Filtering from Tools&gt;InPrivate Filtering</p>
<p>If installed there are settings in IE7Pro to toggle Ad blocking. (not currently installed on my machine... )</p>
<p>Some Anti-virus programs have options to block all scripts.....</p>
<p>Woops..... another cause could be your security zone settings in IE... go</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Internet Options - Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default"</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p><br />
Should we infer&nbsp;that you are doing something non-standard&nbsp;to enter the sites?&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. trying to enter by a "backdoor" or otherwise evade seeing the advertising that pays for the content could easily explain your symptom IMO.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when you see the error symptom
 do you also see the Cookie blocker icon in the Status bar?&nbsp; If so, doubleclick on it to see which&nbsp;of the site's advertisers you are avoiding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you will just have to be more open to the site's advertising, e.g. either viewing it the designed order or
 not filtering it when it comes?</p>
<p>FWIW I can watch the video from the home page by clicking on it there but before it shows there is a 13 second clip of advertising and other ads also to be seen there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The expected clip is shown cleanly even though my browser is apparently blocking cookies
 from&nbsp; core.insightexpressai.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p><br />
Good luck<br />

<p>Robert,</p>
<p>I have not delibertly tried to watch the clips via "backdoor" intentionally.&nbsp; I can watch the clips on the home page at nhl.com but when I go to the "video" tab for game highlights, I just get in bottom left corner the yellow triangle caution symbol and
 the error comscore is undefined.&nbsp; Nothing on the toolbar pops up saying something is being blocked.&nbsp; Just the yellow triangle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried most of the things you mentioned.</p>
<p>-Pop Blocker is on (turned off and nothing changed)</p>
<p>-Manage add-ons (Adobe Flash is enabled)</p>
<p>-I have Kaspersky Intenet Security 2010 and it notifies me if something being blocked but nothing popping up</p>
<p>-Reset default securtiy zones.</p>
<p>I still cant figure out what I need to fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got the same error message in WinXP SP3 IE7 trying to watch the news videos on Reuters.com.&nbsp; I went to NHL.com as you and could not watch their videos either.&nbsp; The clue was videos didn't work in Google Chrome or Opera either.&nbsp; Here is the solution:</p>
<p>You have altered your HOSTS file to exclude or block&nbsp;COMSCORE an ad counting service.</p>
<ol>
<li>Close Internet Explorer </li><li>Place DNS Services in 'manual' mode and stop it. (run - start - 'services.msc')</li><li>Find your 'hosts' file and either restore to default or edit to stop blocking Comscore.</li><li>Start DNS services again. </li><li>Open Internet Explorer and try NHL.com again. </li></ol>
<p>Those are the rough steps but for a more detailed document go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm</a></p>
<p>You see many on the 'net tried to solve this problem assuming it was a Java problem.&nbsp; That's a false lead.&nbsp; The beginning of all webcontent goes through the DNS Java or not.&nbsp; I altered my hosts file because I wanted to filter all the ____ that's out there
 and view pages more quickly.&nbsp; Ad services are wising up to more sophisticated users blocking their stuff so they just don't allow you to view videos w/o also viewing their ads and/or tracking your movements.&nbsp; Nyah small price to pay to watch hockey right?</p>

    <title>missing audio when playing back of notes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            missing audio when playing back of notes</h2>
                    
<p>After an hour and a half lecture being recorded in OneNote using the audio feature and typing of related notes, the audio is blank when it is replayed. The counter, show playback, and file size all appear normal as if the audio file recorded properly.</p>
<p>The original recording / notes were done on a Windows 7 machine using OneNote 2010. Both OS and OneNote are fully up to date. This is the first time for this problem out of many many pages of notes in the past working perfectly!</p>
<p>I have saved the audio file outside of OneNote and but the same problem occurs. I have also opened the OneNote page in question on both a Vista machine and an XP machine via notebook syncing with no luck.</p>
<p>Another posting suggested playing with the audio settings, specifically changing to a 'stereo setting' which did not work for me.</p>
<p>I am at a loss and any help would be appreciated..... Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Ben, </p>
<p>I have also had this issue of recoding "nothing".&nbsp; After fiddleing around a bit I have discovered that something is muting the inbed microphone, so every time I use OneNote to record a lecture or meeting I have to ensure that it is not muted.&nbsp; I have since
 unchecked the "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device" option, but that has only reduced the number of times the microphone is muted from time to time.&nbsp; It has not prevented it from occuring.&nbsp; So not whe question is how do I prevent the
 microphone from being randomly muted?&nbsp; what are the common reasons/solutions? </p>
<p>*Both of my&nbsp;Laptops, Dell and Toshiba, are running windows 7 (Dell: Ultimate; Toshiba: Home Premium) &nbsp;64 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For those reading this&nbsp;other than Ben</strong>,</p>
<p><u>to Check if the microphone is muted</u>:</p>
<ol>
<li>right click the speaker icon in the bottom right of the screen</li><li>right click 'recording devices'</li><li>right click the icon of the microphone you intend to use</li><li>select 'properties'</li><li>select the 'levels' tab</li><li>click on the speaker icon to toggle mute on or off.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>To uncheck the "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device" option</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Follow steps 1 - 4 from above</li><li>select the 'advanced' tab</li><li>uncheck the box for the "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device" option</li></ol>

<p>A possible solution was found..... If you are using a USB microphone, you need to start OneNote BEFORE you plug in the microphone.</p>
<p>Apparently when OneNote starts it takes the audio settings in effect as of when it launches and if you plug in a USB microphone after launching OneNote it isn't detected by OneNote as an audio input source even though Windows may say it is so.</p>
<p>When the first recording in OneNote is blank and the second one works it is because OneNote also refreshes the audio settings when you create a new page.</p>
<p>The moral here is to launch OneNote first and then plug in your USB microphone and THEN create your new page to 'house' the recording on.</p>
<p>Seems like standard line in microphones are automatically recognized but USB devices aren't.</p>
<p>Either way, test - test - test and test again and then pray because the only sure fire solution is to wait until the recording is finished and listen back to it.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to have an audio meter or something to indicate that OneNote was actually registering sound?</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Repeating Table of Contents title on each page</h2>
                    Is there a way to repeat "Table of Contents" at the top of each page of a TOC that is multiple pages long?

            <p>I'll assume for starters that you've inserted the TOC by clicking the Automatic Table 2 thumbnail on the Table of Contents button. In that case, the words "Table of Contents" are formatted with a style named TOC Heading. Then:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't already have a section break between the TOC and the start of the document body, insert one.</li><li>On the first page of the document body (the second section), open the header pane so the Header &amp; Footer Tools tab appears on the ribbon. Click the Link to Previous button in the ribbon to turn it off.</li><li>Go to the first page of the TOC and open its header pane.</li><li>Check the box for "Different first page".</li><li>On the same ribbon tab, click the Next button in the Navigation group to go to the header on the second page.</li><li>If there is already text in this header, edit it or remove it as needed. Then press Ctrl+F9 to insert a pair of field braces. Between them, type
<strong>StyleRef "TOC Heading"</strong> and then press F9. This field will repeat the "Table of Contents" wording on every page of the TOC (except the first).</li><li>Click the Next button again to go to the first page header of the next section. Verify that it's the correct header for that part of the document.</li></ul>
<p>If the heading on the Table of Contents has some style other than TOC Heading, put its name in the StyleRef field instead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to resolve this issue, you will have to first un-install the Spanish version of Office 365 from you iPad and then download and install Office 365 again in the English language from App Store. To install
 Office 365 for iPad you will have to login to the App Store and download and install each app individually. Check

<h2>            How to make pasted text from one Word document to another automatically merge formatting&#63; &#40;&#34;Set Default Paste&#34; does NOT do it&#41;</h2>
                    I do scanning and OCR of documents which are then pasted into a larger existing Word 2010 document. Each time I paste I see the merge option spplet at the end of the pasted text and have to click it and choose "merge formatting" to get the new material
 to match the rest. I have tried the "Default Paste Options page to make this happen automatically. However no setting of those options has made it work. I still have to go through the applet each time I paste. Anyone who can share a way to make this process
 automatic would be much appreciated.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I am afraid that I may not have made my problem clear enough because the reply seems to not fit the question.</p>
<p>Let me describe the scenario. I have scanned documents (such as pages from books) in PDF format. I use the Nuance OCR application to convert the scanned page into a Word document which opens in a separate Word window and is a text file
 titled “OCR0001.txt”. I then “select all” (CTRL A), copy (CTRL C). I then move the focus to the existing Word .docx file I am building. I do a paste operation (CTRL V) and the text file appears in the .docx document looking just like the text file I copied
 it from. At the end of it there is the paste applet which I have to click on to open the choices. I select “Merge Formatting”. The newly pasted text is now the same format as the rest of the contents of the .docx document. I save, then do the same thing with
 another scanned page. Each time I paste, the original pasted material retains its .txt characteristics until and unless I click the paste applet and select “Merge Formatting.” What I am asking is this: is it possible to apply a setting which would immediately
 and without the use of the paste applet merge the format to the existing .docx text? If so how, and where is this setting to be made? Also I do not see the relevance of any registry subkeys to this issue. Also, I do not use “paste special”, because it has
 no choices which are useful or relevant to what I am trying to do.</p>
<p>If this is clear enough, I hope you can suggest a fix.</p>
<p>Thanks, APS</p>

            To Nyrana S M:<br />
Thank you for trying to help. <br />
Actually, there is a quicker way to reach the cut and paste options you recommend, and that is by way of the applet that appears when a paste operation is done. And of course I went there as my first act after noticing the "default paste options" link. Sadly,
 as I made clear in my question and its followup reply, despite making the changes that "promised" to do what I am trying to do, the settings there make no difference at all in the behavior of the paste operation. I still get the&nbsp; .txt format in the pasted
 text and am obliged to open the applet and select "merge formatting" to get the format to convert. For some reason, the so-called default formatting options do not do what they seem to promise to do. You were right in referring to them, but my copy of Word
 (or perhaps the type of text I am pasting) does not respond to checking "merge formatting" as the default in all paste scenarios. But thanks for trying.<br />
