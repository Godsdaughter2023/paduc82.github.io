<h2>            XCOPY &#47;d problem</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My code is as follows:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">XCOPY c:\sourcedirectory\*.* "C:\users\my documents" /d</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is supposed to copy only the newer files from "sourcedirectory" to "my documents".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The result is that it copies all the files. &nbsp;It does this repeatedly, every time I run the script. &nbsp;This did not happen in Windows XP, but it does in Windows 7. &nbsp;The specs for XCOPY in Windows 7 say that this
 should not be happening. &nbsp;Both systems get their time setting from the internet, and the times are exactly the same as far as I can measure. &nbsp;Both systems are on daylight savings time.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What gives?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think I mentioned before that the folder name "My Documents" is a junction point that exists for legacy applications only. You must use the correct name, "Users".</p>

<h2>            If you could play one Original Xbox game online again, what would it be&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Please, just pick one game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, it would have to be 25 to Life. I miss that game so much. I remember I rented it from Gamefly with my Gamepass because I heard the LAPD and Hillary Clinton were trying to get it banned. I kept it in my possession for over a year and nothing happened.
 I eventually bought it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My biggest regret was selling all of my Original Xbox games and my system. I should have kept them all and taken them with me during the move but I figured I would never play an Original Xbox game online again since the Xbox 360 was released. How wrong I
 was. I started purchasing all the Original Xbox games again but they were hard to find because the nearest Gamestop was an hour away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The games I used to possess on Original Xbox were:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>25 to Life</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Finest Hour</p>
<p>Counter-Strike</p>
<p>Halo 2</p>
<p>JSRF (Jet Set Radio Future)/Sega GT 2002</p>
<p>Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</p>
<p>Rainbow Six 3</p>
<p>Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow</p>
<p>Soldier of Fortune 2: Double Helix</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I played these games online for 6 hours a night!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The reason for the error code
<b>0x8024400A</b>is when there<b> </b>is temporary connection problems while installing the update. I suggest you to follow the instructions related to Windows XP at the article below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Temporary connection-related errors may occur when you use Windows Update or Microsoft Update</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836941</a></span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Zaki,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to give me this tip. I think this machine has already been attacked, even though I got McAfee running soon after we restored the OS.</p>
<p>Also, I have two PCs connected to my modem and try the update again.&nbsp; I was given this machine but it hadn't been used for (years?) It came to me with XP SP 1.&nbsp; I managed to get it to SP2 and load needed software.&nbsp; But this is an HP machine, and it came
 with a bunch of software I do not recognize, such as "Install Shield".&nbsp; Their webpage is so old it does not refer to the service packs of XP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the executable given as an answer to another poster in this string, and got the following errors:&nbsp; maybe they tell you somehing?&nbsp;Here are the missing .dll's&nbsp; Everything else ran as expected. &nbsp;Thank you again,</p>
<p>Joanne</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From file named "update.bat" given as an answer to another questioner in this thread.:</p>
<p>mshtml.dll was loaded, but the DLLRegisterServer entry point was not found.&nbsp; This file can not be registered.&nbsp;

            <p>The answer to this problem is somewhere in this thread. It is a command that executed when I clicked the link and I was able to get to W update.&nbsp; I got so many updates that this huge hard drive only has 5%.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to find the answer that works for XP SP2 that cannot get to WUpdate and post it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But can someone tell me how to, or if I can clean all those updates?&nbsp; There is also a rootkit on my machine that wasn't there when I was running SP2.&nbsp; I probably should have left it there... Most of my hard drive was clean and I had no trouble with malware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em>&nbsp;diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When (approx. date) were you given this used computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When (exact date, preferably) did you "restore the OS?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. How long has the computer been connected to the internet since you "restored the OS?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did you&nbsp;"restore the OS" by doing a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install</a>&nbsp;of WinXP&nbsp;or&nbsp;did you do&nbsp;a clean install of WinXP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. WinXP SP3 is <em>not</em> installed, is that correct?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 factory reset error &#34;Something Went Wrong&#34; after selecting Language, Keyboard and Language.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have done a reset on my Surface 4.&nbsp; After I am prompted for the language (English), Cortana says that we just need to configure a few more things like wifi and passwords.&nbsp; It then asks me if Singapore is my region (I say no and change it to Germany). Then
 I selct the appropriate keyboard.&nbsp; Then Cortana tells me "Something Went Wrong, but you can try again".&nbsp; No matter how many times I try, or what keyboard, language and region combinations I try, I get to the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do next?</p>

</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>This is not a troubleshooting step, however, it helps to isolate any underlying causes which might be triggering the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Boot the computer in safe mode with networking, and&nbsp;check if the issue still persist.&nbsp;Once this is done, reboot the computer in normal mode and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Safe Mode With Networking:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not occur in Safe mode, try to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party application/software to be causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A <strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.</span></span></p>

            <p>Sorry for late reply.<br />
<br />
I went for the "SAFE MODE FOR NETWORKING'.<br />
<br />
There when i tried to set up cortana she asked me for the location. There were 2 buttons.<br />
One was 'No thanks' and another one was 'Allow'. When i tapped on the second one, nothing happened.</p>
<p>I tapped on 'Allow' several times but nothing happened as usua;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also some apps were not running like 'Microsoft Edge' and 'Alarms and Clock'.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cafd5603-2e70-4249-b9e0-95dd0170732d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cafd5603-2e70-4249-b9e0-95dd0170732d" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/668b70df-9b5e-45b4-b13c-237f49817785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/668b70df-9b5e-45b4-b13c-237f49817785" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After all this, I went for Clean Boot. But nothing happened. Same error was coming which i posted previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My date and time all are set correct.</p>
<p>Both the troubleshooters were telling to set up Microsoft account for syncing. But I couldn't due to the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there will be a way to figure out this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping for the BEST</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted and we appreciate the time and effort you have put in to resolve the issue. Let me assist you further from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to the built-in administrator enabled on your PC instead of the normal administrator/local user account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A built in administrator account is used only for troubleshooting purposes and you won’t be able to update to Windows 8.1 from a built-in administrator account. I suggest you to first change the other account into an Administrator account and then
 remove the built-in administrator account. Log into the built-in administrator account and follow these steps;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press Windows key + X, select control panel.</span></p>

<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now, select user accounts and click on ‘manage other accounts’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now click on the other user account apart from the built-in user account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on ‘change account type’ and change the other account into an Administrator account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now, restart the computer and log into the new administrator account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However, if you do not have a separate user account, I suggest you to create another administrator user account by referring to the Microsoft&nbsp;article here:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Set

<p>I have other Windows Store apps that I don't mind being on C:, but my C: drive is an SSD, and I want to put Killer Instinct on my larger storage drives.</p>
<p>Is it possible to install only this game on D:?</p>

<p>If not, is this game going to be available on another platform like Steam that allows installing to other drives?</p>

    <title>Windows Store Setup forces Microsoft Account Login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> regrh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Store Setup forces Microsoft Account Login</h2>
                    <p>When setting up windows, like many long time windows users and computer enthusiasts I choose to make a local account. &nbsp;I did this knowingly and deliberately. &nbsp;However when I wanted to download a free app I had to register for a Microsoft Account. &nbsp;I understand
 that is how the store works and that is fine but I was absolutely livid to find out after the setup that adding a Microsoft Account makes this your only login option until you change it back. &nbsp;I had not even verified the account and it barged in on my computer
 taking over and changing policies and essentially locking me out due to a bad password entry during setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a heated argument with the support tech who helped switch me back to the local account sign in but we could not see eye to eye on what happened. &nbsp;I am mad because my already specified, established and authoritative login credentials were disregarded
 and replaced with Microsoft's preference. &nbsp;I made deliberate choices when setting up my computer and consider any alteration of those settings a major and intrusive change. &nbsp;I do not consider the words "add this Microsoft Account to my computer" to imply in
 any way shape or form a removal of my local account as the authoritative login method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my PC and I expect my access to it to be complete and unrestricted. &nbsp;I do not appreciate how pushy Microsoft is being with this subject. &nbsp;When you buy an android phone and sign in with a google account, does it force you to log in to this account
 before accessing the phone? &nbsp;NO. &nbsp;If you so choose you can set a pin but at no point is the online account forced as the only method of accessing and administrating the device. &nbsp;This is ridiculous and needs to be fixed. &nbsp;NEVER hide my local profile under an
 optional Microsoft account ESPECIALLY without informing me you are about to do so.</p>

<h2>            ASUS UL30Vt-A1 Ultrabook PC</h2>
                    <p>I just recently got a used ASUS UL30Vt-A1 Ultrabook PC and I was wondering that if I upgraded this notebook to Windows 10 will I have any problems? This was a very high end back in 2010 but just wanted to know if it will have any issues with upgrading to
 Windows 10 since it has Windows 7 Home it should work. I know now that Windows 10 is stable and updated compared to when it first came out so will Windows 10 detect all drivers and install them right? if anyone has this notebook let me know if they had problems
 after updating to Windows 10 Home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you</p>

    <title>A lot of issues getting online on Halo Reach - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> efrainfernandez  say:</h3>
<h2>            A lot of issues getting online on Halo Reach</h2>
                    <p>First of All do not tell me: "This is Microsoft Forum, go to the Xbox forum" because that's&nbsp;what I did, I get to the Xbox&nbsp;website but it sends me right here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Halo Reach had a beautiful online back on Xbox&nbsp;360, but it gets full of issues in Xbox&nbsp;one, and is not a new problem, it has at least 1 year. First, when I start the game it can be a random&nbsp;try that says "Disconnected from Xbox&nbsp;live" so 1 day it does not
 say anything and another day it says "disconnected", even though I can see that I am online on the Xbox&nbsp;one menu, the disconnected status does not disappear in the game until I stop the game and start it again. Another issue is that I am connected to Xbox&nbsp;live
 in the game but when I select "matchmaking" it takes up to 3 minutes to get the info from the halo reach server or sometimes also says loading and it takes the same amount of time until I can see my rank, progress, and the possibility&nbsp;of starting a match of
 matchmaking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue is that 50% of the times I lose the connection with the other players while voting for the map before the match, the game says "network difficulties" and then all the other Gamertags&nbsp;disappear on the right, I have no option to leave until the
 match starts and it quickly says "game over".</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Problems getting Teredo IP address" what is that? when finally I get into one match and I start to get too much lag and disconnection with other players, I go to the network settings of Xbox one and test the multiplayer connection and NAT type, then it
 says that: "Problems getting Teredo IP address".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really love that game, I have play&nbsp;halo reach from 2010 until&nbsp;today, on Xbox&nbsp;360 I had an internet connection of 3mbs and just having lag sometimes, Now on Xbox one I have 10mbs and a lot of lag, and connectivity issues. I really want to keep playing online,
 please help me.</p>

<p>Hey there efrain, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into these problems. Now is this the only game that this is happening to? I would advise going to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Test Network Connection</a> to see if there is any error messages that you can go Troubleshoot. If there is no error messages there
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/multiplayer-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Test Multiplayer Connection</a> and do the same. </p>
<p>Give it a shot and let us know if there is any changes. </p>

<p>Hi Efrain,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you able to run the network troubleshooting tests that was suggest by XBF Erick? If you haven't done so I recommend doing that and let us know your results. From your original post you mentioned you saw there was a problem retrieving a teredo&nbsp;IP address

<h2>            Changes to Text size gettings restored after reboot</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Text size issue</p>
<p>I have tried to increase the text size (Win10)&nbsp;for all aspects of Windows (task bar, icon, message area, etc.) and after reboot, the settings are gone and I have to redo, log out, and log in and the settings only stay while I'm logged on.&nbsp; Have tried another
 account, changing dpi, and still the settings won't remain - gone upon reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this problem with Win10?</p>

 it for years....</p>

<h2>            The start up menu in windows 10 keeps popping up every few second</h2>
                    When I sign in and try to do anything whether it be search the internet, look at email, play a game etc. the start up menu pops up about every 3 or 4 seconds.&nbsp; I checked the keys to see if something was sticking but it isn't.&nbsp; Thought it might be a virus
 so took it to a computer place to have it checked but still getting the pop up screen.&nbsp; Also the pointer automatically moves when you are typing. &nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What exactly happens when you try to play YouTube videos?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are seeing issues with playing online videos, it might be due to Internet Connections also. I would suggest you to check if you have any other issues with performance in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A high percentage means that the programs or processes that are running require a lot of CPU resources, which can slow your computer. If the percentage appears frozen at or near 100%, then a program

            <p>Have the exact same problem on my Dell A860 laptop. Windows correctly reports the max CPU speed at 1.8GHz but limits it to 0.9GHz with total CPU activity maxing out at 50% (CONSISTENTLY).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried forcing maximum performance mode, and disabling SpeedStep in the BIOS; still have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, temps stay at around 50 degrees C as I recently cleaned out the fan &amp; heatsink and applied new paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem did not exist in windows 7 when it was running on this laptop this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is barely usable.</p>
<p>

            <p>It's not because of internet connection, since the downloaded mark is already far beyond playing position. Beside, I also try to run two instance of microcontroller simulator to make cpu busy and it's also stuck at half speed. The simulator is always try
 to eat all of the rest of cpu time, so when it run at normal system, cpu load will become 100%. But here, cpu is still stuck at no more than 49%.</p>

            <p>Hi OP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Came across this thread and it seems to have solved my problem for now.</p>
<span>
<p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/b95d3e0e-4d86-458b-a719-a02c0b22677f/windows-8-is-throttling-my-cpu-pentium-4?forum=w8itproperf</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;"</p>
<p>Finally I compared the bootlogs of safe vs. normal mode, and the culprit turned out to be"intelppm.sys".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what worked for me:</p>
<p>- Boot into recovery console from install medium</p>
<p>- Type "regedit"</p>
<p>- Browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Intelppm and set the 'Start' value to '4' (=&gt; disabled).</p>
<p>- Leave regedit</p>
<p>- Change directory to c:\windows\system32\drivers (&lt;- in my case, the "C:" drive was somehow mapped to "D:")</p>
<p>- Type "rename intelppm.sys intelppm.sys.old", just in case you need it later on</p>
<p>- Exit console and reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You could probably do this in Safe Mode as well. </p>
<p>...and I'm not sure if it's necessary to change the registry settings if you renamed the driver file, maybe someone else can test that out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps..."</p>

            This will make cpu speed always at max speed, even if there is no activity. And my laptop become overheat quickly. So, this is not the solution for my problem.

            <p>Same problem here, at 0.91GHz always, even with benchmark software stressing the cpu</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is obviously a fault Intel PPM driver, but nobody cares from MSFT or Intel, the usual "throubleshooting" never works (since Windows 1.0, of course :D)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont want to touch the registry, i still want to keep my battery working for a few hours, if i change the config is obvious i'll be at 2.7GHz all the time, do someone knows if Intel has an update for this? Microsoft? my notebook is useless with this issue</p>

            <p>for intel processors, try this instead. go into your device manager and open up the processor tree, and update the driver to the one labeled 'processor'. you must do this for every core listed in the tree, or it will not work. the CPU will still be identified
 the same in the device manager, but instead of using intelppm.sys it will use processor.sys instead. after reboot on my system, instead of .90 Ghz, my system is now running at 1.60Ghz. my system still isn't turbo boosting to 2.8 Ghz, yet but it's a step in
 the right direction. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that for those with AMD CPU's in the update driver screen instead of the two option being intel process and processor, it would be AMD processor, and processor. if this is the case, then this operation should work for AMD cpu's as well</p>

            <p>just discovered something interesting after switching over to the processor.sys driver. BIOS setup was not coming up when summoned. before we go any farther let me state, that my system has a traditional BIOS/CMOS setup and not UEFI. back to what I found.....
 when I pressed the bios setup key (F2 in my case) the screen would display a message saying entering setup, but instead of bios setup, windows would start loading. several reboots did not resolve to issue. I finally returned access of the bios setup by removing
 the power cord and pressing and holding the power button for 15 seconds. afterwards, for testing purposes, I switched back to the intelppm.sys driver, and when I rebooted the variable clock and turbo boosting was working again. IDK how long the bios was like
 that, since I rarely have a need to access it. last access was probably when I was still running&nbsp;windows 7. I don't know if a condition like this is even possible with UEFI, but I thought I would report it. the only reason I even went into BIOS setup, was
 to confirm the speed step and turbo boost setting were set to on (enabled, yes, etc.). but now the clock is going from between 1.6 Ghz to 2.8 Ghz as it should be. and the utilization now matches what I saw&nbsp;under windows 7. between 5% and 18% with peaks at
 30%. I'm now back to using the 'intel processor' driver for the time being.</p>

Yup, but ripping is pretty much as fast as just copying the files, and PCs that are slow enough to make it a problem normally don't run Windows 7.

Yup, but ripping is pretty much as fast as just copying the files, and PCs that are slow enough to make it a problem normally don't run Windows 7.

I agree but for some people who dont have top of the line pc's i'm not one of those but others who use laptops or old desktops to rip cds this would be a great addon for them. I can rip one cd in about 2mins using 128kbs mp3 codec. I only use 128kbs cause my
 sound system is good and I don't need cd quality mp3s to hear my music. But anyways I would like to see this in the future and I clicked on the link Manasa P gave me but it sent me to an error.

    <title>Wrong thumbnails in Music Library - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skynet987  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong thumbnails in Music Library</h2>
                    
<p>Within the Media Library of WMC Ultimate (Win7 32bit) I have some six albums that are displaying the wrong albums thumbnail.&nbsp; The artist and album is correct, it is just the wrong thumbnail.&nbsp; The thumbnail happens to be one that I also have in my collection
 and displays ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within WMP all artwork is displayed perfectly fine.</p>
<p>I have removed the contents of %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player and let the index rebuild.&nbsp; I have removed the problematic titles from WMP, confirmed they are not in Media Library, re-added them and the issue is still present.</p>
<p>I have used Tag &amp; Rename to ensure file and folder art is correct.&nbsp; I have checked for hidden files in these folders.&nbsp; I have even checked the "Details" tab in each mp3 files properties.&nbsp; All info and art appears to match the title.</p>
<p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated as I am now at a loss.</p>

<h2>            Is there still no update&#47;bug fix for the Miraak ethereal glitch in Skyrim&#58; Dragonborn.....&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the Dragonborn DLC close to when it first came out, and played through it in a couple days. When I encountered Miraak in the last fight I realized that he was glitched, searched around for a fix, and there was none. I decided to wait it out to see
 if there would be a bug fix, and there still isnt one. Its a little shocking to me that theres no solution to a major bug in a DLC I paid 20$ for, almost a month after the DLC came out. Any info about possible fixes would be greatly appreciated</p>

<p>Bugs take time to fix, and updates don't fix your save file after the glitch has happened.</p>
<p>The only way to get through this is if you have a save file from before you entered that realm, otherwise you'll have to start again.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, they may be no patch coming, as this isn't any known glitch. I've only heard of it once otherwise, and that once is possibly you posting about it before. If not, then there's been only 2 known cases of this that I know of.</p>

<p>A web search reveals that multitudes of players have encountered the same glitch. &nbsp;Players offer numerous workarounds, but others note that the workarounds do not work for them. &nbsp; A short summary of suggestions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Restart from a prior save.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Fight slowly and let him talk ... use a weak weapon (bare knuckles even) and no shouts. &nbsp;If knocked below 10% health before using a dragon to heal, the game glitches.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;At the start of the fight, stay on your dragon and kill the other dragons first.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;If glitched, try hiding and sneaking to make him forget you and restart the battle.</p>
<p>I assume you have already noted and tried all of that. &nbsp;Bethesda's site makes notes of that issue and only suggests, "To avoid this situation, you will need to load a save prior to using the Shield against Miraak and avoid using the power during the battle.
 " &nbsp; There is no mention of a patch forthcoming. </p>
<p>My own experience with Oblivion and Skyrim glitches is that they are never patched. &nbsp;When I encounter a glitch like the one you have, I quit the game, come back a few months later and start a new character, avoiding the glitch this time around.</p>

<p>I appreciate the community effort to assist in fixing this bug but the bottom line is that there are indeed two separate glitches going on, and that fact should be understood before wasting any time trying to bypass the bug.</p>
<p>Firstly I’m really , really disappointed in Bethesda for not even acknowledging the bug/glitch in the Miraak boss battle on their support or community forums. That is the most basic form of customer / public relations. People spent good money on this game
 and then spent real-life hours only to reach what could be an insurmountable glitch without a Bethesda patch.</p>
<p>As many of the other threads around the web note, the worst of the two glitches occurs when you install the DLC before installing the most recent skyrim patch. The order of the installation actually matters. Installing the DLC and THEN patching the game
 with the most recent patch actually breaks those boss scripts. The clearest indicator of this was that you probably weren’t able to find the boat after you first installed the DLC until you patched the game. Most likely you spent a while searching the docks
 and waiting to be visited by the cultists etc…Remember that? When this didn’t happen that’s when you most likely patched your game. If this scenario sounds familiar you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KILL Miraak no matter what you do. Smaller weapons, killing/not killing
 dragons, invulning, insta-blinking him- none of this matters. What will happen repeatedly is that you will absorb the dragons souls instead of Miraak , causing him to keep invluning. I even tried to do the hide trick (if you hide long enough he’ll exit his
 invlun stage) but it doesn’t matter either- because he’ll keep going back into invuln every time you attempt to kill him. He HAS to absorb the dragon souls or the boss battle cannot end.</p>
<p>The other scenario is that you DID install the patch before the DLC. In this case your glitch is less serious. You can just dicker around with highly nerfed attacks until he dies. It’ll take longer , just watch how hard you hit him.</p>
<p>That’s it. Basically scenario 1 folks are going to have to wait for a patch or alternately UNINSTALL the whole DLC and start from scratch from the beginning of the DLC. I’m not willing to do that. I’m hoping people will give Bethesda hell until they release
 a statement. And that’s really all they’d have to do to help their customers out is give them an idea of when there will be a patch and let us know they’re actually working on one. I’m really appalled that they haven’t done this small thing… really- how hard
 is that?</p>

<p>I myself encountered this glitch when I first played through the Dragonborn DLC. I had to play through the DLC again, luckily I had a save from before I embarked on the trip to Solstheim. As with all elder scrolls games, there are glitches here and there
 as the games are so massive and complex. Unfortunately the only thing you can do here is save your game before embarking on the final fight with Miraak and then reload if a glitch occurs.

<p>As above numerous glitches across Skyrim and installing on hard drive helps resolve.</p>
<p>Basically the open world nature of Skyrim means no two games are the same so obviously a lot of data for the game to handle. Even things such as leaving too many unwanted items across the map rather than in chests etc can affect how the game loads.</p>
<p>For example I am 160 hours into Skyrim and can not complete the drinking contest with Sam – no way am I starting again now!!!</p>
<p>Again as above head to the Bethesda pages and post your feedback – generally if enough people report the same issue they will eventually release a fix.</p>

<p>After meaningless hours of trying to work around the glitch I finally figured out how to get past it. I tried everything suggested here and nothing worked, the only remaining solution was a new character. But that isn't necessary, all that is necessary is
 to restart the Dragonborn dlc. To do this you need to delete the Dragonborn dlc file. I had Skyrim installed on my Xbox and deleted that as well as the patch file. Then I launched Skyrim and redownloaded the patch and opened my most recent save game withOUT
 dragonborn downloaded (yes, it was a dragonborn save). Do this on the mainland as it will probably bug out if you saved on Solsteim. It will prompt saying that this save game requires content that is no longer available, just hit continue. After you load in,
 make a new save file. Then exit and download Dragonborn. Load that last save file you made and it will be as if you never played the dlc on that save before. After doing this and moving through the story, I was able to fight Miraak with no issues what-so-ever.
 Good luck!</p>

<p>The reason it is not fixed is because Microsoft doesnt care about you or me, and is happy as long as they got money. Yes, in 2015 this problem has occured, ive been so annoyed on how Microsoft wont fix this crap at all.</p>
