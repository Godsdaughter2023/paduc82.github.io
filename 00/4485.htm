<h2>            Fast Boot - Norton, Adobe, Mouse</h2>
                    <p>Ok, running 16257 but with issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Norton - Norton has begun to show a "Coming Soon" screen instead of the normal one that shows status and access to Settings, scans, etc.&nbsp; Effectively, Norton is frozen but may be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe Acrobat Pro DC - I run this Adobe and it recently sent down an update and it wiped my activation and put it back to a 7 day trial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mouse - This PC recently took a little rain shower but bounced back.&nbsp; This was about the same time as 16257.&nbsp; I then lost the mouse pad although a wireless mouse works fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sort of put this PC down as toast due to shower.&nbsp; I swapped out the hard drive
 and the&nbsp; mousepad came back so re-installed the original hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I keep losing the mousepad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now believe that these issues are related to Fast Boot.&nbsp; As I see it, Fast Boot is closing off fewer system files to get a faster return from Sleep and Hibernate.&nbsp; The simple work a round is a Re-Start.&nbsp; I pulled a Re-Start last night and my Adobe and
 mousepad are now normal. &nbsp; &nbsp; Norton did come back to working but has once again frozen.&nbsp; The word has it that Norton has released a patch but my frozen condition may be holding back the fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, not saying 16257 has a flaw.&nbsp; However, it may show that issues in 3rd party software continue to come to light and that is why we are Insiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone.&nbsp; I am not even sure if I am running Fast Boot but will now determine that, if I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

            I have followed these instructions and still see it continues to 'default' to MSN.&nbsp; Getting a blank page and then having to select a page is also not a complete or final answer.&nbsp; So my point here is that you will not be satisfied with these steps alone.&nbsp;
 There is more you will need to do to deal with some of these factory OS defaults&nbsp; (latest versions at this writing up to 1809 of Windows 10). &nbsp; It is clear Microsoft wants you to use MSN and Bing, and they wrote the OS.&nbsp; I am simply not far enough in the 'web'

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>A browser add-on (toolbar) is causing this.</p>
<p>It would be nice to know your Windows version, but...</p>
<p>From Start&gt; Settings&gt; Control Panel&gt; Internet Options&gt; Tools&gt; Manage add-ons (Show: All add-ons) disable all non-microsoft add-ons. Open / close Internet Explorer.&nbsp;The problem should be gone.</p>
<p>Reenable one add-on at a time until the problem returns. That last add-on to be enabled is the troublesome one. Either uninstall it or uninstall/reinstall. Installing the larest version may resolve the issue.</p>
<p>I found one post on the web pointing to the comcast toolbar as the culprit, but it could be another.</p>
<p>Don</p>

<h3> theodore jucha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install MS Office 2016 on new GalaxyBook2 with ARM processor running windows 10 enterprise</h2>
                    <p>We received new Samsung GalaxyBook2 tablets that came with Window 10 S on them.</p>
<p>I followed directions to get them to run Windows 10 enterprise.</p>
<p>They can run office 365 but as a standard we have office 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to install MS Office Pro Plus 2016 32 bit.</p>
<p>When I start Word on the GalaxyBook it opens Word 365.</p>
<p>I go to Account where it says to enter in the product key for 2016.</p>
<p>Then a blank box with a scrolling dotted bar appears and stays on the screen.</p>
<p>If I close this window a second box comes up and it looks like Office 2016 is configuring and it asks to reboot.</p>
<p>It never seems to install office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone successfully installed 32 bit office 2016 on ARM based tablets running windows 10 NOT in S mode?</p>

            Hi Theodore 
<br />
<br />If Office 365 installed on that system then, so should Office 2016, the problem more than likely is there are remnants of Office 365 left behind on that system . . .
<br />
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of a previous Office Installation:

<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) that system and install office 2016 . . .

<p>I found after it finishes the configuration and asks to Reboot Now.&nbsp; &nbsp;Say NO</p>
<p>Close out Word&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second office 2016 configuration window will appear and when it is complete restart the device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After restart check that the office 2016 license is activated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After rebooting the first time the license did not take.</p>

<p>Hi H. R.G,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer connects with two monitors which with the same size and screen resolution under Extend these displays mode. And the Excel window keep the same when I move it between monitors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if this scenario is resolution relation related, please use the same resolution to see the outcome. For your reference:
 on external monitors</a></strong></span>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this you still get the wrong size of Excel window, please share with me more info as below to let me have a better understanding of your scenario:</p>
<p>1. Are your two monitors the same size?</p>
<p>2. Can you reproduce this issue with other monitors?</p>
<p>3. <span>Screenshot of the detailed version number of your OS(Click Win</span><span>+R</span><span>&gt;type CMD&gt;OK) and Office(File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information e.g.

    <title>Help with Nokia 3250 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b4karne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with Nokia 3250</h2>
                    Im not sure what to do about this, I think my memory<br />
could be full, but nothing gave me an indication that<br />
it was.<br />
<br />
I went to send a text, was in the edit screen, clicked<br />
send, it said *sending*, you know the drill, but then<br />
It went back to the editing thing, with my message that<br />
I had supposedly just sent. So I pressed send, it did<br />
it again. Tried it about 5 times, gave up, thought may<br />
be I needed to turn the phone off and turn back on, and<br />
it won't turn on again.<br />
<br />
The 'nokia' comes up at the bottom of the screen, but<br />
seems to be frozen there.<br />
<br />
I havent dropped the phone, wet it, anything, it just<br />
did it for the first time today.<br />
<br />
Btw, this has nothing to do with the 'freezing' when<br />
sending a text, I got the accelerator patch for that.<br />
I don't get any messages from anyone but friends, and...<br />
I can't think of any other problems. Does anyone know how to fix it? Or at least turn it on?

            I'd try checking what else you have running (press and hold the menu key) first and maybe shut any other apps down.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, I'd try re-starting the phone.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, you could then try clearing some space on the card and/or in phone memory.<br />
<br />
If that didn't work, I'd try a reset (after backing up)<br />
<br />
If that didn't work and a later version of the firmware is available, I'd install it<br />
<br />
If that didn't work .. I'd be stumped and take it to a service center.

            OneNote for Mac are synced to OneDrive and available to you on all your other OneNote clients, so i would suggest you to login on OneDrive and rename it.

    <title>Outlook takes long in building identity after latest update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maryvdb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook takes long in building identity after latest update</h2>
                    Ever since the last Office update (Outlook 14.2.2) it takes forever for Outlook to start. The screen for 'building identity' is shown with the 2 status 'block' (don't know how to explain, I'm Dutch). Below a yellow triangle warning sign is shown saying:
 only try to stop Outlook after your update is finished. But my update IS finished, there's nothing to update anymore. I've rebuild my identity several times (via the Microsoft Database Utility), but every time I want to open Outlook, after my MBP has been
 shut down, I have the same issue. It takes several minutes before the identity is build and Outlook starts. No problem if I keep my MBP working and starting Outlook the 2nd time. It's only the first time after my PC has been shut down.
<div>Does anyone know what to do?</div>

            If everything is on&nbsp;Exchange, all you need to do is make a new&nbsp;Identity, enter your account and let it all&nbsp;download from the server.
<div><br />
<div>The only suggestion is to make sure your Inbox is clean. By that I mean you don't have thousands of messages in this folder. If you do have a full Inbox, I suggest you log into your account with your browser and move the older emails to a subfolder before&nbsp;downloading
 into&nbsp;Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div><b>Exchange Basics</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>The Inbox syncs more frequently than any other and should be kept as clean as possible. (this is the number one cause of problems with sync). Do NOT make subfolders under the Inbox.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any folder with more than a few thousand messages is going to take some time to fully come down when you first sync your account. Due to the design of Outlook's sync engine (and how exchange works), you will see the 512 newest messages in a folder at the
 initial start of sync then the rest of the folder's contents will be back filled before you see any mail that arrives after this point. This is why it will look like you are not getting new mail when a folder is still going through initial sync. This is also
 further exacerbated by an Exchange issue where it gets unnecessary change events before the newer mail arrives. If you carefully watch the progress during the sync of a folder with greater than a couple thousand messages, you will see "Updating local..." a
 lot before the newer mail starts arriving (newer than the initial 512 that come down).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Outlook checks the server for updates every minute, any folder that has updates will subsequently be synced. Since Outlook has a limit on how many folders can be synced at a time, there can be a queue of folders waiting. The Inbox does get high priority
 so it will generally sync before other folders that also need to sync.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div><b>Rebuild Basics:</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>Do Not Rebuild Identities with Exchange and IMAP accounts</b>. Delete the accounts (this deletes the cache files in Outlook). Do the rebuild then add back accounts. Better yet start over in a new Identity. If the rebuild does not work then you could
 sync unwanted changes or deletions to your server and lose data.</li><li>Make sure you have plenty of free space on your drive. Make sure that you have at least three times as much hard disk space available as the current size of your Outlook identity PLUS 10% free for virtual memory.</li><li>Rebuilding does not fix all issues. It can make some problems worse. Even though the Database Utility will make a backup, I advise making a copy in the Finder first.</li><li>You can delete the rebuild version after you are satisfied with the results. This copy will be named like this: Main Identity [Backed up 1-21-2012 13.35] &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Tip: If your Identity will open, before you rebuild, check "On My Computer" Inbox and Sent folders to be sure they are under the 2GB limit. Generally this is less than 10,000 messages but with large attachments could be less. Make subfolders e.g. Inbox
 2011, Inbox 2010, Sent 2011, Sent 2010 etc to help reduce the number of messages in a folder. (Check for any large archive folders you might have in addition to Inbox and Sent).</div>

    <title>Help us protect your account... this is just getting stupid - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annoyed_person  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help us protect your account... this is just getting stupid &#40;Security issues , notifications , is this the fall of outlook&#63; &#41;</h2>
                    <p>Alright so all of a sudden my hotmail account is blocked with this 'Help us Protect you account pop up'. I need help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I'm like, alright, no big deal, microsoft is reasonable, I can probably get my account back. Unfortunately I'm in this continuous cycle of doing everything but getting my account back!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-First problem is that my second email which verifies my current account also has the pop up to verifying my account. Basically my accounts verify each other so there is no way of getting the code as they are both blocked with this pop up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-(Okay so maybe the first part was my fault) but the second problem is after clicking 'Don't have access to your other email' and creating another email to get a code. After I type this in successfully I get a form popping up asking to fill out some of the
 things that I had on my email. Shouldn't be too hard right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-So I fill out the form and click submit but its says there is 'not enough information' popping up. I am sorry but I never have changed my password before so I can't fill in the other passwords you used before. Other emails I contacted: I guess this is just
 me put I don't like my 'spam' mail and 'important' emails together. I have a gmail for my important emails where is send things to people and my hotmail is used for the 'spam' mail: things like gaming subscriptions, gumtree messaging, ebay messaging, facebook
 notifications. (It just clogs up everything). The form also has a "subjects of emails" I don't know and I don't pay attention to what all these subscriptions send me as a subject line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-So basically i fill in stuff like "I never changed by password" in the passwords section, i mean if this is being sent to a person they would understand. BUT, as I though its just sent to some program that send an automatic message saying I'm sorry you
 information didn't match.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-So getting frustrated I sent a few of these racking my brains for what I had on my email... basically there turns out to be a maximum of 4 within 24hours. Yay i have to wait another bleeping 24 hours before I can try guess my way into what I had written
 and received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-So i had a look on the internet who had others who had problems but they never had their questions answered because all the microsoft moderators closed the discussion saying 'just click this link' you shouldn't mentions any private info here etc. So I can't
 ask the moderators there. Also turns out others are having problems with the customer service too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I click link, it brings me to a list of problems, I click "have problem verifiying email" it brings me to sign into my email with the pop up of&nbsp;'Help us Protect you account pop up'. Wow... you really made my day outlook..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in conclusion, I need my account back, i know the stuff on there isn't going to make me lose jobs but being attached to all my games and facebook and gumtree, Is microsoft expecting me to make a new account (which i did) and attempt to try move all these
 things i signed up for over...? (How do I do this anyway without loosing my other accounts) I'm sure others might be having this problem and perhaps its more serious with important emails that cannot be accessed. As for my second email that verifies the first,
 I hardly use that, hence I can't fill out the form at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm asking that you remove this verification thing, or give a notification of such so that I can get codes before you block my emails. If you have solved this problem please tell me, (I never really get along with all this technology business). I would greatly
 appreciate your help, just so frustrated and annoyed. I do need to check up on some things there, forgot a password for one of my accounts linked to the blocked email and I need to send an verification email to my email to reset the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*MODERATORS: don't you dare close this discussion with a click me 'link' unless it actually solves my problem!!!</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help C#S,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I'm only getting 2 options on this hotmail account like in the picture below. Email **** was the email I set up my account with, (that verify each other) and I believe only need a one code process -I get a 6 digit code, on my other email type
 it in and I'm in (or at least would think I would be). But I can't get the code from my other email in the first place as I get the pop up on both emails and can't access my emails to get the code. The 'I don't have these anymore' option is a two step process.
 It brings up the option to send an email to another email, which I did create another, you get a code, but the code only allows you to complete the form to try get back into your account which I must submit to some sort of automatic system. I can't see any
 of my emails in the second process as the other email only gets a 4 digit code which unlocks the option to fill out the form to 'attempt' to get back into my account, hence why creating an email out of microsoft wouldn't work. Or am I missing something, is
 there an option to get a 6 digit code that won't bring up the form and straight into my email? Any ideas are greatly appreciated :)</p>

            <p>Wow, it seems like my prayers have been answered! The verification pop up has been moved and am back into both accounts. Thanks Microsoft and for anyone who has microsoft email problems VOICE YOUR OPINION and be HEARD!! to get it fixed :) Very happy, as
 never expected anything to be done (and within a month isn't bad either). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must say its rather amusing to find all the 'we detected usual signs in activity' emails from microsoft about all the failed form attempts to get my account back and the amount of emails I have been missing in the last month.

            I'm sorry, but what exactly happened to fix the issue? I'm having it, and my email is not Microsoft-related. But I never get said email with the 6 digit number. So what did you do, or what happened that made it all better?

    <title>Page Edits Show in Web App, but Not in OneNote After Sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> huddie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page Edits Show in Web App, but Not in OneNote After Sync</h2>
                    Often I will be making changes to a page on one of my notes stored on SkyDrive, using the OneNote Web App or another device. &nbsp;When I go to my main PC, open OneNote and look at the note, even after synchronising 'successfully', the changes either do not
 appear at all or appear after a delay of hours. &nbsp;No errors, warnings or alert icons are displayed in OneNote, SkyDrive or Windows. &nbsp;I can't find any pertinent events in the Application Event Log or other logs. &nbsp;This is an intermittent and highly unpredictable
 issue - note changes often do synchronise.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To attempt a workaround when this occurs and I'm aware it's happened (remember there are no warnings in OneNote), here's what I can do. &nbsp;I go to the page in OneNote on my PC where new text is missing. &nbsp;I click the mouse and place the cursor on a blank
 area, type text, then immediately remove it. &nbsp;This triggers and automatic sync. &nbsp;When then happens is the changes will appear, or I will get a generic error stating that an unknown problem has occurred. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I don't have the error code, but will
 post if it happens again. &nbsp;Though this is a sync error, OneNote does not present the options for conflict resolution so there's nothing I can do to repair the note. &nbsp;Should this error occur, then I have to rebuild the section or note by copying and pasting
 pages into a new section then removing the old one. &nbsp;This is a dodgy technique as you can see. &nbsp;Even if the error doesn't occur and my edits show, further edits won't until I do the same workaround again. &nbsp;Therefore this workaround is totally inadequate and
 I have to rebuild the section or note anyway.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As you can imagine, I've lost quite a few pages owing to their details not being updated and then eventually (I think) being overwritten in subsequent edits and syncs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd love to be able to post technical details, such as logged events, but I'm just not able to find any. &nbsp;If you know where error or warning events might be logged by OneNote I'd be grateful to hear of it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please could someone help me with this ? &nbsp;Have you had the same problem, where OneNote thinks it has synced successfully, but edits don't appear ? &nbsp;Please help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Details:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>OneNote Version: Office OneNote 2010 x86 SP1 (also OneNote MX)</div>
<div>Windows Version: Windows 7 x86 SP1 (also Windows 8 Release Preview x64)</div>

1. As mentioned in my original post, sync status reports success.
<div><br />
<div>2. Answered at the bottom of my original post.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. I've already tried switching to offline mode then manually syncing. &nbsp;It doesn't make any difference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The linked article refers to a previous 50MB filesize limit. &nbsp;This, it seems, no longer applies and also, OneNote now automatically optimises files to prevent excessive filesizes, according to the same article. &nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyDrive</a>,
 the current filesize limit is 300MB. &nbsp;I've tested and uploaded a file &gt;50MB successfully.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for replying Daniel, but you really should read the original posts in forums and also the articles you're going to link to, before you respond :-( &nbsp;I've put a lot of time into troubleshooting this issue and don't want people thinking they don't
 need to reply here as you've already done so.</div>

A friend of mine had similar issue but it was only happening on a specific computer. No one knew why.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span>Well If you don’t delete the blank area in&nbsp;<span>One Note</span>&nbsp;web
 app forcing the sync to take place, how long does it generally take for content to get synced automatically?</span>
<p>
Is this issue experienced on a specific notebook ? How about reproducing this issue on a different computer?<br />
<br />
Try copying and moving the content to a new file and check its&nbsp;<span>behavior</span>.&nbsp;<br />
Always make a backup .<br />
<br />
And by the way, it worked fine with different internet connection and in clean boot. you may even want to try that and see.<br />
<br />
Try uploading the file or sharing the file if its ok to check.</p>

3. Try copying and moving the content to a new file and check its&nbsp;<span>behavior</span>.&nbsp;<br />
Always make a backup .<br />
<br />
4. And by the way, it worked fine with different internet connection and in clean boot. you may even want to try that and see.<br />
<br />
Try uploading the file or sharing the file if its ok to check.</p>

<br />
<div>1. I'm not sure what you're referring to here. &nbsp;As stated in my original post, "<span>I go to the page
<b><i>in OneNote on my PC</i></b> where new text is missing. &nbsp;I click the mouse and place the cursor on a blank area, type text, then immediately remove it." &nbsp;Can you clarify ?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>2. No, it occurs on all three of my notebooks, which were created at completely different times. &nbsp;It also occurs on my home PC, where I run OneNote MX on Win8 RP x64.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>3. I've already done this - see my original post. &nbsp;"</span><span>Should this error occur, then I have to rebuild the section or note by copying and pasting pages
 into a new section then removing the old one." &nbsp;Each section in a OneNote note has its own corresponding file(s). &nbsp;I've also used the same technique to completely rebuild an entire note, to no avail as the problem just comes back soon afterwards.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>4. As stated in point 2, it occurs on two different PCs. Each has its own build and Internet connection.</span></div>

            <p>Hi Huddie,</p>
<p>Sorry you are having this issue - I'm very puzzled, and worried,&nbsp;by this.</p>
<p>Have you only seen this after making changes on the web app then looking at a PC, or have you seen it when making changes at PCs too?</p>
<p>Background synching of the desktop app, for sections that you are not looking, can be slowed down significantly (up to a few hours in theory if they are sections you are never looking at and OneNote is not active). However, pages and sections you are moving
 to in OneNote should automatically download changes at a much faster rate.</p>
<p>The "green checkmark" is more a guarantee that your local changes were pushed than the server changes have been downloaded. The reason is that, when doing background synching, we might not be aware of changes that occured on the server.</p>
<p>One problem that can cause background synching to slow down significantly more than this is if you have another notebook that is having difficulty synching. It might delay synching of other notebooks. Look at the sync UI and see if there is a long-running
 progress bar that doesn't seem to make progress.</p>
<p>Next time this happen, instead of making a change to the page, try doing Shift-F9 on the notebook and wait for sync to complete. This does a little more than just making sync go faster - it will reset a few internal states to make sure we are fully consistent
 with the server. Do the changes appear in this case?</p>
<p>If the changes do not appear, but they do when you type, then this is a very different, server-side problem that we are not aware of. If so, let me know, we definitely want to get to the bottom of this!!! This would mean the server is actually telling OneNote
 that it is up-to-date when it isn't. This would not result in data loss, but can result in the clients not being up to date with the server.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Benoit.</p>

<div>Many thanks for your helpful reply Benoit and sorry for the delay getting back to you.</div>

<div><span><i>"Have you only seen this after making changes on the web app then looking at a PC, or have you seen it when making changes at PCs too?":</i>&nbsp; It seems to happen on the PC, when changes have been made elsewhere.
 &nbsp;If a section has become 'detached', i.e., changes made on the web app or elsewhere stop automatically showing on the PC, implementing the actioned mentioned in the second paragraph of my original post will cause the changes to show. &nbsp;Generally, if I make
 a change on the PC it does get reflected elsewhere.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><i>"Look at the sync UI and see if there is a long-running progress bar that doesn't seem to make progress."</i>: &nbsp;This is not happening. &nbsp;The PC OneNote app seems to think that sync is successful and completes
 quickly. &nbsp;All notes show the green circle with a tick after only a few seconds.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span><i>"Next time this happen, instead of making a change to the page, try doing Shift-F9 on the notebook and wait for sync to complete."
</i>&nbsp;I'm afraid I've already tried this and it doesn't work. &nbsp;The PC OneNote app still thinks sync was successful even though the changes haven't shown.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>One thing that I haven't mentioned is I use a third-party app called
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themsteam.mobilenoter.direct&amp;feature=nav_other#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDYsImNvbS50aGVtc3RlYW0ubW9iaWxlbm90ZXIuZGlyZWN0Il0." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MobileNoter&nbsp;SE</a>&nbsp;to access all my notes on my Android smartphone. &nbsp;A possibility is that its sync method could be affecting 'version control' info on the notes data and causing server and clients to have problems knowing when changes have been made between
 SkyDrive and the OneNote PC app. &nbsp;MobileNoter always syncs ok, even the sections where I have this problem, but that is not to say that it isn't in some way affecting the OneNote apps.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have been in touch with their support but it's been difficult dealing with them, owing to time lag between timezones, language barrier and the absence of user forums. &nbsp;However, I made some progress yesterday
 after a lot of communication. &nbsp;Though they have not acknowledged specifically that there is a problem, they have just told me they have a new version for Android coming out in a couple of weeks. &nbsp;They said this version has much improved synchronisation. &nbsp;Sync
 implements a kind of 'version control' and items are synced in a more 'granular' way instead of the current method of syncing per-section. &nbsp;This stands a good chance of being where the issue and solution might lie, but we'll see.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>In the meantime, I wonder could you please tell me a few things ? &nbsp;I've tried looking for event logs for PC OneNote and can't find any (just some 'transaction' type log files for internal app use). &nbsp;I would like to do some more troubleshooting on this,
 but as I can't find any errors or logs I can't progress this. &nbsp;Can I enable logging in OneNote PC ? &nbsp;If so, how, and where may I find the logs ? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just as a final note, please don't take offence at this as I know that you're leading OneNote app development. &nbsp;You may be wondering why I use MobileNoter SE instead of OneNote Mobile on Android. &nbsp;The answer is that, frankly, OneNote Mobile is unusable.
 &nbsp;It fills the internal memory up with note data instead of writing this information to the SD card. &nbsp;If it were not for this issue, which causes major problems with my phone, I'm sure I would be using OneNote Mobile now. &nbsp;I do hope this issue is being addressed
 as, otherwise, it looks pretty promising.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback on the Android client - we will continue to improve all of the OneNote clients and this is a frequently requested feature.</p>
<p>As for the sync issues, I will say that any full-file sync interactions with the fine-grain sync technology that OneNote uses is
<strong>guaranteed</strong> to cause data loss because there is no strong synchronization between the two models. This is only speculative, but if&nbsp;the 3rd party is using full-file DAV access to the files, you will lose data... I do not know specifically how
 MobileNoter interacts with SkyDrive, but based on the description above, it seems that they are currently doing full-file sync.</p>
<p>You might be able to avoid this by sharing your notebook on Skydrive to another Live ID account than your main one, and only allow Read-Only access. Then reset your Android application and use your other Live ID. You will lose editing abilities, but this
 will at least protect you against this while still enabling you to read your notes on the go.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Benoit.</p>

Thanks Benoit. I'll keep your suggestion re MobileNoter in mind. However, I'll see if the new version improves matters first, then report back...

<h2>            Built in administrator will not allow me to log in or change settings</h2>
                    After installing win 10 , I lost most of my desk top icons , all my pictures and have no access to changing any settings ( Built in administrator ) will not allow it. I had no password and don`t need one, but if I try more than twice to change anything
 or even add a program . The darn " built in IDIOT " won`t allow it. Then it slows down the computer to the point that I can`t even shut the program down. Opening more than one or two sites at a time is a joke. I can`t even shut the computer off or reboot from
 the screen. All I get is an annoying beeping sound when I move the mouse. Tried going back to my old OS , but the "built in admin " clown won`t allow it.&nbsp; Stay away until these guys work out more than just a few bugs. I would rather go back to win 2000 than
 this, and I foolishly thought that by now they were using educated people instead of intelligent monkeys to do the programing. System rollback only was available before the second update, after that, my computer would wake up

            Hello folks, I tried to "fool " it back , but 'IT' knows better than to be kicked out. Latest build is 10074 . Also installed IE 11 with less than favourable results. Lost my home page only to have it replaced by Bing. I seem to have some control over
 what I can and cannot delete, but am having problems with finding and removing some files that seem to be floating between my hard drive and my data stick. I can remove them from the stick , but they keep showing up on the hard drive. Last update seems to
 help out.&nbsp; Gonna try upping the ram to 4gb and see if that might help. 2gb doesn`t seem to cut it. Thanks for trying. Seems my only way out is to format and reinstall 7 or 8 , which means I have to pay someone for a new disk.&nbsp; I`m gonna tough it out on this
 computer and see where it goes. Meanwhile , my poor old laptop with XP will do just fine when I need to get something done. Thanks again folks. Enjoy the weekend.

<h2>            Email Reading Format is all stretched-out</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I installed MS Office 2016 on my Windows 10 System and now my MS Outlook Emails are not working properly.&nbsp; Reading emails has become a chore because for most of my emails, I have to use the scroll bar to read the content.&nbsp; The Emails are placed in the center
 with a large amount of space on both sides of the reading pane, resulting in having to constantly use the mouse to scroll to the right to read them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I did noticed this issue in the Early release forum and it is not apparently not fixed in the Release version.</p>
<p>Is that the new norm now; release buggy software so people can test it for you?</p>

Since our forum focuses on Office365 for Business online services, and this is a client related issue, to ensure you receive the professional support, I recommend you post on our&nbsp;<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;Outlook

<p>Poppy Yang, you should try using the products you allegedly support and familiarize yourself with your own forum. &nbsp;This is a known issue of which none of you "support" reps have any knowledge:</p>
<p>Preview from back in August: <a href="https://community.office365.com/en-us/office_2016_preview/f/991/t/403298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I have the same problem. &nbsp;None of the suggested fixes by others have helped.</p>

<p>Hi BryanConklin9896,</p>
<p>Currently, no server side configurations can cause the issue. Since the issue is related to the Outlook client and our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business Online services, &nbsp;I would suggest you post a new thread in our &nbsp;<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook
 client Forum for</a> dedicated support.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

<p>Can you type *#0000# into your phone dialer and then post your product code here,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The usual explanation for this is that your phone is a grey import originaly destined for a market where the FM transmitter is banned,</p>
<p>The dealers who import these phones usually flash them with the local firmware varient which enables the fm transmitter functionality, but when the user updates the phone reverts to it's 'native' regional firmware and the transmitter stops working</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case the only solution is to take the phone to a nokia care point and ask them nicely to reflash with the generic firmware and pay to have this done,</p>

            I am not aware of any log. Yes, that is a blue screen actually, and the phone reboots its self. However, you are about a different issue because your phone is Nokia Series 40. The Nokia 222 is Series 30+. Therefore, please, let us continue with

            <p>Hi Al Conte,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to get the value from a column containing "FALSE" and "TRUE" in Excel, you can use VLOOKUP function. VLOOKUP function needs to contain Value you want to look up, range where you want to lookup the value, the column number in the range containing
 the return value and Exact Match or Approximate Match. You can refer to my example below. For more information about VLOOKUP function,

            <p>Hi Al,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as you said, using INDEX function combined with MATCH can look up values "TRUE" and "FALSE" from Access Database.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ae7e093-75ff-490d-8909-f3d48a6574dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ae7e093-75ff-490d-8909-f3d48a6574dd" /></a></p>
<p>You would need to write a query if you want to use Excel VLOOKUP function in reference to an Access Database.

<p>I gave up on using the vlookup, and just resigned to the fact that it does not work. Index and Match combination, although I am not as familiar with them as vlookup, did the trick.</p>

    <title>Using a SUMIFS to pull data from another workbook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using a SUMIFS to pull data from another workbook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using multiple SUMIFS functions in a workbook which pulls data from another workbook.&nbsp; The SUMIFS works great when both workbooks are open, but if the source workbook is closed then the workbook using SUMIFS functions returns #REF.&nbsp; It looks like the
 issue is that there is no reference to the specific tab in the in the SUMIFS function for the source workbook, just a reference to the table name, so the formula doesn't know which tab to pull the info from. &nbsp;Is there a way around this?&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal would be
 for the SUMIFS workbook to update without having to open the data&nbsp;source workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>If copy fails only for a few contacts, it may be caused by contact field information&nbsp;that outlook.com can't handle. If the rest of the contacts were&nbsp;copied succesfully, it is better to add the few remaining ones manually on the outlook.com website and put

    <title>How to auto update MS Access FE with multiuser security - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim4692  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to auto update MS Access FE with multiuser security</h2>
                    I am in desperate need of some way to automatically update user front ends from a master front end. I have tried the
<i>Microsoft Access Front-End Auto-Update Enabling Tool </i>from <span>
www.btabdevelopment.com.<b> </b>I used the </span>
version for secured database using mdw file, which was modified from Bob Larson's version by Tom Knight.<br />
<br />
When I use it, I get the following error:<br />
<br />
Error in createDesktopShortcutWParams( ).<br />
Error #-2147024891<br />
Unable to save shortcut "c:\MPDSA.lnk".<br />
<br />
I either need to know how to fix this or I need an alternate application that can update my front ends.<br />
I know everyone mentions Tony Toews Autofeupdater.com, but that application is no longer free and my employee is not willing to pay for it. They would rather I have to run around and reinstall front ends on everyone's computer each time I need to make a change.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />

            <p>Note: I am not familiar with Bob's utility at all, much less the modified version you're using.&nbsp; However, it occurs to me that you may be running into a problem with write permissions on the root folder of the C: drive, which are usually restricted these
 days.&nbsp; What happens if you write the shortcut to the user's Documents or AppData folder instead?</p>

<p>In all fairness to Tony, he has put in a ton of work into his updater. It's well worth the price.</p>
<p>But I have a method I created and it's still free. You can read my article "Deploying and updating a Front End Application"&nbsp;and download a sample script at

            It is designed to create a folder on the C: Drive that you name. I know I am able to create other new folders directly subordinate to the C: Drive. I am relatively new to dealing with VBA code, but one of the statements in the code states that the folder
 is created in C: because something about dealing with the batch file won't work in a folder that has spaces, such as "Documents and Settings". Unfortunately I know just enough to get more confused.<br />

<br />
It may be designed to create a folder on the C: drive, as you say, but the error message you quoted says it was 'Unable to save shortcut "c:\MPDSA.lnk".'&nbsp; That makes it seem that it is trying to save a file, "MPDSA.lnk", to the root directory of C:.&nbsp; Can you
 confirm that you are able to create&nbsp;a file, not a folder, in C:\, without running as an administrator?&nbsp; I know that on my Vista system, I can't.

            It appears you're right. When I attempted to paste a&nbsp; file directly to the C:\ Drive it advised I need administrator rights to do so.<br />
<br />
So my question is now what to do about it. I've looked at the modules for the Auto-update enabling tool, but I am still a novice to interpreting and manipulating code, so I'm afraid of screwing something up if I try to figure out how to have the shortcut saved
 to a location other than the C:\ Drive. If I'm to attempt this, I'll need some guidance as to what I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
Or.... is it possible that our IT administrator could change permissions to allow this file to be saved to the C:\ Drive. And would that be a system wide change they could allow without making changes to each user's computer?<br />

            I use AutoFEUpdater and my company has purchased an Enterprise license. It is not expensive and well worth the cost.
<div><br />
<div>But what you should be doing is storing the icon for the shortcut either on the user's desktop or in their AppData folder. Tony's tool allows you to specify %AppData% as the root folder to store the local FE.</div>

I don't recommend that you ask your IT adminstrator change the permissions.&nbsp; They are restricted for a good reason.</p>
<p>How about writing to Bob Larson via the contact form on thebtabdevelopment website and explaining your problem?&nbsp; It seems clear that any user of this utility, under any recent version of Windows, will have the same problem.&nbsp; The code changes would be simple,
 but not necessarily for an amateur to do.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Dirk,<br />
<br />
You're correct. I talked with our IT Manager and she advised the restrictions on the C:\ Drive are actually required by the State Police due to all the sensitive info that is transferred on a continuous basis.
<br />
<br />
I did email Bob directly and he replied. He advised that Tom Knight modified his version so that it would take into account the use of the Workgroup Administrator security file used in multiuser DBs. Bob tried the email he had for Tom, but replied that it was
 no longer a good email address. I have not been able to locate a good email for Tom Knight at this point.<br />

            <p>Having glanced at the code, I'm pretty sure the modifications would be relatively minor.&nbsp; If I weren't so busy at the moment, I would undertake to make them for you.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I'm swamped with work at the moment and couldn't reasonably get to something
 like this for weeks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you want to wait until I "get around to it", I could put it on my list of things to do, but can't give it a high priority.&nbsp; My guess is that you would do better just to find a different solution to the auto-update problem, but let me know if you feel
 like waiting until I find the time.</p>
