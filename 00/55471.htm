<h2>            Windows XP Update doesn&#39;t work, How to stop Office 07&#47;10 Updates&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For the past few months, the web version of Windows Update does not work with XP. When you click the button for Express or Custom install, the system stalls out looking for updates. So I had to set Windows to notify me of updates instead of going to the
 site, but now it keeps wanting me to download updates for Office 2007 and 2010, but I don't own those products (I use Office 2003).&nbsp; I could not get it to stop this, even when I checked the box not to notify me of those anymore. Finally I went to the site
 and found an option to Disable Microsoft Update, which said I could still download updates from the site, But I can't because it tries to force me to re-download Microsoft Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's going on?&nbsp; I don't like the new Microsoft Update because it keeps nagging me to download updates for products I don't even own. How can I update only Windows XP??????&nbsp; This is very fustrating.

Hi Steve, <br />
<br />
Please do the following. <br />
<br />
Go to <b>Start </b>| <b>Settings </b>| <b>Control Panel</b> and double click <b>Automatic Updates</b>. I'll explain why later.
<br />
<br />
Next, checkmark the bottom option to disable Automatic Updates and then click Apply/OK.
<br />
<br />
Next, go to Start, Run, copy/paste this command and click OK: <b>services.msc</b><br />
<br />
In the list of Services, can you see <b>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</b> ?<br />
<br />
Here's a pix of what it looks like.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2520e9cf-3532-42cf-bdf5-56a8947e5cae" /><br />
<br />
<br />
If it's not listed, please proceed as follows to register the BITS service.<br />
<br />
Open the Windows Search tool, copy/paste the following and then click Search: <b>
qmgr.dll</b><br />
<br />
Search should show that file in the following locations:<br />
<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32<br />
C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\bits<br />
<br />
You might only see qmgr.dll in C:\WINDOWS\system32 depending on your setup.<br />
<br />
Next, go to Start, Run and copy/paste: <b>regsvr32 qmgr.dll </b>and click OK<br />
<br />
Do the same with this file: <b>regsvr32 qmgrprxy.dll</b><br />
<br />
Reboot the system and then copy/paste this command into the Run field:<br />
<b>%windir%\System32\rundll32.exe setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 132 %windir%\inf\qmgr.inf</b><br />
<br />
If you're prompted to insert the Windows installation CD, ignore that and in the dialog box at the bottom, change the path to
<b>C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386</b><br />
<br />
<u>If you could only see the file in C:\WINDOWS\system32, change the path to that instead</u>.<br />
<br />
Restart the PC again and then go to Services and you should be able to see BITS in the list.<br />
<br />
Double click it and then on the <b>General </b>tab, click the <b>Start </b>button to try and start the service manually. This is just a test to ensure that it's working correctly.<br />
<br />
If you get <i>Error 2: cannot find the file specified</i>, go to Start, then Run again and copy/paste the following command and then click OK:<br />
<b>Reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\BITS\Parameters /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d %windir%\System32\qmgr.dll</b><br />
<br />
Reboot again and then try once more to start BITS. It should work properly now, but in the unlikely event that it fails again, run the following command and then hit Enter:<br />
<b>Reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\BackupRestore\FilesNotToBackup</b><br />
<br />
Reboot once more and then do the following.<br />
<br />
Go to this link and install the&nbsp; IE8 cumulative December update:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=41404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=41404</a><br />
<br />
If you use IE7, use this link instead:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=41442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=41442</a><br />
<br />
Finally, go to the Windows Update site and you should be able to download normally.<br />
<br />
Provided that's the case, re-enable Automatic Updates in Control Panel. <br />
<br />

    <title>Joining Tracks When Ripping in Windows Media Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> surfer96815  say:</h3>
<h2>            Joining Tracks When Ripping in Windows Media Player</h2>
                    When I rip my live CD's I do not want a gap between tracks. Also, I do not what to have to rip the entire CD as one long track.&nbsp; Is there a way to reproduce the CD in that the tracks are separate but there is no gap when listening to them continuously?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Did you rip your CD to MP3? If yes, there is no solution to make it playback gapless. That's how MP3 format works. It leaves a small silence at the beginning/end of tracks. The only solution for MP3 format is to make a big MP3 with the whole disc.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a way to make your ripped CD gapless. Windows Media Player options allow media to be ripped gapless by selecting Format: "Windows Media Audio Lossless". I believe lossless is a format that is gapless. A side effect is that the file sizes when you rip
 file are rather large.

<p>These might give you some idea of options available to you.&nbsp; From a Vista point of view it seems that WMP cannot do it for you (they way you want and provide file separation),&nbsp; Nero, I-Tunes, and other third party CD Burning software may provide you that
 option.</p>
<p>how do I eliminate gaps between songs when burning a cd in Windows media player?<br />

<h3> randomperson78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Popup Not Showing When Device Plugged in Audio Jack &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I got this new headset which I plug into my audio jack. I've had to switch headphones to headset whenever it pops up. Once I switched and then checked the "Don't show this again" box. After plugging them in once more, the sound was only going through the
 right end. I'm guessing this is an issue with my device not recognizing my headset, as it works fine, just not with my device.</p>
<p>I've read through help articles and tried to find a Realtek Audio manager to enable the popup. I've sifted through my control panel and device manager, updated my audio drive,&nbsp; and have had no luck being able to set up this popup.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that the device driver is not compatible with your PC that caused your headset to not to work as expected. In order for us to provide the appropriate solution to your concern, we'd like to ask for additional information to help us
 investigate. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What build and version of Windows 10 are you using?</li><li>Just to clarify, the missing pop up that you are referring to is the option where you change the headphone to the headset, correct?</li><li>Have you already tried running the built-in Playing Audio troubleshooter?</li><li>What is the make and model of your headset?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon. </p>

<p>Thank you for the additional details. For the troubleshooting, we recommend unplugging the device and uninstall it from the Device Manager app.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Locate the device that you want to uninstall.</li><li>Right-click and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Driver </strong>tab and click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>To reinstall, plug the device back and it will automatically install the driver.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the steps above, let us know if the issue still persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response. </p>

<p>So you have a combined audio port with the Waves manager.&nbsp; The latest version of that software allows you to turn the popup on or off using the advanced settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;The UI should show in the hidden icons on the Taskbar, but if not, open it from the apps section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Headphones are anything you listen to music with.&nbsp; The headsets are communication devices, so make sure how yours is set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you turn the popup off, it will revert to what was set earlier as to type of device.</p>

<br />
<br />To troubleshoot :

<p>
</p><p>I was sleeping and when i woke up i met that notification:</p>
<p>
</p><p>“We’ve got an update for you</p>
<p>Windows is a service and updates are a normal part of keeping it running securely.&nbsp;Your updated is sheduled for 3:30 am.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Followed by icons for “Restart Now”, “Pick a time”, and “Snooze”.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When i woke up in morning i go to pc. But it hangs because mouse cursor was a turning circle and unable to click anything,so i just ctrl alt delete and log out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Like i said i was sleeping at this time. I want to know, if this is possible how to check ,on what hour and second exactly it popped that notification?</p>
<p>Is this any way? Event log nothing i find,maybe registry or something?<br />
</p>
<p>I ask because my game crashed nearly at this time,and i want to be sure if that was caused by that notification or not.</p>

            Hi, SasaAsasa
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<h2>            how do I find a Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter&#63; How do I replace it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was having problems with my laptop in regards to the sound coming from it when I've got the HDMI cables hooked to my TV.&nbsp;The sound should be coming from my TV instead of my laptop.&nbsp; &nbsp;It had never done this before and I accidentally removed the Teredo Tunneling
 adapter when trying to troubleshoot the problem myself.&nbsp; I even reinstalled the "drivers and utility" software, but it didn't work.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I have two problems.&nbsp; When I have my HDMI cables hooked up to my TV, but the sound still comes from
 my laptop.&nbsp; It never did that before.&nbsp; Then I accidentally removed the Teredo Tunneling Adapter.&nbsp; Please help me with both of these problems if you can.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'm usually watching Netflix and now I can't get the cables to mute the sound coming from my laptop.&nbsp; Where do I find this adapter and install it again?&nbsp; The cables are still working because the picture is fine, it's just the sound isn't coming from the
 TV, instead from my laptop.&nbsp; I had one problem and ended up with two!</p>
<p>I tried going on Microsoft's Compatibility 7 website and tried to download one that was compatible and that didn't work either.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.&nbsp; But I've got to get both of these problems fixed because they are enter twined.</p>

    <title>Playback says that Bluetooth Headset is Disconnected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rozsudek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playback says that Bluetooth Headset is Disconnected</h2>
                    Hi. So I bought a Bluetooth Headset with Microphone enabled and it worked perfectly with my iPad. Getting the headset to pair with the computer also went smoothly, but when I tried to listen to it, sound came out of the speaker. I looked in the playback
 menu and found out that the headset is set to "Disconnected", and every attempt to connect it has failed. I can't set it as the default device because the thing is disconnected. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p><b>Hi,</b></p>
<p><b>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community Forum.</b></p>
<p>From your description I understand that Bluetooth headset is disconnected.</p>
<p><b>I would suggest you to follow the methods:</b></p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><span>Temporarily disable security software and firewall and check if the issue persists. Make sure to enable that security software on the computer
 after checking.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If disabling the security software resolves the issue then, please contact the specific security software manufacturer to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span>
 Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as
 you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><span>Add a Bluetooth enabled device to your computer once again and check.</span></p>

            Hi, thanks for your solutions. Unfortunately, removing and adding the headset leads to no solutions and turning off the antivirus and windows firewall doesn't seem to help. If it may help, I also tried connecting it to an older Macbook and the headsets
 work, leading me to think it may be a problem just with this computer. Also, the control panel says that each service is working properly. Hopefully this information can help.<br />

            Well, after a few days of silence and searching, I decided to try updating my drivers. After
<b>turning it off</b> and leaving it to attempt to update (it didn't work), it turned itself back on. I was somehow able to open the device control and subsequently, connect to the headsets.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help any other person.<br />

            I have tried the above, and still no success. I have an iHome model iDM12 portable rechargeable Bluetooth stereo speaker. After pairing, Windows 7 recognizes it as a Bluetooth headset. When I right-click the speaker icon and choose Playback devices, it
 shows the "headset" is disconnected. When I run Troubleshoot audio playback, it says I have to plug in the unit. The iDM12 works perfectly with my iPad. Also, the manufacturer had no answers and suggested I contact Microsoft, so here I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><br />
In addition to <em>FoxFifth's</em> comments that message indicates to me the encryption type on the router is different and not supported on the Nintendo DS device.</p>
<p>Some of the Nintendo support pages indicate the device only supports WEP encryption versus WPA2 or WPA.</p>
<p><em><span>WEP</span> Key is a security setting for your router. <u>WEP is the only security that is compatible with the Nintendo DS Wi-Fi</u> Connection. You will need to set your router for WEP security -- or remove security on your router -- to use the
 Nintendo DS at this access point.</em> </p>
<p>I got that from this page...</p>

<p>Beyond all of that and to actually find the encryption key/password/passphrase...</p>
<p>Open the Network and Sharing Center on&nbsp;a wireless Win 7 computer then select <strong>
Manage wireless networks</strong> and look at the properties of your home wireless network, ie. highlight then right click on your home network. Click on the
<strong>Security</strong> tab and check the <strong>Show characters</strong> checkbox. You can then simply copy-n-paste the encryption key/passphrase/password to a text file for later use.</p>

<p><a href="http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/LAN/SoHoWirelessSecurity.html#Windows_Connect_Now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Connect Now</a> [WCN] to copy the wireless profile to a USB flash drive. Once you do that you can simply navigate to the
<span><em>\Smrtntky\Wsetting.txt</em> file on the flash drive and see the key in clear text. You can then manually configure your Kindle.</span></p>
<p><span>Also note that some wireless routers will display the encryption key/passphrase/password in plain text. Log into the router admin pages and see if you can get the key that way.</span></p>
<p><span>In all cases make sure you document the encryption key/passphrase/password for later use...</span></p>

            My <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">guess</span> based on the Nintendo support site is that the problem is due to the following statement (note that 802.11g and N are most commonly used today but that the Nintendo device does not support those):<br />
<br />
"Does your router use 802.11g?<br />
If your router uses 802.11g, it may default to only the "g" band. This setting will not work with the Nintendo DS. Check your router's settings (typically in the "Wireless" tab) and make sure that it is set to "Auto," "Mixed," or something similar."<br />
<br />
The above quote is from: <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/wrSetupHelp.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/wrSetupHelp.jsp</a>&nbsp; and that page may contain other useful information.<br />
<br />
I also found the following information at: <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/wrInitialSetupHelp.jsp#router_type" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/wrInitialSetupHelp.jsp#router_type</a><br />
<br />
"What type of router (a, b, g, or N) is compatible with Nintendo WFC?<br />
Nintendo WFC is compatible with 802.11b. Because 802.11g and 802.11n routers are also compatible with 802.11b, these routers will work as well, as long as the router's settings are not set to "g only" or "n only". "<br />

            Your post is a little confusing. Are you referring to https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surf3-surfmusic/surface-3-speaker-noise/0b650093-c8b9-435b-9884-71f7333dd312 ? Or a different thread in the community? 

Intermittent issues are the hardest to resolve. 

You can try the diagnostic toolkit https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-the-surface-diagnostic-toolk 

If that does not help, you can certainly visit a physical retail Microsoft Store if you are in the USA for help and possibly and exchange. Before you do that, consider a reimage from a downloadable recovery image to rule out software issues. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage 

If it isn't software and you aren't in the US, contact support for an exchange https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers

<h2>            WSL&#58; How does kernel recognize Pico processes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the presentations about WSL mentioned that when the NT kernel receives a syscall, it first checks if the process in question is a pico process or e.g., a Win32 process. Do you happen to know some internal details behind this step? E.g., which kernel
 data structure is being examined?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Getting MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION bluescreen error while playing Dota 2 game</h2>
                    <p>Old title: MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been playing a game called 'Dota 2' for a while. I had a Macbook Pro before I had this laptop and the game ran perfectly on my mac. I switched over to a new MSI Windows 8.1 laptop a while ago and re-downloaded Dota 2 on it. It happens randomly when
 I'm playing the game, but my whole computer will freeze for a few seconds making a loud buzzing noise and then goes to a blue screen that says MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION. This doesn't happen all the time, it only happens when I am playing Dota 2 and I've had
 this issue, mostly every time I play the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my system info:</p>
<p>https://gyazo.com/bf7b1223e3c83f8443a5f1a92b6e6d8e</p>
<p>(Copy and paste it into your url bar)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you referring issue with Windows 8.1&nbsp;or Windows 10?</li><li>When this happens, did you notice what all applications running on desktop screen?</li><li>Did you make any recent changes to your computer? Like installing Software or Windows Update?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION </strong>bug check has a value of 0x0000009C. This bug check indicates that a fatal machine check exception has occurred. The problem might be with the incompatible or malfunctioning driver. Suggest you to check and update
 all Windows drivers for your device from device manufacturer website. You can search them using Device Model number. Most probably this will fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the above details to assist you better.</p>
<p>

            <p>1. When I bought the laptop, it was Windows 8.1 and I had the issue. I think my computer has automatically updated to Windows 10 or something because in my settings, it says Edition: Windows 10 - I still have the issue with Windows 10 though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I was playing the game, I don't have any apps open other than google, skype, or the game itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I think I only had the Windows update but I had it before the update and now (after the update).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 can&#39;t connect to horizon life on pc and xbox one</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have pre-ordered Forza Horizon 4 ultimate and since the early access release I couldn't join the Horizon Life.</p>
<p>The error message I got "failed to resolve server address,check your dns settings and try again"</p>
<p>So I did that.At first I changed it in the xbox at the network settings(I tried it with the google dns server).It didn't work,so I tried to change it in the router,I set the google dns server as a default gateway,after that I got a different error message(ipsec
 0x0000000)but it didn't say what to do,the first error message had an ipsec error code too(ipsec0x89232001).</p>
<p>The network is fine,I checked it with the multiplayer test connection,my nat is open and I don't have a double nat.</p>
<p>I checked it on pc too.</p>
<p>I only could join with a vpn(avg and avast trial vpn),but the latency is horrible.</p>
<p>I am a costumer of the Hungarian Telekom(T-com) and this is a common problem.Vodafone/kabel has the same problem in Germany and it's present in many country.</p>
<p>I tried to get an answer from the forza support,but they haven't said anything useful.</p>
<p>Every other game works perfectly in multiplayer.</p>
<p>When will this problem solved?</p>

<p>Thank you for bringing&nbsp;the issue to our attention. Are you having these issues on Xbox One and on Windows 10? It sounds like it could be an issue with your internet service provider you may want to contact them. Also take a look at these support articles
 and try some of the listed steps to try and resolve this. <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/multiplayer-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello George!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried those steps and the test says it's all good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention,I already contacted my ISP and they said their technicians looked into it and the dns error isn't real.</p>
<p>One other thin,my cousin is a customer of the same ISP,but he lives in another part of the city and he can join the horizon life,but after every online race,it disconnects him from the online part of the game.He has ipv4&amp;ipv6 at his neighborhood,and I have
 ipv4,this is the only difference.</p>
<p>I bought the digital copy to play it on xbox on s,but I tried it on pc too,because it's a play anywhere title.</p>
<p>The forza support said they know about this issue,but they don't really say anything.</p>
<p>It would be great if there would be an official statement about this from the developers.</p>
<p>I tried everything I found on the forum.</p>

<p>Hello Crystal!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I looked into it,I already had a static ip,and I forwarded all port that is required.Now I don't get the error message,but I can't join the multiplayer.The game is trying to find and join a session,but it can't.Yesterday I waited for 15 minutes,hoping
 it will work.</p>
<p>I doubt that my internet bandwith would be the problem.My internet is 100 mb/s fast,it's not much,but it should be enough.</p>
<p>I am a member in an xbox group on facebook and some members said after the last update they can't play multiplayer either and they are customer of a different ISP.</p>

<p>Hey Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you possibly checked your router settings to see if there is an option to enable IPv6 tunneling? It could be supported in your area but most of the time it's a setting you will need to manually turn on. I would suggest to look over your router manual
 If you have it or look online on the manufacturers website to find a version you can download.</p>

<h3> kalandominick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 WiFi Light Issue</h2>
                    So I have been using Windows 8.1 on my laptop for a few weeks prior to updating to the new Windows 10 update. The WiFi light on my computer case was always a solid color and would only turn off when WiFi was disabled. This morning I started the Windows
 10 update and after the computer restarted and started copying files I noticed the WiFi light status was flashing. I have had the WiFi card for a while and it could be that its time for a replcement however it is still working as I am typing this and it is
 also flashing. I am thinking it has something to do with the new Windows 10 update. I remeber when Ubuntu released there 10.04 version, there was an issue like what I am having, where the OS would make the WiFi light blink on activity? I have a&nbsp;Atheros AR9287,
 anyone have any advice or can explain what is going on.

    <title>Saved game files not transferring between Xbox one&#39;s consoles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thejavabugg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saved game files not transferring between Xbox one&#39;s consoles</h2>
                    I have an external hard drive where I have installed all my games that I will occasionally take to a friend's house. I was playing the 360 Oblivion on my Xbox One and got a good 30 hours into the game and then took the disc and external hard drive to a
 friend's house where I stayed for a while and tacked on about 8 hours of gameplay, saving often throughout. He doesn't have oblivion installed onto his internal hard drive so I would have thought my save games would all be saved to either the cloud or my external
 hard drive. However, when I brought the disc and external hard drive back to my house, I only had the saves that I played on my home Xbox and none of the hours I put in on his Xbox. So like 8 hours behind. If I go back to his house and plug up my external
 again, all my saves are back. I can't figure out how to access the cloud or force a game to save to it. His Xbox says there's no Oblivion data, it's just on my external. On the 360 I could go into storage and see each individual

            I'm not sure saves can be manually moved around to any extent. I know Xbox One games save to a cloud which syncs on any console you play the game on, but I don't think backwards compatible games do. Pair that with the complete inability to move saves between
 storage devices, and, from what I can tell, you're pretty much out of luck. All saves save to&nbsp;<em>Internal</em> by default, regardless of any external drives or the default download location, and I'm not sure that can be overwritten. My best guess, and I'm
 not even sure it'd actually work, would be to transfer the game itself from your drive to your friend's console, then back to your drive and hope that it brings your progress with it when it comes back. just know that I never have tried it, I've never needed
 to transfer backwards compatible saves before. I'm sorry I can't be more help than to say "you can't", I hope someone else comes along with better advice. I'd be very interested to know if it's possible myself. Good luck, vod.

<p>Just be aware that saving Xbox 360 backwards compatible titles is a bit more complicated than "native" Xbox One games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox 360 emulated game has no concept of multitasking or being "suspended", so if you end your Oblivion session like a normal Xbox One game (e.g. simply turning off the console, or pressing the Xbox Button to switch to another game on the Start screen),
 then the console might not be able to get the emulated game in such a state, that it can upload a consistent savegame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to make sure your Xbox 360 games are saved and uploaded properly, make sure that you save the game with the in-game save option, make sure that the save indicator for the game has disappeared, and then quit out of the Xbox 360 game by pressing
 the Xbox button, pressing the Menu button on the main game tile showing the Xbox 360 game, and then choosing "Quit" from the menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you quit the game like this, the Xbox knows the game is now in a consistent state to be synced to the cloud, and if your friends console is online, it should then sync your savegame as well to the cloud, so you should be able to continue where you left
 off at your friends house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just make sure, that if you played on your own console in the mean time, and updated the save, that you don't downlaod that state to your friends console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead play on your friends console and create a newer savegame, that should be "newer" than the last time your console synced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would think this has to do with an Xbox Live connection.&nbsp; The Backwards Compatible game is emulating the Xbox 360 and that includes the Xbox 360 Cloud Save system, which is a different pipeline from the Xbox One, though a similar idea.&nbsp; So when you're
 in the game at your friends house, you should&nbsp; be able to press the "Menu" and "View" buttons (start and select) to pull up the 360 dashboard in the game, and then do some cursory functions via that dashboard, and possibly force the sync of the 360 cloud saves?&nbsp;
 You might need to look at what storage device the saves are set to while on that console., but I can't remember if that is possible in BC games, as I think it only uses Cloud Saves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all that to say I think that it should be saving your 360 BC game saves to the cloud, but if it's not properly connected to Xbox Live, those saves might not be getting uploaded properly.&nbsp; I also remember those save being pretty big, so while you're in
 the game, might want to check available space of your Xbox 360 Cloud Storage, again, different from your Xbox One or console storage.</p>
<p>
