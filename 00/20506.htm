<h2>            scanning of computer suddenly stops</h2>
                    I have successfully downloaded MS Security Essentials but have problems in scanning. Using a Full or Quick scan mode I can scan for a while but then the process just stops dead. Last time, for example, after 3 hrs 41 mins of scanning in which 371049 items
 were scanned, the whole thing just froze, even though the icon in the toolbar at the foot of the screen indicated that scanning was continuing. How can I sort this problem?

            <p>Same Security Essentials hang problem. Yesterday i started to download a manual when other programs also began downloading. Stopped process and removed any programs that showed up in "Uninstall or change" with that day's date. Started full Essentials scan
 and after a half hour PC just stopped - &lt;ctrl&gt;alt del not responsive. Ran check disk including check for bad tracks and apparently no problems (took a couple hours, saw it finish, looked away for a short whole and it continued with windows restart so didn't
 see final report). Ran Essentials scan second time and it hung in a half hour or so again. Ran Essentials third time and it ran several hours hanging when about 90% through. No error reported any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>running Win7, never had any other anti virus, no problems since got this PC in early 2013. Thanks, Ed Fries</p>

<p>Well, there is this though, all three times it hung nothing worked. The cursor wouldn't move, &lt;ctrl&gt;alt Del did nothing (and tried both of these things more than once). The PC was frozen. And the first time the PC froze I went to bed and it was still frozen
 in the morning.</p>
<p>I have had no other problems and it had a long, continuous and successful run when the disk check ran. It's very strange. Any other thoughts? Thanks, Ed</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;should have noted that. My reply was to note what typically happens at 90%. Depending on system resources that can take quite some time and may even make the PC sluggish. I don't know that this is what happened with you. Honestly, I don't have any other
 ideas with the experience you described -- 2 lockups before a successful completion.</p>

            <p>Steve, I wasn't very clear. Essentials failed rock solid all 3 times it ran. PC was unresponsive to everything and had to be rebooted. In between Essential runs I ran check disk specifying "fix bad sectors" and it ran for a long time and apparently successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fear I may have some sort of ugly running on my machine causing the failures but perhaps the next thing to do is to uninstall Essentials and download a fresh one. If you have any other thoughts please let me know or possibly pass this on to someone else.
 Thanks, Ed</p>

<h2>            &#34;Restrict Access&#34; function not visible at all in Office 365</h2>
                    So I need to restrict access for documents I share, in such a way that I can limit how long the document can be seen/used. The thing is, all the eHow-like websites say to click on "Restrict Access" on the Protect Document menu of the Info section, to get
 to that option, but I don't see that option anywhere. Any way to get this option on Microsoft Word?

            It sounds as if these versioned documents were created some time ago, perhaps in an earlier version of Word? Microsoft deprecated versioning in Word 2007 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2007#Word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2007#Word</a>).

<p>Stefan, Suzanne-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that is one of the problems, I think.&nbsp; Notice the 2nd part of my post where I was complaining of not being able to open a lot of documents - they all appear to be linked directly to my wife's OneDrive.&nbsp; So I really don't know what the heck is going
 on there either.&nbsp; Some of them work and others don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, the file which has the JUNK for previous versions is the one that comes off of OneDrive, or at least that is what the link indicates.&nbsp; And now that I think of it, the one file I found that did have previous versions that were legitimate (i.e. not
 the junk snip/clip I sent in my note) was from a local file as opposed to getting our files off of the OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just now realizing how screwed up my wife's computer is with all of it's questionable links to OneDrive.&nbsp; I have files, MANY FILES, in WORD (i.e. load Word, Open, and then start looking at the file names in the Word list) -- and I can't find the files
 anywhere.&nbsp; I can't find them on OneDrive, I can't find them in This PC, I can't even find the folder/directory they are supposed to reside in -- so maybe that is why I am getting all of the "We can't connect to . . . ." errors -- they are gone, don't exist
 any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like I am going to have to spend a lot of more time on this.&nbsp; Yeah, it looks like I am missing folders -- and I KNOW you will deny it, BUT I NEVER, NEVER HAD THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE ONEDRIVE.&nbsp; Are you absolutely sure that OneDrive is ready for prime
 time.&nbsp; YES, this is my frustration coming through (previous versions not working, cannot connect to files and now missing files, directories).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My big problem right now is that I don't have a lot of time to spend on this.&nbsp; My sort-of shot/long range plan is to get a new system and then somehow merge all of my files and all of my wife's files together.&nbsp; As there will likely be a lot of duplicate
 file names in the two systems, the only way I can think to manage this is to have a His Documents and a Her Documents on the new system.&nbsp; I was hoping that I could just copy each Documents directories from each computer onto the new computer, but now that
 I am having all of this files missing nonsense on my wife's computer, I am not sure if this was work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have Carbonite, but that hasn't been of much help either -- was hoping OneDrive would make that need for Carbonite go away, but now I don't know about that either.&nbsp; Yes, again, very frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I will drop out of the complaint mode.&nbsp; I will try to keep up with suggestions that I&nbsp; receive, but as I said I am pretty busy with other things right now, like the 4 separate tax returns I got myself into with trying to help other family members out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks for letting me vent.&nbsp; I guess I will just write-off the previous versions thing as a feature that doesn't work, that truly is not ready for prime time and I will try to figure out how come I have missing files and folders and that being the simple
 explanation as to why I am getting all of the "We cannot connect to . . . ." errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Suzanne (next post), some of these documents were obviously (well maybe not obviously) created with earlier versions of Word (at least 2010 and 2013), but the problems I am having with previous version I am pretty sure were created a couple of years
 ago (created time stamp says Jan, 2016), but that date might have been reset with the movement to files to my wife's new laptop, December 2015.&nbsp; Bottom line is that I really know is happening and&nbsp; why it is not working.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to investigate further, provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the model of your phone?</li><li>What changes did you recently do to your phone?</li><li>Did you reset your phone, then restored your contacts?</li></ul>
<p>Regarding your concern about the email accounts, they have been merged so you will only have to use one server. You can try to remove and re-add the other email accounts. But if you're issue is with the primary account, perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10666/windows-phone-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Reset my phone">hard reset</a></strong>.</p>

</p><p>As for the issue with the MMS, contact your mobile service provider and report the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

            <p>Phone is HTC One M8, recently upgraded from HTC 8x.</p>
<p>Hadn't made any changes to phone. On or around 9/30/16 started noticing texts coming through in duplicate, triplicating, even quadrupling in some cases. Scrolled back to very old texts from different people and they had ALL duplicated. Then noticed that
 all contact photo had suddenly changed to blank squares! Went to look at old HTC 8x, contact photos were still there- then I watched in disbelief as they also disappeared. Viewed to my email accounts, where I had linked same contacts with different photos
 and those too were gone. Saw that all my email addresses had changed to s eas.outlook server and wouldn't allow me to revert back to previous settings. Phone seemed possessed so I performed reset. And of course the only backup available was that current day,
 10/02/16. Once reset, I manually added contact photos but am missing many contact links from secondary email account.</p>

            <p>Most of your issues are caused by Microsoft's Outlook.com to Outlook Mail upgrade in 'the cloud' (it's not a defect on your phones).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some issues and workarounds are listed on this page:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-Outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-Outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft sadly still fail to acknowledge the loss of contact images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option is manually add the images back on one of the phones, then it will sync via the cloud to the other phone on the same account. The contact images are stored along with the other contact details at</p>
<p><a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people</a></p>
<p>The webpage displays the contact images now, but there is still (so far, on my account) no option to add or edit contact images on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact images syncs as they always used to, it's the Outlook Mail upgrade that failed to migrate some user's contact data completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MMS error "Getting Media Content" could be the known issue with MMS to your email address that's listed in the fixes or workarounds link above?<br />
I'm in Europe and don't know how AT&amp;T deliver MMS. Try consult them if the error persists, and ask if 'the APN settings for MMS' are correct on the phone.<br />
AT&amp;T has an option to 'reconnect the phone to the network' which may help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest check each email account regarding which items you want to sync, then in the People app &gt; . . . &gt; Settings - check which accounts are to be displayed?<br />
It can be an awful mess if the contacts have auto-linked multiple duplicates from different sources. :(</p>

            My HTC One M8 is running Windows 8.1 OS. I had already done everything that you mention prior to posting. When I added back my other email accounts (live, hotmail), they automatically revert to the same eas.outlook server. If I try to manually change,
 I receive errors. People hub through web login and in OneDrive is the same as on my phone obviously since the accounts are all linked and when the photos disappeared on devices, they disappeared in the cloud as well. It's just extremely frustrating that all
 of this happened so suddenly and at the same time as other problems appeared, such as the excessive multiplication of texts (new and old) along with MMS issues. Had already contacted my provider and ultimately was recommended to do a reset. This helped with
 the ability to view new incoming MMS but still am unable to open older and previously viewed MMS, where it freezes on the "Getting media content..." Mind you, NONE of this was an issue until the recent MS update I've read about which screwed

            <p>Apologies. I assumed that your phone is running on an operating system not supported by the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshot that <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a59c8572-3147-4828-8564-dd0e9957443a" title="hpholm">
hpholm</a> provided showing contacts having images, must be a Skype contact. I forgot to mention that Skype contacts will still have images if viewed in the mentioned web app, if the user/owner of the account provided one. Restoring your
<strong>phone</strong> contacts from a backup, will only download the basic contact information. If you try to add a phone contact using the aforementioned web app, you will only be able to add the basics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screenshots of the People web app, when one you tries to add a contact:</p>

<p>
</p><p>As for using a different email protocol for your secondary email account, below is a screenshot on a friend's phone running on the Windows Phone 8.1 operating system:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2248228e-14c9-45cb-9221-33a26abeaa1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2248228e-14c9-45cb-9221-33a26abeaa1c" height="475" width="285" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>She is using the IMAP4 email protocol for her email account. The settings by the way, can be found under the
<strong>Advanced settings</strong>. Add your secondary email account as <strong>Other account</strong> or use the
<strong>Advanced setup</strong> option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern about the MMS messages. The media sent to you, are delivered via your service provider. They have control over the media content that you receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bogus contacts in the screenshot are added manually to my Outlook primary Microsoft account on the phone for testing, and sync'ed to the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did a hard reset, did not restore a backup, added the same Microsoft account to the phone - and the contacts sync'ed back to the phone, including the images, as expected, and like it has always done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some users report lost contact images, lost groups of people, lost custom ringtones, lost multimedia content in backed up MMS, lost or corrupted calendar entries etc.<br />
All after the Outlook.com &gt; Outlook Mail upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please escalate or have somebody escalate these issues.<br />
It's loss of personal data and preferences, it deserves priority in my opinion.<br />
An official acknowledgement is the least Microsoft can do.</p>

            <p>At this point I'd just like to be able to view my backed up mms and SMS attachments. Can view all new incoming so obviously isn't a carrier settings issue! Had been able to see older multimedia content previous to the Microsoft /Outlook update. Have also
 backed up/restored on Windows phone in the past and never had this issue. Same goes for contact photos and links- never been a problem getting them back. This recent"update" has really messed things up for a lot of users and something needs to be done by MS
 to fix this!</p>

    <title>Two sent folders in outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenalfonso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two sent folders in outlook</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with my Sent folder in Outlook - I have two of them on my work computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are:</p>
<p><strong>"Sent Items"</strong> - emails sent from my work computer saves under this folder on this computer only, nowhere else so cannot be accessed by my personal comp or phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Sent"</strong> - no email sent from my work computer saves under the "Sent" folder. Only emails sent from my personal computer and phone is saved under this folder. However this folder syncs across my work and personal computers and phone via this
 folder&nbsp;therefore can be accessed by all three.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails saved under the "Sent" folder does not sync with or save in the "Sent Items" folder in my work computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal computer and phone has only the "Sent" folder, no "Sent Items".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue is that the emails sent from my work computer which are saved under "Sent Items" cannot be accessed from my personal comp or phone. I want all of my emails to fall under the "Sent" folder only so that all of my emails sync properly - how can I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the "Advanced" settings (File &gt; Account Setting &gt; More Settings &gt; Advanced) my root folder path is "inbox", under the "Outgoing Server" settings, I "use same setting as my incoming mail server".</p>

            <p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is your Outlook account connected to the domain? Is it a Microsoft account or some other account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that you have an IMAP account, as this issue occurs with IMAP account. I would suggest you to setup your account in Exchange Active Sync (EAS) and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, you can refer to the suggestions provided in the following thread:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-outlook/outlook-2013-imap-incorrect-sent-deleted-folders/2036bfff-8049-4922-8393-6c2bc057749f">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-outlook/outlook-2013-imap-incorrect-sent-deleted-folders/2036bfff-8049-4922-8393-6c2bc057749f</a></p>

<h2>            Missing Notes in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I wonder if anyone can help me please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to have my laptop repaired (Win 8.1) and backed up my .pst files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is now back and I have re-installed Outlook 2013 and opened the .pst file. I can see my Contacts but have no Notes for each Contact which is very important for me to have. I have seen the posts to try to get them back but the solutions recommended
 do not work for me (or I am not doing them correctly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My e-mail address that synchs with Outlook 2013 on my laptop is an outlook.com e-mail address. Any help much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I cannot believe that individuals have to go through this to get a product like Outlook working properly.</p>

<h3> timothywhitler  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 9 has a black bar on the right side and I have to put the pointer further to the right to click on links.  How can I fix this&#63;</h2>
                    I just recently installed IE9 and there is a black bar on the right side of the screen. The pointer on the screen needs to be placed about 2 centimeters to the right of the link I want to press in order to click on it. When i wan't to insert text it also
 places the cursor further to the left than where I click on the screen.&nbsp; It is as if I am seeing the screen shifted to the left and the computer is still recognizing the screen as if it is in the correct position.&nbsp; In order to use the scroll bar to see further
 down the page I need to actually put the pointer in the black bar on the side (where the scroll bar SHOULD BE).

            <p>It appears in IE9 that the screen has shifted over a little less than half-an inch on the right. As soon as I close or minimize the program the screen appears normal. This happens on every website and only in the IE9 window. The top header bar and the bottom
 Windows taskbar remain complete so it is not a graphics problem. This began when I was trying to navigate in Google Maps. I saw post on some troubles Google had with Maps when IE9 was first released but this seems different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried resetting IE9 through the Advanced Options, but this has not solved the problem. Any help on this would be great. I'm going to download Firefox which I don't expect will have this problem as no other program does. I may try deleting and reinstalling
 IE9 to see if that fixes it.</p>

            Found a fix. Uninstall the IE9 update! I'm fine in IE8. Haven't tried to go back to IE9 and don't know when I will if it's buggy.

            Hey Frank, I was having the same problem here. Try this, open IE and minimize it, then change the resolution to 1360 x 768, maximize IE windows and check, then get back to recommended resolution (1366 x 768) and check again if it worked. This happened
 when I connected my laptop to HDMI TV or it was when I used a software called Hotmail in IE. Anyway, try it and let us know.<br />

<h2>            restricted editing blocking some text boxes</h2>
                    I have a form that I created and some of the text boxes once I put the restrict editing on will not allow filling out these text boxes.&nbsp; The text boxes at the top of the form work correctly but when I try and select the text box to enter information it
 just jumps back to one of the controls at the top.&nbsp; It works great until I put on the protection not sure what is going on.

<p>
</p><p>1. What kind of "text boxes" are in the form? There are "content controls", "legacy text form fields", and "ActiveX text boxes", all in the Controls group of the Developer tab. (Note that none of these are related to the text boxes you can create from the

            Forms restriction is not required for ActiveX forms (and in fact, as you've seen, does not work). In fact, however, some of your controls look like Content Controls, and it also appears that you are in Design Mode.

            <p>Michael, Suzanne is correct on all counts. The items that say "Click here to ..." or "Choose an item", enclosed in blue shapes, are content controls. The ones that are just black rectangles are ActiveX fields. The fact that you can see the blue shapes of
 the content controls indicates that Design Mode is turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two ways to fix the form so it works. Which way is preferable depends on whether the form should be usable in Word 2003 and earlier. Only versions of 2007 and later can use content controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, first turn off the protection, because you can't manipulate the boxes while it's turned on. Also click the Design Mode button in the Developer tab to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all users have at least Word 2007, delete all of the rectangular boxes and replace each one with a content control, either a Rich Text or a Plain Text control. It appears that you've used a borderless table to align many of the boxes. That's good; if
 there is a table, continue to use it, otherwise insert a table (or several tables) and place each control in a separate cell.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Group content control, which surrounds the entire form and is invisible when Design Mode is turned off, performs the same function as the forms protection would -- preventing editing of the text that's not within one of the other content controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If some users of Word 2003 must be able to use the form, then you have to go the other way: Delete each content control and replace it with a legacy form field, and replace each ActiveX text box with a legacy form field. (ActiveX controls are really not
 very good in Word forms and should be avoided wherever possible.) The "Area" item will have to be replaced by a Dropdown form field. Unfortunately, there is no form field equivalent to the date picker content control, so that will have to be replaced with
 a text form field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to remove the Group content control by clicking the Group button in the Developer tab and clicking the Ungroup item in the menu. After all the entry points have been converted to form fields, apply the "Filling in forms" editing restriction to make
 the form fields work.</p>

            <p>Everyone using the form will be using word 2010 so that will not be a problem.&nbsp; I can try changing to a plain text control.&nbsp; I have code in there to make the specific actions text boxes actually need to grow as the text grows so I put in a textbox.height
 = textbox.linecount * 18 in there to make them grow.&nbsp; Will that work with the plain text control as well?</p>

            <p>You don't need that code with content controls. They'll grow taller automatically. However, they'll also grow wider automatically unless you put them into table cells, and that will destroy the alignment of the rows of data. In other words, you really do
 need the table (or maybe more than one, or you can play with merging cells).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two details are important: (1) If you use Plain Text content controls, by default they won't allow multiple paragraphs in any one control; pressing Enter inside a Plain Text control does nothing. If you need to allow multiple paragraphs, click inside the
 control, click the Properties button on the Developer tab, and check the box for "Allow carriage returns". (2) When you use a table to contain the controls, don't set any specific height for the rows. The default for row height is "At Least", and then the
 height will grow as needed. It's possible to set a row height to "Exactly" and prevent the height from increasing, but you generally don't want to do that.</p>

            Click <strong>Design Mode</strong> in the <strong>Controls</strong> group on the
<strong>Developer</strong> tab, and you can edit the placeholder text to be anything you want. You can't get rid of it entirely (Word will give you an error message when you try to turn off Design Mode), but you can leave only a single space. For plain-text
 controls (especially in a table), this may be sufficient since <strong>Tab</strong> will advance to the next control, but you could also consider using more visible text that indicates what should be entered in the control.

            <p>I'm having a similar problem and Design Mode is not the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table inside a text box. &nbsp;I spent a few hours inserting date and plain text controls into certain cells in the table, in the text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can fill the form out with no restriction but when I apply "Filling in Forms" restriction I cannot. &nbsp;I've made a short and concise video showing this problem.</p>

<h2>            Mail merge opens and closes my bookmark document repeatedly in Word 2007 </h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have a number of documents that contain this kind of code for multiple fields (with matching bookmarks):</p>
<p><strong>{IF {MERGEFIELD "field1"}&lt;&gt;"" "INCLUDETEXT "X:\\path\Bookmarks.doc" { MERGEFIELD "field1"} \*MERGEFORMAT" ""}</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I used to execute a merge in it was almost&nbsp;instantaneous&nbsp;but since upgrading to Word 2007 I see a popup that says 'Opening&nbsp;<strong>"X:\\path\Bookmarks.doc"</strong>' for seemingly every field on each page. &nbsp;A mail merge that has up to 20 fields for
 multiple records can take hours to run.</p>
<p>If the bookmark document (e.g.,&nbsp;<strong>"X:\\path\Bookmarks.doc" </strong>from above) is open while I execute the merge the popup doesn't appear and the merge is almost&nbsp;instantaneous&nbsp;again. &nbsp;Is there a setting that I can change so that the merge keeps the
 bookmark document open for the duration of the merge?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Inviting people to view my Sway - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicsota  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inviting people to view my Sway</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create a 'view' link to share my Sway. However, when I create the link, it appears in the 'storyline' view, ready for editing.
</p>
<p>I have shared Sways many times before and I cannot work out what I'm doing wrong this time.</p>
<p>These are the steps I take:</p>
<p>- select 'share' from the top right corner</p>
<p>- select 'those in your organisation with the link'</p>
<p>- select 'invite people to <strong>view'</strong></p>
<p>- then I copy and paste the link to another browser or email, but just keeps opening in editing mode (storyline).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>            Artist Name and Track Order not copied when I Synch to a Micro SD Card</h2>
                    I have been syncing music using Windows Media Player to my micro SD card for many years without problem. Now when I sync an album on to the card, it says "unknown artist" on the card and the tracks copied are in alphabetic order instead of the track order
 on the album. This has only been happening for about a month. Can someone please tell me why this is happening and how to fix it?

<p>You may find that if you go to the ripped files in your music folder, and check the 'Properties' - details tab</p>
<p>that some information is missing.... try adding the missing&nbsp;info there and see if that changes things particularly in the 'Description' and 'Media' fields - I should have asked which format you usually rip in too! - You should see something&nbsp;similar to this
 screenshot....</p>

            I am using MP3 files. I usually copy a bunch of files and the on album, change the track numbers and album name and artist. (Example: Album: Dylan Live Oakland 1/17/74 and artist: Bob Dylan) That worked for years. Now it copies as unknown artist and not
 in track order. Weird.

    <title>Installation Security Error. Unable to install. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dborg01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installation Security Error. Unable to install.</h2>
                    The subject says it all. I am getting that message when I try to install the PC Suite support in the mobile phone.<br />
<br />
But let me give you an overview of the situation. Together with my friend we bought a Nokia 6680 each on October 5th. His phone works and worked well ever since. Mine re-started something like 30 times between the time I first turned it on and the following
 morning. It even restarted twice while still in the shop!! When I told the guy at the shop about it and he told me to wait a few months then he'll upgrade the firmware.<br />
I came home and found that a firmware upgrade already exists in the Nokia website. I followed the instructions and few days later I did the installation. In the meantime I tried using the phone with the Multimedia Card but it still re-started a lot of times.<br />
I did the firmware upgrade and at first seemed to work well until a few hours later....it began to re-start again.<br />
I went to Club Nokia point and they installed the firmware themselves and even tested it under warranty. But after a few hours it began to restart again.<br />
So they changed it and now I am a happy customer...until a few minutes later when I try to install the PC Suite support from the phone and the phone starts to give me the above message. Before they changed it I formatted the Multimedia Card that was included
 with the phone.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me as to what I can do? I followed other posts and have already checked the Menu &gt; Tools &gt; App. Manager &gt; Settings &gt; Software Installation = On / Online certif. check = Off<br />
<br />
Still I have no luck. And your help will be highly appreciated as this is my first Nokia and after spending LM155 (around 357 Eur / £233 / US$434) I am devastated to find that I still cannot work properly with my phone after 15 days I bought it!<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

            i guess you try to install pc suite support. It is a SIS package, where di you get it from ? It is not supposed to be a separate stand alone SIS, but a piece of Nokia PC suite tat activates itself in certain situations. So please desribe in detail what
 you do.

            Please start by listing the System Info in Pc Suite - Help - About Pc Suite.<br />
<br />
Then describe in detail how you try to install the support and exactly what type of error message you get (how it fails?)<br />
<br />
Also tell if the phone software is somehow potentially failing (is the phone straight from shop, does it have warranty or ...)

            Hello, terryrica.
<br />
<br />If you worry about your Skype account, follow these steps:
<br />1. Be sure that you know your Skype account name (email, other alias etc)
<br />2. Be sure that you know your password.
<br />3. Save contacts follow this guide: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34851/how-do-i-export-a-list-of-my-skype-contacts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34851/how-do...</a>
<br />4. If you keep some other important data (video, picture etc), it would be better to safe it as well.
<br />5. Export chat history: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA392/how-do-i-manage-my-conversation-history-in-skype-for-windows-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA392/how-do-i...</a>
<br />
<br />Following these step everything would be saved. At this moment I din't meet this hard scenarios with data lost, only unhappyness with new design.

            Yes, Starter is actually "installed" inside of the CTR, so nuking the CTR will cause it problems.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of ways to get it back:<br />
<b><span>HP instructions on Office Starter Repair, Program Manager, Uninstall Starter and Re-install Starter via Program Manager in Pictures</span></b>
<div>
<p>
The best instructions I've seen for "fixing" Office Starter are this HP page:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c02981221#N272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c02981221#N272</a></span></p>
<p><span>Starter is not actually installed on your computer. It runs inside of a “virtual computer” located in the “Q:\” drive and the program code is downloaded over the internet every time the program is started. Therefore there
 are limited things we as users can do to "fix" starter:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Run an Office Repair on Starter</span></p>
<p><span><span>23.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Use "MS Office Manager" to re-install Starter from the Windows program Manager</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Re-install WINDOWS from the recovery partition, wiping all installed programs and personal data files!</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Phone the OEM who supposed to support Starter. They will tell you to do steps 1-4 and then lie to you and tell you to call MS!</span></p>

            <p>Hello Joel:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the language display of Bing news on your phone.&nbsp; I have done some testing on this and will provide you what I have found to successfully change the display language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone is natively set up to English, US.&nbsp; I can find the phones current configuration by going to settings &gt; region + language.&nbsp; When I have it set to English/English(US), I find Bing news in English.&nbsp; I accessed Bing news by going to Internet Explorer
 and typing in bingnews.com.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to get Bingnews to display in Spanish.&nbsp; I did this by going to settings &gt; region + language and setting this to Espanol/Spanish(Mexico) and then tapping the option to restart the phone.&nbsp; When the phone reboots it is entirely in Spanish and that
 includes Bingnews.&nbsp; When you are making these changes, go to the very bottom and verify that the search/browse language is also set to English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are doing the above and do not notice changes throughout the phone and your browser, try clearing your Internet and search history.&nbsp; You can do this by going to settings &gt; applications &gt; Internet Explorer/Search &gt; tap delete history.&nbsp; After you do
 this, set the region/language setting of your phone and restart the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Using a combination of Outlook rules and vba script, we know how to get the attachments copied to specific network folders, with each attachment saved as a unique file by including the subject, date/time stamp, and original attachment name as the name of
 the saved attachment.</p>

</p><p>Using a macro, we know how to selectively create a pdf version of the Outlook message to specific network folders. &nbsp;This is currently a manual process involving the selection of a single message to save as pdf, and then selecting the network folder.</p>

            <p>It is relatively straightforward to use a macro to save an e-mail message as PDF, but it is a whole different ballgame to save the attachments from that message, created by disparate applications, as PDF, let alone combine them into a single PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a start Office does not provide a process that will merge PDF files, so you are going to have to consider using third-party software that can be driven by VBA and which will combine PDFs. PDFCreator and Acrobat immediately spring to mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you are going to have to be able to drive an application for each type of attachment from VBA, in order to open the attachments as temporary files so that they may be printed to the third party PDF tool to create the individual PDFs that will later
 be combined. That's a big enough ask, as by no means all the attachments you may receive are likely to be from applications that are VBA compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to save messages with their attachments, surely it would be preferable to save them in msg format from which they can be opened at any time in Outlook?</p>

<h3> sylverboss  say:</h3>
<h2>            E61&#58; SIP NOT WORKING &#63;</h2>
                    I wonder if the SIP is really working on Nokia E61.. no chance to get it connected even after reading most of the recommandations on this forum.<br />
<br />
The SIP provider is freeipcall.com, but always having "registration failed" on the phone. I also tried using the IP address of the SIP server but on the other side the sip trace doesn't show any request coming in from the phone. WLAN connectivity is working
 fine, i can surf the web.<br />
<br />
sip proxy: sip.freeipcall.com<br />
<br />
Is there a proper way to get connected via SIP? please let me know if i forgot something or misconfigured it. Does anyone managed to get SIP working?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

            OK - I've played around with my E61 for hours and hours now. The only way I can get the SIP client to work is to use a user without a password (I can do this as I am running my own VoIP SIP server). It doesn't work if you require a password for your SIP
 account.<br />
<br />
I am more than enraged that Nokia ships a phone with a SIP client they do not support that is of such lousy quality.<br />
<br />
Outgoing calls take a minute to connect, the automatic re-connection doesn't work if you leave the WLAN, etc. They didn't even test this.<br />

            E61 and Vonage<br />
I could succesfully register with my E61 and Vonage but I can't make any calls.<br />
The phone says it registered and there is an icon showing on the screen with a phone and a globe.<br />
<br />
When I try to make a call it throws me an error saying Address not in use.<br />
<br />
Any Ideas what else could be wrong?<br />

            Replace proxy address DNS-name with IP address:<br />
<br />
Sip protocol requires IP address in route field and this client cannot resolve the address.<br />
<br />
It might work also without proxy address.<br />
Registrar server address is required to be DNS-NAME<br />
<br />
Make sure that you are not using Speedstream 6500 series adsl model+wlan.. It has faulty SIP ALG impelmentation.

            I tried these exact same settings and my E60 will not register. I'm begining to think that there's something wrong with the software in my phone. I wish it were possible for me to just reinstall the operating system like I do when Windows acts up.<br />

            Hi All,<br />
<br />
For all the people wondering why SIP over WAN is not working, here is the reply I received from NOKIA support.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm receiving a descent answer as I told them that I'm a sys admin @ FreeIPCall, so... unfortunately we will have to wait before making SIP calls over WAN.<br />
<br />

<br />
--- Dear Sir/Madam Thank you for contacting the Club Nokia Careline. I am writing regarding your enquiry about using a Nokia E-series phone for VOIP calls.<br />
<br />
In the first phase, your Nokia device has been designed to be used with a SIP based VoIP server which resides on the same side of the firewall as the phone, for example inside company premises.<br />
<br />
Mobile VoIP telephony is unique compared to the fixed VoIP telephony, because users expect to be able to use their mobile phones in multiple different spaces, such as in the office, at home or with a WLAN hotspot. Hence the VoIP phone call should be able to
 cross different kinds of firewalls on its way to the server. In order to be able to do this, a method called Network Address Translation (NAT) is needed to translate different IP addresses on different sides of the firewall. Your Nokia device does not currently
 support a technique to enable the crossing of the firewall (called NAT traversal).<br />
<br />
Your Nokia device supports compatible enterprise voice solutions from Avaya and Cisco which operate inside the company firewall and hence do not require NAT traversal.<br />
<br />
We are working on ways to enable the NAT traversal. Our current plan is to build support for the most common methods for NAT traversal, called STUN, TURN and ICE. STUN support is expected to become available during 2006, and TURN and ICE during 2007.<br />
<br />
Please don't hesitate to contact us again if you have any further questions.<br />
<br />
Yours faithfully<br />
<br />

            From the answer is not very clear to me if NAT traversal will be made available for the current, shipped E61 (as a new version of a downloadable application or firmware) or if will be incorporated in new devices or new version of the current devices.<br />
<br />
In other terms, if i buy an E61 today, will it be able to do SIP over NAT next year, or will i need to buy a new telephone ?<br />

            right now, nokia is saying that the e-series phones will not work over nat. i will say this is true, i have an e61 but cannot work it for sip at home, only at work where our sip server is on the same side as the firewall as me.<br />
<br />
other people though, mention that they cannot connect when the server is on the same side of the firewall as them...

<br />
Well, they say the e-series do not work now, not that it will not work. If you take the text posted by silverboss, you find:<br />
<br />
&gt;In the first phase, your Nokia device has been designed to be<br />
&gt; used with a SIP based VoIP server which resides on the same<br />
&gt; side of the firewall as the phone, for example inside<br />
&gt;company premises.<br />
<br />
OK, so it doesn't work. The real question is: what is this first phase, and what is the second phase. Down in the answer you'll find:<br />
<br />
&gt;We are working on ways to enable the NAT traversal. Our<br />
&gt; current plan is to build support for the most common methods<br />
&gt; for NAT traversal, called STUN, TURN and ICE. STUN support<br />
&gt;is expected to become available during 2006, and TURN and ICE<br />
&gt; during 2007.<br />
<br />
Ok then: ways to enable NAT traversal for which devices ? The current e-series ? Will phase two be a firmware upgrade,<br />
or a new device family ?<br />
<br />
For me, being eventually able to use VoIP is a major buy criteria.<br />
<br />
Any idea ?<br />

            Ehm, i answer to my post :-&gt;<br />
<br />
I saw that the answer provided by the UK support is now included in the FAQ regarding the E61.<br />
This means the plan they mentions regard specifically the E61, and so i suppose we can assume we will get a firmware update supporting NAT traversal.<br />
