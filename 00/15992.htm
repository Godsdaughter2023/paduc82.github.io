<p>If the document contains markup, it will print. You can't really get around that, except that you can hide the markup on your computer by selecting the appropriate options in Trust Center (those settings do not apply when you send the document to someone
 else).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are referring to the List of Markup option in the File | Print interface, that is a different story. It can be deselected.</p>

<h3> jarrodlilly  say:</h3>
<h2>            INCLUDEIMAGE Field doesn&#39;t show image on load until the placeholder is clicked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made a document using images that update from the web. My idea is to make is so when the word document opens the images load and are updated then to have the document automatically convert to a pdf, save to dropbox, and email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is fine except when the document loads the images do not show until I go and click on each individual placeholder. I've tried an auto open macro I found but had the same result. The images load on the page because I cannot click them until they do but
 they do not show on the page until clicked. I just see a place holder. This is what it looks like. Thank you for any help!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't think there is any method of doing this with a button on the worksheet.</p>
<p>You could create a Userform with a button on it. You can size the userform down to the size of the button but you will still be able to see the bar at the top of the userform.</p>

 even after reinstalling Office 2013. Is there any setting or remedy for this?

    <title>Cortana Limitations Build 9926 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerry purvis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana Limitations Build 9926</h2>
                    <p>I played around with Cortana quite a bit recently to see what she could and could not do.&nbsp; I suspect that some limitations are due to Build and they will be enabled as we get further along, but that's only suspicion, and this could be just a problem with
 my setup.&nbsp; These are also some suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Chatting with Cortana is not NATURAL.&nbsp; Before I say anything to her, I have to constantly say "Hey Cortana"&nbsp; and if I just pause for a second, she stops listening.&nbsp; So it's always "Hey Cortana, what's the weather" or "Hey Cortana, check stocks", etc.&nbsp; I
 also have to speak it really fast.&nbsp; If I just pause for a second, she stops listening.
<ol>
<li>Allow her to keep listening until I say something like "Goodbye Cortana" or allow us to adjust the time she listens before turning herself off due to no activity.</li><li>Allow us to have different custom commands for turning her off/on.&nbsp; For instance, in the morning, I might like to say "Good morning Cortana" or just simply say "Hello Cortana" and to turn her off, I might like to say "See you later Cortana" or "Goodnight
 Cortana"</li></ol>
</li><li>Currently, it seems that Cortana can do only two things.&nbsp; Search the web and check the weather.&nbsp; This may be an issue you are aware of, but I have not found it in the forums anywhere.&nbsp; No matter what commands I try, it always searches bing instead of doing
 the said command.&nbsp; Won't navigate, won't open an application or go to a specific website. Won't open calendar or schedule Won't do anything other than search bing or check weather.</li></ol>

            <p>Makes one suspicious that the demo of Cortana for the Jan 21 presentation was totally staged.&nbsp; It was not software responding but a person behind the curtain using a keyboard. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly, Cortana is not ready for prime time.&nbsp; It, not she, is one more demonstration that AI is something we don't yet know how to program a computer to deliver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn Cortana off and delete the search bar.&nbsp; Use what worked in Windows 7.&nbsp; You will be much more satisfied with the results.</p>

 world". </p>
<p>If you think that "Use what worked in Windows 7" is the answer,please,go back to windows 7,stop testing this!</p>

            <p>The one capability you can add to "searching Bing" and "checking the weather", is time-based reminders. On the PC, she understands "Remind me to post the letter at 3pm".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Lumia 1020, however,&nbsp;she is much more capable. She can do location-based reminders, such as "When I get to work, remind me to phone John" --&nbsp;she reminds me just as I'm coming through my workplace entrance. Also, "Wake me up in 20 minutes" (sets an
 alarm 20 mins from now). And "When Roger calls, remind me to tell him about the presentation". She can add an appointment to my diary and it gets synced straight away to Outlook on my PC. She can also, optionally,&nbsp;scan messages/emails and will highlight dates
 and times to add them as appointments to my calendar (but this is done without voice interaction, and only when I tap the highlighted text).</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS made a mistake in releasing Cortana on the PC with such a basic feature set compared to what she does on the phone. They set up huge expectations, and this is causing frustration to people who haven't experienced how useful she can be. I sincerely hope
 the next build will put this right.</p>

<p>&nbsp;No and I never will.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want a phone to be, gosh, an actual phone which can be used to make a receive voice phone calls.&nbsp; Can you imagine that?&nbsp; I don't need nor want something that has a poor excuse for a camera and web browser using a miniature screen.&nbsp;
 If that is what you want, you can have it and go with my blessing.&nbsp; However, don't berate me for wanting an OS that can do more than make my wrist watch talk to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am forced to make use of Windows 10 because I develop and support a major workstation software package (&gt; 1 gig SDK that I have&nbsp; been developing since 1985) that must use Windows.&nbsp; Microsoft, in its divine wisdom, has decreed that all OS's prior to Windows
 8.1 are DOA and are no longer well supported nor available for purchase and installation on new hardware.&nbsp; Hence, I must make Windows 8.1 do until Microsoft kills it.&nbsp; Which, by the way, will be shortly after Windows 10 is released.&nbsp; Then after that, I must
 use Windows 10.&nbsp; Somehow, I must make it a viable Desktop Workstation OS for development and customer use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That means I must find what works and what doesn't and not use what doesn't work.&nbsp; I must add the minimum necessary to make it a viable development workstation for my use and a viable workstation for my customers' use.&nbsp; Cortana is not yet a viable functionality
 for me or my customers. Hence I have disabled it.&nbsp; It is irrelevant to me that you find it so useful&nbsp; on your so called a "smart phone".&nbsp; When it becomes more than the person behind the curtain, I might take another look at it.&nbsp; Until then, it will receive
 no more attention from me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming they are going to make Cortana useful, so I will use it until Win 10 is finalized. &nbsp;If it's still not useful, THEN I will remove it. &nbsp;That way, they had every opportunity to use feedback gathered from people using Cortana (as well as my feedback).</p>

            I actually really love the idea of Cortana being integrated into Windows 10.&nbsp; The possibilities of what she could do are virtually limitless if the feature is done right.&nbsp; Allow us to give her custom commands to get her to do whatever we want her to do.&nbsp;
 Search Wikipedia for information on Abraham Lincoln?&nbsp; Sure, why not?&nbsp; Need to just send a quick message to someone letting them know you are on your way?&nbsp; "Hey Cortana, send Jerry on Facebook a message letting him know I'm on my way"&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I don't expect complete AI functionality, but when the functionality is integrated into the OS instead of a third-party app, there are some amazing possibilities if Microsoft will allow it!<br />

            Hi Rani,<br />
<br />
One of the possible reasons why you can't activate your Office is because the version of your Office have changed. We suggest that you completely uninstall Office and reinstall it using the email and password associated with the Microsoft account that was used
 to install Office 2016 Home and Business. To uninstall Office from your computer, you can follow the steps on this

    <title>Windows 10 changed my default Office version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> afab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 changed my default Office version</h2>
                    I have two versions of Office on several computers in my home office -- Office 2016 that was presinstalled as a demo version and Office 2010 that I installed and own. Today (7/17/18) all of my systems went crazy. When we click on a file that is associated
 with an Office app -- either from a folder or sitting on the desktop, the wrong version of Office opens. it's the newest version for which I don't have a license and it tells me that as of tomorrow, I won't be able to use those apps anymore. I can click the
 icon for Office 2010 but why should I -- it was set as the default already. Now when i try to change default apps, I just see icons of multiple Windows apps with no identifier as to which version it is. This is extremely annoying.

<h2>            Expand Group not working when assigning a workflow task</h2>
                    
<p>Using the out of the box workflow for Collect Feedback in our SharePoint Online site, if we assign the workflow to a domain group, choose parallel assignment, and tick the checkmark to expand groups (so a task is assigned to everyone in that group), it doesn't
 work. There are no errors, but it also doesn't assign any tasks to any one. I've read multiple threads where this question was asked, but never one with a resolution. Is this a known bug, and if so, is there any timeline for when or if it'll ever be fixed?</p>

<p>Hi SummerPrisock,</p>
<p>To clarify the situation, I'd like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1. More information about the "domain group" you mentioned.<br />
I find only security group members can receive email notifications after doing some test with Collect Feedback-SharePoint 2010 template.</p>
<p>Here are some types of groups for your reference:<br />
Security group &amp; Distribution group:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-za/article/Create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group-55c96b32-e086-4c9e-948b-a018b44510cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group-55c96b32-e086-4c9e-948b-a018b44510cb</a></p>
<p>SharePoint group:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ca/article/Create-and-manage-SharePoint-groups-b1e3cd23-1a78-4264-9284-87fed7282048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Create-and-manage-SharePoint-groups-b1e3cd23-1a78-4264-9284-87fed7282048</a></p>
<p>2. Please provide us with detailed steps of the workflows you created so that we can try to reproduce the issue from our side for investigation.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Hale</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>It's a global security group, synced from our local AD to Office 365. The reason for calling it "Domain Group" is because SharePoint Online labels it as that type from the permission screen on the site. This group is also being used to control access to
 the same site where the workflow is running. It only has 12 members/users in the group currently. If you examine the group properties from O365 it's labeled as a security group (clearly).
</p>
<p>The workflow is just the out of the box collect feedback workflow (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/All-about-Collect-Feedback-workflows-e0443930-6a88-4f71-ac4e-6ab591225066)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../All-about-Collect-Feedback-workflows-e0443930-6a88-4f71-ac4e-6ab591225066)</a>.
 It is being initiated manually on the file at the time the user chooses to run it. On the initiation form you have the ability to assign it to a person or group. We choose this security group, leave the order as "All at once (parallel)" and tick the checkmark
 to Expand Groups, so that a task is assigned to every individual member the group contains.

<p>hi summerprisock,</p>
<p>thank you for your clarification.</p>
<p>i notice that the group is synced from your local ad to office 365, you can try creating a new security group via the steps below to see if the issue is related to it.</p>
<p>go to your office 365 admin center &gt; group &gt; <a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7b17740a-9a80-479a-8ae8-6e62d9f843e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
</p>

<p>hi summerprisock,</p>
<p>we have received the information and ruled out the possibility being caused by a service interruption.</p>
<p>to narrow down the issue, please share with us the points below:</p>
<p>1. does it work for individual user except entire group members?</p>
<p>2. which method do you choose to start the workflow with?<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1826f2c8-d2aa-41ee-bb20-e60d155e0223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d1826f2c8-d2aa-41ee-bb20-e60d155e0223" /></a><br />
if choose the first option to start the workflow manually, have you tried to check the box for the name of the file &gt; files &gt; workflows?<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=99137515-e505-4b3a-9df0-4c0dbd41d7fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d99137515-e505-4b3a-9df0-4c0dbd41d7fe" /></a></p>

<p>Yes, it will assign the workflow to individual users. Groups are the problem. It is set to be allowed to be manually started, just as you have indicated in your screen grab. Method for initiating the workflow has included both the ribbon, as you've indicated
 in your screen grab as well as using the drop down menu associated with the file individually as well.

<h2>            Synchronizing Outlook and Nokia- calenders&#47;contacts</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 on my laptop and desktop. On both I run Outlook 2010.<br />
<br />
I <strong>recently updated/removed duplicates/consolidated my contacts on Outlook 2010 as well as all the birthdays</strong>, etc in my Outlook calender. There were numerous duplicates and I managed to clear them, exporting it to Excel. I also re-set my times
 for birthday reminders, as some went off in ther middle of the night. I think this happened. as I was usind Nokia PC Suite and in the bast have backed up more than one phone to the suite.<br />
<br />
I have a Nokia E63 and downloaded Nokia Ovi Suite (3.0.0.284).<br />
<br />
<font color="#888888">I synchronized my new phone</font> and needless to say, I have numerous duplicates on my phone again, but what is very irritating is that there are few reminders for a single birthday, each reminder goung off at a different time.<br />
<br />
Is there a good way once and for all delete duplicate contacts, merge contacts and delete duplicate reminders? It feels as if one should have a "central point" where everything is stored, I am not sure what programmes are available, but Google also displays
 birthdays and send a reminder to my omwn (not a gmail) address)<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I backed it up on the Ovi website, which will also need to be cleaned!<br />
<br />
Any help please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a good tutorial, etc, please let me know, as I will need step by step instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of your browser addon(s) (Google toolbar) that has popup blocker functionality. You don't need 2 popup blocker programs.... disable/uninstall the Google toolbar or other browser addons that you don't need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your IE security settings (which in turn determine how popup windows are opened).</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>The website you are visiting is programmed that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible please include links to problem websites with your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are a web site programmer, post programming and network management questions about IE to the appropriate MSDN or TechNet support forums. Include a link to your website or a jsfiddle mashup with your questions.</p>

<p>My E6 has developed a texting problem, whenever I send a text none of the text appears in the conversation speech bubble, just the date or time when it was sent and the character "0". Does anyone know why?</p>

<p>Would suggest that you backup E6-00 using Nokia Suite, then reset device to "Out of box" state by keying in *#7370# followed by 12345 (default Nokia lock code unless altered by user). Perhaps restore contacts only and try out texting/conversations before
 restoring device any further.</p>

<p>You can find an explanation of the error codes on the page <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/resolve-windows-10-upgrade-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolve Windows

<p>
</p><p>The error you have seen is specifically mentioned but also with an "extended code" of&nbsp;0x80070003- 0x20007 which relates to "<em>a failure during SafeOS phase driver installation</em>" and a couple of suggestions for "Mitigation".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that'll put you on track to resolve the error.</p>

    <title>Deliverability to all accounts on outlook.com and hotmail.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deliverability to all accounts on outlook.com and hotmail.com</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
I'm having trouble with delivering emails from my business accounts "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***","*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" to all accounts on outlook.com and hotmail.com. Absolutely all emails end in a spam. Everything is set
 correctly, SPF verification, DKIM. I tried to send the IP address of the outgoing server to deletion from MS blacklist, but unfortunately the address was not listed.<br />
I am trying to solve it without success for about a month, I tried to contact my web hosting provider, who claims that his servers are not blocked and all my settings are fine and that the problem must be on MS side. Now I've been trying for 2 weeks to find
 the cause of the problem with someone from Office 365 support, as I tried to move the third of my account "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" to the purchased email hosting MS Exchange in the belief that if everything is under the roof of MS , so the problem is quickly
 found. Unfortunately, also this email account still has a lot of email delivery problems on outlook.com and hotmail.com, and no one can figure out why a simple email from one of your servers can not be delivered successfully to the inbox on your other server.
 This problem is really just and only of your accounts on outlook.com, hotmail.com (probably live.com, but I did not have the opportunity to try it out). I do the tests through GlockApps, where they have 7 test accounts on outlook.com and one on hotmail.com.
 From the first two email accounts that are still hosted on the Digital Pacific, NEVER have a single email been delivered to inbox. The moved account "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" to MS Exchange, in last 2 weeks improved from 1/8 deliverable address to 3/8 deliverable
 addresses.&nbsp;<br />
I'm asking you to thoroughly investigate the problems, as most of my clients, especially new ones, have an email right on one of your servers, and it is a huge problem for me. I have to request a phone number in the online form on the web, and I always have
 to send a text message with the email to look at the spam, where they can find the reply. It is not possible that you can not find what is the cause of the problem when it is just about your servers.<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.<br />

<p>Hi Kristine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for reply. To your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using Office 365 for Business?<br />
<strong>I am not using Office 365 for Business, just Exchange Online (Plan 1).&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>How are you accessing your emails, using a browser (Outlook.com Premium) or using the Outlook desktop app?<br />
<strong>I am using a desktop client "eM Client" and on another PC Mozilla Thunderbird.</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Can you send us a screenshot of the delivery error message you're receiving?<br />
<strong>I have never received an error message because emails are always delivered, just not into inbox, but to spam. If you want, I can send you a header of any emails that ended in the spam or screenshot of the GlockApps that I'm using for testing.</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Is your computer connected to a domain?<br />
<strong>No, computer is not connect to a domain.</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>For clarification, which email protocol are you using on the affected emails, POP3, IMAP, or Exchange?<br />
<strong>I am using IMAP for *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong><br />
<strong>and Exchange for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Are the affected email addresses listed under the recipient’s safe sender’s list?<br />
<strong>No and that is not a solution as I need to be able to reply to new clients.</strong></li></ul>

<h3> flyawayhome  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live ID account and Windows 10049 incompatablity issue</h2>
                    My live ID points to my Business O365 account (to access my business mail XXX.BIZ as opposed to the Outlook.COM mailbox that is setup with a new Live ID account). When I log into Win 10 TP (10041 or 10049) it makes the assumption that I want the 'home'
 account (which is Outlook.com) instead of the 'business' account which points to O365. This causes all kinds of issues - especially with Office 2013 and Office 365 applications. I tried unlinking from my Live ID and everything works, but when I relink, everything
 breaks. I also tried uninstalling office and reinstalling.

<h2>            Why does using Copy Paste make my Excel hang, heats up the CPU, and takes ages to be completed&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, as soon as I copy paste, on my Windows 10 Pro &amp; brand new Dell XPS 8930, whether trying on Excel 2016 or my old Excel 2007, the operation takes ages, my Excel hangs or freezes (will unfreeze a few minutes later if you have the time to wait), and the
 CPU usages increases by 15/20% (you can hear it easily with the loud XPS 8930 fan). I have the same problem on other computers as well. Thanks in advance if anyone has a fix for this. Best, M

            Try following (First try option 5 most likely this is an issue with default printer) -
<br />
<br />Try following one by one as check after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation. irst try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />1. Open Excel
<br />2. ALT+F11
<br />3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window
<br />4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter
<br />5. You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />4. Try to login through another Windows profile. If there is some corruption in profile which is causing this problem, this would correct.
<br />
<br />5. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />6. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus  etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps. Start your computer in Safe mode with networking and see whether the problem is solved. If yes, then some program is causing the problem.

<br />
<br />7. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:
<br />
<br />    Open Excel.
<br />    Click on file, Options.
<br />    Go to the Advanced tab.
<br />    Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.
<br />    Click ok and restart Excel.

<br />If you need an access to your account that it works for some browsers.
<br />
<br />Try to use different one, for me it works in Microsoft Edge.

<br />This can be used as workaround.

            Hello LizDonaldson,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your patience.
<br />
<br />I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.

<br />
<br />In case it is still not working for you, it could be a browser-related issue.
<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser?

    <title>Pasting from Excel to Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briankwwolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pasting from Excel to Word</h2>
                    I want to paste data from Excel into Word.&nbsp; When I select a range in Exel and paste it into Word, the table that is created is always stretched or compressed causing the test to look like a different font or font size than the other words in the document.
 The only thing that works is to paste as a picture but you lose the ability to edit the data.&nbsp; There is a feature to paste as picture with links to the Excel spreadsheet which would be perfect, but this option stretches or compresses the data also.&nbsp; Any other
 options than just picture that will retain editing ability but not stretch or compress the look of the data?

Use Paste Special in Word and select the method that suits you best.&nbsp; Check the Paste Link radio button if you want to be&nbsp; able to update the data if it is changed in Excel.

    <title>using &#34;Insert Object&#34; in MS Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            using &#34;Insert Object&#34; in MS Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>In order to better manage the pictures and drawings in the Word, I used do the following:</p>
<p>- insert object -&gt; select "Microsoft Word Document"</p>
<p>- draw everything in the newly inserted object</p>
<p>Once I close the inserted object, my drawing looks like a picture in the original document. Then I could easily resize the whole object and everything would remain in the same aspect ration and resized nicely.</p>
<p>it was very good way of adding figure and managing them. </p>
<p>Now in Office 2010, and 2013, when I do the same thing, when I resize the object, only the page size of the embedded document changes instead of resizing the whole content! I tried many different things, but can no longer get to the previous behavior.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the strange thing is that I copied one of the objects from one of my old documents into a new one, and the old object still behavies correctly and reizes all the contents. But anything new I add does not behave similarly.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea as how to get to the previous behavior? </p>
<p>Also, does anyone know a better way of adding drawings and easily resize it? (I know about canvas and resize feature, but never works the way you want and specially text gets messed up, so looking for a better solution).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            AFAIK this is how it works in both 2010 and 2013<br />
<br />
I agree with you that this use to work without any obstacle in previous versions of office.<br />
