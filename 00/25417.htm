<h2>            Outlook 2016 crash code&#58; 0xc0000409 after Insider update to build 16176.1000 &#40;rs_prerelease&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My outlook 2016 crashes at startup all the time after this Insider update. I did a quick and online repair. Removed Outlook.com live account too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debug mode startup also crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removed 2 plugins I know where installed.</p>
<p>sfc/scannow does not find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve?</p>

    <title>Earned Value, AC wrong in Visual Reports - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 69l46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Earned Value, AC wrong in Visual Reports</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi, I'm learning how to use Project 2007, and am unable to produce a simple chart with the following data as a function of time: Earned Value, Actual Cost, and Planned Value (for the entire project, not just up to the status date).
 Basically, I want the baseline S curve (the spending planned for the entire project based upon the current baseline). Then I want 2 additional curves that are complete only up to the status date: Earned Value and Actual Cost.</span></p>
<p><span>The problems I run into are:</span></p>
<p><span>1. All of the values in the AC column&nbsp;of the pivot field in Excel generated by the default earned value template are&nbsp;only one of 3 values: 0, -8.6729E+209, or 3.2467E-269. Actual Cost appears to work OK, but it is not cummulative.
 This requires making another column of data with indirect references to the "Actual Cost" data in the pivot table (so I can cut and paste that formula).</span></p>
<p><span>2. Very rarely, the&nbsp;data in the EV column&nbsp;of the pivot table in Excel matches the data in Project. Most of the time it is completely unclear where it comes from (one time it matched the EV for a particular subtask).</span></p>
<p><span>3. Planned Value is reported a zero for any dates after the status date. Maybe this is by design. It doesn't look like a single field that I can select does this job. For now, I am using a formula to create a column outside the
 table that is essentially a cummulative baseline cost.</span></p>
<p><span>4. All of what I said above appears to change randomly.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Is there any way to get at the project data that does not involve learning Visual Basic? Visual Reports is absolutely unpredictable - once I think I have what I need, the next time I try it, it's gone. Is there any quality
 control at MS these days?</span></p>

<div>With all due respect, I think your expectations around how EVMS "should"</div>
<div>work are a bit unrealistic honestly.&nbsp; EVMS is based off of a baseline.&nbsp; If</div>
<div>you change the cost estimate for a task, that impacts your EVMS figures. </div>
<div>&nbsp;If it was an intended change to the cost estimate, then you would need to</div>
<div>go through a formal change management procedure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any tool that simply allowed you to erase variances that easily would hardly</div>
<div>be considered a project management tool.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That's the nature and definition of EVMS...</div>

<div>&gt; data for custom fields. It also will not export time-phased data for</div>
<div>&gt; all of the pre-defined time-phased fields. For instance, you cannot</div>
<div>&gt; use Visual Reports to export time-phased data for the field "%</div>
<div>&gt; Complete" even though it shows up as time-phased in both the task</div>
<div>&gt; usage and the resource usage views. I can't even find a list anywhere</div>
<div>&gt; of what fields I can use to export time-phased data - because it</div>
<div>&gt; certainly is a different list than the list of time-phased-data</div>
<div>&gt; fields. I can't understand what purpose MS has in limiting the data</div>
<div>&gt; you can export from project.</div>

<h2>            Color coding email messages</h2>
                    In Outlook 2007, I could assign a different color to the people who regularly emailed me. One boss's emails were blue, another green, so I could quickly and easily pick out their messages. This did not come through when I upgraded to 2013. Can I still
 use this? I noticed a little category box that will show up with that color but that's not at all helpful to me. I'd like the entire email to show up in color. Thanks.

    <title>Emails in Junk Folder Folder Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> okigiveup&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails in Junk Folder Folder Missing</h2>
                    <p>I have a PAID Hotmail account and the reason I purchased it was to have expanded storage, no advertising and my emails were not to be auto-deleted, but rather left to me to choose when to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not so much concerned with the Deleted folder but I had hundreds of important emails yet to go through in my Junk folder containing important files, invoices, etc. that I needed to save, print or archive. &nbsp; They just disappeared within the last 7-10 days
 and after hours of trying to figure out how or why I found a change in my setting where Outlook has set the Junk mail to auto delete after 10 days. &nbsp;With no notice, no email from Outlook.com clearly stating this change as being made... nothing... &nbsp; That is
 so wrong because I am paying for the right to control when my emails get deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent the better part of 2 hours trying to locate a means of contacting support to ask for help in restoring these emails only to find no way to to do so... unless I pay a bunch of money for a support contract. &nbsp;Seriously!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is even worse, is reading in the forum of people loosing their entire Inbox and other mail as it pertains to some change to Outlook Mail and needing to backup their emails, which is also something I have no knowledge of and have heard nothing about
 from MS. &nbsp;A nightmare because I have 15+ years of business email and contacts in my Hotmail account and always assumed it was backed up and protected by MS, especially since I am paying for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am reading in the forums that I need to find some kind of other email server/service to work with my Hotmail/Outlook account so my emails don't get lost or deleted??? &nbsp;What am I paying for then?? &nbsp;I don't use the calendar, one note and all that other
 stuff, I just use and want a functioning emails system that let's Me choose what emails I want to keep and what emails I want to delete... not MS or Outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go on and on about how upset I am and how devastating this is going to be for me if I can't retrieve these emails... but bottom line; I just need someone who can help me to get them back or help me to get a direct email to support so I can ask for
 their help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the restore "deleted" emails link is not a solution for me, because the emails I am concerned with were in my Junk folder and were not deleted by me. &nbsp;And we are talking emails that could go back as far as January of this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any one knows of a way to restore emails that have been auto-deleted from the Junk mail folder or if not, knows of or has a direct email address to the Outlook support team, I would sure appreciate your help. &nbsp;Thank You.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Mark;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The response provided by Paul_M did not address my issue. &nbsp;It is well known that shortly after MS bought Hotmail, that free accounts were configured to auto-delete emails after a specified period of time.<br />
<br />
My Hotmail account existed long before MS bought Hotmail but shortly after this acquisition, I switched from a free Hotmail account to a Paid Hotmail account. &nbsp;This was way more than 10 years ago. &nbsp;The reason I did so was for work and the primary reason for
 selecting a Paid account over a free account was the promise that there would be NO auto-delete of any emails, regardless of which folder the resided. &nbsp;The additional benefits of the paid account were no advertising and expanded storage.<br />
<br />
Yes the cost of the account is not expensive, but none the less I have paid for it going on 10+ years and MS has lived up to its part of the bargain and those specific features is what I have had until something happened… within the last 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
Year after year, month after month I would receive emails in my Junk folder which were important emails but from people and businesses that were not in my safe sender list because we did not communicate regularly or were in response to 1 time only events, but
 important events for which the emails were the delivery of critical files, invoices and other documents.<br />
<br />
For 10+ years my practice was, when time permitted me, to go through my Junk folder downloading important files, moving emails to corresponding folders and when all was done, deleting the remaining “junk” emails. &nbsp;And to the best of my recollection, never in
 all of these years has MS auto-deleted a single email from my account including the Deleted emails folder.<br />
<br />
My settings have always been set to exclusive but never has an email been deleted. &nbsp;But I also cannot ever remember seeing the statement in my Account Settings indicating that emails would be auto-deleted from my Junk folder after 10 days. &nbsp;That is new and
 totally contrary to the features offered for the Paid account.<br />
<br />
Which by the way, was done without providing any notice to me and I am sure all other persons with Paid email accounts. &nbsp;No email advising me of a future change to Paid account services or offerings so that I might could prepare, or make changes in the application
 and/or my habits, to avoid loosing all of those very important emails and documents.<br />
<br />
When trying to figure out where months of emails that were in my Junk folder had gone, I discovered this auto-delete statement. &nbsp;I have since moved it to “standard” but that does not benefit me as it pertains to all of the emails lost dating back to possibly
 January of this year. &nbsp;I did run a recovery of the Deleted email folder but it only returned 72 emails, most of which I had already considered and deleted. &nbsp;But there is no function to retrieve emails deleted from the Junk folder.<br />
<br />
Just a couple of months ago, in June, I was charged for the renewal of my Paid email account. &nbsp;So please explain to me. &nbsp;Why was I charged and why am I paying for an account that has the same auto-delete feature of the Free email accounts? &nbsp;Which is specifically
 the reason 10+ years ago, I chose to purchase the paid account…no auto-delete of emails!<br />
<br />
I need help. &nbsp;I need my emails restored and I need MS to live up to its agreement to not auto-delete emails in Paid accounts.<br />
<br />
Please help and also, please advise the “powers that be” that they need to fix this. &nbsp;If I charge you for a steak but then serve you a hamburger…?<br />
<br />
Full control over all emails and all folders should be restored to Paid account holders.<br />
<br />
Hopefully there is among your staff, a highly skilled and ingenious tech person who can get my emails back for me.<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
<br />
Michael<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply and the link but I have been to this page multiple times looking for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Contact Answer Desk" link takes you to a chat window. &nbsp;I attempted a chat window the other night and the person I chatted with told me they could not help me as they were there to help people with login and basic email issues. &nbsp;The in store option is
 not viable for me since I am about 55-60 miles from the nearest store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other options were to purchase a software support plan. &nbsp;I could not, anywhere on this page or any page on the MS support sites, find a means that would permit me to send an email to the Help Desk or Support Team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have such an email address, I would very much appreciate you sharing it with me or if you have direct access, perhaps you could contact a support tech, give them the link to this thread and ask them if they could contact me.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 not starting after downloading Word Perfect X5 using Vista operating system.</h2>
                    I have Outlook 2010.&nbsp; My OS is Vista home.&nbsp; I had to download the latest version of Corel's Word Perfect X5 for a project, however, just needed and downloaded the word processing portion of the office suite.&nbsp; The problem is... that ever since I did this,
 I can now no longer open my Outlook and I get the following popup box with this message which is proceeded by a red X..."Cannot Start Microsoft Outlook".&nbsp; I have tried to find this answer online and the closes thing I found to an answer was a lady who said
 she had the identical problem and wrote that she ended up having to run Outlook as an Administrator... So I tried to attempt this... however when I go to outlook and right click/properties/advanced, I get a box that comes up that has a box to check to do this,
 but the whole this is shaded and it wont allow me to click a check mark in the box.... if this is the right answer, please tell me how to check this box. if it isn't please suggest something else.&nbsp; Thank

<p>Not much information here. Start by clarifying this statement:&nbsp; "just needed and downloaded the word processing portion of the office suite."</p>
<p>Word Perfect has scuttled many of Outlook's functions. Start by repairing your Office 2010 installation.</p>

<p>Russ,</p>
<p>Thanks for responding...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only needed the word processing program in the WordperfectX5 office suite, it's also called Wordperfect as I'm sure you know.&nbsp; This is the only utility I downloaded from the Wordperfect Office Suite product. I would also like to add, that I removed the
 WP Office suite completely, and my Outlook did not start.&nbsp; So I have since reloaded it on and I am of course back to square one.</p>
<p>I already ran the repair to the MS Office product.&nbsp; this didn't seem to work, so I completely removed it, and reloaded it again.&nbsp; This didn't work as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contacted Corel and told them about this and they said this was a MS Outlook problem... so here I am.</p>

            So downloading Corel broke Outlook, and Corel says&nbsp;that is an Outlook problem. I'm having trouble following that logic, but obviously have no other solutions from the Outlook end of things. One of the things Corel often broke was the MAPI transport. Might

 as an Administrator... So I tried to attempt this... <strong>however when I go to outlook and right click/properties/advanced, I get a box that comes up that has a box to check to do this, but<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the whole thing is shaded</span>

<p>I'm wondering if anyone else has run into a problem with being unable to start Outlook 2010 after installing Corel WordPerfect Office X5 on a Vista Ultimate (32-bit) machine?</p>
<p>I'm a solid Outlook user, and have been running 2010 relatively uneventfully since the day it was released.&nbsp; Yesterday, however, I installed Corel WordPerfect Office X5, and then OL couldn't start.&nbsp; In WP's Release Notes, it indicates that MS Office 2010
 should be installed <strong>before</strong> WP X5, which is what I did.&nbsp; I tried Repairing my MS Office installation, but I still got the error message when trying to start OL.</p>
<p>The only way I could get OL to work again was to do a System Restore to before X5 was installed.</p>
<p>Being a glutton for punishment, I guess, I went through the X5 installation again only to find that I again couldn't start OL until I did a System Restore.</p>
<p>I will appreciate any suggestions other than just don't use WP, which isn't an option.</p>
<p>*********************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>The lady writes again a few months later...</p>
<div>
<p>I <strong>finally</strong> found stumbled on an easy way to resolve this problem with OL 2010 installed first -- the last thing I'd want to have to do is uninstall OL 2010 &amp; then have to get everything set up (including my many email accounts) just so again.</p>
<p>After installing WordPerfect Office X5, set OL 2010 to "run as administrator" -- this is only necessary for the first OL 2010 start up after installing X5.&nbsp; Allow OL2010 to open, then close it.&nbsp; Now, deselect "run as administrator" for OL 2010 &amp; voila --&nbsp;it
 starts up fine &amp; I've recovered the vital (for me) OL 2010 functions lost by having to "run as administrator."</p>
<p>Whew -- it only took about 5 months!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Jaap van Ekris, a fellow MVP, wrote a nice Bluetooth manual on syncing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can find it here:</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and look here at this guide at Tony Spencer's site:</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Linley also had a link on a previous post (<a href="http://www.ppcsg.com/index.php?showtopic=79826&amp;st=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ppcsg.com/index.php?showtopic=79826&amp;st=0</a>)

<p>Hi emmausdan,</p>
<p>I thought I would also mention that you must first successfully connect and sync the two devices via USB before attempting to use Bluetooth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you have done so previously, please re-connect via USB now to confirm that everything still syncs works
 fine between the two devices, then re-attempt the BT connection and let us know what happens...</p>

<p>David, I been syncing the PDA to the Desktop VIA the USB since I bought the desktop over three years ago. I have been doing the syncs at least a couple of times a day. Even after I asked about not being able to sync with ActiveSnyc via bluetooth I continued
 to snyc via the USB.&nbsp; I rely on my PDA and need the Outlook calendar and contacts to be up to date on the PDA and desktop.</p>
<p>I have no problems getting the PDA and the desktop to "find" each other via bluetooth.&nbsp; Both the desktop and the PDA confirm that they are connected via bluetooth.</p>
<p>On both the desktop and the PDA, active sync was set up to sync via bluetooth.&nbsp; As I orginally reported, when I attempted to do the sync it did not work.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly tried to resolve this issue. Recently I discovered that the bluetooth connection will not automatically connect each time I activate Bluetooth on the PDA.&nbsp; I discovered that after I turn on bluetooth in the Wireless Manger on the PDA, that
 it was necessary for the desktop and PDA to find each other.</p>
<p>I had wanted to connect via bluetooth to avoid having to unplug the USB cord from the power cord and plug it into the desktop each time I wanted to do a sync.</p>
<p>HP had told me after I bought this PDA that using the USB cord via the desktop to recharge the battery on a long term basis would damage the battery. HP strongly recommended that I recharge the PDA via the USB cord via the the USB/power device.</p>
<p>I just a few days ago removed the Bluetooth/USB device from my desktop and returned it to the seller for a refund.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying to help me.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that you ended-up taking your original BT dongle back for a refund.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may wish to try a BT module made by a company that uses a different BT stack and driver, you may have more success.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have experienced situations where my iPAQ (h5555)
 was unable to connect to some other people's BT networks, but was able to connect to others.
<br />
<br />
There is also the issue of your Windows Firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has preset "exceptions" that allow packets to pass through the firewall if necesary.&nbsp; I do not know what changes (if any) would be required under similar circumstances for a BT network connection.</p>
<p>Sorry that we couldn't help you!<br />
<br />
Best of luck in your future endeavors!</p>

<p>David, what is a BT dongle??&nbsp; I had a Bluetooth adopter that plugged into the USB port. It was an IoGear Bluetooth 2.0 USB Micro Adapter GB421U.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that in the middle of this issue I had my hard drive wiped.&nbsp; After re-install I continued to receive the problem. The only difference is that before the wipe I was using ZoneAlarm Security Suite for my firewall and after the re-install
 used the Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>I am not sure if I want to try another Bluetooth USB adopter. If I have to manually tell the PDA to find the desktop each time I want to sync.&nbsp; It does not really make it easier than using the USB cord.</p>

<p>My apologies for using computer slang.&nbsp;&nbsp; A dongle is any piece of equipment that plugs into a port (USB, Serial, etc) that does nothing else but hang there and provide a service (usually it's a security device, but in recent years the term has started to
 encompass things like USB BT Transcievers and USB WiFi / 3G network adapters).</p>
<p>As for the issues you would encounter on the BT sync, if you told your BT&nbsp;Management software to always transmit a signal, and always accept an incoming transmission, then theoretically all you would have to do is turn-on your BT on the PPC, start ActiveSync
 (AS), and start syncing.&nbsp;&nbsp; But then you would have to manually quit AS and disable BT on the PPC lest it continue trying to sync and use-up electricity transmitting/receiving BT signals, all while you were trying to recharge it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>What IPAQ do you have?&nbsp; I use a <a href="http://us.kensington.com/html/9403.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Kensington Bluetooth USB Adapter</a> to sync my IPAQs to my computer.&nbsp; I documented the process in this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://frommypocket.pocketprimer.com/2007/01/20/use-bluetooth-to-sync-your-pocket-pc.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use Bluetooth to Sync Your Pocket PC</a></p>
<p>Did you find the port that Bluetooth assigns for this purpose and reference that port number in ActiveSync?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I've always thought that syncing via Bluetooth essentially bypasses any problems that could occur with the computer's Firewall, since, in many cases, users who are not able to obtain a successful wired syncing connection between their computer and windows
 mobile device could usually make a bluetooth connection.</p>

<h2>            Windows Firewall can&#39;t change some of your settings. Error code 0x80070424</h2>
                    <p>I am&nbsp;using Windows 7 OS and my PC's Windows Defender and Windows Firewall have failed to turn on. I have McAfee Antivirus installed and active but of late it also&nbsp;keeps showing me a&nbsp;warning message that my computer is at risk, and the firewall is turned
 off. Then when i click on it, it prompts me&nbsp;to turn on the firewall. When I turn it on from McAfee, it lasts a few minutes and again I receive the same message.
</p>
<p>I have tried several times to turn on Windows firewall and windows defender from the control panel but instead I get an error message that 'Windows firewall can't change some of your settings. Error code 0x80070424'. The same happens for the windows defender.
 I have tried to check for help from the problem "Error code 0x80070422 Can'T turn on" in the Microsoft community page but the solutions given have failed to solve the problem. I thought that may be it is because the solutions given&nbsp;only applied&nbsp;then&nbsp;(2009).
 I am requesting for your help on how to fix this problem. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Office 365 on iPad &#47; iPhone read-only</h2>
                    <p><span>I have Office 365 Home on my Windows 7 PC, iPhone 5s and iPad 4. All works fine on PC and iPhone. On iPad Excel files that have any protected cells open and read-only. I cannot edit ANY cells. This is a time sheet spreadsheet with some protected
 formulas and unprotected data entry cells. When I attempt to select an UNPROTECTED cell the "read-only" message pops up and I cannot edit. Again, this only happens on the iPad. Is this a known bug in Office for the iPad?</span></p>

            Outlook Mac does not allow for add ons. I'm not sure it's possible on the Mac, but you should send feedback asking for this feature.<br />

If you put addresses in BCC they couldn't reply all.<br />

<h2>            Lumia 800 repair cost</h2>
                    
<p>Just yesterday I was unlucky enough to drop my phone face first towards to the&nbsp;ground . The screen was damaged from below towards to the top is was a decent crack outside the surface . The internal screen didn't got damaged and the touch screen still works
 fine even at the crack part of the screen. Can I know how long does it take to repair it and how much does it cost ? Do I need to send it to a nearby nokia center ? How do I get my phone back once it was repair , is there any post service&nbsp;to return it back
 to me. Thanks</p>

            Yes you need to send the phone to the authorised Nokia care centre in your area. The cost &amp; time taken is best answered by the repair centre itself. Please note that the time taken may vary depending on the availability of the part. And as it is physical
 damage it will not be covered under warranty.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you download that, open the workbook (make sure that you allow macros) and click the button?</p>
<p>Do you get the same error?</p>

    <title>Synchronizing Playlists to Nokia Lumia 1520 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kordel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synchronizing Playlists to Nokia Lumia 1520</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Media Monkey to create automatic playlists based on genres and comments. &nbsp;This worked with intermittent success on my Android phone so I had hoped moving to a Windows device would provide more seamless synchronization. &nbsp;When I try to synchronize
 to my Nokia Lumia 1520, though, only some of the songs and playlists are moved to the phone. &nbsp;This includes only 11 out of about 70 playlists and 3,276 of 4,626 songs. &nbsp;I have 9,459 songs total, but only want to sync the 4,626 songs included on these playlists.
 &nbsp;Can anyone tell me how to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many MANY apps on my phone and computer over the past couple months and have not found a solution. &nbsp;I have tried creating playlists in formats PLA, M3U, and I think a few others. &nbsp;I have tried creating static playlists from the smart playlists
 but even the static ones won't sync. &nbsp;I have tried MusicBee and at least a couple other programs on my Windows 8.1 computer also with no success. &nbsp;I have tried pretty much every music app available to my Lumia 1520 on the app store to see if any of them could
 read the playlists (in case they were being transferred but just not visible to the default music app--I don't know how to figure out if this is the case) but nothing did. &nbsp;Only one song shows up as DRM protected, so that is not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Windows Phone App but the only playlists that it shows on my computer are 3 playlists that I have no idea where they exist (I don't remember making them but I might have a long time ago, but they are NOT among the 70 or so playlists that
 I actually want to sync). &nbsp;Beyond that, my only options are apparently to sync genres or artists, but I don't want to. &nbsp;I only want about 50% or so of the songs in my library, which are PARTS of multiple genres and artists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wits end. &nbsp;I have tried more things than I can remember specific details of, but know I have not been able to find a solution yet. &nbsp;I would be willing to buy expensive new apps for both my computer (Windows 8.1) and my Lumia 1520 if I knew they
 would work. &nbsp;Can anyone point me in the right direction? &nbsp;Thanks for any help or insights that you can provide.</p>

<p><span>Thanks for coming back on this thread.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I completely miss this point… in fact you need to create your playlists on Xbox Music Application or even from Zune software then from your Windows Phone app to access it to get it synced. For more information have
 a look on thread here linked.</span></p>

    <title>Can one add text to a cross-referencing field&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simply mitch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can one add text to a cross-referencing field&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been searching for quite some time for the answer to this question. &nbsp;However, thus far have had no success. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a document which needs to be cross-referenced. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heading 2 is defined as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. &nbsp;However, within the body of the document I would like for the resulting cross-reference fields to display as Section 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc., incorporating the actual word "Section" into the resulting field codes.
 &nbsp;Is this even possible? &nbsp;And if so, how could one go about accomplishing it? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, if it is indeed possible, is there a macro or process which could be implemented to revise all field code instances in one fell swoop? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using MS Word 2010 with Windows 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any insight into this situation would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Doug: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally was able to attempt running the provided macro in an effort to insert the word "Section" into the cross-referencing fields. &nbsp;However, the macro proved unsuccessful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I "stepped into" the code via the VBA Editor and received the following as a result: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab267125-5ae3-4cf6-85c9-0261f2429967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab267125-5ae3-4cf6-85c9-0261f2429967" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am not well versed in diagnosing VBA coding (although goodness knows, I have tried for longer than I would care to think about) so I remain at a loss as to what the hangup may be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, I've laid out this response in a manner that makes sense. &nbsp;Beyond that, any further insight would, as always, be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>

 have deleted the msgbox statement which was put there during development to see what needed to be used in the following command).

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Insider Preview.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to access Network Attached Storage while using Net gear ex6200 Wi-Fi extender with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For better understanding of the issue, please provide us following information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which build of Windows 10 is installed on the computer?</span></li><li><span>Are you able to access Internet?</span></li><li><span>Have you installed any Security Software?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you follow the steps below and see if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Disable Antivirus</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If you have installed any 3<sup>rd</sup> party Antivirus application, please disable it before upgrading to the latest build.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Follow the steps provided in the article below:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Temporarily disable the security software/firewall and check if you are able to print</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Though the article is intended for Windows 7, same holds true for Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable
 your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Reinstall the Network Driver in compatibility mode:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This issue could have occurred if the drivers installed are not compatible with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to install the network drivers in compatibility mode and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to install drivers in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Right click</span></strong><span> on the setup file of the&nbsp;driver&nbsp;and&nbsp;select
<strong>Properties</strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Compatibility Tab</strong></span></li><li><span>Place a check mark next to Run&nbsp;this program in Compatibility mode and select the operating system&nbsp;accordingly from the drop down list</span></li><li><span>Click OK and run the setup.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

            I have just purchased a netgear wifi extender - "N300 WiFi range extender" Model EX2700 and am also having problems connecting to it. &nbsp; There is no software drivers supplied to install. &nbsp;After setting it up by connecting to the extender and connecting
 to it and setting it up to connect to the existing router you then have to connect to it rather than the router but all it comes up with is unable to connect. &nbsp;It is set up with the same password etc. as my router. &nbsp;I have a dual boot system and I am able
 to connect fine on windows 7. &nbsp;I am also able to connect my phones and chromecast. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am not sure if the password is not being passed over correctly - but have battled yo see much as Windows 10 is quite different from windows 7. &nbsp;The security being used
 is wps2

            I do not think that Microsoft have a clue as to the cause - not sure if they have even tried to recreate the problem and find a solution.&nbsp; Only way it will work is not to use windows 10 with that extender or possibly approach netgear and see if they may
 be able to help.<br />

<p>If you mean a Data Validation dropdown list. . . .there is no autocomplete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use vba code to achieve that.</p>

</p><p>A method not using VBA is to have the list items in alphabetical order with a single letter at the beginning of each letter group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type a letter in the cell then hit the downarrow to see top of your letter group.</p>

<h2>            How to fix ICS not working after reboot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have PC with one Ethernet controller connected to ISP and another one to home network. &nbsp;After every reboot Internet Connection Sharing stops sharing connection. I have to go to ISP Connection properties disable sharing, OK, enable sharing, OK, then fix
 reassigned IP address on home network controller. It started some patches ago, may be half an year ago. My current release is 15031 but the error still persists. I reported it every new patch using feedback but i have no idea if anyone even reads it as not
 a single bug has been fixed so far (and i am insider since beta).</p>
<p>I've tried so far "sfc /scannow" but no errors found.</p>
<p>I know i can write some powershell script and autorun it to fix things up but is it really the only and way to go?</p>

This article was written about products for which Microsoft no longer offers support. Therefore, this article is offered "as is" and will no longer be updated.</p>
I have no idea why the background so gray.&nbsp;</p>
The article is about&nbsp;<span>Windows 98 Second Edition - you serious?</span></p>
<span>I've searched thru Technet and found no answer as well.</span></p>
<span>The issue is that ICS works until reboot - and then stops until re-enabling - doesn't
 look like it doesn't work at all. It seems like the problem is in route tables as they differ before and after re-enabling ICS - and i have no idea why they should.</span></p>

            <p>Hello. I recently upgraded PC, made clean Windows 10 re-install and unfortunately the issue is still there despite having new equipment (And it cost me Insider license, well done.) I reported feature for like 3 times using feedback hub since the patch it
 started to happen. Can't see anything was done about it. After update I got like 14K build and Windows eventually get updates at slow pace despite I am having "fast" builds setting, so currently I am at 15048 rs. When it at last gets updated to latest build
 and if the issue is still there i'll report it with Feedback Hub once again.</p>

</p><p>It seems I found the root of the issue. Upon restart the Service "Internet Connection Sharing" is not in "started" state despite having "Automatic (Trigger type)" startup type. Simply starting it causes ICS working well. What might be the problem ICS service
 doesn't get started? </p>

The fix for the issue is currently rolling out and should be worldwide within 24-48 hours. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by this outage. Your patience is highly appreciated.

<br />However please exclude a browser issue. Try to use another browser, and In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can block authorization and cause problems.

            <p>Hi Judy, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pop-up Blocker is a feature in <span>Internet Explorer</span> that lets you limit or block most pop-ups. You can choose the level of blocking you prefer, from blocking all pop-up windows to allowing the pop-ups that you want to see.
 When Pop-up Blocker is turned on, the Information bar displays a message saying "Pop-up blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable the pop up blocker and check if it works. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This also applies to Internet Explorer 10. Perform the steps suggested for Internet Explorer 9.

<p>
</p><p>This is not working for me either. I'm not sure if it ever worked. I have a Surface Pro 6, iPad Pro 11" (2018 model), and a desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can search handwritten text on my desktop if it was written on my Surface within 10 minutes of writing. Months old text written on the iPad still isn't searchable. What's weird, though, is that ink to text is working with numbers - search is not, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I often write the date at the top of a note. I have "7/2/19". Ink to text can pick up the "7", "2", and "19", but it cannot find any of those values in search (if I ctrl-Z to revert back to handwriting). It's like it knows what the handwritten
 numbers are but refuses to include in my searches. Like I said, search works flawlessly when written on a Surface Pro.</p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us. From your description, in OneNote on your desktop, Ink to text works well for the handwritten text created on your iPad, but you cannot search those text.</p>
<p>I test from my side, firstly write text and numbers in OneNote on iPad, then go to OneNote in Windows 10 desktop, open the notebook. Find the handwritten text and numbers, use<strong> Ink to Text</strong> feature to change them to text, then I search those
 text and numbers, they display fine in the search result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using OneNote for Windows 10? If yes, I suggest you try steps below and see if the issue can be fixed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Close OneNote for Windows 10, go to Windows Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps &amp; features&gt;scroll down to find
Advanced options</span>.</p>
<p>2.Click <span style="font-weight: bold">Repair</span> to repair OneNote. Open OneNote again, open your notebook, use Ink to Text to change the handwritten notes to text, then check if you can search them.</p>
<p>3.If Repair doesn't help, try clicking <span style="font-weight: bold">Reset</span> to reset OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, could you please let us know info below for troubleshooting?</p>
<p>1.Does the issue happen for the notes in a specific notebook or all notebooks?</p>
<p>2.When you cannot search the number/value in OneNote on desktop, can you search it in OneNote on your iPad?</p>
<p>3.if you are using OneNote for Windows 10(desktop version), please let us know your OneNote version.</p>
<p>(click 3 dots in upper-right corner&gt;Settings&gt;About)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<h2>            Changing &#34;Sent From&#34; or Using &#34;On Behalf Of&#34; in email</h2>
                    <p>My email address has been added to a group email that ends in <strong>.org&nbsp;</strong>so when anyone sends an email to the group (ending in .org) I am copied on it of course. I have been told that I have been granted access to send emails from the group email
 address now. So, I want to send emails to our participants and change the "<em><strong>Sent From</strong></em>" field to the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">group email instead of From my personal email address.</span> And or, I would like to send emails to our participants "<em><strong>On Behalf Of</strong></em>" the group email address. I can't find a way to add the web
 email address (ending in .org) to my Outlook account unless I have credentials (password, pop server, etc) yet another member of the group email address is capable of sending out emails to our participants "On Behalf Of" and he's not sure that he did anything
 other than select the groups email address in what he called "the choices" and I am not sure exactly what that means. Any suggestions please? Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Kringle,
<br />Whether you can send as the address or on behalf of depends on your account's permissions - it sounds like your address was given send as rights and your coworker has send on behalf of rights. 
<br />
<br />You can't add the group address to outlook as an account - click on from, type the address in the other email address field - then next time you need to send from the address, it should be listed under the accounts with and X on the right to delete it (when you no longer want it listed).<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f4e7623-0781-46b4-aca2-9effdb8645bc?upload=true" />

            That message means you do not have any permission to send from that address. You need to speak to the email administrator. 
<br />
<br />Is the group address on the same mail server as your account?
