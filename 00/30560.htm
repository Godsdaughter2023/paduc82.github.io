<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Printer Manufacturer's website &gt; Key in your Printer Model Number and Operating System.</p>
<p>Uninstall/reinstall your Printer using the latest Drivers from there for your Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most Printer Manufacturer's will also have troubleshooting steps for you to take listed there, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And printer manufacturers normally have their own support forums.</p>

<h2>            USB 3.0 port no longer working</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS UX31E laptop running Windows 8.1. </p>
<p>An external hard drive WD Elements Portable USB 3.0 was plugged into the USB 3.0 port, the laptop lid was closed (laptop entered sleep) and the external hard drive was then removed (ie without clicking 'Remove device safely').</p>
<p>Since then the USB 3.0 port is not responsive. No device is detected when plugged into the USB 3.0 port, but they are detected when plugged into the USB 2.0 port on the other side of the laptop.</p>
<p>When the external hard drive is plugged in, the light turns on but there are no vibrations felt, meaning it is not even spinning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run Windows Update and installed all available updates, but have not solved the problem.</p>
<p>I have run the Hardware troubleshooter, but have not solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under 'Universal Serial Bus Controllers' in Device Manager it lists: </p>
<p>Generic USB Hub</p>
<p>Generic USB Hub</p>
<p>Intel(R) 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller - 1C26</p>
<p>Realtek USB 2.0 Card Reader</p>
<p>USB Composite Device</p>
<p>USB Composite Device</p>
<p>USB Root Hub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct in thinking the USB 3.0 port is not even listed there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried re-installing the USB 3.0 Fresco driver from the ASUS support website but it gives the error message 'Fresco Logic USB3 Host Controller is not found!'</p>
<p>I then tried re-installing the chipset driver from the ASUS support website, this installs without error but does not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware there was a software issue regarding USB 3.0 ports and a power saving feature of Windows 8.1, but the Windows Update should have fixed that. There is also a hotfix available, however my situation is not exactly as described for the hotfix so I
 am reluctant to install that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on what else to try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct in thinking the computer doesn't seem to detect that the USB 3.0 port is even there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Chris</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;UPDATE&gt;</p>
<p>In device manager, if I click View &gt; Show Hidden Devices, the USB 3.0 port appears greyed out. Under device status in properties, it says&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)<br />
<br />
To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I re-connect an internal USB 3.0 port within a laptop?</p>
<p><br />
</p>

The issue seems to be with the hardware. I would suggest you to contact your computer manufacturer and check if the USB ports can be replaced.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 cant connect to Blackberry Hotspot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently bought a MacBook Air and have installed Windows 10 (64bit) and Office 16, through bootcamp.&nbsp; I also use a Blackberry Z30 as my&nbsp;phone and to connect to the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MacBook air cant see the Blackberry Z30 hotspot.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have downloaded
 BB Link and BB Blend on the MacBook Air (in Windows 10 partition) to ensure that all BB drivers are loaded.&nbsp; I have also installed all Win10 and Office 16 updates.&nbsp; But still the MacBook Air&nbsp;cant locate the BB hotspot.&nbsp; The MacBook Air while running windows
 can see all other wifi connections (home router, iPhone5, Android, etc.).&nbsp; But just not the BB hotspot.&nbsp; Also, the BB hotspot is seen and can be connected to using my ipad, my other older laptop (Thinkpad X230), and Android phone, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I switch to Mac OS (Yosemite) then the MacBook Air is able to see the BB Hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is no problem with the BB hotspot or the BB, but there seems to be some problem with Win10 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx. Maneesh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding. &nbsp;However, having tried your suggestions this has not resolved the problem. &nbsp;As mentioned earlier, the MacBook Air with Windows 10.1 (all updates installed) still does not see the Blackberry Hotspot (Z30). &nbsp;The hotspot is visible and
 can be easily connected to all other devices (iphone, Android phone, Lenovo laptop, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely, there is some windows issue. &nbsp;I am not able to figure this out. &nbsp;Do suggest some other alternatives.</p>

            The only solution i have found to use the Blackberry 10&nbsp;as the internet connection for Windows 10&nbsp;is by associating the Windows 10 device via tethering with Blackberry, the Bluetooth capability seems pretty good even with the larger laptop.

            Are you both using BootCamp on Apple PCs? There is no issue with Windows 10 and a VZW Z30 hotspot on any of my Windows 10 PCs. It has to be an Apple issue.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am using bootcamp to run Windows 10. &nbsp;As mentioned above, the hotspot is visible if I run iOS (and I can also connect to it), hence I think it has to be Windows issue. &nbsp;Do let me know if I am wrong.</p>

            <p>Well, I am no Apple expert (e.g. never use them) but iOS and OSX (on your Mac PC) are different, right? Then you add the BootCamp on top of that. Here's a post that mentions "Bootcamp drivers". I know it is Windows 7 but there seem to be a lot of this type
 of issue. I'm just thinking you would be better off in an Apple forum (Bootcamp subforum) unless some Apple/BB 10 user can answer your question. Like you said, it is not a BB 10 issue and I have no issue with native Windows 10 connecting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I guess at the very least, you could try to ping the BB10 hotspot from within your Mac setup. What security software are you using?</p>

            <p>Hi Maneesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently having the exact same problem. I use the BB Passport and it connects as it should on OS X, but on bootcamp Win 10 it doesn't even find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you found a resolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Ghalib,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't found a solution to connect via hotspot. Tethering (via cable) or bluetooth are the only options. &nbsp;If you see the thread, its not clear whether this is a a WIN10 problem or OSX or is it due to some drivers that are not available when you load bootcamp
 and install WIN10 on a Macbook Air. &nbsp;Either way, if you want to connect via hotspot use the OSX partition and if you like WIN10 on a Macbook Air (some people found it funny that we like WIN10 on Macbook Air) then use the tethering/bluetooth option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently bought a MacBook Air and have installed Windows 10 (64bit) and Office 16, through bootcamp.&nbsp; I also use a Blackberry Z30 as my&nbsp;phone and to connect to the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MacBook air cant see the Blackberry Z30 hotspot.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have downloaded
 BB Link and BB Blend on the MacBook Air (in Windows 10 partition) to ensure that all BB drivers are loaded.&nbsp; I have also installed all Win10 and Office 16 updates.&nbsp; But still the MacBook Air&nbsp;cant locate the BB hotspot.&nbsp; The MacBook Air while running windows
 can see all other wifi connections (home router, iPhone5, Android, etc.).&nbsp; But just not the BB hotspot.&nbsp; Also, the BB hotspot is seen and can be connected to using my ipad, my other older laptop (Thinkpad X230), and Android phone, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I switch to Mac OS (Yosemite) then the MacBook Air is able to see the BB Hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is no problem with the BB hotspot or the BB, but there seems to be some problem with Win10 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx. Maneesh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>try this solution:</p>
<p>1-go to settings in windows 10</p>
<p>2-click wifi and internet</p>
<p>3-click manage wifi settings</p>
<p>4-click the network or the hotspot you used to connect to&nbsp;internet using windows 7 or 8.</p>
<p>5-click <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>forget</strong></span> to remove it from the wifi list.</p>
<p>6-click to scan wifi.</p>
<p>7-select the same hotspot.</p>
<p>8-enter hotspot security key</p>

<h2>            BIOS update problem - Win 7 recovery Boot Disk</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Firstlty appologies for posting in the wrong area, I hope this is correct.</p>
<p>How do you create a Win 7 Boot Disk. I need that answered as I have a laptop with a possible BIOS problem and will not boot. The System recovery will not repair it, I need to boot from a CD into either XP, Vista or 7 as this is the only system the flash
 utility will accept. Unfortunately no FULL SYSTEM DISKS were created so we cannot even resore the computer. If I boot onto an XP disk the Laptop fails when its the installers turn to take over (after blue screens, I presume drivers even though I have them
 slipstreamed into the XP boot disk)</p>
<p>Im now at a loss with this PC and I have asked around on various forums without any luck,</p>
<p>How do I access a flash Utility that runs on the above systems from my current position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer switches on, </li><li>BIOS loads, I can access the BIOS </li><li>F2 Bios F4 Recovery, F4 does not recover ALL Options have been tried. </li><li>Recovery disk created will not recover </li><li>After BIOS has done just at the point of loading <strong>Win 7 32bit home</strong> it sits and hangs with black screen.</li><li>I CAN access the Hard Disk via crossover and recovery (F4) AND create a System recovery disk but it will not fix it!</li></ul>
<p>I was going to boot from a disk and run the flash but I seem to have hit a major road block and could do with some help,</p>
<p>Shop I purchased this from has gone bust - 12 month old laptop, currently useless!</p>

- Control Panel<br />
- Backup and Restore<br />
- System Repair CD<br />
This is an absolute must unless you have a Windows installation DVD. How else would you repair Windows in case it refuses to boot?

<p>I have that, it will not repair!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I was to say whats wrong here its either the BIOS but more likely the Boot Sector but I have little EXP with Win7 so I hoped someone could help,</p>
<p>I would say the software on the Hard disk is ok, for some reason it will not boot,</p>
<p>there is a BIOS update for this PC but no read me for the changes,</p>
<p>so I need to be able to apply the BIOS update to eliminate this from the possible reasons for the problem.</p>
<p>and that is where I am struggling to use the BIOS updater because the laptop will not boot</p>

<p>A BIOS update is a risky affair. It is rarely required solve Windows problems and it should only be undertaken by experienced people. If you get it wrong then you can cause permanent damage to your motherboard.</p>
<p>From your initial description I gather that quite a few things are wrong with your installation. This probably puts your issues beyond the scope of this forum. I can see these options for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a person with a strong background in PC/Windows maintenance to assist you.</li><li>Back up your data files, then reload Windows onto a freshly formatted disk. </li></ul>
When finished, create an image of your installation, to be used in case you suffer another disaster later on.

Let's get a few things straightened out:<br />
<ul>
<li>When I was your current age, we had just dropped DOS 6.2 and battled with Windows for Workgroups and its proverbial instability. Windows 95 was a long way in the future.</li><li>Since most respondents in this forum are <strong>volunteers</strong> from the general Windows community, you can<em>hope</em> for a reply that will solve your problem.
<em>Expect</em> is a term I would use when there is some sort of a service agreement. You bring your car in for a service, you expect it to be fixed and you pay the charge.</li><li>If you have used PCs since the age of 11 then I think you would know how to make a bootable disk or CD for a BIOS upgrade, so why ask here?</li></ul>
Now if you're prepared to relax and tone it down a little then I'm happy to explore this issue in greater detail.

You could improve your chances of getting a reply by starting your own thread and describing your problem in detail. Old threads don't get much attention. Remember also that a BIOS update is

            Hi Roy
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of Turbo Tax are you trying to install?
<br />
<br />Here are some recommendations from Intuit if you are experiencing problems trying to install the software:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1899518-troubleshoot-installing-and-running-turbotax-on-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1899518-troub...</a>
<br />
<br />    Run the Windows System File Checker tool.
<br /><a href="https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1901167-running-the-windows-system-file-checker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1901167-runni...</a>
<br />
<br />    Install TurboTax from a different CD or DVD drive on your computer, if you're installing from the CD.
<br />
<br />    If you downloaded TurboTax, delete the downloaded file and download TurboTax again. Sometimes files get corrupted during the download process.
<br />
<br />    Install TurboTax on a different computer. If you can't get it to install on any computer, request a new CD.
<br /><a href="https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1899341-how-do-i-get-a-replacement-for-a-lost-or-damaged-turbotax-cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1899341-how-d...</a>
<br />
<br />    Install TurboTax from your hard drive.
<br /><a href="https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1900681-install-turbotax-from-your-hard-drive-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1900681-insta...</a>
<br />
<br />    Restart your computer in Selective Startup Mode (TurboTax 2008 or later) (<a href="https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1901330-start-windows-in-selective-startup-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1901330-start...</a>) or Safe Mode (TurboTax 2007 or earlier) and then install TurboTax (<a href="https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1900847-start-windows-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1900847-start...</a>).
<br />
<br />Just to highlight:
<br />
<br />- Disable your Antivirus utility temporarily before installing.
<br />- Perform a clean boot in Windows 10 then try again:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>

Why is it easy?&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>You don't have media for Office 2002 (XP) because...?&nbsp; (If it came pre-installed - what happens if you had a hard drive crash and had to replace the drive and everything on it?)</p>
<p>In any case - your problem seems similar to this, although they refer to SP1 for Office 2002...</p>

One gets what they give.<br />
If you really don't care (your words) then I am not sure what anyone could/should do to assist you further.<br />
Just because something worked in the past (like applying updates) doesn't mean they will continue working in the same manner - as each new case has new variables.<br />
Did you read the article I linked to and try to apply it (despite it being about SP1 for Office XP and not SP3) to your situation?&nbsp; They have some tips that may very well get it fixed for her.<br />
Could have left the first response you made...<br />

            Yeah, you get what you give, you gave me a smart attitude so I recognized your effort which is what you desire and feed from.<br />
<br />
Of course I read the article. Apparently you did not or&nbsp; you would have known it tells you to insert the install disc which I
<u>clearly </u>stated I did not have in my first question.<br />
<br />
I have spent numerous hours cleaning up this machine from infections, spyware and adware.&nbsp; In addition to applying SP3 and all windows updates I am also upgrading some of her hardware. I am saving her a lot of money by doing this favor for her.
<br />
<br />
So if you're not going to offer anything of value then the smart remarks are not needed and I would appreciate this conversation coming to an end.<br />
<br />
However I believe you are the type who always has to get the last word in so I will not be surprised to see another

            Thanks Dave, but the article states to insert the Office CD rom and click repair. I talked to her today, she seems to think the machine came with it already installed. If that is correct, doing a system recover should take it back to the original factory
 set up, but I don't want to risk it at this point. If all else fails I may come back to that idea. I have some feelers out looking for an install disc.<br />

<p>Hello Naresh,<br />
<br />
Svchost.exe is a generic Windows process that loads several services for Windows. Windows update, full event log, and services that have many processes can be the cause of high usage of svchost.exe. For us to assist you, we suggest that you download Process
 Explorer on this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Process Explorer will show you the sub-process of svchost.exe and will help determine which highly consumes your network usage. Once you've downloaded the file, follow the steps listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Open <strong>Process Explorer</strong> and click <strong>View </strong>
on the menu bar. </span></span></li><li><span><span>From the drop down menu click <strong>Select Columns</strong> and then the
<strong>Process Image</strong> tab.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Check the boxes before Description, Image Path, Image Type, and Command Line.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on two other options on the View drop-down menu, namely <strong>
Show Processes from All Users</strong> and <span><strong>Show Fractional CPU</strong></span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Place the cursor on the "svchost" process generating the CPU activity, right-click, select
<strong>Properties </strong>and the Service.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Right-click the "svchost" process showing the high CPU activity.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click <strong>Services </strong>tab. From there you will see the list of services that the use the process.</span></span></li><li><span><span>When you place the cursor to the appropriate button, you may <strong>
Stop </strong>and <strong>Restart </strong>any services. From doing this, you'll be able to check what impact it has on CPU usage.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Before stopping any service read the description to avoid any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and if you need further assistance, feel free to post back.</p>

                    With just about every update for Windows 7 accounted for and installed successfully (with the exception of one), I had 10 remaining, all related to Microsoft Works 9.&nbsp; In the past I had no trouble installing these updates, but this time the installation
 failed with the error code 687, even while one of my Microsoft Security Essentials definitions updates installed successfully.&nbsp; What could be interfering with the installation of those 10 files, and how do I fix the problem that is causing error 687?<br />
[Please be advised that I cannot go back to check on the details of the error.&nbsp; I have wiped my disk.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would like a solution in case it happens again.]<br />
<br />
One other thing:&nbsp; Is there a solution to removing the updates marked "Failed" from the list of updates without getting rid of the updates marked "Successful" or "Canceled"?&nbsp; Or is it an all-or-nothing process?&nbsp; And will getting rid of the entire list present
 any potential of doing harm to a Windows 7 setup?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community and thanks for posting the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may repair Works from Programs and features and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, manually download and install all the updates and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If still unable to install the updates, restart the computer in Windows Clean boot and then try. Refer to the link below to know on how to start computer in clean boot:</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I&nbsp;read the error code wrong when it came up following the failure of Windows Update to install components of Microsoft Works 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a full disk wipe and reinstallation of Windows 7 and all of its updates, along with the installation of Kaspersky Internet Security, I installed Microsoft Works 9, and after a restart, 3 updates were made available:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Works 9 (KB2754670), 2.1 MB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack Service Pack 3 (SP3), 35.4 MB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PowerPoint Viewer 2007 Service Pack 3 (SP3), 33.1 MB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the suspicion that the installation will fail again, I attempted to install ONLY the Security Update first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely enough, it failed, with the error code 6<strong>B</strong>7 (six-B-seven), not the 6<strong>8</strong>7 (six-eight-seven) that I thought I read the first time it came up (before my disk wipe).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the error for help, and the Windows Help and Support displayed 29 items for
<strong>"WindowsUpdate_000006B7"</strong>&nbsp; I chose option number 7,<em> "<font color="#0066cc">Troubleshoot problems with installing updates".</font></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the solution,&nbsp;I ckicked the&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Fix-It</em>&nbsp;button, and a Windows Update troubleshooter program was presented to me, which I downloaded and installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few items within the&nbsp;update program were fixed (which I will soon test), and the&nbsp;update
 history was erased, and I'm about to try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should mention that, until now, I never had this problem with Windows Update following the installation of Microsoft Works 9 on&nbsp;Windows 7.&nbsp; [To be continued...]</p>

            <p><strong>Problem solved...I hope.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I did:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the Windows Fix-It program to clean up Windows Update.&nbsp; That didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clean-booted my machine and ran the Windows Update troubleshooter again.&nbsp; I ended up getting another error, saying that Windows could not&nbsp;search for&nbsp;any updates.&nbsp; I figured that the error came up because i didn't run msconfig
<em>as an administrator.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I restored everything to its original state, then ran msconfig as an administrator and clean-booted again.&nbsp; I had to reinstall Microsoft Update to get updates for Microsoft Works 9.&nbsp; I had no problems with the updates, and when more updates for Works 9 were
 available, I downloaded and installed them as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error 6B7 started after I installed Microsoft Works 9.&nbsp; I hope the error is limited to the updates that were Works 9-related, and not an error that will be permanent within Windows/Microsoft Update, thereby requiring me to clean-boot my machine every time&nbsp;before
 using Windows Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hid all MS-related programs in the <em>Services</em> tab of msconfig, I had 19&nbsp;services displayed before I clicked
<em>Disable All.&nbsp; </em>I have 2 Acronis programs installed and several programs related to my&nbsp;NVIDIA graphics card (including
<em>LucidSrv,</em> for <em>Lucid VirtuMVP</em>).&nbsp; I am pretty sure the related services&nbsp;are not the cause of Error 6B7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time that error came up, I had Microsoft Security Essentials installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, following a disk wipe and Win7 reinstallation, I had Kaspersky 2013.&nbsp; That almost certainly eliminates my antivirus program as a possible cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time Error 6B7 came up, I did not have Systweak Advanced System Optimizer installed.&nbsp; The second time, that program was installed before I installed Works 9.&nbsp; Advanced System Optimizer can surely be eliminated as a cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Works 9 itself can't&nbsp;possibly be the cause, because in January&nbsp;I had no problems with the updates that followed (other various&nbsp;mishaps forced me to reinstall Win7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an ASRock motherboard, and a program related to ASRock's <em>XFast LAN </em>
hardware driver, called <em>cFOS Speed System Service,</em> is among those I suspect blocked several Works 9 update files from being installed.&nbsp; In addition,
<em>ASCT Always Updated Agent,</em> and one of 7 Intel services, are among my suspects.&nbsp; Since I had no problem installing Works 9&nbsp;updates in January,&nbsp;I would have to guess that&nbsp;a newer&nbsp;version of one of these 9 services is the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I run into a situation where a new Windows&nbsp;update is available, and it fails to install, I assume&nbsp;I will have to perform a clean boot with only these 9 services disabled, to determine if one of them is the cause.&nbsp; But right now, I suspect that Error
 6B7 was limited to the 13 updates related to Works 9.</p>

            <p>My motherboard's DVD had a Norton free-trial included, but I never installed it.<br />
<br />
After the first incident of Error 6B7 (when I had MSE installed), I wiped the drive clean and started over.&nbsp; The second time the error came up (this time, with Kaspersky installed), I did a clean boot and installed the updates to Works 9, all 13 of which installed
 successfully while in clean-boot.<br />
<br />
I have only one question, since I narrowed the list of possible service programs to 9, one of which may have the reason my Works 9 updates (mostly security updates and MS Office compatibility programs) failed to install:&nbsp; By installing such a program while
 in clean-boot mode, is there any possibility that my Windows setup, while in normal mode, could be corrupted down the road because of a program or security update that was installed in clean-boot mode?&nbsp; I have run Microsoft Works 9 in normal mode, and I have
 no problems as of yet, with that program or any other program.<br />
<br />
By the way, the info I gave in all 3 links you provided, obviously relate to one procedure or another that was somehow corrupted by something I had not foreseen.&nbsp; Given the setup I have, I have come to the conclusion that, in some cases, there is a specific
 order in which to install certain programs and updates, and if I deviate from that order, I end up with a corrupted or unstable&nbsp;setup, most likely, where one program clashes with another and an unstable situation occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clean boot was a concept unknown to me until this point.&nbsp; Obviously&nbsp;I will utilize it if my Win7 setup becomes corrupted again, or if my WinXP setup (which has been far more stable than that of Win7) should falter.<br />

            <p>Thank you Rohit for your help, I appreciate it very much.</p>
<p>I have found the solution to this issue and am sorry for wasting your time as the problem was user based. I will briefly explain.</p>
<p>Previously while using windows 7, part of my backup regime was to do a monthly manual backup to an ext. drive. To make this easier I created a "Library" called Manual backup and included all my file locations. When using Windows 8 File History, all my files
 were correctly copied but I wrongly thought it had&nbsp;backed up my files twice as all of my Library's were duplicated in my Manual Backup Library. I excluded my Manual Backup Library, formatted my drive&nbsp;and tried to run file history. I saw msg. 'drive not recognised'
 I selected the drive again, then chose 'no' to move my files across as I had formatted the drive. File history completed the backup immediately, leading me to believe it was only backing up changes to my files as it thought the original backup still existed.</p>
<p>To fix the problem I simply included my Manual Backup Library, it seems so obvious now but while trying to troubleshoot, I was quite worried as I didn't have an adequate backup system in place.</p>
<p>Again thank you for your interest and offer of help</p>

            I formatted my Western Digital My Passport Drive and could not get Window's 8 file history to recognize it. I got the message: "file history does not recognize this drive". I tried a million things and spent hours agonizing over a solution, but finally
 solved it. I downloaded the latest driver (SES) from Western Digital's Website. That worked!<br />

I had similar problem when swopping a flash drive on a NAS server. I had to copy over the previous file path to the new flash drive for file history to work.

            Thank you so much for your explanation. I have been struggling with this exact issue for more than a week. You&nbsp;"chose 'no' to move my files across" and that took care of the issue for me instantly. I haven't made any changes to my libraries, so I'm not
 sure what exactly caused the problem to begin with, but who cares? It's fixed now! Thanks again for your contribution.

<h2>            File History &#47; Temp File Storage</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 backup on an external drive that I have set to backup each hour and keep files until space is needed.&nbsp; I do not have the external drive connected to the computer at all times.&nbsp; I try to connect the external backup drive once a day or
 so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given my settings, i'm assuming that I should have 24 backups in a day (hourly).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I got an error / alert stating that I needed to plug in my backup drive and that my backups were being saved to a 'temporary' file on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is:&nbsp; When I re-connect the external backup drive are these 'temp' backup files then transferred over to the designated backup external drive or do they live on forever in this 'temp' storage file on my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I needed to understand this behavior and it's implications because I work with large files that I would not want accumulating is a 'temp' file, also if these files are not moved to the external upon connection, i now have an issue of my backups not being
 complete or consistent...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shed some light on these issues above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>I gotta have an explanation of 2 games, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I gotta have an explanation of 2 games,</h2>
                    
<p>2 games in a row last night we(a few friends and I) saw things we had never saw before happen.&nbsp; First was a Hardcore Headquarters match and I'll copy and paste from the COD forums.</p>
<p>Last night some friends and I started a hardcore Headquarters match on Xbox Live, Nuketown map, immediately upon the initial starting countdown there were 2 15th prestige players camped in our spawn. This started a slaughterfest that lasted 15 minutes. OMG
 it was soooo frustrating. That was my first game to ever save to my fileshare just for proof. Some players are just good, I can't understand how they spawned in our spawn initially to begin with and they knew what was going on. At one point I had about 7 Commando
 hit markers on a guy, a team mate hit him with an RPG or grenade and he finally went into last stand and I had to finish him off with 2 more rounds. If anyone cares to watch feel free to check it out. I just want to know if something fishy was up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, The very next game we played was and Hardcore TDM game on Havana.&nbsp; The server had 3 players on our team and 7 on the other.&nbsp; That game was fun but still don't understand how it happened.&nbsp; Both games are in my fileshare if anyone cares to watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The 3 v 7 game is close to a common occurance. I've been in many 5 v 7 games so I'd assume that this one was a similar situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the first game, there initial spawn was in your team's spawn? I've never seen that. I've seen plenty of spawn killing on Nuketown, but never at the very beginning of a match.</p>

<p>This is CoD. These games are famous for having bad spawns. Spawning with the bad guys at the start of a HQ game on a small map like Nuketown doesn't surprise me one bit. I haven't played HQ in some time, but I do remember spawning on the enemy side on more
 than one occasion, so it happens. It also sounds like you were in a laggy-er than usual room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the lopsided teams, I've run into that from time to time as well. It's just one of those things. I wouldn't chalk anything up to cheating. It's just the game being the game, sometimes it hiccups and you have things like that happen. I will say that
 everything you described, I've had happen to me also and I think many others can say the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Edit: even when I press ENTER four times it still lumps everything together. These new forums suck!</p>

<p>I can take that. &nbsp;I admit that this is the first game I have ever played online but I've played it a lot and had never seen such. &nbsp;I guess anything is possible in the world of computers. &nbsp;Just seemed to be "extra" screwy last night. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, the spawning is horrible in this game. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Seems like some lag and some good players were the culprit. The guys getting to your spawn so fast was probably Lightweight/Marathon guys on a small map, plus they probably were tac inserting. The matchmaking has always been alittle weird on this game and
 lag causes the most WTF moments ever.</p>

<p>In HQ it's common for 1-2 players from one or both teams to spawn nearer to the bulk of the enemy, rather than the bulk of their team.</p>
<p>As was said above having unevenly numbered teams, while not occuring very often, isn't extremely rare either. &nbsp;Nothing to worry about there.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>Were you able to backup before without any issues?</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Follow the suggestions and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>To work around this problem, remove this reparse point from the library, and then run the backup wizard again.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to <b>
Start</b> / <b>All Programs</b> / <b>Accessories</b> / <b>
System Tools</b> / <b>Disk Cleanup</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the drop down menu, select the drive you want to clean up and click OK. The drive will be scanned.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the next window, select the
<b>Clean up system</b> files button.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the drive again and click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the next window, select the More Options Tab. In the System Restore and
<b>Shadow Copies section</b>, click the clean up button and click <b>
OK</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the next window, select the
<b>Delete Button</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;This will remove all of the temporary files and all but the latest System Restore Points.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Select the absolute path of this location from the Windows Backup configuration user interface.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Please check that the following services are enabled:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) - "<b>Manual</b>"</span></p>

<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Reboot computer and then check the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>You may also try to temporarily disable security software from the computer and try to create a backup and check if it works. If you are able to create a backup, you may contact the security software Manufacturer
 and check if you need to change any settings</span></p>
<p>

 If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            Hi chefozman, <br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!<br />
<br />
Mac users basically use QuickTime Media Player or iMovie to watch videos. But the video that we create using Windows Movie Maker saves the file (mswmm files) in Movie Maker format which do not work in Mac.
<br />
<br />
The mswmm files are the project format for Windows Movie Maker. The files tell Windows Movie Maker things about your video editing project like what video clips are used, which audio files you imported, which transitions go between which clips, and which effects
 are used.<br />
<br />
These files are essentially readable only in Windows Movie Maker and will definitely not work on a Mac. The two options for saving out a video file from Movie Maker are either DV-AVI or WMV.
<br />
<br />
To create a Mac-compatible video file, open the mswmm file in Windows Movie Maker, save the movie at the highest quality setting WMV or preferably as a DV-AVI format file. Import this finished AVI or WMV file into iMovie or other Mac video editing application.<br />
<br />

<p>i have done your tips as it is but it seems doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>i have tried your solution twice but nothing changed.</p>
<p>for now the only way that can help me through this are setting up my screen brightness a second before my laptop booting up and there is an app called Dimmer that can give a darker filter on my screen brightness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope future windows update can fix this.</p>

            You can consider rolling back to the previous Build 16299 as it is the only alternative if Display driver reinstall didn't worked.
<br />However, I can assure you that fix is coming soon.

<h2>            Microsoft Photos app not importing video</h2>
                    Could someone please help me with the video project feature in Photos? It will allow me to import photos into my project but no video clips. I am using .file type that it purportedly accepts (.avi) and have tried others as well. I have tried to do it from
 a file landed on jump drive, desktop, and Documents folders. I do not see any adjustment in Settings regarding type of files or memory size. And, repair and resent features through settings have not worked. Advice? Thanks.

<h2>            Access denied for opening hyperlinks in Microsoft Outlook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>I just recently installed a program called TuneUp Utilities, it takes care of the maintenance of your computer and has the ability to control your system through this one program. After installation, it asked me to scan my computer for maintenance and after
 completion, it asked me whether or not I should enable or disable some options to keep my computer safe from other computers. I enabled and disabled most of these options to keep my computer safe from hacker and such things as that, but afterwards, I couldn't
 open up the hyperlinks in my Outlook 2010! An error pops up saying, "This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact you system administrator." I did not have this problem before. Can anyone tell me how I can
 allow my computer to open hyperlinks again?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>PQService is the ACER factory restore partition and is visible in "Disk Management". Note that in Disk Management it may show as empty. Ignore this because it is not empty.
</p>
<p>Leave it alone. Don't touch.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge not loading any webpages.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally use Chrome/Firefox so I hadn't opened Edge in a long time. Wanting to test some code I'm writing in a web dev. project, I went to open Edge to test compatibility and noticed that absolutely no page loads, whether remote or local. I am always greeted
 with the "Hmmmm... can't reach this page" error.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see from the screenshot above, this happens even when trying to reach a page on a locally running server. Of course the page, along with any page on the internet loads fine on Chrome, Firefox and Opera. This is strictly an Edge problem. Also perhaps
 linked is the fact that the Windows Store is also unable to load due to internet access issues.<br />
<br />
I've tried:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearing all browsing data and resetting Edge settings</li><li>Using default DNS settings</li><li>Creating a new user account and trying Edge on there</li></ul>
<p>All to no avail.<br />
<br />
</p>

            Hi Shawn -
<br />
<br />Hi Luis.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />You can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But what I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />if problems persist with the new version then you can roll it back and hide it with the Hide Updates tool to wait for it to mature more:   <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />Hide Updates Tool:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            Account Permanently Banned.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am making this forum about my permanently banned account (TjOsoarrogant).</p>

<p>So anyways on june 16th I was given noticed on enforcement action on my account from email and It said marketplace theft.</p>

<p>A family member of mine was using two of my accounts which are connected on a family on Xbox live.</p>

<p>My accounts (Tj The Brute) and (TjOsoarrogant) were both suspended for marketplace theft but (Tj The Brute) has multiple accusations of marketplace theft in enforcement while (TjOsoarrogant) has only one and is permanently banned from Xbox live. On both Purchase history on the accounts nothing recently has been Purchased. IS there anyway I can get my account from being unbanned? I have made notice on the case review but,&nbsp;I'm not entirely sure that I need proof I'm innocent in this situation. I need to know for sure because I don't want my account I've had for almost 5 years to just be gone forever and especially the time and money spent on it.</p><p><br /></p>
