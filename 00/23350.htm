<h2>            Outlook .ost files and how they synchronize with the server</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Support Desk Engineer for a company out of Jacksonville, FL.&nbsp; I have a issue that continues to persist.&nbsp; A good bit of my users have email accounts attached to them through the Exchange server.&nbsp; For example
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is attached to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; My issue is this, if I attach about 10 different emails to
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, it causes jsmith's .OST file to grow substantially due to the amount in email accounts attached to his Outlook.&nbsp; Most of the users have 2010 or 2013 so they have a max size, for a .OST file, of 50GB.&nbsp;
 When it reaches this limit, Outlook fails to open.&nbsp; A quick remedy is deleting the .OST file and opening Outlook so they can at least send mail and receive some.&nbsp; The problem is continuity.&nbsp; I have a user who oversees these accounts, archiving the shared mailboxes
 almost daily, due to the high volume of mail they receive.&nbsp; Yet, the issues persists as the .OST file continues to grow until it reaches the 50GB.&nbsp; Does Outlook not recognize that email has been archived from one of its shared mailboxes?&nbsp; My theory is no because,
 it continues to grow even when the mail has been archived.&nbsp; So, knowing that 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** has reached the 50GB and one of his attached mailboxes has recently gone through a massive archiving process, I delete the .OST file.&nbsp; Once Outlook has been launched and started to rebuild the .OST, which takes hours, the user is again
 able to send/receive mail.&nbsp; Once done, the users .OST file is much smaller as it has synchronized with the server which has recently gone through archiving on these shared mailboxes.&nbsp; Obviously Outlook is still trying to update not only the users main mail
 but also all of the attached mailboxes.&nbsp; So my question is, does Outlook know to decrease the size of the .OST file since some of the mail, that has caused it to grow, has been archived and is off the server?&nbsp;I could continue this process but it is very time
 consuming and it takes quite a while for Outlook to rebuild the .OST file.&nbsp; My objective is to gain continuity amongst all users with shared mailboxes associated with their personal mail.&nbsp; One user has
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** up to date yet the user going through the rebuilding process is showing differently.&nbsp; Hopefully someone has a remedy for this that doesn't involve third party management or cloud services.</p>

<h2>            onedrive - can i change the location of just the music folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>windows 10 10162</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have onedrive in the default location (users/me/onedrive), however, i already have all my music on another drive (M:). I don't want to copy or move all my music to C drive since the space is limited compared to M drive. And I'd prefer not to move the entire
 OneDrive folder to M drive and then have to move my music into the one drive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do is tell onedrive that just the music folder should be located at m:\music and the other onedrive folders can remain where they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>

            hmm....ok i'll give that a try later. Does that mean there's no way within onedrive itself to specify a folder outside of the main onedrive folder?

            sorry but a symbolic link didn't work. When i first create the link to my music folder it will sync up and upload any music already in the folder. But anything I add to the folder after that never gets uploaded. It shows up in the folder with the little
 refresh icon next to it instead of a green checkmark, but for whatever reason, onedrive never uploads it. it ignores anything added after i create the link.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description it appears that you are trying to move OneDrive subfolder to other drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried to reproduce the issue but unfortunately we don't have an option to move a subfolder to other location in OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to change the location of entire OneDrive folder then you can do that by Unlinking and during set up of OneDrive it will ask you to change the location of folder. Also if you want you can sync only particular folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To do so:</strong> Right click on <strong>OneDrive icon</strong> on the Taskbar and select
<strong>settings</strong> option and click on <strong>Choose folders </strong>tab to select only particular folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. reply to us with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            It seems like a product flaw not to be able to have folders located on different drives. I'm sure I'm not the only person who keeps documents on C drive but stores their music and movie files on another drive.

<p>I have a SSD 256Gb C: drive and a HDD 1Tb D: drive.</p>
<p>One drive folder is in in C. But I would like to keep my Videos subfolder in D, so that the heavy videos do not affect my SSD space.</p>
<p>I hope one day this can be possible.</p>

Hi,<br />
This shouldn't happen at all as the procedure that<br />
you have gone through is correct.<br />
Switch your phone off and again on. This should<br />
solve the problem.<br />
Good luck.<br />

<p>Since I can’t reproduce the issue in my SharePoint Online environment, I’ve created a workspace for you to upload the problematic EPS files for our troubleshooting. You can see how to access the workspace via

                    <p>I am having trouble upgrading from Win7 to 10 Tech Preview-when I try, I get a SYSTEM_SERVICE_ERROR BSOD as soon as the "setting up a few more things" step gets past 2%, and installation reverts. I have an unmodded Dell Inspiron 1545, and the only services
 I think would be incompatible would be 1.Symantec Endpoint Protection, 2.Dropbox 3.0.3, and 3. Realplayer Cloud. I would attach the dump file, but I don't know how to find it.</p>

            <p>Third party Antivirus utilities are a known blocker for the upgrade, so you should really consider removing Symantec EndPoint for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>

<p>Make sure you have full administrative privileges</p>
<p>If you are connected to a domain, switch to a local account</p>

<h2>            Pivot Tables data won&#39;t change to new range</h2>
                    <p>I have an excel sheet that has multiple tas (approx. 52 currently and growing), and previously I was able to create a copy of a tab and modify the data, then change the data range to the new tab data. &nbsp; Recently this has ceased to occur and the pivot table
 will revert back to an old tab.</p>
<p>ie - tabs 1 - 12 are all data and each tab has their own pivot table</p>
<p>I would copy a tab - lets say tab 12 to create tab 13, enter in new data, select analyze, select change data source and it would have tab 12's data highlighted.&nbsp; I would click the new tab (13) and the data since it hasn't increased or decreased in size has
 the same "data range".&nbsp; The data range in the change data source function changes to tab 13 and new data area.&nbsp; Upon clicking ok the data in the pivot table doesn't change values.&nbsp; Going back to the change data source the range is still showing as tab 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not changed any features in my excel ( I do have office 365 so god only knows what they changed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did read somewhere about datamodel or what ever it is called and have not created anything with that, nor do I have any relationships under data&nbsp;</p>

<h3> sdh2003  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can i get windows live messenger on my windows 7.5 smartphone&#63; It was supposed to be there automatically</h2>
                    Messenger is supposed to be on the messaging tile, where sms appear, but it doesn't seem to be able to show my contacts etc. NB: I use a different set of contacts on messenger than for my main phone book. I also use a different email address . I need to
 be able to download an app for messenger, where i can skip between users.

            <p>The integration of windows live messenger into the messenger hub is real, but it only integrates&nbsp;the contacts&nbsp;from your primary windows live account and &nbsp;you will only be able to message with the windows live messenger contacts in your primary windows live
 account.....this is the account you input into the phone when you set it up right out of the box.&nbsp; There is no way to add a second windows live account to the phone so it can be incorporated into the messaging hub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although not integrated into the messaging hub, you might want to check out the IM+ app.&nbsp; This app does allow you to use a different windows live messenger account on the phone.</p>

<p>
</p><p>With VBA it is possible to load another themecolorscheme from the folder. I'll go not into the details about where and how, it is basically</p>
<p>
</p><p>ActiveWorkbook.Theme.ThemeColorScheme.Load</p>
<p>
</p><p>and that is working fine but the default theme does not exists in the folder. How can I reload the default themecolorscheme.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Preferrable in a direct way and not by adding a new workbook to read the default scheme.</p>

</p><p>Why not use the save command (of that same object) to save the existing theme to a temp file (since the user may be using a custom theme and not the default) before you load your custom theme.&nbsp; Then load that file back in and delete it.

    <title>Import a multi-record .DAT file into MS Access&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pat dools  say:</h3>
<h2>            Import a multi-record .DAT file into MS Access&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be receiving a .DAT file with a given day's Sales Orders that I need to&nbsp;import&nbsp;into MS Access (Office 2010 version), then parse out, assign column names, and then export out to MS Excel to pass along to the report users.&nbsp; The .DAT file contains multiple
 Record&nbsp;Types as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; 'F' records - contains general file information and appears once in the beginning of each .DAT file</p>
<p>2) 'SH' records - contains Sales Header information - one record per Sales Order</p>
<p>3) 'SL' records - contains Sales Line information - can be more than one Sales Line for each Sales Header record, each identified by a unique SKU #</p>
<p>4) 'ST' records - is a separator&nbsp; between Sales Orders and appears after each 'SH' record and its related 'SL' record(s)</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; 'T'&nbsp; records - contains Sales Order count information and appears once in the end of each .DAT file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, I'll need to strip out each 'F' and each 'T' record and only import each 'SH' and 'SL' record.&nbsp; I will need to concatenate each 'SH' record to each related 'SL' record so that the Sales Order header info. is properly attached to each Sales Line,
 otherwise, we won't know which Sales Line records belong to which Sales Header records.&nbsp; I will need to run through this concatenation loop attaching 'SH' records to all of their related 'SL' records until I encounter an 'ST' record, which will indicate that
 a new 'SH' record (indicating a new Sales Order) will be the next record type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the record layouts indicating the size of each of the fields for each Record Type.&nbsp; Within the original .DAT file, there are carriage returns at the end of each Record Type, which moves the next record to the next line when it is imported to the destination
 table in MS Access.&nbsp; So, each line begins with 'Record Type' ('F', 'SH', 'SL', 'ST', or 'T').</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What I need is some sort of code that will do the following:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Concatenate the Parent 'SH' record with each of its Child 'SL' records and have each concatenated pair write out to its own record in the table.&nbsp; This looping code will need to know that it should continue&nbsp;this pairing until it encounters an 'ST' record,
 which will indicate the end of a Sales Order and that a new Sales Order record will begin and the 'SH'-'SL' looping concatenation should re-start.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Filter out all 'F', 'ST', and 'T' records so that all that exists are the concatenated 'SH'-'SL' records.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Parse out the concatenated record so that each field is written out to its own column - this will be based on the record layout documentation I have for the 'SH' and 'SL' Record Types.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; Export the new table of 'SH'-'SL' concatenated records to an MS Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I imagine this will be done in VBA once the file has been imported into an MS Access table - does someone have some sample code I can tweak to accomplish this?&nbsp; I've never imported and parsed out data files that contain multiple Record Types in the same
 file before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

ST<br />
T 0000000001</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Here is what we want the <strong>output data</strong> to look like after getting rid of all Record Types besides the 'SH' (Shipping Header) and 'SL' (Shipping Lines):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SH108SH60710663&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0008237016000286&nbsp;&nbsp; CITY&nbsp;&nbsp;ST 01999-9999 062013&nbsp;&nbsp; SL108089901100000&nbsp;</p>
<p>SH108SH60710663&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0008237016000286&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CITY&nbsp;&nbsp;ST 01999-9999 070203&nbsp;&nbsp; SL792004544000000</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, I want the 'SH' record to begin every line, preceding each individual 'SL' record, ensuring that the 'SH' portion of the record has the same begin/end point for every line, as does the 'SL' record.&nbsp; Then, we can parse the 'Header' and 'Line Detail'
 fields according to our file layout documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if anything else is needed and thank you!</p>

            Actually,&nbsp;between one 'SH' record for one sales order and an 'SH' record associated with the
<u>next</u> order, the 'end' point could be different - i.e., the corresponding 'SL' record could begin at a different position depending on the endpoint of the 'SH' record it is paired with.&nbsp; Given this, perhaps it makes more sense the continue 'pairing' SH-SL
 records, but write the 'SH' record type &nbsp;to one field in its entirety, and write its 'SL' record type pair to the next field on the same line.&nbsp; Then, all 'SH' and 'SL' record types would always have a 'starting point' of '1' in their respective columns, and
 the next step would be to parse out the individual fields from the 'SH' &amp; 'SL' 'combined' columns.

    <title>Gorilla Glass is worthless - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Gorilla Glass is worthless</h2>
                    
<p>My Lumia 920 is a month old.&nbsp; It fell out of my coat pocket just 2 feet off the ground and shattered the glass.&nbsp; I had a Samsung&nbsp;Captivate with Gorilla Glass for two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;It probably&nbsp;fell to the ground 30 times and never even scratched.&nbsp; I saw the videos
 online of the guy running over&nbsp;the 920&nbsp;with his car, batting it with a 2x4, dropping it multiple times from various heights, and even bashing it with a hammer.&nbsp; I think mine was defective.&nbsp; AT&amp;T and Nokia&nbsp;say - too bad so sad. Got quotes of $130 - $300 to
 repair. I will try the $130 first.</p>

            Those videos are not made by Nokia, and I don't think you will find any statement that the phone will endure a 2 feet fall in any of Nokias advertising material.

<p>I agree, any glass will break when dropped at certain angles, and at no time has Nokia ever said the screen is unbreakable, gosh if my phone had fallen out of my pocket as many times as &nbsp;yours has, I would definately have &nbsp;invested in a pouch with a &nbsp;belt

<p>I shattered the glass on my 920 for the SECOND time over the weekend. After shatter #1, I put it in a leather "wallet" calse with a magnetic closure figuring it would be protected. It was knocked off of a table, about 3 feet high, hit the floor on the corner,
 the case bounced open and the phone came out of the case and hit the floor. I'm debating whether to have it fixed a 2nd time or just use it cracked for tne next year. It's very disappointing, especially since the glass isn't separate. It's an expensive fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody know of a case that will actually protect the glass? Most of the cases I've seen for this phone go up to the glass but still leave the raised sides exposed. I think it might be just a little too big for my hand which is why I'm finding it so
 drop-prone. I never once dropped my Samsung Focus in 2 years.</p>

<p>I had my Nokia 928 less than a month after switching from a HTC phone, and it slipped from my hand and hit the ground on the bottom right hand corner. The screen immediately cracked halfway up the display and a piece of the screen was lost. I was understandably
 dismayed that the "unbreakable" gorilla glass had shattered so easily after my HTC withstood 10 times more impact than that during the 2 years that I used it. The screen still worked, so I continued to use it while I decided whether or not it was worth paying
 $100 in addition to the monthly insuance fee to replace it. I literally sat it down on my desk at work, and the screen cracked all the way up. I might mention that the actual casing of the phone never sustained a scratch, crack, or damage of any kind. Only
 the gorllia glass. What does that tell you??&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure that I will NEVER buy a Nokia again, and I will not replace my Nokia, but instead go back to my HTC that worked flawlessly for two years. Never again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gorrila glass is not unbreakable, no one makes any claims like that. Frankly you are the one dropping your phone so how is that Nokas fault?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's glass which means if you apply enough pressure it _will_ crack. You were careless and damaged your phone, get it fixed and over it..</p>

<p>Its 'unscratchable', not unbreakable. &nbsp;And even then, Gorilla Glass is prone to traumatic deep scratches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point of Gorilla Glass is that you won't get the normal 'wear and tear' scratches on the surface. &nbsp;Remember any of your old cellphones from the last decade? &nbsp;Even if you were careful, had them in cases, etc... you'd still end up with a screen full of
 really light scratches, just from using the phone normally (unless you had a screen protector). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what Gorilla Glass is good for... no one ever claimed GG was indestructible.</p>

<p>There are no claims it is unscratchable either. Gorrila glass is more scratch resistant than 'normal' glass and that is all there is to it.</p>

<p>In terms of impact resistance Gorilla Glass is stronger than normal glass of the SAME thickness but manufacturers use thinner GG so it is no better than normal glass. So all GG does is allow manufacturers to use thinner glass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for scratch resistance, probably worthless in my experience. It can still be scratched by sand grains.</p>

<h2>            MS Outlook 2010 grays out most insert options.</h2>
                    Last year I purchased Office Professional 2010 that includes Outlook 2010 as part of the Office Suite. &nbsp;Why are most of the Outlook insert options grayed out when trying to insert an attachment in a new email? &nbsp;As I understand it, the grayed features should
 not occur in this version of Outlook.

 latest build 10041 which, after installation will be rolled back to 9841 by itself. I tried booting even with USB. But it doesn't help. Please help me upgrading to the latest build.</p>

</p><p>You can still <strong>view and print </strong>UML diagrams created in previous versions of Visio, but

    <title>How to sort and organize Outlook Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gibbon22  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to sort and organize Outlook Folders</h2>
                    I have many outlook folders (roughly 400), and some of them are now duplicates. For each of my current clients, potential clients, and lost clients, I keep a folder. Every so often I forget to move a folder from potential to current, or potential to lost,
 etc. I would like to quickly search the folder titles to ensure that I catch any of these duplicates and compile all the client information under a single folder. However, the idea of searching these lists by hand, when I anticipate less than half a dozen
 duplicate folders is daunting. Is there any sort of "sort" feature, or a way to look at and organize Outlook folders?

<p>No, there is no way to do that in Outlook.</p>
<p>You can do an Advanced Find (CTRL+SHIFT+F) across your mailbox and then search on the corresponding email addresses or domains (or whatever you use to identify a client). You can then move these items to the correct folder.</p>
<p>Afterwards, right click on the root of your mailbox-&gt; Properties-&gt; Folder Size...<br />
Here you can then review your empty or small folders produced by your moving actions.</p>

            Yes but its almost the same as installing it in ur phone memory as it occupies the same amount of space. This is the main reason why people fear opting for windows phone devices.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There are possible reasons why you're getting a delay when receiving emails under your account. In most cases, this is due to a server configuration. Let's isolate the issue by providing us the following information:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using an Outlook application to open your Mailbox, or online at Outlook.com?</li><li>In what device are you trying to access your mailbox?</li><li>When does the issue start?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried?</li></ul>

<p>Hi there thanks for the replay, but guess you are wrong here, i saw many similar topics talked here as same as mine,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook/emails-from-office-365-being-delivered-with-huge/9024df59-7ad4-4ff8-81d0-29fe15c14232</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is just 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>and this is about 365, as the mail delay happens only from 365 servers, its all over the internet and many experience this, but MS still didn't give a solution for this, i even called them and explained, but they ran away by saying you are not a 365 customer,
 but they understand its BECAUSE of 365 servers, if 365 guys implementing new stuff, its appreciated at least tell the solutions or adjustments to do in mail servers, anyway, if you guys cant answer this, its fine, but cant say its not related to you, this
 issue only comes from 365</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks and bye!</p>

    <title>Corrupt Silverlight - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris grey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt Silverlight</h2>
                    I have found plenty of instructions about how to uninstall and reinstall Silverlight but my question is, "Why does Silverlight constantly seem to become corrupt?". We use this as a necessary component of our online system and we get messages from users
 weekly with reports of Silverlight errors which seem to only be resolved by uninstalling and installing Silverlight. We do not do anything TO Silverlight so why does it corrupt?

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be a compatibility issue between Silverlight and Internet Explorer. We would suggest checking the post of Anil Kumar B from this

            I had already seen that article. The problem is that we have been seeing this issue for some time now and it has occurred on a number of different peoples PCs. Every time it occurs the solution is to fully uninstall Silverlight and installing a ‘clean’
 copy.

<h2>            Updating linked cells when rows are inserted &#47; deleted in source</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp; I see my problem is not a unique issue, but the posted results are not working for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a master list in Sheet A and cells in Sheet B that refer directly to this list.&nbsp; If I edit items the master list A, the cells are immediately and automatically updated in B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I add or remove rows / items in Sheet A, these changes are NOT picked up in Sheet B.&nbsp; The only way I can get this to refresh is to highlight the top cell(s) in B and drag down the list to reinsert the formulas.&nbsp; Then it updates beautifully - but I
 have to manually do this every time I add or delete items from the master list to force the refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on info found here and elsewhere, I have tried changing the references in Sheet B to
<strong>=INDIRECT(ref_text,T/F)</strong>, but linking to a different workbook gives me a #REF error, whether the modifier is set to TRUE, FALSE, or omitted.&nbsp; INDIRECT also only seems to work if both sheets are always open, which may not be true - and in my
 case it doesn't work even when both sheets *are* open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried changing the references in Sheet B to <strong>=INDEX(ref_text,1,1)</strong>.&nbsp; This returns the correct value regardless of the status of Sheet A, but like the direct link, it also fails to update when rows are added or deleted from the
 source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

            My solution is to utilize Power Query to link instead of formula.
<br />
<br />Basically, you load up the Sheet A table to Power Query, and load the Query to Sheet B where you can also use formula.
<br />
<br />I made an example for you: <a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AtZQr_vCCvAW4I5ecpYBMfwGVdLYtA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://1drv.ms/x/s!AtZQr_vCCvAW4I5ecpYBMfwGVdLYtA</a>
<br />
<br />Here, Sheet A contains the info you need, and the last column is an arbitrary column that I suppose you want to link to Sheet B.
<br />
<br />Now, on Sheet B, the first column of the table is a query of Sheet A, and the second column is calculated using formula. 
<br />
<br />Whenever you make changes to Sheet A table, simply go to Sheet B, right click and select Refresh, and you will have your answer.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<p>Hi, Vijay:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Sheet B, my cell formulas look like this:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDEX('[Sheet A.xlsx]Unit Costs'!$H5,1,1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously had them as direct links, like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>='[SheetA.xlsx]Unit Costs'!$H5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both workbooks are in the same folder, and can stay there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Do I assume that the deleted email is still in Deleted folder ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, 2 ways to "transfer" it back to Inbox..........</p>
<p>1. Go to the Deleted folder &gt; &nbsp;Left click at the deleted email and HOLD &gt; drag it back into Inbox folder.</p>
<p>2.Go to the Deleted folder &gt; &nbsp;Left click at the deleted email &gt; toolbar at top, click Move To &gt; click Inbox from the drop down box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does one of the above work ?</p>
