<h2>            Giant memory leak</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. Im experiencing some problems in windows 10 developer preview. It all started when a security/windows update (not a new build) came out a week ago..&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens is that when i turn on my pc, everything is fine, but after only 2 minuted, everything starts slowing dows, and 2 more minutes later, my pc is almost froze.. I managed to open task manager (took me 5minutes) and it **** saying that system and
 compact memory was using over a gb of ram and from my initial 6gb of ram, only 0.1 were available... Im running a intel i7, nvidia gt635mm (2gb) and 6gb of ddr3 ram. I need some help because i simply cant use my pc for more than 3 minutes</p>

<h2>            making multiple selections on a treeveiw in Access 2007</h2>
                    I'm using a TreeView control on a form in Access 2007 at my work.&nbsp; I need to set it so I can make multiple selections.&nbsp; When I do it on my home computer (same Access version) I can set the selection, but the version I have at work doesn't have that as
 a property of the treeview control.&nbsp; It also doesn't have a checkbox option on the property list. &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm using Microsoft Treeview Control 6.0.&nbsp; Do I need to have a certain reference set?&nbsp; Does anyone know how to set this.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

            <p>The reference is automatically set when you insert a Treeview control. Just check in the VBA editor &gt; Tools &gt; References and observe a reference to Windows Common Controls 6.0 (SP6). It also tells you where that file is.</p>
<p>Check its version number. Install the latest version on the other computer and you should be golden.</p>
<p>Of course you set the SingleSel property to False on your treeview control.</p>

<h2>            Search people in Outlook web that are in a sub contacts list or not in primary contact list</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating. We are Office 365 users, using both the desktop and web versions. I created separate contacts lists. When doing a search on the web, I can find people and distribution groups in my main contacts but cannot find anything in different
 contacts lists other than my main contact list. What am I missing? I have been researching and cannot find anything. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Ed Frias,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After testing on our lab, may I confirm whether the “Sub Test contacts” contact folder is created on an Outlook desktop client then is synced to online? You may try the following steps to see if these steps
 work for this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. In Outlook Web App-&gt;select “Sub Test contacts” contact folder.</p>
<p>2. Right-click it and choose “<strong>Move to “Your contacts”</strong>”.</p>
<p>3. In People pane, enter one contact list name in search field to see if the result returns this contact list, then move this contact folder back to under
<strong>Other Contacts</strong> folder to see if issue continues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is suggested to create contact folder directly in Outlook Web App and add list in it to test this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<h2>            I need to locate my MS Office 2013 Pro Plus product key after Repair</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For about the past week word and excel documents that I receive by email have been crashing when I tried to open them saying there was an error with opening "protected view". After doing some research which seemed to indicate it might be a problem with the
 upgrade to Windows 10 I did recently, <strong>I decided to do an "Online Repair" of my MS Office 2013 Pro Plus which is running on my&nbsp;Windows Surface Pro 2 tablet</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am now being asked for a product key to activate MS Office and the email address I used to set up the Windows Surface Pro 2 tablet is for some reason not associated with the MS office product.</strong> I don't have the product key, it was part
 of a volume licence purchased by a company I was working for a couple of years ago. That company does not exist any more and I have no way of getting the product key. I was able to find the last 5 digits of the key using&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Find-your-Office-product-key-after-installation-026bc81b-6b2f-4052-b433-f41e6cc31c5a
 but have not been able to find any way to retrieve the full product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also discovered that in my upgrade to Windows 10 that there was no restore point set up so I can't even roll back to before I did the repair......</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I made multiple calls and chat support requests to Microsoft this afternoon and after being transferred, hung up on, fobbed off and rerouted I was finally told that my only option is to buy a new MS Office licence. To say I am angry is an understatement.
</strong>I have wasted so much time on this today and find it incredible that my genuine version of MS Office cannot be validated in some way remotely by Microsoft. They seem to be able to track everything else I do on my computer so I cannot understand why
 they can't do this. <strong>It feels like a scam by Microsoft to force people to buy another licence for a product already genuinely purchased.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there has to be some way for Microsoft to validate that my original copy of MS Office is genuine and supply me with the product key to activate the repaired version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help gratefully appreciated - I can't even find a way to email Microsoft with the details. Their online contact chat facility is a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please HELP! and thanks in advance.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hi Mohan, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried that already. For some reason my Office Pro Plus isn't associated with the email address I've been using for the past 2 years since I installed office originally. I have no way to get the original product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I find the key in the registry or can an engineer take control of my computer to help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a genuine version of MS Office Pro Plus on my computer and I am not accepting that I need to re-purchase Office Pro Plus when its already been purchased. At no point in the "repair" process was I aware that I would need the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The 2013 Pro Plus Key is not stored in the registry, or anywhere else on the system</p>
<p>And depending on the exact type of volume license if its dependent on the original Company the license terminates when the company license ends.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive is contantly downloading files I dont want</h2>
                    <p>Using windows 10 and Office 365. Everything up to date as of 1/7/2019 as I am writing this.(One Drive version&nbsp;<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=844652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">18.222.1104.0007</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive is contantly downloading files in system Pictures files which I do not need on this device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the option "Save Space and download files as you use them". I have also disabled all non-Microsoft from booting with windows as was recommended in a similar thread with this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After OneDrive is done syncing dozens of gigabytes of photos I dont need on this device I right click on my pictures folder and select "free up space". OneDrive then removes all these files locally only to start downloading them moments later. This is infuriating.
 My whole system and network gets slowed down and there's nothing I can do about it unless I want to turn off OneDrive (rendering it useless). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its worth noting that I selected my system pictures folder to be the pictures folder in one drive so perhaps there is some system process that is making it think I am accessing these folders? However I have also done this with my documents and music folder
 but don't have this problem with these folders.&nbsp; Please someone make it stop.</p>

            Thanks for the reply but that is not the solution I am looking for. I want to have access to these files in the event I need any of them but I don't need all them to be saved locally (there's almost 200 gb in this folder) also The OneDrive pictures folder
 is set to my default windows' Pictures folder. &nbsp;

</p><p>I installed 3 licenses of Office 365 on 3 different laptops using Windows 8.1 Professional. &nbsp;All installations are in English. &nbsp;I also downloaded, installed and enabled the Dutch language proofing tool on all 3 computers. &nbsp;None of them are working. &nbsp;See
 pictures below. &nbsp;I tried the suggestion I saw on an earlier post about a similar issue (quick repair of the Office 365 installation), but to no avail.</p>

<h2>            How to look up the longest string of zeros in a row and return the number of cells in that string&#63;</h2>
                    This should be simple, but I'm not aware of the correct formula:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A1:A16 all return "30"</div>
<div>A17:A27 all return "0"</div>
<div>A28:A43 all return "40"</div>
<div>A43:A48 all return "0"</div>
<div>A48:A50 all return "7"</div>
<div>A50:A56 all return "0"</div>
<div>A56 returns "1"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now all I need is a formula that finds the longest string of consecutive zeros, in this case A17:A27, and return the number of zeros in that string: "11". Anyone know a formula that can do that?</div>
                </div>

            I assume that you have a header row in row 1.
<div>So your data starts from A2 till A57.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now take help of one helper column, say its B.</div>
<div>Now in B2 give this formula and drag it down till your data, say till B57.</div>
<div><br />
<div>=IF(AND(A1=A2,A2=0),B1+1,IF(A2=0,1,0))</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now give this formula to get the range of longest string and number of zeros, give this formula.</div>
<div><br />
<div>=ADDRESS(MATCH(MAX($B$2:$B$57),$B$1:$B$57,0)-MAX($B$2:$B$57)+1,1,4)&amp;":"&amp;ADDRESS(MATCH(MAX($B$2:$B$57),$B$1:$B$57,0),1,4)&amp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Number of Zeros are &nbsp; &nbsp;"&amp;MAX($B$2:$B$57)</div>

<h2>            Favorites won&#39;t delete</h2>
                    I&nbsp;got Windows 8.1 when I got my new laptop a few months ago.&nbsp; I had to merge at least 2 favorites lists (one from Firefox and one from IE).&nbsp; Today I tried deleting some of the listings, both folders and individual sites, but found they would just move
 all the deleted ones to the bottom of the favorites list.&nbsp; I don't think this has been happening all along since I got the new computer but....&nbsp; WTH?&nbsp; How can I get rid of all the duplicates and unwanted sites?

            <p>Hi Laurie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue sounds like a permission problem with the Favorites folder.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Please make sure that you are using an account with administrator rights.&nbsp;Let’s try some basic troubleshooting to check if this is caused by the Internet Explorer performance issues.&nbsp;I would suggest you to follow these methods and let us know the results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Run the Internet Explorer performance troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue is caused by the Internet Explorer Performance, then let’s try running the Internet Explorer Performance Troubleshooter. Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click on “Internet Explorer Performance”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, then you may check that you have administrator rights to the Favorites folder in your user account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Assigning permissions to the favorite folder</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try assigning permissions to the favorite folder and then check this issue. Follow the steps to apply permissions for a user:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Navigate to the location “C:\users\ and open your user account folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Right-click on the “Favorites” folder and then click “Properties”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click the “Security” tab, and then click “Edit”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>To set permissions for a user that is not listed under Group or user names, click “Add”, type the name of the user or group, click “OK”, select the permissions, and then click “OK”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Eddie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As posted above, I am afraid it is not feasible to get the time when a account got blocked. I suggest you submit your feedback via
<p>
</p><p>In the .csv file exported from Office 365 admin portal, we can see the time when we created the account and when we changed password, &nbsp;not the time when it got blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

    <title>How to create a &#34;Compiled Album&#34; within WMP12 from single - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brewsterblock  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create a &#34;Compiled Album&#34; within WMP12 from single songs already in WMP12</h2>
                    <p>I am in the process (finally) like many others trying to organize decades of LPs; Tapes; and Audi CDs on an HP laptop running Windows 10 and WMP12. I started with the CD's. The 1st step was copying via a USB memory stick existing WMP files and iTunes files
 from an older XP tower. I copied them into the MUSIC folder on the laptop. Net result after firing up WMP12 was not bad. Most of the CDs were there plus a lot of singles with origin unknown. I then loaded many more CDs directly into WMP12 using auto-RIP and
 the single&nbsp;laptop drive - again reasonably successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a classic analytic, I have spent days reading whatever I could find on the web in general and this forum. There were a lot of problems but here is the biggest challenge: I am trying to understand just what logic WMP12 uses to "synch" itself with my
 laptop MUSIC folder files. I will distinguish between activity in WMP by using "WMP" and PC MUSIC folder activity by using "EXP" since I use File Explorer to create and find music files in the Music folder. I learned in the research how to delete the WMP folder
 and let it re-build itself. I seems to work OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to do&nbsp;3 things: </p>
<p>1) Group many of the discreet singles into a "compiled" album of my own creation - instrumentals for example.</p>
<p>2) Same as 1) except that some of the tracks have already been grouped into an "album" by WMP. I am assuming that I can select these tracks as in 1) and then after they are on the compiled album, delete the now empty album to which they belonged</p>
<p>3) A lot of the artwork in WMP for albums is wrong. I was hoping that I&nbsp;could and that WMP would substitute a generic picture for them. I did read about and have succeeded in copy/pasting a picture file from elsewhere in my picture folder but it seems that
 is the only way??</p>
<p>
</p><p>One problem I did "solve" is what gave rise to my logic question. I have the Barbra Streisand Essential 2 disk set. They all loaded except the last track on disc 2 which kept showing up in WMP as a separate album. I saw the other 2 in both WMP and EXP. I
 successfully found and loaded the artwork of Barbra, but not on this single in WMP. In WMP I kept examining the data items by right-clicking in WMP on Barbra picture; selecting "find album info" and the choosing EDIT in the resulting window. Finally I noticed
 that the orphan album had in the album field on this widow showed the following: [Disc 2] as part of the title. The correct albums did not have the square brackets. Once I removed and saved the title the orphan album in WMP automatically disappeared and jumped
 into place as the last Disc 2 track!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So before I tackle the rest, what music data elements does WMP use to decide what is in a particular album and what does not matter?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Brewster</p>
<p>OK - Let's start with album organization - first thing to be aware of is avoiding confusing the database in WMP. If you want to group together a bunch of tracks create a work folder in '<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Documents</span>' where they
 will not be monitored by WMP. Copy/paste the required music files to that folder, then you can get to work. If they are to be grouped together as one album (this isn't strictly necessary) highlight all the tracks and r-click for properties. In the 'details'
 tab - 'album' field, type the proposed name and this will be applied to all the tracks - if it is a mixed set you probably want to go for 'Various Artists' as the 'album artist' at the same time - so this will also be applied to all tracks. Same for 'Genre'
 - you can create your own genre (Compilation - Single etc.) which is useful.</p>
<p>Then you will need to work through the individual 'properties' details tab for Track No (#) and 'Contributing Artist'.</p>
<p>You may also want to include the track number in the file name (General tab) so the order in 'explorer' and WMP match.&nbsp;Art can be added later - let me know if you're OK with this so far... Cheers, Ric.</p>
<p>btw - you can mix singles separately - here's an example of how I keep mine... ('explorer' view)</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Thanks so much RicW-nw for your quick and helpful reply. I have a CD obviously someone created on a blank disc. When I ripped it, it ended up scattered in WMP. So some of your suggestion I already tried and
 it worked.&nbsp;In EXPLORER / Music folder, I did change the file details in properties/details, from a blank album name on all of the tracks/music files with one of my own. I also put something in &nbsp;Title and WMP now does show it as one album.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your point about not confusing WMP &amp; using a work folder in DOCUMENTS is somewhat confusing me - I was not doing this. I am working directly in C\Users\</span><em><span>My Name</span></em><span>\Music.
 So …</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) Using a work folder won’t I have to copy the final result back into the PC’s Music folder eventually?
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>(or point to the new work folder in WMP Organize\Manage Libraries\Music along with the existing standard Music folder - that’s where WMP points now)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2) </span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I still don’t know where most of the singles in my WMP12 came from – probably somewhere on my
 old XP when I used WMP11 there. I certainly don’t have the CDs for them. Ii seems then that</span><span>&nbsp;WMP11 on the XP found them outside its My Music file on that machine? You seem to be saying that WMP12 won’t look outside the
 Music folder on my laptop? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3) Finally here is another problem which I could perhaps explain if I knew what music tags WMP examines to create albums. I have the double “The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac” album(s). I ripped them and they
 appear as 2 albums in both WMP12 and EXPLORER Music file. However one track on the CD did not get included in Disc 1 The RIP process returned an error. It shows up in WMP in its own album. I don't see it in Explorer. It plays fine. However I noticed that its
 format/file type is M4A and others on that disc are WMA. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since I can’t seem to get WMP12 to merge it back into Disc 1 after many efforts, could that be a factor – different format of just 1 track? Disc 2 by the way has M4A for all its tracks. Seems strange – 2
 formats on the same album.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry about the core dump here but my brain is swimming with questions. I have tried to find a decent book or manual on WMP and how it works but I can’t. I will ask about how you are handling singles another
 time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Promise to be shorter next time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>No worries - we can take some time over this. Once you get a routine established - it's a bit like riding a bike - you'll do it automatically.</p>
<p>Yes you're right - you will eventually move the work folder back to the music folder and then WMP will read the revised track details back into its library. Working within WMP is fine if you are just sorting stuff out in one album, but with the compilations
 it tends to start cross-referencing tracks mixing up artwork and causing all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>One of the issues you raised in the question was 'what music data elements does WMP use to decide what is in a particular album' - well it uses an online database (FAI) which often has multiple versions of one album. It doesn't always get it right and it
 isn't a great database anyway. The trick is to get an album's info correct <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
before</span> ripping it&nbsp;(making manual adjustments first if necessary). </p>
<p>It's a good idea to limit WMP's influence to the basics otherwise it can change back work you have done. Before doing too much more have a look at these WMP settings (top left) in 'Organize' - Options; the two&nbsp;main tabs of concern are the 'Library' and 'Privacy'
 tabs. Uncheck boxes to look like mine (below) - this allows WMP necessary access but stops it over-ruling your choices! In particular uncheck everything in the left hand red box - and also that second down on the right (update music files) Then click 'apply'
 and OK at the foot&nbsp;...</p>
<p>I'm finishing for this evening but I'll be checking in tomorrow - R.</p>

            <p>Thanks Ric. Had unchecked the Library one but not the Privacy. Wasted more time today than I care to recall. Double CD's seem to be a real problem. I also ripped a Jerry Lee Lewis CD that only has 10 tracks. What a mess. There was less that 50% data right
 in WMP. So I click on a track to play it and a totally different song plays. It is correct from the list on my CD but the wrong song title entirely from the WMP list on the right. I don't know what you call these areas in WMP - just that the left seems to
 be the Navigation Panel. Artwork also wrong. When I try to look up the music tags by finding the album on the net even then a lot of data is wrong. When it gives me 2 lists in a window - left half is supposedly MATCHED tracks (but inactive) and right side
 allows me to click drop downs to select the "correct" title, things got even worse. I have no Idea what I am supposed to do with that user interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sound like overall you are telling me to manually enter stuff in a work folder in Explorer unknown to WMP then when it is as good as I can get it copy it to Music also in Explorer and start WMP12 with the above unchecked? Still means I am typing everything
 myself.</p>
<p>

 is paying little attention to Media Player.</p>
<p>Unfortunately if the database is wrong manual correction is the only alternative other than installing a different media player that has a better database (e.g. &nbsp;iTunes is much better - data-wise). However like with your Jerry Lee Lewis disc - you can
<p>And although you may have to type in the basics - to cut down on the finger work you can copy and paste the song titles from a site like Discogs which will usually have the correct version. They need to be copied one at a time but at least you don't have

            <p>Hey Ric. Grew up in the '50s myself (born in the '40s). The JLL CD is "Jerry Lee Lewis The Original Golden Hits". There are 10 tracks. It says ELITE&nbsp;and Original SUN Recordings. There's a PolyGram name here also. USB# if it helps is 042284565523.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About singles. I have one&nbsp;CD ( burned by a friend&nbsp;) with over 190 MP3 '50s songs. Similar for '60s' '70s etc. They are all in WMP12 as singles. Can't imagine how tough it would be to try to merge those. I tried a few but got nowhere. Being an IT guy I guess
 it just seemed natural since they are all on one CD and under 1 folder name in my PC Music folder, that I somehow group them in WMP12 as one since that is what happens with most commercial&nbsp;CDs that I RIP. By the way now that I turned off those checkmarks I
 am having less trouble so Thanks again. I know I can create a playlist which is almost as good but I am assuming I will have to drag them all one at a time into that list area on the right in WMP. Ideally I could just drag the "album" I suspect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also wanted to create a simple directory tree in the PC&nbsp;Music folder that I can easily back up to a jump drive or give a copy to anyone who might want it or just a part of it - like these compiled&nbsp;albums. The 2nd reason was that I have A Yamaha&nbsp;audio which
 will take the USB stick as an input. I have tried it and it works. I was going to Bluetooth from my PC to the Yamaha which also works but they are on 2 different floors of the house - not so good for Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Yamaha can then broadcast it using Yamaha MUSICCAST to any Yamaha speaker in the house wirelessly. I'm told if I make both the PC and Yamaha known to my WIFI then the Yamaha can access the PC directly. Have not tried that yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other tricks up your sleeve on singles please let me know.</p>

            <p>Indeed Brewster... - probably just missed being born within range of the Bow Bells but close enough!</p>
<p>Well a quick dash through the &nbsp;UK database (they vary locally which sometimes doesn't help!) pulled up four albums with 10 tracks. Give me the first three track&nbsp;titles and I'll see if any of them look like matching.</p>
<p>I see your problem with the mp3 CD - with a standard audio CD it's easy to make corrections before ripping it. The only option with mp3 discs is to copy the tracks organizing as you go. Say for example you found 24 instrumental tracks that you wanted to
 make one set, the best method would be to copy the individual tracks into the one folder (preferably in Documents as I said earlier) You can then title the folder (e.g.) '24 Instrumental Greats' and apply that title in the Properties Details tab - along with
 the other adjustments mentioned in my first reply. Then when it's all done transfer it to your music folder. WMP will then read it as that album (and you can copy and paste a suitable piece of artwork to the icon square).</p>
<p>Let me know about the track titles and we'll carry on from there...&nbsp; Cheers, Ric.</p>

            <p>Hey Ric. Spent 2 3/4 years in London in the early 70's. One of our flatmates was Cockney so I picked up a bit of it for laughs. Have a look at this. Over me 'ed: http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk/cockney_translator/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several CDs all in MP3 so I am able to just copy the mp3 files straight into a folder of my own creation. I tried it in my Music folder and sure enough WMP12 picked them up - as singles but that was expected. In these cases they are only an a given
 CD because someone thinks they are all '50's; '60's etc so I will just create my own PlayLists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was quite a discussion on WMP12 not showing a RIP button. It went back &amp; forth with some saying it does not exist and others that it does. I have used it a lot and it is there for sure ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was pointed out by someone that if the CD already is in MP3 format then there will be no RIP button in WMP12. That was my experience also and I spent a lot of time looking. However as I said all I had to do was copy the MP3 files&nbsp;into the right folder
 and voila WMP12 found them and sucked them up like a Dyson!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found several JLL also. This is </p>

<p>3 Breathless</p>

            <p>Thanks for that - it doesn't match any of the four I found but armed with that I can take another look - there may be a version that has extra tracks (but that doesn't matter too much if 1-10 are in the correct order).</p>
<p>Yep that's correct - no rip button if it's a data disc. Again that's why I copy anything like that to Documents first, so that it can be sorted before WMP carves it up! I do this with downloads too because sometimes the track titles or numbers need reorganizing.</p>
<p>I'll check this out and be back tomorrow sometime - after the dentist has finished with me! - R.</p>

            <p>Don't waste more time on JLL Ric. You have been very helpful. I just typed in the names of 2 discs (double) with 20 tracks each. Since I already ripped them in WMP12 all 20 were there in each case - wrong titles and art. But I found that if I updated them
 in the ALBUM and TITLE fields in Explorer, then when I SAVED the Properties, WMP title was updated a couple of seconds later - I was observing 2 small separate windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So 10 tracks in JLL is no big deal!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should be done the CDs soon - then on to Cassettes and LPs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which side of the pond are you on? T any rate go to YOUTUBE and type in at the top in SEARCH
</p>
<p>enter "Dallad of Donald and Hillary". That's me. Did it just before the election.</p>

    <title>Can I use a Frame inside a Table in W07&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vagulus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I use a Frame inside a Table in W07&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a document where the text is contained in a table for page formatting purposes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to insert an illustration with a caption within a table&nbsp;cell containing text as shown.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdb49701-0982-4889-8ce3-fc3fd1036a66" /></p>
<p>The idea is&nbsp;to be able to keep both objects together and position the pair of them within the Table Cell.&nbsp; Then the text in the cell could flow around the pair of them.&nbsp; I expected to be able to highlight the two objects and Insert a Frame around them but
 as soon as I highlight them the <em>Insert Frame</em> icon on my quick access toolbar greys out - is disenabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some way to get <em>Insert Frame </em>to work, or is their some other way to achieve the aim?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t change file association to Excel from Windows Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> axellpl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change file association to Excel from Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a Dell workstation with preinstalled windows and office 2016 from Windows Store. I need to make file association .xml&nbsp;-&gt; Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I don't see Excel in App list, it's not installed in a default&nbsp;directory like for instance Program Files/Microsoft/Office, but in AppData/Local/Microsoft/excel (not exact path). When I browse manually I can open this excel app (0 kB) and everything
 is ok, but when I want to make an association to it I get "Permission&nbsp;denied". I tried to change it in regedit but with no luck, I can't even find the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Can you please help me with it? I tried basically everything I found on the internet, with no results. I need to change it for a&nbsp;user without admin permissions, so when I open regedit&nbsp;as admin does HKEY_CURRENT_USER show current user as admin or user which
 is currently logged in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>AxellPL</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There’s a possibility that the current user profile you’re using on your Windows 10 PC is corrupted. To have this concern isolated, I’d suggest that you try
<strong>creating a new local user</strong> and then try to perform the file association from there. See this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you’re done creating a new local user, try to verify if you’ll be able to see Excel in the list of applications when performing the file association. If so, then it’s confirmed that the issue has something to do with the profile
 being used initially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

<p>Hello Louie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;thank you for your response! This problem currently occurs on 20 Dell workstations, I created new users on all of them, but nothing has changed. It looks like the Office version from Windows Store is really strange and bugged. The only solution I found
 is Office re-installation, but basically, it's not a solution but an escape from the problem with Office from Windows Store. In the near future, I will have to install tens or hundreds of these workstations and reinstalling Office on each of them will consume
 a lot&nbsp;of time. There are also problems with "send to: mail recipient", nothing happens when I try to use this function, I also tried everything I found, but it's impossible to create proper association when there is no proper application I can refer&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>Hi Paola,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To delete sip_profile name folder, please stop all Skype for Business and Teams related processes first from your Task Manager&gt; Process in Apps and Background processes. After this, please continue with the steps from Oliver's message and let us know whether
 the issue persists.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Build 9860&#58; System Wakes Up Every 20 Minutes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oreveredrist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 9860&#58;  System Wakes Up Every 20 Minutes</h2>
                    <p>Build 9860: &nbsp;System wakes up every 20 minutes, yet "Allow Wake Timers" in my Power Plan is Disabled. &nbsp;I assume that means my system should NOT wake up because of scheduled tasks. &nbsp;Also, I can find nothing in Task Scheduler that is set to run every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: &nbsp;oh, poo. &nbsp;Instead of digging through Power Plans and Task Scheduler, I should have started with the easy stuff. &nbsp;I opened a Command Prompt and entered:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>powercfg -devicequery wake_armed</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>That showed my keyboard, mouse, and ethernet adapter as capable of waking the system. &nbsp;I forgot to change the power settings for the ethernet adapter when I loaded Windows 10 on this computer. &nbsp;Going to the Network &amp; Sharing Center, &nbsp;Change Adapter Settings,
 right-clicking on my adapter and selecting Properties, hitting the Configure button, going to the Power Management tab, and unchecking "Allow this Device to Wake the Computer" seems to have fixed it.</p>

    <title>How to block incoming call and chat when sharing desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michele_8778  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to block incoming call and chat when sharing desktop</h2>
                    <p>We often use Skype in order to show our desktop to our customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very critical problem with this, is that when we hare sharing our desktop, it can happen that we receive a second call, or a chat from another customer.</p>
<p>This is very bad for us, because customer name and also maybe the logo, shows in the middle of the screen or, anyway, in a visible way.</p>
<p>The customer we are talking to and the customer calling us may also be competitor, so we absolutely don't want that one can see the oter calling us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to completely stop Skype from receiving incoming calls or incoming chats, while we are in call?<br />
Also anything we can do manually it is ok for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,<br />
Michele<br />
