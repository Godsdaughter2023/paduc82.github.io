<h2>            Clubs on xbox live why are they not updating their feeds &#63;</h2>
                    Is anybody else having trouble with clubs that you belong to not updating the latest feeds I have noticed that I am unable to send screenshots to all of the Forza related clubs that I am a member of and none of them are showing the latest posts . Even
 the awesome screenshot club won't show the latest feed of screenshots .

Hi</p>
<p>That is a strange one and doesn't resemble any start button that I have ever seen. It doesn't even fit on the Taskbar?</p>
<p>My first reaction would be some kind of malicious infection. Microsoft offers free, online support for security related issues. You can&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/protect/resources/support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start Here</a>&nbsp;to take advantage of this.</p>
<p>Also, have you installed any third party utilities that change the Start Button, or anything associated with Themes?</p>
<p>You might also want to try using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Restore-system-files-and-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Firefox &#40;or any non-IE browser&#41; causes Windows 8 to lock - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Firefox &#40;or any non-IE browser&#41; causes Windows 8 to lock up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been using Windows 8 since it was officially released (I hadn't played around with the previews so it was a bit of a shock), but I've really been trying to give it a go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I keep coming up against a number of deal breaking issues, the chief of which is that using firefox will occassionally cause Win8 to completely lock up. Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't work and the only way to get my laptop responsive is to hard reset
 it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is exactly as described here <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/W8ITProPreRel/thread/0f20fd22-a305-455f-9fe4-0caed949b74d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/W8ITProPreRel/thread/0f20fd22-a305-455f-9fe4-0caed949b74d/</a>&nbsp;for the Windows 8 preview (there are other posts on this issue on the RP and RTM candidates if you search, but I've not found anyone complaining
 about the actual realeased product and this issue).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I do note that there are two possible fixes but niether of which I want to use. I don't want to turn off my processors low power states; I have an untrabook which is supposed to be low power in order to get a full day's battery for a reason. Similarly
 I don't want to install hyper-v and run Win8 as a guest OS; my ultrabook is already pretty weady as it is without loosing reasources to a hypervisor (I know it wouldn't be much, but it would still be something).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, is anyone else suffering from this issue and is there anything Microsoft is doing about it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>~Dan</p>
<p>P.S. There are no events in the event&nbsp;log, the laptop has no AV installed other than Security Essentials and the only applications installed (aside from drivers) are Office 2013, Visual Studio 2010 and firefox.</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community forum. I understand that Windows 8 computer freezes locks up with any other browser except
 Internet Explorer. <span>&nbsp;</span>In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly do you mean when you say “causes Windows 8 to lock up”?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may perform clean boot and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to place the computer in clean boot
 state.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> window type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’.
</b>In the<b> Task Manager window </b>under<b> startup tab, </b>
right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>f) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </span></b><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns.<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
<br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem.<br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to
 clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps
 to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> window type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</p>

            Imran,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your replay. To address your questions:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>By completely lock-up I mean the following; all windows become unresponsive. Button presses aren't registered (caps lock, num-lock etc). Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't response and Ctrl-Shift-Esc doesn't start task manager. The mouse is responsive but nothing reacts
 to any clicks. The only way to return the computer to working order is to hard reset it.<br />
</li><li>There are no events in the event log except for an event stating that windows did not shut down correctly.</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not believe that this issue is related to any particular service and is not a bug within firefox. The next time it occurs, I shall certainly try your suggestions to eliminate/prove this. The conclusion I have read (and is alluded to in the thread I
 linked to) is that it is a kernel issue with how Windows 8 manages the power states for specifically Intel processors with integrated graphics; Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge. As I understand it, with the advent of HTML5 browsers are now using the more advanced
 features of an iGPU when rendering a web page. The lock-up occurs when the browser requests one of these features which has been "put to sleep" in order to save power. The kernel is unable to activate the necessary power state and things get in a twist and
 the lock up occurs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The two solutions I posted about are a work around only.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The first is to disable the processors advanced C states within the BIOS (assuming that you even can). This will stop Windows putting core/parts of the processor to sleep and therefore the bug. All very well in a desktop with a fixed power supply (though
 not particularly environmentally sound), but in a laptop working from a battery a short cut to a flat battery. As a means to testing that you are suffering from this problem it is a very fast way to confirm it is indeed the same issue.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The other solution is to run Windows 8 as a guest OS on a hypervisor, which then uses the hypervisor Kernel to manage the processor power states. You can achieve this easily without reinstalling Windows 8 by activating the hyper-v feature (though I think
 that you need to have Win8 Pro to be able to do that). Whilst this is a solution, I am unsure of the performance impact though and also what effect there will be on the laptop having to access hardware 2nd hand as it were. I'm not willing to test at this point
 but given the option of rolling back to Windows 7 vs the hyper-v option, I will select the latter first in order to minimise the disruption.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Honestly though I would have hoped that given the number of people affected by this issue during the release preview that Microsoft would have addressed it. It would be nice to know if there is a hotfix or a patch in the workings ... or if there was a patch
 released, then I'd like to suggest that it hasn't been successful.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that I would provide an update on this Windows 8 issue, which I have to say has not improved, but in fact gotten worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I performed a clean install of Windows 8* shortly after posting here to see if that would help with the issue, unfortunately that was not the case and it continues today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am, however, also having a&nbsp;number of other issue which are equally affecting my Windows 8 usage.&nbsp;These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>When performing file actions within Windows Explorer, such as copy/paste or renaming files, Windows will crash in exactly the same way as the browser issue detailed above; namely the system will become unresponsive to any clicks, ctrl-alt-del and ctrl-shift-esc
 do not work and the only way to restore the machine to working order is to hard reboot.</li><li>When waking the laptop from sleep, the network card is no longer able to connect to any WiFi network. I have to disable the adaptor and re-enable it before it will connect.</li><li>The Crashplan Backup service seems to be unable to connect to the internet, unless the machine is cold booted (as in complete shutdown and then start, reboot doesn't seem to help). Following a cold boot, the service connects fine. The first time I put the
 machine to sleep the service will then be unable to reconnect (this is also following the above disable/enable network adaptor issue), and just shows the message "waiting to connect". The service does connect to the internet though as it is able to verify
 the Crashplan servers are available. I have checked Windows firewall and Crashplan is in there with a rule. Turning off the firewall (in the windows firewall control panel) doesn't allow it to connect, strangely disabling the firewall service seems to help
 (though not reliably).</li></ol>
<p>I realise that these&nbsp;are separate issue and plan on creating a separate post regarding this. I also plan on raising error reports for the respective application/driver providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the following Imran's suggestions above to disable services, but have found that I need to have at least one&nbsp;3rd party services operating which is the Intel Anti-Theft service. Disabling this renders most folders of the hard disk un-usable due
 to the disk encryption that anti-theft performs. It also means that I am unable to attempt to replicate this issue due largely to the fact that the machine is effectively useless due to this encryption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to work around this, starting with disabling the hard drive encryption - a challenge given how little documentation Intel make available for the anti-theft technology. However, frankly I have a day job and debugging a defective OS takes me away
 from that during the day, or away from family in the evening. Thankfully my business has thus far remained unaffected as I have not had to use this laptop in anger, but at some point I am going to need to use this laptop properly, and at this point it seems
 the only way I will be able to do that is to re-install (again) with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have taken the advice of one of my friends and just bought a Mac ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi j_ipo,<br />
<br />
I'm not having the issue any more; I performed another completely clean install of Windows 8 (and later 8.1 as I had upgrade problems). I suspect that it was largely caused by the Intel/McAfee Anti-Theft software that was included with the laptop, which I hadn't
 bothered re-installing.<br />
<br />
Essentially there were two components to the application; a disk encryption and a active always have to be online component that bricks the laptop if you didn't log in. Neither of these worked with the encryption causing all the lock-ups and the online component
 continually failing to connect and the laptop getting locked out because of it.<br />
<br />
The last I checked it looks like McAfee have abandoned development of this software (despite selling 3 year licenses), so it isn't about to become Windows 8 compatible. If you have anything like this, I would recommend removing it from your system.<br />
<br />
With the rebuild I also manually installed all the latest drivers for everything that I could, and kept the manufacturer soft(bloat)-ware to a minimum.<br />
<br />
Sorry that I can't be more helpful, hope that you get your issue sorted though.<br />

<h3> dickywoollard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1053. The plug and play service will not start.</h2>
                    This all began because I cannot get the SCO audio device to appear in the sound controls.
<div>I went to look at the Servcies, and discovered that the Windows Audio Service was not running.</div>
<div>When I tried to restart the service it would not respond because it is a dependent service.</div>
<div>I checked on the dependend service, the Plug and Play service, and found that it was not running either.</div>
<div>I have tried to start the Plug and Play service another error message:</div>
<div>Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Howcan I make the Plug and Play service start, so that I can then start the Windows Audio Service?</div>
<div>How can I then make sure that the SCO BLuetooth Audio device will be detected and work?</div>

<h3> gunfa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wacom Graphics Pad Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have an older Wacom Graphire4 tablet that worked fine with Windows 7 but I can't get it to work with 10, in the device manager it appears under the HID Tab as&nbsp; HID complient digitzer also as USB input device ( a normal mouse ?)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works as a normal mouse in the BIOS prior to loading windows, both the above entries are listed as working normally with no problems in device manager, but there is no movement at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I boot up without the Graphire mouse on the Graphire Pad no power appears, but if the mouse is on the pad an orange power light appears &amp; changes to green on clicking the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing various Wacom drivers without success, the HID complient digitzer entry says no driver files are needed or loaded for this device, the USB input devie entry has the same 3 driver files listed as my USB mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think fresh ideas are needed, anyone have an answer?</p>
<p>

            I think the problem may be that Wacom hasn't provided a Windows 10 compatibility Update to the Drivers for that model, but has for all 'recent' models.&nbsp; You could try the most recent Windows&nbsp;8 Driver, if that isn't what you have already&nbsp;installed. -
<a href="http://us.wacom.com/en/support/legacy-drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://us.wacom.com/en/support/legacy-drivers/</a> Maybe try installing the driver in Windows 8 compatibility mode.

</p><p>Problem solved by searching through the Wacom forum found the drivers needed, it seems that an automatic seach just brings up the latest Microsoft drivers as they have the latest date, (alhough they don't work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside I have had to return to Windows 7, too many random problems, the latest the printer wouid not work because the print spooler service could not be started !
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also had Windows defender stopping and switching protection off, File explorer opening very slowly and other random glitches, I have no virus, sfc finds no problems so the only thing left for me to keep my sanity was to go back.</p>
<p>

            <p>I also encountered this problem with my Graphire 4 (CTE-640) when I built a new Win10 PC. For now it seems that the problems were solved by this Wacom Forum thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://forum.wacom.eu/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=12822</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Wacom employee points to an installation pack "cons530-3_int.exe" (properly from Wacom's own servers, no suspicious third party links) in the download link in the seventh post of the thread. It's a bit older driver for the Bamboo tablets for Win8, but
 at least for me it seems to work with my Graphire 4 in Win10. The Wacom preferences utility functions and allows me to assign keys/modifiers to the pen and the tablet buttons. Pressure sensitivity also worked in PS. As you might recall, the later drivers for
 Win7 also "forgot" the old Graphire models and the packet was simply talking about Bamboo, but everything worked nonetheless. I guess the technology inside is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always, make sure to remove any old drivers and reboot before installing the new one.</p>

            Ah man, this seems like the exact fix I need, but it appears that post is gone? Does anyone have any advice about getting that file somehow? You guys seem to have fixed the exact problem I've been having.

            <p>You might have solved the issue already by yourself, but for the sake of posterity I'll give here some simple advice. It seems Wacom closed their forums due to spam, so the link to the forum topic won't work, for now at least. However, my original post contained
 the name of the driver package, including the version number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Wacom main site, which the dead forum link redirects one to, doesn't seem to either host this version (for Windows) or at least doesn't list it. However, if you head over to the Wacom Europe site, wacom.eu, you'll easily find this particular driver package
 by going to the Driver section and then selecting Graphire4 and Win8 as the options. This driver (cons530-3_int.exe) is then what the site will list. Just be sure you are at the EU site, as Wacom seemingly loves to redirect one to the common US site, wacom.com,
 which, like I said, won't be serving you this driver version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The url ought to look something like this, at the time when I'm writing this post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.wacom.eu/index4.asp?pid=29&amp;lang=en</p>

    <title>Xbox Live child account does not allow purchasing of music&#47;videos - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live child account does not allow purchasing of music&#47;videos in Windows 8 Xbox apps</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am a 15 year old student in the UK. I have a child account and cannot purchase music/video using Windows 8 but I could in Zune (using the same account) on Windows 7. The problem is as I
<strong>do not have an Xbox console</strong> so I cannot log in and change the account via the parental controls.</p>
<p>I get told that "this is not available on child or teen accounts". The excellent support rep told me that "Most likely what has happened is that when going over to Windows 8, some of the settings were changed. Since this is a child account, the settings
 would have to be changed using the parental account.</p>
<p>My parents logged in and changed the account settings etc. (on the website) but the support rep said that I could log on to a friend’s console that "If the privacy settings are the problem then the console would definitely help because then we could log
 in and change those. The privacy settings for a child account can't be changed from the website. However if this is an issue with Windows 8 then hopefully it's something that can be resolved by them much more quickly."</p>
<p><b>Is there a way to allow purchasing music or video possible using a child account on Windows 8? My account needs to allow music and video purchasing which cannot be changed on xbox.com but I do not have an Xbox.
</b><br />
I do feel that this is an issue considering teens like me buy tablets (in my case windows 8) and we can't buy music like we can on our Windows Phones.</p>
<p>(I have got a customer support tag number on this issue)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Ben</p>

<p>Hey there isaacsben, </p>
<p>Since you're on a child account, there is likely a parent account that your account is tied to. You may need to use that parent account to change your settings. Do you remember when setting up the account who you may have designated to be the parent on the
 account? </p>

<p>I'm discovering the same thing. &nbsp;It appears that nothing you do on the website will allow a child to purchase anything. &nbsp;There is even some wording there that says so. &nbsp;Something like, "Children are not allowed to purchase content from Xbox.com". It looks
 as if you are screwed until you are an adult, however old that may be in your country. &nbsp;I've been trying to set up a Surface tab for a friends teenage daughter. &nbsp;I think I'm going to suggest we lie about her age. &nbsp;On top of that, there are no controls, once
 she is an adult, to keep her from going crazy and charging up her parents card. &nbsp;This seems like a huge oversight by Microsoft. I'm really disappointed. &nbsp;What would be wrong with a simple pop-up where the parent could approve the purchase?!</p>

<p>I totally agree with you, it is a huge oversight by Microsoft and I don't even think that their support people understand the exact problem- nothing works at all. I'm hoping that if Microsoft do something like Xbox Gift Cards that can be applied to accounts
 and we can use them instead, a pain it will be, but it should hopefully solve this problem until I and your friends teenage daughter reach legal age.
</p>
<p>I'm glad it's not just me having this problem! </p>

<p>What I'm going to do is suggest that they get her a pre-paid debit card or her own bank account (minors can have bank accounts, but they can't buy stuff from Xbox?!) that they can use as her payment option. &nbsp;The lying about her age will still be required,
 but at least that way they can control how much money she has. &nbsp;Luckily she doesn't already have an Xbox account, so she has nothing to lose as far as achievements (or things she purchased on the Xbox). &nbsp;I have not tried using the Xbox yet. &nbsp;I have one, but
 I don't really want to add a bunch of people to my sign in list. &nbsp;Already I had my 19 year old daughter sign in and I have yet to figure out how to remove her. &nbsp;I don't like that when I sign in I have to scroll over to me - I should be the default owner, I
 shouldn't have to find me in a list of people that have played on my box. &nbsp;But that's another issue, that maybe is solvable. &nbsp;In exploring this issue I maid an account for my baby boy. &nbsp;He's less than a year old and already has email! I'll add him to my Xbox
 and check his permissions there and let you know how it goes. &nbsp;But I don't have much faith in that. &nbsp;Without the Xbox, i can find nothing that fixes this. &nbsp;I'll try Zune as well. &nbsp;This policy is so backwards! At least as near as I can tell, parental controls
 and the ability to turn on or off downloads will work perfectly well, if the user is an adult! Dangit, I'm gonna call Bill!</p>

            Did you double check the family settings? Also, Could have been some sort of malfunction from plugging and unplugging microphone. Maybe take an air blower and use it on the bottom part of the controller. If non of these work I would recommend going to
 your nearest Microsoft Store. The service advisors there are great and would be more than happy to assist you in this matter.

<p>Hi Cary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to us with more information regarding this current issue with the mic and the child account. I understand you've even made a new child account and noticed it works fine so as you mentioned the problem wouldn't be hardware. Since this
 is persisting with the child account I would suggest for you try <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>remove and re-add the profile on the Xbox
</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>Give it a shot let us know if anything changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is it showing the mic is active? If so if the mic still doesnt work after removing the account and placing the account back onto the account, make sure the party the child is in hasnt been muted, we had the similar situation and turned out that someone in
 the party had muted my child in the party. Hope this helps x</p>

            Thanks for the idea. I removed and re-added the profile on the Xbox. Unfortunately, it did not make a difference.

            Yes, I suspect it is something like this; somehow, the child in the party has been muted. I have created a party with only the child in it; the child is still muted in this case. I also tried creating the party from the parent's account and the working
 child account and allowing the non-working child account to join those. In each case, the parent and newly added child mic works; the old child does not. This is all using the same controller and headset.

            I found a workaround. By assigning going to the working child's account, then Setttings : System : Devices &amp; accessories : Headset : and changing 'Assigned to' to the working child's account, the non-working child's account now works. Bizarre. But it fixes
 my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Ok I have had just about enough. I can't even play a match anymore. I have cleared old game data and the cache but it still freezes. Is this really what Microsoft wanted to do just to get you to buy a Xbox one? I mean really a week and a half and still no
 fix. This is getting to the point to where I'll just stop paying for Xbox live and sell the Xbox.

<h3> randhir sookdeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            display has a shadow</h2>
                    My entire display has a shadow type effect. All Text, Icons and Windows opened have a coloured shadow vertically below. This "shadow" effect causes a magenta strip above and a cyan coloured strip below on a Blue piece of background. I get the impression
 that the entire display is made up of coloured layers and these layers are not in sync.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been using my laptop for most of the day and I had it hooked up to a LED TV as a secondary display via HDMI cable before this problem appeared, I've restarted my system and unplugged the HDMI cable. The Display on TV was clear and did not have the
 problem as seen on the laptop.</div>

</p><p>
</p><p>Activation issues have many possible causes. If you're unable to activate Windows 10, we suggest that you run the Activation troubleshooter by doing the following and see how it goes:</p>
<p>

<h2>            Accidentally disabled Intel Graphics Driver on Windows 10&#33;</h2>
                    I recently updated my Windows from 9 to 10 and it meant I could not play a game on my computer (that previously worked in Windows 9) - the optimal screen resolution balloon kept popping up. I disabled the balloon notifications but my game still failed
 to work. I then accidentally disabled the Intel Graphics Driver and now I can't re-enable it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How do I reinstall it!?!<br />

Realms error: Client Outdated
<div style="margin-left: -15px; color: rgba(83, 83, 83, 1)">
<div>
<p>When attempting to play on Minecraft Realms, if you see an error that states that your client is outdated, it means that you're using an older game version. To solve this, you will need to update your game to the latest release version of Minecraft.<br />
<br />

            If youve both tried reinstalling ot could be a beta issue. Are any of you on the insoder build if so you need to be running the same version of the game so opt out of inders while playing in that realm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Blue Snowball Mic Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dylanmclaughlin_2300  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Snowball Mic Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Basically i just recently bought a new Blue Snowball iCE from amazon. I plugged it into my pc and the red light turned on showing it had power. I went into recording devices to check if it was picking up any sound and as expected , it wasn't. I researched
 a bit and read that alot of people had issues with the mic but it was mostly because of the installation process.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My problem is basically that it wont pick up any sound. I have tried different USB slots and plugging in and out . I set it to default device and it is perfectly installed and detected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point i really need help because im just about to say
 screw it and go back to using my old crappy mic , considering i basically just lost £50.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would be seriously grateful for some feedback and help . Thnx</p>

<h2>            Windows Update - How to fix &#34;Some settings are managed by your system administrator&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I can share / comment on that subject of seeing a message like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/013ecc5d-77bb-4afa-887b-3e1453626b5d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Often accompanied by a message like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0dad8d8d-40bb-478a-9407-51dee0d5fb78" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And from the Control Panel Action Center you might see:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd476912-7855-4d1c-9fe7-5e20e10998c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd476912-7855-4d1c-9fe7-5e20e10998c2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The problem has nothing to do with you account or how you are logged in.&nbsp; Logging in as Administrator will not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is extremely unlikely to be a malware infection (never seen it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things to try that in my experience will not help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode</p>
<p>Clean Boot</p>
<p>sfc &nbsp;/scannow</p>
<p>System Update Readiness Tool</p>
<p>Windows Update Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Messages like that about "...by your system administrator" are Group Policy settings and in this case a Policy has been applied to Windows Update by someone or some-<em>thing</em> - probably your antivirus/antimalware application as it wants to protect your
 system from changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The quick fix is to just remove the suspicious Group Policy registry key causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First make a manual System Restore point (just in case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a Command Prompt window as Administrator:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b1c4596-87ba-4f17-83c9-b72cac9b54e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b1c4596-87ba-4f17-83c9-b72cac9b54e7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Carefully enter (or copy/paste) the following command, press the Enter key and respond in the affirmative:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>reg &nbsp; delete &nbsp; HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c925f0f-1bc3-4c34-b786-e9882e93c16b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c925f0f-1bc3-4c34-b786-e9882e93c16b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For 64-bit systems also enter this command:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>reg &nbsp; delete &nbsp; </strong><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now check your Windows Update settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those that are interested here are more details about problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know all the possible ways these Policies may have been set but I know how to fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make a System Restore point (just in case) because there is no undo or quit without saving in the Registry Editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then launch the registry editor (regedit.exe) as Administrator:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e76a26f-9e2f-43cd-b338-eed529747ea8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e76a26f-9e2f-43cd-b338-eed529747ea8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigate to this location:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the AU key (AU= Automatic Updates) right click and delete it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43961c6b-bc76-4aee-9ef5-ab6f383029fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43961c6b-bc76-4aee-9ef5-ab6f383029fd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For 64 bit systems repeat the process at this location:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close registry editor and check Windows Update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No reboot should be needed but do it anyway to be sure the adjustments "stick".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, and Windows 7 Enterprise support the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) so if you did not change the policy yourself somebody or something changed it for you.&nbsp; It could be some previous Windows Update troubleshooting
 suggestions or sometimes malicious software that likes to mess with such things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other possible afflictions where you might see a similar message are Command Prompt, Task Manager, System Restore, Registry Editor (regedit.exe), etc. and these are all things that you might use to find and remove malicious software.&nbsp; Sometimes the malicious
 software is very clever but you can always outsmart it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another common example afflicting System Restore settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/715f8f43-96b7-4421-8c82-cfa5e28ee820" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice all the messages end with "...by your system administrator".&nbsp; That is the clue the problem is a Policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some malicious software likes to disable these things to make it harder to find and remove it in hopes that you will be fooled into reinstalling your entire Windows when you really don't have too.&nbsp; Sometimes folks that don't understand the problem will tell
 you a complete reinstall is the "only solution" when it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility is some third party program you have installed that is "protecting" your system a little too much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should follow up with some malware scans with the free versions of Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner both of which you can get from here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Malware scanners may not undo policy changes because the scanners can't tell if the policy changes are legitimate or not so they might report them as PUM (Potentially Unwanted Modification) or they might not report the Policy changes as a problem at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The important things is to recognize the problem as a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
policy change</span> by looking at the error message (get a screen shot) and then check the Policy section of the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the daredevils that want to see more about how it works and have the Group Policy Editor here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Launch Group Policy Editor and navigate to Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Windows Update, Configure Automatic Updates and make it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65824e4a-bdf5-4cca-b82f-ddb75e0d1123" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now check the registry for the Windows Update and AU keys and you will not be able to change your WU settings until the policy is manually removed or Not Configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p><span>Bingo! Thank you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am a pipe fitter basically but I manage 4 Win 7 PCs for my contracting company. (Had an NT 4 administration course at a community college in 1998, but that’s it.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I began to notice Windows Update dialogs contained the message: “Some settings are managed by your system administrator” in September of this year.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I recognized Windows Defender was useless at that point, so I bought copies of Malware Bytes for all of us. Malware Bytes found and removed “Rootkit.Necurs.R.64” from
 the afflicted PC. But Windows Update was still locked down by the administrator.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So you have given me the way to salvage that iteration of Win 7 without having to format and reinstall.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I agree with CanadianTech that your insight deserves its own thread.</span></p>

            <p><span><span>Hi John,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It’s unfortunate you can’t see the images. They show the manifestations of the Administrator lockdown of the feature in both Registry Editor and Group
 Policy Editor.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know your way around Registry Editor (Regedit.exe)?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a single key which can be deleted to return control to you of the Windows Update settings. It is usually found at:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This troubled key appears as a folder named ‘AU’. It contains the Automatic Update options. It is safe to delete the AU key.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Afterwards, reboot and go into Windows Update in Control Panel. You should then be able to click Change Settings and change the automatic update feature
 to Never.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If it is not as I have described, then someone above my pay grade should advise you. I am not ElderN. I am the guy ElderN advised earlier in this thread.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</p><p>I adjusted the topic so it might work better with no images...&nbsp; but I don't think there is a problem with the images.&nbsp; Perhaps John's new computer needs a video driver update :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing about these Windows Policy adjustments and malware scanners is that the scanners can't tell if the policy adjustment is legitimate or not (it could be) so depending on the scanner they might reports it as a PUM (Potentially Unwanted Modification)
 and give you a chance to remove it...&nbsp; or they might not report it at all.</p>

            ElderN, your way of displaying the solutions is very good.&nbsp; I would not change a lick of it.&nbsp; Different people need different kinds of direction.&nbsp; It is also almost impossible to gage the competence of the questioner in advance.&nbsp; Keep up the excellent
 work.&nbsp; Kudos to you.&nbsp; It is a pleasure to have such a good colleague.

<h2>            Xbox 360 on PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering (since I've been searching for the past 3-4 hours) : is there a way for me to be able to play my games from my XBox 360 on my PC (Windows 10 pro 64bits)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched and searched and the only thing I found (as information) was the thing about&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed- Inappropriate]</strong>&nbsp;Menu, Horizon and another subject (which had the word "TAG" in it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an easy way (or any other possible way) for me to be able to play them on my computer (I wouldn't mind paying a fee, if needs to be)? I certainly don't want to flash/jailbreak my XBox 360 and I'm kinda tired of searching for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone who could help me with that topic, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all very much and have a plaisant day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pascal</p>

            Hi, There is no way to play Xbox 360 games on a Windows 10 PC. The only way would be to play a Windows version of the game, which you can find on 3rd party store such as Steam and GOG. But playing Xbox 360 games on a PC is just not possible.<br />

            No the xbox play anywhere system is relatively new so although you might be able to play forza on your pc because you own it on xbox you won't be able to play any games from the 360 unless you buy them through other websites such as steam on your pc.

<p>Actually there is, it's called Xenia, it only runs a few games well so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, you need a 'Ninja PC' to get anything remotely playable. We're talking an a high end i7 processor, 16GB RAM and a GTX 1070 graphics card.</p>

            AFAIK, there are no objects. you are "painting", so it behaves like a normal piece of paper/canvas that you are painting on.

            Hi  Irene
<br />
<br />Can you see yourself on Skype when you are video calling?
<br />
<br />1.
<br />
<br />If not, then possibly Skype is not allowed to access your camera
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App, go to Privacy - Camera
<br />
<br />Is Skype one of the apps listed as allowed to use your Camera?
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />
<br />If you can see yourself and the other parties cannot see you, it is possible a bug in Skype
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:

</p><p>Ok, since we've gotten no response from this forum, I went looking for a solution to the downloading puzzle problems.&nbsp; It's probably in your privacy settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this solution in another support forum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Close Microsoft Jigsaw. 2.&nbsp; Go to settings.&nbsp; 3. Click on Privacy.&nbsp; 4. Click on Background Apps. 5. Turn on "&nbsp;Let apps run in the background, if it's off.&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp; Scroll down to Microsoft Jigsaw and set it to "On"</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now open Microsoft Jigsaw again and try to down load your puzzles again.&nbsp; If it doesn't work, restart your PC.&nbsp; Mine started working right after the restart.&nbsp; Good Luck.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 10 with Kaspersky installed on it.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to help you with the appropriate troubleshooting steps, please reply with the following details:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you receive any error message when you run the .exe installer?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Which version of Windows is installed on the computer currently? To check type:
<strong>winver</strong> in the search bar on the Taskbar and hit Enter.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you have mentioned that you have Kaspersky installed on the computer, it could be that Kaspersky is blocking
 the installers to run. I suggest you to try disabling Kaspersky and see if that helps. Please follow the steps to disable Kaspersky:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type
<strong>Kaspersky</strong> in the search bar on the <strong>Taskbar</strong> and open it from the search results.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now, click on
<strong>Settings</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on
<strong>Additional</strong> and then click on <strong>Self-Defense</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Clear</span></strong><span>
 the check box for <strong>Enable Self-Defense</strong> to disable <strong>Kaspersky</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you receive any prompt, click on
<strong>Continue</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Note: Disabling Antivirus software may open the computer to threats. Make sure to enable it after performing the troubleshooting.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also check if the application that you are trying to run is Quarantined by Kaspersky. If the application
 is Quarantined, restore the application and see if that helps. Please follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type
<strong>Kaspersky</strong> in the search bar on the <strong>Taskbar</strong> and open it from the search results.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on
<strong>More</strong> <strong>tools</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the
<strong>Tools</strong> window, click on <strong>Quarantine</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Look for the .exe installer that you are trying to run. If you find the installer, right click on it and select
<strong>Restore</strong> to restore it to its original location.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply with the status of the issue, we will be glad to help you further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Remote Procedure Call Failed for Photos and Windows Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasoncorl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Remote Procedure Call Failed for Photos and Windows Store failed launch</h2>
                    <p>Recently I cannot open any photos without getting the error message "Remote Procedure Call Failed". When I try to open the Photos App, or others like "Movies and TV" and the Windows Store, the app seems to start then vanishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most recent change was installing Adobe Creative Cloud but not sure if the issue was present before that as this computer is fairly new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked for updates, nothing</p>
<p>Checked services RPC and RPC locator startup settings, no difference in automatic vs. manual</p>
<p>Installed media feature pack for Win10 N and KN, no change</p>
<p>Rebooted several times, no change</p>
<p>
</p><p>any other tips would greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>I created a new account and everything works ok, how do I fix my current account. Now that I think some more, I did disconnect my account from my MS profile and then reconnect it before this was noticed, maybe that had something to do with it? Please any
 suggestions?</p>

            <p>I have had exactly the same problem as you, I was wondering if you have managed to fix it yet?</p>
<p>I was thinking it might be to do with deleting one of the accounts on your computer? I recently deleted a spare account that I had added, but then ended up not using. When I did this it said that it would delete all the "Stuff on that account" So I figured
 that would be fine. What I think has happened is there is a bug in Windows 10 that means it deletes some of the necessary files required for those apps. (This is just&nbsp;a guess)&nbsp;so if you&nbsp;did a similar thing with deleting an account soon before this happened,&nbsp;then
 that may be the problem.</p>
<p>Hope this can be fixed soon, because as you say this is a very annoying problem.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Nope I never found a solution. I moved all my content over to the new profile.</p>
<p>i think what happened is I had created the main acct, then linked that acct to my MS acct, then unlinked it. That is when I noticed the problem. I'm guessing something to do with user authentication for app access but who knows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely a bug the question is if MS cares. I just wish the MS rep would come back and admit it's a bug, help resolve the issue or say "gosh guys, I'm stumped but I'll look into it for you". You know, be accountable.&nbsp;</p>

 be the reason for this issue.</p>

            <p>If you have been unable to fix your problem, then the way I did it was to open the command line in administrator mode, and then follow a series of commands to delete and then reinstall all the windows apps.&nbsp;the instructions for what to do are on this website,
 http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-reinstall-default-apps-in-windows-10/# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you just follow these then it should work. I hope this helps!</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with user accounts..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the same error after creating another log-in account. The other account could access the photos app, but now my current account that I'm using is not able to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the new account that I just created to see if the photo app is working, but it is still not working. Even the Windows Store is not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>help... </p>

            <p>I have a similar problem too. I created a second Windows user account after W10 automatically replaced the original login details of the&nbsp;first account with Live login details (rather annoyingly, without any warning, if I may add).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the Photo and Store apps are not working anymore for the&nbsp;first Windows account, which is linked to a Live account. For the newly created Windows user account (without Live account),&nbsp;these apps work fine. RPC is running, and the troubleshooter and SFC
 don't find anything wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the fact that the apps are working for one of the user accounts, I deduct that the problem seems to have something to do with user accounts, or with creating (or deleting) another one. Can someone help to find a solution for this problem?</p>
