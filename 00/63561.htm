<h2>            Get error 80072741</h2>
                    
<p>I cant get my xbox to connect to LIVE. When I try I get error code 80072741. It has me sign in then it goes through the process where I have to put in my email address and my password. Then it asks if I want to remember the password. Either way I click it
 signs in then goes through a check signs me out and says it cant connect error 80072741. I have done the following steps with an xbox tech support person.</p>
<p>1. cleared cache</p>
<p>2. deleted profile</p>
<p>3. Downloaded profile</p>
<p>4. I checked connection(all pass)</p>
<p>I have even gone so far as to format the memory on my xbox. I have installed a new thumb drive. I have deleted both just the profile and everything assosciated with the profile.</p>
<p>I have TW cable internet the 30mbps connection. I use their wireless router/modem the **** TG862G. I have the firewall on said router turned off. I use a WET610N wireless device to connect said xbox to router. I have two other xboxes in the home( an original
 x360 white hard wired to router, one MW3 edition wireless) that connect fine. Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hey there Square! Thanks for hitting us back with all of that information. Now let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br /><strong>To start out, I suggest making sure that all of your security information is valid and up to date, then let's give your profile a clean redownload. To do that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that your <a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-security/security-proofs-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Security Proofs</a> are valid and properly set up.</li>
<li>Check to see if you have <a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-security/no-prompt-security-proof" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Two Step Verification enabled</a>. If you do, make sure that the app password is properly set up. If you don't want to use the app password, be sure to disable Two Step Verification.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete your profile</a> ONLY (do NOT delete profile and items).</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your system cache</a> <strong>3 times in a row</strong>.</li>
<li>Restart your console.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download your profile</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />When you go through those steps, make sure they're done in that order and ensure that you clear your system cache 3 times in a row since that can help to resolve stubborn issues like this. Let us know how that goes and what the results are. We'll be standing by to hear back from you. ^_^</p>

<p>Heres a final update for this problem. It was something to do with the router/wireless adapter setup. I disconnected the xbox from the wireless adapter and hardwired it to the router it worked fine. I switched ISPs and got a different router and now it connects
 fine. Apparently ARRIS routers do not like Linksys adapters. Thanks for all the help</p>

<h2>            Share desktop and camera at the same time</h2>
                    <p>I tried using the updated version of Skype today, and found it is impossible to share the screen and camera at the same time. If I share my screen, the person I am talking to can no longer see me (they can only see my shared screen). And if the person I
 am chatting with shares their screen, then I can no longer see that person, only their shared screen. How does one share both the screen and the webcam at the same time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the previous version of skype, if someone shared their screen with me I would also be able to see their webcam in a smaller window/pane, and it was even possible to move that little window anywhere on the screen. Has this been removed in the new version?
 It is a useful feature, and if it has been removed in the update then the update should be considered a downgrade.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c62b22d0-ba3a-483d-a2f1-32a13dff4ba1" title="garyofcourse">
<p>
</p><p>The option to simultaneously share your screen and your video feed is currently not available on the latest versions of Skype. When a user shares his/her screen, the other party will only see the shared screen and the call will be converted to an audio call.
 Once the user stops sharing his/her screen, the call will be reverted back to a video call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the moment, this is how screen sharing works. Should you want this feature to be re-introduced on the following updates, you can submit a feature suggestion here in the Community so we can collate them and pass it to the appropriate support team. Our
 developers are eager to hear and read user feedback. Feedback and suggestions help them improve the application experience.

<h2>            No audio output device installed</h2>
                    Hi. First&nbsp;of all i'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but i'm desperate.&nbsp;so I have a asus rog g502vs laptop and it had realtek hd audio device but it just disappeared. I just cant find it anywhere. there is no 'Audio inputs and outputs'
 in the device manager and in 'Sound, video and game controllers' I can only see NVDIA virtual audio device. also there seems to be a problem with device manager&gt;other devices&gt;audio device on high definition audio bus. I've tried to download realtek high definition
 audio driver for windows 10 but when its almost done and 'intalshield wizard is installing' window pops up it fails after a short time and says 'realtek HD audio driver failure'. I also tried to 'Add Legacy hardware' form device manager but in the end it said
 that it could not install the Realtek hardware. (something like that). it all started when I launched troubleshooter, because there were no sounds in Google chrome, but Microsoft Edge was working just fine.

<br />
<br />No sound in Windows - Use the troubleshooters - Control Panel - Troubleshooting 
<br />
<br />Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area check Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the lower Right click Properties check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also, do same for Configure on Lower Left of that box. Repeat this paragraph for headphones.
<br />
<br />Check to see if you have the latest available driver. Download and install the latest driver. If you have the latest driver re-install the same one.
<br />
<br />How to manually install drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker, as fallbacks, and the Device Maker's for which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Sound - write down he make and complete model of your sound adapter - double click - Driver's yab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Display Adapters, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - 
<br />REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check in Device Manager to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

                    <p>I don't recall the turning point but my Edge/IE browsers are not working. Specifically, Edge yields the message:</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Go to those steps, from the Start menu or by pressing the key combination Win + I open the Configuration and click on the option Networks and Internet. Once there, we select the option Status of the left side menu and within the settings and options that are loaded in the right panel we have to look for network restoration.
<br />Clicking on this option will show us a new window from where we will be able to perform the network reset in Windows 10. In this way, all the network adapters will be removed and reinstalled and the original configuration of other components of the network will be re-established. net. This implies that if we were using some software such as a VPN client or virtual switches, we will have to reinstall them.
<br />A process that is carried out automatically by the system by clicking on the Reset button now shown in Network Reset in the Windows 10 configuration. It is normal that the process does not take too long, although we must wait until the end completely and restart the computer again to proceed with the network configuration in Windows 10 as we had until now.

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<p>thanks again for the reply. I'm a little hesitant to repair the operating system via this method given that I'm on the insider preview build now. These instructions state that i'll need a windows 10 ISO of the current/same version and I'm not sure I can
 do this?</p>

<p>Sorry, but you got scammed. &nbsp;If you call before the 8-10 weeks is up, the reps tell you that they can't tell you anything about when you might receive it and to just call after the 10 weeks if you haven't received it. &nbsp;When you call after the 10 weeks are
 up, they tell you that you should have called more often and that since you didn't you forfeited your right to receive the game. &nbsp;If you keep pressing them, they'll tell you that the offer is expired and that Microsoft does not have any more copies of any
 of the games for the promotion. &nbsp;If you ask them for a digital copy of the game, or for a refund of XBox Live, they will refuse. &nbsp;They don't mind spending 3 hours on the phone over 5 different calls, but they definitely mind living up to their side of the
 bargain.</p>
<p>I know, I've been through all this. &nbsp;Here's what I finally told the representative, and what I plan to do- I refuse to renew XBox Live from this point on. &nbsp;I refuse to purchase any materials from the XBox Live Marketplace. &nbsp;I will buy all games used from
 this point on, because I know how this impacts their profit. &nbsp;And I will blog about this experience in half a dozen places. &nbsp;XBox will lose a couple thousand in revenue just from me, as I have a lot of people on my Christmas list and buy about 20 games a year.
 &nbsp;And I'm hoping that others will follow my example, and that such short sighted business practices will be justly rewarded.

<h3> seadee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notepad in Vista</h2>
                    Opening an html file to edit it with notepad.<br />
<br />
If I open using 'Open with' using right mouse button it access pop out menu when over the file. When I come to save it I get an error cannot create the file.<br />
<br />
However, if I open Notebook and find the file then edit it and save it, it gets saved no error message initially and then the same error on subsequent tries.<br />
<br />
The only solution i have is to keep the explore view of the folder containing the file open and the notepad of the file I am editing open; then delete the one in the explore window and then save the notepad new edited one.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess it is some kind of overwriting problem.

            Hi Seadee,
<div><br />
<div>Try the following when in Windows Explorer:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Organize </strong>button in the top-left corner, go to <strong>
Layout </strong>and ensure <strong>Preview Pane</strong> is <strong>not </strong>
selected </li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>If that doesn't resolve the issue, what is the path to the folder holding the files? Have you tried creating a file in another folder (i.e. your Documents folder) and tested for the issue there?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, try a clean boot and see if the issue persists:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a></div>

    <title>WHY IS MICROSOFT VIOLATING GEO BLOCKING by releaing games only in some - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tannicjeans5929  say:</h3>
<h2>            WHY IS MICROSOFT VIOLATING GEO BLOCKING by releaing games only in some EU regions when it needs to release it as in one market, it should comply from 3rd December 2019</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/geoblocking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/geoblocking</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Geo-blocking and other geographically-based restrictions undermine online shopping and cross-border sales. Regulation 2018/302 of 28 February 2018 will set an end to unjustified geoblocking. The Regulation will start applying as of 3 December 2018.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/glossary/#geoblocking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Geo-blocking</span></a> and other geographically-based restrictions undermine online shopping and cross-border sales
 by limiting the possibility for consumers and businesses to benefit from the advantages of online commerce.&nbsp;The problem equally affects consumers and businesses as end users of products and services and exists both in the online environment and in real-world
 situations.</p>
<p>The regulation on geoblocking is part of a series of <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/new-eu-rules-e-commerce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">new rules on e-commerce</span></a> aimed at boosting cross border online sales in the EU, both for the benefit of the consumer, who will have more choice and more guarantees when buying, and for the online sellers.</p>
What is geo-blocking?
<p>Online sellers&nbsp;apply barriers and impose restrictions to consumers on the basis of their nationality or place of residence. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>blocking access to websites across borders;</li><li>denying the possibility to complete an order, to purchase goods or to download content when accessing a website from abroad;</li><li>denying delivery or shipment across border;</li><li>providing different prices and conditions depending on nationality, country of residence or location of the customer.</li></ul>
<p>There might be justified reasons for traders not to sell cross-border, such as the need to register at the tax authority in the country of destination, higher shipping costs or costs arising from the application of foreign consumer law. While outside barriers
 create additional complications and extra costs for the trader, differences in the treatment of customers are based on objective criteria.</p>
<p>However, discrimination between EU customers based on the desire to segment markets along national borders, in order to increase profits to the detriment of foreign customers, is considered as unjustified geoblocking.</p>
The regulation
<p>The regulation on addressing unjustified geo-blocking and other forms of discrimination based on customers' nationality, place of residence or place of establishment within the internal market defines three specific situations when there can be no justified
 reasons for geo-blocking or other discriminations based on nationality, residence or location:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The sale of goods</strong> without physical delivery. Example: A Belgian customer wishes to buy a refrigerator and finds the best deal on a German website. The customer will be entitled to order the product and collect it at the trader's premises
 or organise delivery himself to his home.</li><li><strong>The sale of electronically supplied services</strong>. Example: A Bulgarian consumer wishes to buy hosting services for her website from a Spanish company. She will now have access to the service, can register and buy this service without having
 to pay additional fees compared to a Spanish consumer.</li><li><strong>The sale of services provided in a specific physical location</strong>. Example: An Italian family visits a French theme park and wishes to take advantage of a family discount on the price of the entry tickets. The discounted price will be available
 for the Italian family.</li></ul>
<p>This <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2018.060.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:2018:060I:TOC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">regulation</span></a> was part of an e-commerce package together with a legislative proposal on cross-border parcel delivery services and a legislative proposal to strengthen enforcement of consumers' rights.</p>
Other elements of the regulation
<p>Furthermore, the proposal bans blocking of access to websites and the use of automatic re-routing if the customer has not given prior consent.</p>
<p>The regulation also provides for a non-discrimination rule in payments. While traders remain free to offer whatever payment means they want, the regulation includes a specific provision on non-discrimination within those payment means.</p>
<p>The regulation does not impose an obligation to sell and does not harmonise prices. It does however address discrimination in access to goods and services in cases where it cannot be objectively justified (e.g. by VAT obligations or different legal requirements).</p>
Timeline of the regulation
<p>The Regulation entered into force on 22nd March 2018 and applies from 3rd December 2018, nine months after the
<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.LI.2018.060.01.0001.01.ENG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">publication of the Regulation in the EU Official Journal</span></a>, to allow in particular small traders to adapt.</p>
<p>For better understanding of the regulation, the Commission issued a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/news-redirect/617204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">detailed Questions &amp; Answers</span></a> document and a

<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">MEMO</span></a>.</p>
<p>Within two years after the entry into force of the new rules, the Commission will carry out a first evaluation of their impact on the internal market. The Commission will also include in its evaluation an assessment of the scope of the Regulation, including
 of the possible application of the new rules to certain electronically supplied services which offer copyright-protected content such as music, e-books, software and online games, as well as of services in sectors such as transport and audio-visual.</p>

            As previously suggested to you. This should be taken up with Microsoft Legal, as nobody on the forums can or has the ability to do anything about this. There is probably a good reason why these games are not available in your Country but available in other
 European Countries. I would also suggest that you pertition your local politicians and government as to why there are restrictions in place.&nbsp;

<h2>            Game crashing before being able to load completely, Sea Of Thieves</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I've been working on this for about 3 days now, a total of 7 hours spent trying to fix this. That being said, I WAN'T THIS FIXED! I spent money on a game to play it not to watch it continuously crash over and over and over again. I've tried
 all of these "fixes" from the actual website of the game and it's creators: https://support.seaofthieves.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115015775927-Sea-of-Thieves-not-Launching . I also spent a half an hour with a Microsoft Support agent on the phone with no luck
 and with a virtual agent for half an hour who was no help whatsoever and could not speak English to a level of my understanding. I'm disappointed with the situation, would anyone like to help me out here?&nbsp;</p>

            I have not made physical changes to my computer nor virtually. This is the only game experiencing this issue or any issue at all and yes I have tried the uninstall/reinstall. Thank you so much for coming back to me with help! I did all the steps, unfortunately
 none solved the issue. Though I believe they still benefited my computer so thanks for that.&nbsp;

    <title>On Windows 10, some desktop application appeared blurred on high-DPI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itsdragonxi  say:</h3>
<h2>            On Windows 10, some desktop application appeared blurred on high-DPI settings.</h2>
                    <p>Before I start, I should state that I have already checked this: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2900023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2900023</a> ,which is the official solution for this problem, but it only works on Windows 8 &amp; 8.1, now because Windows 10 moved most of their settings into the "Settings" in new UI, the old method doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cf752ed-f9b3-4034-806b-7a428ef0262a" height="313" width="303" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably the difference is not very noticable in a screen capture, but trust me, it is insufferable if you are sitting in front of my laptop right now... Anyway, the left half is just the Explorer.exe, the other half is a MMC component, Computer Management,
 which you can access by right-click on My Computer. (btw it's in chinese)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been searching for solutions for couple of hours now, and there is only one so far: right click on the exe file and tick the "Disable display scaling on high dpi settings", which would work fine on things like Steam, but it seems the option is disabled
 for all built in .exes, including the mmc.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if I applied the official solution on my Windows 8.1 and then updates to Windows 10, everything works out perfect, no force-zooming on mmc.exe, but once I reboot, the problem starts again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably worth mention that in a Chinese website, I found another (ridiculous) solution, which involves using regedit, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop, and change the "Win8DpiScaling" to 1, and change the "LogPixel" to 120 dec (or 78 hex),
 and then log off and log on. Now I don;t know if this works on others' or not, but it sure didn't on mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully a new patch can be released real soon, and other people can notice this problem and discuss about it.</p>

            <p>(IMHO) I don't believe it is a display driver problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But just so we can proceed solving this problem, my model is <strong>HP-ENVY-15
</strong>notebook, <strong>j105tx</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Operating system is Windows 10, CoreCountrySpecific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specs are i7-4702HQ(<strong>Intel(R) HD Graphic 4600</strong>), SSD, <strong>
NVIDIA GT 750M</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver version are:</p>
<p>-<strong> 10.18.15.4256 </strong>(Intel, package version is <strong>15.40.4.64.4256</strong>)</p>
<p>- <strong>353.62</strong> (NVIDIA)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this moment, all my drivers(even including those of the hardware other than GPUs) are up-to-date; I used Windows 10's iso file to perform an installation from scratch (version is 10240), still no luck.</p>

    <title>Teredo Adapter Disabled and Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lukaspan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Teredo Adapter Disabled and Missing</h2>
                    I've been trying to play multiplayer of Forza 7 with my friend for the last couple of weeks, but just can't connect to the server. After consulting online, I pretty much determined that it's because my teredo&nbsp;is disabled. There is<strong> no Teredo Tunnelling
 Adapter or&nbsp;Teredo Tunnelling Pseudo-Interface </strong>in my device manager, even I selected to show hidden devices. Then I followed online instruction to<strong> reinstall legacy hardware</strong>, but there is
<strong>no Teredo for me to select under the Microsoft Tab</strong>. Then I tried the edit registry&nbsp;option, and found there is
<strong>no DisabledComponents key under the parameter path</strong>.&nbsp; I updated my system to 1803 on Jun 25th and successfully joined a Forza 7 multiplayer match at 1st July, could someone help me here?

<h2>            Get message &#34;Attempt to access invalid address.&#34; trying to map network drive</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to map network drive using Windows8.1 64-bit.. &nbsp;The drive is a USB disk plugged right into my router. &nbsp;The drive location is //192.168.0.1. &nbsp;If I do the following in a command prompt, it is successful and I can read/write to the USB drive using
 File Explorer at //192.168.0.1:</p>
<p>net use \\192.168.0.1 /USER:admin (and typing in the password when prompted)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I try to use the Map Network Drive tool (while selecting the "different credentials" option) something weird happens. &nbsp;The Windows Security box pops up to enter my credentials but then immediately a second box opens up titled just "Windows".
 &nbsp;The box says:</p>
<p>The mapped network drive could not be created because the following error has occurred: Attempt to access invalid address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I use Remote Desktop Connection to try and connect with my computer at work I get a very similar situation. &nbsp;A Windows Security box pops up to enter my credentials followed immediately with a box with the message "Remote Desktop Connection has stopped
 working". &nbsp;I know it should work because I created a .rdp text file with my username and encrypted password in it and then I can connect!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking something must be corrupt in my registry. &nbsp;The only security software I run is the stuff that comes with Windows 8.1, pretty basic machine setup quite frankly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is very similar to this one, which was resolved by doing a system restore:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/unable-to-connect-to-network-shares/ba2d4a73-4f20-431a-9aa6-fbdd0fcde2b4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/unable-to-connect-to-network-shares/ba2d4a73-4f20-431a-9aa6-fbdd0fcde2b4</a>.
 &nbsp;A system restore is my very last option because I don't know when the problem started.</p>

            Try Device Manager to rollback to the previous driver or search for a driver update in Device Manager. However that error message frequently pops up after updates and sometimes disappears after a few reboots. It is a benign error as long as the computer
 can recover but annoying. Do not get any Surface or laptop drivers from Intel and do not use compatibility mode for Surface drivers. Microsoft is the only place to get driver updates since those are customized drivers for the Surface. If you have installed
 Intel drivers from Intel before that could be your problem. Get the latest drivers from Microsoft (or the laptop/tablet manufacturer) and replace them.

    <title>Computer Suffering Unexpected Restarts, Event ID 41&#58; Same 6 Events - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer Suffering Unexpected Restarts, Event ID 41&#58; Same 6 Events in Lead-up to Each</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update of late November (though I'm unsure if it is the fault of the update), my computer has suffered 3 random restarts (cuts to black) without warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though it is not apparent to me why this is happening, I have found in the event viewer that the same 6 events occur in the lead up to the crash:</p>
<ul>
<li>File System Filter 'FileInfo' (10.0, ‎1983‎-‎09‎-‎10T08:46:43.000000000Z) has successfully loaded and registered with Filter Manager.</li><li>File System Filter 'Wof' (10.0, ‎2102‎-‎10‎-‎27T23:46:39.000000000Z) has successfully loaded and registered with Filter Manager.</li><li>File System Filter 'WdFilter' (10.0, ‎2001‎-‎08‎-‎08T14:54:57.000000000Z) has successfully loaded and registered with Filter Manager.</li><li>Volume C: (\Device\HarddiskVolume2) is healthy.&nbsp; No action is needed.</li><li>File System Filter 'FileCrypt' (10.0, ‎2013‎-‎05‎-‎08T12:49:03.000000000Z) has successfully loaded and registered with Filter Manager.</li><li>File System Filter 'npsvctrig' (10.0, ‎2070‎-‎05‎-‎05T14:38:28.000000000Z) has successfully loaded and registered with Filter Manager.</li></ul>
<p>After this last event , there is an Event ID 41 wit the message "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know what exactly is happening with each of these and knows how to fix it? (I have saved the 3 sets of events and will provide them if anyone is willing to help me.) After this third reboot, I did run the Windows troubleshooter and it seemed
 to have fixed "potential Windows Update database error detected", "Windows Update components must be repaired" and "Check for pending updates", but I'm unsure if these are related to or will fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance</p>
<p>Euan</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the help, Sumit, but I have found a fix for the issue: It is by turning off Fast Boot in the Power Options of the Control Panel that fixes these unexpected reboots for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To whoever is reading this and has this issue, I hope that this fix goes well for you too. :¬)</p>

<h2>            Reset Computer</h2>
                    My parents got me this laptop from a pawnshop for Christmas and its one of those school laptops. It runs really slow and I did everything I could to try to fix it, but it still runs slow (well slower). I want to reset it and when I go to the screen to
 set it to factory mode, the option doesn't appear. I think that it doesn't because it's a school laptop. Could someone please tell me how to either reset it with the school stuff or remove the school stuff off of here so I can reset it. It's a HP laptop and
 the screen behind the repair option said 'Arey Jones Educational Solutions' (if that's any help). Thank you for reading and hopefully helping.

            <p>If there's no built-in recovery partition to launch the factory restore, you'll need a Windows 7 install disc, which you can get

here</a>. Y<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ou'll still need the product key code, which is hopefully on a sticker on the laptop. &nbsp;If you don't have the product key, you'll have to buy one.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">One better option if you don't have the key, is to contact HP and request that they send you the installation/reset CD disc. &nbsp;Some companies will do this for free.</span></p>

            What is the type of the device?
<br />Did you try it in a different computer?
<br />Did you try changing the cable?
<br />Usually, if the device is not being detected, the cable is the culprit.

            Hi jay1yp,
<br />On your phone, when it is connected to your PC, if you swipe down from the top, do you see a panel to change the USB connection type, like MTP . . . etc.?
