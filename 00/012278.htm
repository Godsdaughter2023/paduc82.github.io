<h2>            Roll-back to a production build</h2>
                    I've been trying to roll my tablet back to a production build (either the Fall Creator's update or the previous production build) and have been unable to do so. Several times I've followed the steps to reset my tablet, only to have it reinstall the pre-production
 build that I was running (17017). I did try the Media Creation Tool for Windows 10, and it also reset my tablet to 17017. I don't know if it has anything to do with Fall Creator's update being available (or not) at this time: I did read that it was going to
 be rolled out in phases.

<p>Thanks for the reply. Thinking about it, I did create the installation tool after I had initially tried to reset the tablet (and it reset to the insider build). Perhaps that was why the installation tool didn't work. Of course, there is still the fact that
 it didn't reset to a production build in the first place.</p>

            I think if you boot with the public build install media, it gives the option to keep your existing data under Windows.old, but to go to an lower number build you have to do a clean install.

<p>Tablets are their own thing and re-imaging rather than user-installed new Windows versions are commonly the solution if a clean install is being considered.&nbsp; A big problem is the driver set.&nbsp; Most of the tablets have proprietary drivers that are the devil
 to find separately.&nbsp; I have been through this painful experience myself.&nbsp; I never did find the right gravitational sensor driver for a tablet I was trying to rehabilitate.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the manufacturer, HipStreet, had gone out of business and I had no mfg.
 to fall back on.&nbsp; I finally got the point, recycled it, and bought a Surface Pro 4. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one thing limiting answers here is a lack of information.&nbsp; What is the make and model of your tablet and what OS did it ship with?&nbsp; How much ram does it have and how much built-in storage?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should not carry out steps designed for laptops and desktops.&nbsp; Instead, you need to contact the manufacturer for instructions for any small form factor&nbsp;<span>tablet.</span>&nbsp; Also look for a user forum hosted by the manufacturer.&nbsp; If the tablet is still
 in warranty definitely consider having the manufacturer re-image.&nbsp; Many Microcenters can re-image tablets they once sold, but if it is out of warranty they will charge you $100, which may exceed the value of the tablet.&nbsp; If it is in warranty they may simply
 exchange since small tablets are not considered repairable.</p>

            Thanks, Don, for the reply. Each time I've tried a reset, and when i used the installation tool, I elected to keep my files, not considering that the windows.old "kernel" might change the install. That may be the next thing I try, as I made a backup of
 my old files.

<p>Thanks for the reply, Colin.</p>

</p><p>The Tablet is a Toshiba Encore 2 WT10, Atom Z3735, 2GB, and I've checked the drivers: they're as&nbsp;up-to-date as they're going to get (Toshiba doesn't seem to even sell tablets anymore). It originally shipped with 8.1, and was updated to Win 10 when it first
 came out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for "steps designed for laptops and desktops" I have no idea what that has to do with this: I ran into an issue trying to perform a "standard" Windows task. I did try to reinstall with an image I made from the tablet, after removing Windows.old; this&nbsp;did
 not work&nbsp;because the touch screen was not functioning and I was not able to proceed beyond the "Windows Setup" menu.

<p>If you are using the Media creation Tool you should use the Install instead of Reset and you normally have a chance to keep your files and documents just not any Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use this from the USB key It should most definitely Install the Public Build 16299. and you should be removed from the Insider Build cycle. But it pays to check your Insider status after the new Install just encase it put you in the Insiders again.</p>

                    <p>Starting a new thread for this with a FBH link:</p>
<p><a href="https://aka.ms/AA3w0lp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/AA3w0lp</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This only started with this latest build 18323.</p>
<p>It's related to an Anti-Rootkit driver not installing.</p>
<p>Has been reported in FBH and directly to Jason.</p>
<p>This is the response from Malwarebytes forum:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>I'm currently tracking this issue.&nbsp; Several other users have reported the same issue with the latest Insider Preview build of Windows 10 with various protection components failing as well as some other modules on
 occasion including rootkit scanning.&nbsp; The cause of the problem appears to be an issue with Malwarebytes failing to install its drivers for some reason, and since each protection component (as well as rootkit scanning) uses its own driver, the end result is
 protection components cannot be enabled.&nbsp; Perhaps Microsoft has changed how drivers are allowed to be installed and registered on systems in the latest Insider Preview.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, I expect it to be resolved by the time the Insider Preview build goes final/RTM.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 slow to load links</h2>
                    Looks like since I started using 2010 there is a long delay from clicking a link in an email message to having IE open the link. I do have both 2007 and 2010 installed. Any ideas what is causing the delay? I have removed all add-ins and the problem remains.

            I had a similar problem on a machine running XP and outlook 2007. I was able to get almost instant opening of imbedded url by closing a startup program for my HP Photosmart printer "HP Digital Imaging Monitor". I later went to the HP site and found a newer
 version that I loaded and updated and my system continues to open imbedded URL quickly.

<h2>            vba workbooks.open method doesn&#39;t take the focus of the newly opened workbook</h2>
                    <p>I have found that when I use the workbooks.open method in vba in Excel 2016 the newly opened workbook is not the active workbook and the ribbon is not responsive. It's only when I switch back to the workbook with the code and then to newly opened workbook
 that he ribbon is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have this problem as well and is this a bug?</p>

            <p>I have experienced a similar situation but not when opening a workbook. In my experience it tends to happen when closing or saving workbooks or just using them and some VBA event code is executing.</p>

            <p>I am using a form to select a workbook to open. The form has a Combobox which is populated with all the names of the files in a certain directory.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet with the code has a button which shows the form and the code for the OK button is as below:</p>
<p>
Private Sub cmdOK_Click()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If cmbCompanyName = "" Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MsgBox "Select a company from the list or press Cancel!", vbOKOnly, "Error"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim strPath As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim bOpen As Boolean, wb As Workbook<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Application.ScreenUpdating = False<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; strPath = "C:\Users\"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; bOpen = False<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each wb In Workbooks<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If wb.Name = cmbCompanyName &amp; ".xlsm" Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bOpen = True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If bOpen = False Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set wb = Workbooks.Open(strPath &amp; cmbCompanyName &amp; ".xlsm")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; wb.Activate<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Application.ScreenUpdating = True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unload frmViewCompany<br />
<br />
End Sub
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I check in the code to see whether the workbook selected is already open. If it is it will just activate that workbook and everything works fine. If it is not open then it uses the workbooks.open method to open the selected spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The workbook that is opened looks normal as in the cells can be selected and changed and you can change tabs in the workbook as well, but the ribbon is not active.</p>
<p>The newly opened workbook has a button (as it as a template), when I push the button to edit the information in the spreadsheet the focus automatically turns back to the original workbook that was used to open this workbook.</p>
<p>It looks like the workbooks.open method doesn't change the focus to the new workbook, but stays at the old workbook.</p>

            <p>I can't reproduce the problem. Does the workbook being opened have any code that runs on open? What code runs after the form is unloaded--assuming you are showing the form with the Modal parameter set to True, the code immediately after the Show method is
 invoked will run after the form is closed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>to be honest I have never bothered looking at the modal parameter and always just used the default, but changing it to false has solved the issue.</p>

            <p>Actually, showing the dialog with Modal set to True (default) should work. I think the problem lies with what code executes when the workbook is opened and after the form closes. Non-modal dialogs should only be used when you want the user to interact with
 the Excel UI while the dialog is displayed.</p>

            <p>I thought that it should work as well, but there is no code that runs after the form is closed and there is no code running in the workbook open event either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the same kind of thing in Excel 2010 many times before and never had any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if it's got anything to do with the way every workbook has it's own session now but still is connected to each other. In my opinion not giving the option to open multiple workbooks in one session wasn't a great decision by Microsoft..</p>

    <title>Change the default border weight in Publisher 2000&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vlk l&#38;f  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change the default border weight in Publisher 2000&#63;</h2>
                    When I create a new shape the default setting makes a border of 1 point and no fill; a text box has no border with a white fill; and the picture frame has no border and no fill. &nbsp;I would like to change the default settings&nbsp;for text boxes and shapes&nbsp;to
 no border and no fill and can't find a way to do it. &nbsp;A while back I found a website that said how to do it - unfortunately I can't find the bookmark or the website, but it said something about creating the item with the settings you prefered and then to do
 something to make publisher remember those settings. &nbsp;Then, the next time you created that item it would have the prefered settings. &nbsp;If anyone knows how to change the defaults or can direct me to the website with the instructions, I would be most appreciative!
 &nbsp;Thanks

Open Help in Publisher and on the first page:</p>

Get Help from the Help menu

<p>Thanks for the info - the help menu says you can change the default settings for a text box - font, size, etc. but I can't get it to work.&nbsp; All the other items have worked as the instructions say.&nbsp; Any suggestions for text box default font?</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
Select the text [<b> A</b> ] icon on the left hand side tool bar, but do not actually create a text box.<br />
<br />
Then, on the top menu . . .<br />
<br />
&gt;Format &gt;Text Style &gt;Change this style &gt;Character type and size<br />
<br />
In the dialog box, change the font type and size to your requirements<br />
<br />
Click <b>OK</b> to close all the dialog boxes.<br />
<br />
Then close Publisher and&nbsp; when a dialog box asks you if you want to save the changes, click
<b>Save</b>. <br />
<br />
Done.<br />
<br />
Note that the new default setting will apply to this Publisher document only. It will not apply to other existing Publisher documents or new Publisher documents. I am unaware of the possibility to make a default resetting apply to all and every Publisher documents.<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Yes, that's right. Resetting the defaults applies to all pages of one document only. As I said, I am not aware of a way to make defaults resetting universal.<br />
<br />
You can, however, reset the defaults on a blank document. When you want to create a new document, you open the blank document and fill it with content then "<b>Save As</b>" with a new name. This way your customised settings will always be there.<br />
<br />
Yes you can ask questions about Pub 2010 or any other version here.<br />
<br />
I cannot help you with Pub 2010, but David F2 and Volunteer J and perhaps others too can.<br />
<br />
PS: If you use a blank document to create new documents, you can also adjust the size of the new document to suit your needs, i.e.: &gt;File &gt;Page Setup . . . then tick
<b>Custom</b> and adjust the size.<br />

<p><br />
Like Geoffrey, I would suggest that if you want a blank page to open with different default settings, I would just edit a blank page and do a Save As and then use that file as my new default blank page template. That has always been my 'old school' approach...I
 just make my own templates and reuse them over and over again by opening and then doing a Save As and leaving the Publisher templates as is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said, here is an article that was written a long time ago that may still work with Pub 2000. Reference: Setting Text Defaults using Normal.pub:
<a href="http://ed.mvps.org/Static.aspx?=Publisher/normal.pub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ed.mvps.org/Static.aspx?=Publisher/normal.pub</a>&nbsp; I don't know if the path to the normal.pub is correct for your computer and there is some risk in changing these default files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also here is a similar article for Pub 2010: </p>
<div><font>How to Change the Default Font in MS Publisher 2010:</font></div>
<div><a href="http://www.brighthub.com/multimedia/publishing/articles/88591.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.brighthub.com/multimedia/publishing/articles/88591.aspx</font></a></div>
<div>Use it at your own risk too.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One of the useful features of Pub 2010 is 'building blocks or parts' which might be a better choice than changing the defaults. Draw a text box &gt;click Paragraph and change your preferences. Type a&nbsp;letter with your preferred font, size etc. &gt;&nbsp;right-click
 the&nbsp;text box &gt;&nbsp;save as a Building Block. This text box will be available&nbsp;in all&nbsp;future publications by Insert &gt;&nbsp;Page Parts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Both Geoffrey and I still use Pub 2000 for a lot of our production work. In fact I am not sure but Geoffrey may only use Pub 2000. In many ways MS started messing up&nbsp;Publisher after that version IMHO. Pub 2010 uses the new ribbon menu, does not have the
 built-in clip art, has different paragraph&nbsp;and line spacing defaults,&nbsp;and has quite a few other differences both good and bad.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One of the biggest issues for you is that once you open and save a file in PUb 2010 format, you WILL NOT be able to open that file in Pub 2000. With that said, you can run both versions of Publisher on your computer at the same time, but I would suggest
 you keep your Publisher files seperated as per each version. Though you can do a Save As and save a Pub 2010 file in Pub 2000 format, I would not depend on the conversion working each time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you do decide to run both versions then it is best to install Pub 2000 first and then do a custom install of Pub 2010. Then when you are asked if you want to overwrite the old version you say no. I go a step further and always install the other version
 of Publisher in its own custom folder rather than the default location. I currently have all versions of Publisher installed except for Pub 2002 which I really disliked.</div>

            <p>I so agree with you...I have 2000, 2003 (on my XP machine) and 2010 (on my Windows 7).&nbsp; I still use 2000 for almost everything - it works the best of all of them - with the exception of working with color.&nbsp; Which brings me to my next question/problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This pertains to the&nbsp;color picker/paint bucket - what&nbsp;you use to fill items with color....in 2000 whenever you choose or create a new color, it automatically is displayed right above&nbsp;where it says more colors so&nbsp;it can&nbsp;easily be used again.&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2010, however,
 that does not happen on&nbsp;a consistant basis.&nbsp; If I am trying the use the same color for another box (not the same atribute - so I can't use the paintbrush) I have to reopen the item of the color I am trying to duplicate and visually see where it is in the standard
 color chart.&nbsp; More often than not a color I have chosen does not show up under the recent colors area.&nbsp; It is frustrating and VERY time consuming.&nbsp; I don't want to create a scheme - I just want to be able to use the colors previously used in the file with
 ease....does anyone know how to make colors ALWAYS show up the recently used colors?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, I find that documents change color model - from rgb to cmyk by themselves.&nbsp; I set a color as rgb and for some reason when I click on the item and check the color, it is cmyk?&nbsp; I print most of my work myself, but I do have to send some out to be
 printed and therefore have to use cmyk.&nbsp; Its a mystery to me how colors work in Publisher 2010!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first started to use it I remember going to Microsoft's website and there were detailed tutorials for all the other Office products but NOT Publisher!&nbsp; The new program is very different from the old, especially in the way it works behind the scenes,
 so I decided to keep most of my work in 2000....very frustrating!!</p>

            Have you clicked&nbsp;the Set Up Show button on the&nbsp;Slide Show ribbon and checked the settings there? Maybe your presentation is set to only show slides 1-74 and to loop continuously.&nbsp; If you set the 'Show slides' to 'All' and remove any tick in the loop box
 then it should solve the problem.

    <title>Can&#39;t unpin docs from Word taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mayaum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t unpin docs from Word taskbar</h2>
                    <p>When I right-click the Word icon in my taskbar, a list of recent documents pops up, as well as a few I pinned for easy access. But there are a few documents pinned which I cannot unpin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f886d41-ea23-4b7a-8cf6-8af05fed9b74" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I right-click the pinned document, and select "Unpin from this list"...</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74463bca-0f44-4590-9152-1b0af8fadedf" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>But it just flashes orange and does nothing. I have been able to add new pinned documents and unpin these, but over the last several months a few documents have refused to unpin. I deleted one or two of these documents from my computer files, but they still
 refuse to unpin (they didn't unpin when the documents were still present, either).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions? I'd really like to get rid of these documents - having a pinned list is not helpful if I can't remove the documents later.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I&#8217;ve found an annoying bug in Excel. But I guess it&#8217;s probably because of the latest cumulative update for Windows.</h2>
                    <p><span><em>My equipment:</em></span></p>
<p><em><span>Microsoft Windows 10 version 1809 17763.316</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Microsoft Office 2016 version 1901 11231.20174 / Office 2019 version 1901 11231.20174</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hi, everyone. Hum... I think I’ve found a bug in Excel. Here’s the detail and how to recreate the circumstance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 1: Launch Excel App, and create a blank spreadsheet.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Select some rows. In order to have a distinctly effect, please select rows as many as possible, but be notice! The total amount of selected rows must be
<strong>UNDER </strong>863 based on my test, if it’s equal or beyond 863 rows, it’s going to behaved normally. (You can select 600 rows ~ 800 rows in order to maximize the effectives)</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Just Copy it (both </span>‘<span>CTRL + C</span>’<span> and </span>
‘<span>Right click --- Copy</span>’<span> would do the trick).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That’s all, the memory will fast fetching between 1GB to 6GB based on how many rows you selected and how many memories does your system has. Even if you didn’t fill any data into those cells, your system will act like the same. I don’t think hundreds
 of blank rows would occupy up to 6GB memories. Plus, if you still using HDD for you OS drive not SSD, then your system will get into very slow more like freezing for about 2-3mins. &gt;_&lt; After that, the memory back to normal, and your system also become smooth
 to operate. Of course, those cells are able to paste anywhere.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63576ded-ff7c-4857-a2de-da0d44801341?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63576ded-ff7c-4857-a2de-da0d44801341?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acfb9962-b3a9-4f2f-9eec-e21fde216c60?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acfb9962-b3a9-4f2f-9eec-e21fde216c60?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aaad2abf-f286-43ba-9bb4-5d406f402b63?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aaad2abf-f286-43ba-9bb4-5d406f402b63?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>More strange part is, if you select rows above 863 or select any amounts of columns even Ctrl + A to select the whole worksheet, none of them will trigger this bug.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve tested this on 7 PCs, 4 of them are Windows 10 v1809 with the latest cumulative updates, 1 of them is Windows 7, 1 is Windows 10 v1703, the last one is Windows 10 v1803, and turns out those 4 PCs with latest updates happened like the same, even
 they have different version of Office (2 among them are Office 2016, others are Office 2019), and all of those others PCs (without latest updates) act
<strong>perfectly normal</strong>. &gt;_&lt; Odd.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I didn’t remember this bug happened in Jan. 2019. And combining the phenomenon that I tested above, I think it probably because the latest update. I guess. &gt;_&lt;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, do you guys also being face this bug currently? And does anyone has any idea how to fix it?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Thank you SO MUCH for your patiently reading. And I'm really sorry if I just made any grammar mistake.</strong></span></p>

<p>Hi, mate.</p>
<p>I think I've been found where the problem is...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 v1809, there is a new feature called "Clipboard History" which allows you to view and re-paste your previous copied content. And from what I've known, the clipboard in Office is sharing with the clipboard in Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you done the copy command in 1:700 rows for example, looks like windows is trying to fetch every cells data including blank cells into the Windows Clipboard in order to provide the functionality of Clipboard History. Maybe Windows clipboard can not
 recognize the blank cell? I don't know. But that's 700x16384=11468800 cells data in this case. OMG &gt;_&lt; No wonder it's going to occupy up to 6GB of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround solution is pretty simple, just turn off "Clipboard history". Then you can copy any amounts of cells. After that, you can turn it back on if you want. But next time you have to turn if off again just for preventing this issue happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is an absolutely huge bug for Windows. Hoping it's going to be fixed in the coming v1903 build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, as your phone is detected by PC Suite, make a backup of yoir personal data now if you have not already done so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen may be damaged even if no sign of surface damage is visible, modern full-colour phone screens are very sensitive and it is possible that a shock received to the phone could cause problems.&nbsp;Is the screen appearing to function but nor showing any
 content, or does it appear completely dead? In case there is just a software issue causing this, try a hard-reset of the phone by switching it off then starting up with the *, 3 and green call keys pressed down (keep them pressed until you see the Nokia handshake
 logo).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should clear any connectivity issues that the phone itself might be causing (and assuming that your PC has detected the phone before you began having problems today) I lean towards the theory that you have software issues phone-side).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the screen issue proves not to be a software issue (ie: if hard-resetting doesn't fix things), then you'd have to assume a problem with the screen itself and your only viable option is to take it to a Nokia service point. They would assess the cause of
 the screen problem, but I'll warn you in advance that they usually put screen issues down to user damage, so be ready to demand from them a full explanation of what they think has caused the problem if they&nbsp;tell you this.</p>

            hi, i also had the same problem of screen going blank and various colour lines and shades appearing when the screen is visible. Through trial and error and by going through numerous forums, i have found that the problem is a hardware issue and is caused
 due to the application of pressure on the cable connecting the screen and the board. The cable seems to be going beneath the right menu, the clear key, the right and top navigation keys. The fact that this issue is prevalent on a large number of phones of
 n79 series points to a manufacturing defect by nokia.

<p>I have N95 model. While updating the software, I took a back up to the memory card through the tools. After upadating the software, I deleted the back up through winrar. The next time I switched on the cell phone, the screen was blank. It could not be connected
 to the lap top too since it was not possible to press the PC Suite connectivity on the cell phone. I had a feeling that I had deleted some crucial component of the software while deleting what I perceived as the back up I had taken while updating the software.
 When I took the cell phone to the Nokia care centre, I was told that because of moisture there was a short circuit and the LCD and board have to be replaced. There was no chance of any water entering the cell phone.&nbsp; I was disinclined to spend one third of
 the cell phone cost for the repair, so I asked return of Cell phone. But they offered that only the LCD could be replaced, for which I agreed. I have received back the cell phone after replacement of the LCD, but I am not satisfied whether it was indeed the
 hardware problem.</p>

<h2>            Groove Music stops playing when minimized.</h2>
                    <p>Everytime I try to minimize Groove it will stop playing music. Then when I bring it back up it plays again. I've tried restarting my computer, and then only running Groove and it still happens. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT</p>
<p>The music will also stop playing if I add another. Desktop etc.... So while using the Groove music app I'm stuck with one desktop and not minimizing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT #2</p>
<p>Okay so it seems that since the last update that was pushed my Groove Music has been working. I wasn't able to fix it myself.</p>

    <title>Word 2011&#58; Changing theme does not change font for normal style - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anghara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2011&#58; Changing theme does not change font for normal style</h2>
                    I have a document I created by doing a "Save As..." on an existing document. I tried applying several themes to the document but the "normal" style remains Times New Roman (which isn't even on my computer, a different issue...a bunch of fonts disappeared
 or didn't install with Word 2011 that are core Word fonts).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I assume this is somehow related to the fact that it was a duplicate of an existing document, since new documents created on a blank template seem to be working fine - what I cannot figure out is how to change the normal style so it will link back to the
 themes and change accordingly (rather than being stuck on one specific font). Any help would be appreciated - thanks!</div>

            Thanks for the suggestion - unfortunately, that does not seem to work, but I think I figured it out. At least on my system, "Body Text" is based on Normal, so it's following the "fixed" font that Normal seems stuck on. Whereas, styles like the Title or
 Heading 1 seem to be updating, and looking at them I noted they have a "Font: (Default) + Theme Headings" characteristic in the description.
<div><br />
<div>I think I fixed it by modifying the "Normal" style in my document - for the font, I changed it to the "Theme Body" font for whatever theme I was looking at. Doing that seemed to relink it; the descriptor in Normal then changed to "Font: (Default) + Theme
 Body" and when I tried changing themes the section I'd made that edit to updated as well.</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender</h2>
                    I have Vista &amp; use Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE).&nbsp; MSE has disabled Windows Defender.&nbsp; In Vista, how do I use Software Explorer to change my startup programs since I can no longer open Windows Defender to access it?

            <p>Hi Lechwe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows Defender is part of Windows Vista and Widows 7 (and must be disabled if using MSE). It cannot be uninstalled from Vista or Windows 7 - you didn't install it (it's part of the operating system which is why it cannot be removed and why you'll
 see files for it). It's not in Add/Remove programs because it cannot be removed. If using Windows XP, then Defender must be uninstalled if using MSE. Normally the installation of MSE does these things automatically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows Defender's protection is fully covered by MSE and is not needed. In fact, if using MSE do NOT even try to turn on or install Defender or you will cause problems, crashes, freezes and all sorts of other problems. Defender is NOT needed if you
 have MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See the following for additional information: </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/windows-defender-and-microsoft-security-essentials/5309cb8d-02e1-40e8-974f-0dcedb9ab9fd"><span>MSE and Windows
 Defender</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now MSE does not have an equivalent for Software Explorer, but there are several alternatives, some of which are better than Defender was anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There are at least three ways to manage start-up programs (possibly more, but these are enough). I use all three depending on the circumstances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Run and type msconfig.exe and enter. Go to the Startup Tab and you can check or uncheck the programs you want to run at startup. The two drawbacks are that you get little information about the programs
 and you can't add programs that aren't already there to the listing. And this one is not as easy on the eyes as Defender either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. Download the free WinPatrol: </span><a href="http://www.winpatrol.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winpatrol.com/download.html</span></a><span> and you will not only have control over those programs, but you can also add new ones
 AND, what I like best, you can allow it to run in the background and it will alert you if anything tries to add itself to the startup menu without your knowledge (as sometimes happens with some downloads and installations). You don't have to use that feature
 if you don't want, but I find it convenient. It also provides more information than msconfig. I find it better than Defender and would use for startup-program control it even if it were possible to run Defender.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3. Download the free Autoruns: </span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></a><span>. This is the gold standard for controlling
 startup programs and everything else at startup with loads of details and options and different views. The danger here is that it is so good and powerful, that if you're not careful, you can remove something you really don't want to remove and hose your system
 (but if you pay attention and show use caution and don't change anything unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing and the ramifications of doing it, you'll be fine).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I rarely use msconfig. I mostly use WinPatrol. When I'm really into cleaning things up and need to know exactly what is happening a boot and startup, then I go to Autoruns to get all the details I need.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This will cover managing start-up and boot programs and processes and everything related much better. And if you choose to run WinPatrol only on-demand&nbsp;and not with real-time scanning (as I do), then none of them will take up any resources unless you
 are using them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>A more advanced tool is Autoruns, free from Microsoft.</p>
