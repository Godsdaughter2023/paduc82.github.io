    <title>Pivot Table Subtotal Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot Table Subtotal Problem</h2>
                    <p>I need help on solving a subtotal pivot table problem I'm having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pivot table to determine commission for sales reps. It is by gross profit by customer. I have the pivot table showing the columns and rows I need. The rows show the sales person and the total for each of their customers. I added a calculated field
 column to calculate the commission amount. The formula is working fine and then I realized that instead of the subtotal/grand total field summing the amounts in the rows, it is using the formula it's self.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an issue because the formula is based on the GP% per customer; not on their total for the pay period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched online and got that the power pivot add on would solve this. I added the add on but I can't figure out what I'm supposed to be doing to get the subtotal/grand total to actually total and not use the formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone can help me??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - AutoPreview is not working for Search Results</h2>
                    Hello...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have many Outlook Folders set to show three (3) lines of content from each email - i.e., AutoPreview is set to "Preview all" in such folders.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I CANNOT get Outlook 2010 to do the same for a window that shows Search Results. &nbsp;Please advise...

            Thanks for the reply Nayana.
<div><br />
<div>What you suggest is exactly what I did and it had NO EFFECT on Search Results.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also tried a method where, while in a Search Results window, a right click on the column titles displays a menu with a "View Settings..." option. &nbsp;Selecting the option shows the "Advanced View Settings: &nbsp;Preview - Search Results" dialog. &nbsp;Selecting "Other
 Settings..." opens another dialog that has a section for AutoPreview.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The FIRST time this dialog is accessed during an Outlook session AND the "No AutoPreview" options is selected, changing the setting to "Preview all items" WORKS for the ACTIVE Search Results window. &nbsp;If I open a 2nd Search Results window, AutoPreview is
 NOT applied even though the "Preview all items" option is set on the "Other Settings" dialog for this newly ACTIVE window.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I close Outlook and re-open it, AutoPreview has NO EFFECT on any Search Results windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I set the AutoPreview option to "No AutoPreview" on a Search Results window, then close Outlook and re-open it, then set the AutoPreview option to "Preview all items", the result is as above for "FIRST time".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope I'm making sense in describing the behavior I'm seeing...</div>

            <div><br />
I am SO WITH YOU!!! Thank you so much for asking this question, J.Oz. I am having the EXACT same issue and it was driving me insane.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I knew that 3 line Autopreview WAS working, but then it stopped working and I couldn't get it back.
<div><br />
<div>For anyone else out there who might help - I do have some additional information above everything J.Oz says above (which is all exactly true to my experience as well).</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) This issue is not happening to me for all Search Results, only when I click on &nbsp;"Try searching again in All Mail Items".</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) When I am in the Search Results for "All Mail Items", I have a DIFFERENT SET OF VIEWS AVAILABLE than normal. Here are links to some screen shots on snaggy to illustrate:</div>
<div><a href="http://snag.gy/7m4rk.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Views available when just searching in "Sent Items"</a></div>
<div><a href="http://snag.gy/6zVC5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How I switch to search "All Mail Items"</a></div>
<div><a href="http://snag.gy/nr1hs.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Views available when searching "All Mail Items"</a></div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>So I conclude there is something very significantly different about the way Views are handled for "All Mail Items" and that's why we (J.Oz &amp; I at least) are having this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also think it is very significant that it can be made to work for a particular Outlook session (following J. Oz's excellent instructions - and I don't even want to know how long it took you to figure that out). But it doesn't persist - after the session
 is closed, the Autopreview for "All Mail Items" search results goes away.</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW J.Oz, thanks for the instructions that at least let me get it back for a session - saved my sanity!!</div>

            <p>I have the same problem and I'm pretty sure it is related to Windows Search/Outlook Search options, the indexing, or another search-related issue. &nbsp;My hunch is that AutoPreview (the 1-3 lines we want to see in the Search Results that we get in other folders)
 uses Windows Search/Indexing to read the liens from, and if the items haven't been indexed then maybe that's why it can't display them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I noticed is that if you do a search, select all the results and copy them to a (new) folder then after they've copied the AutoPreview in the Search Results (for the search you just did) starts to work. &nbsp;Weird, no?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No solution yet, just throwing this feedback/experience out there in case it helps.</p>

<h2>            Unable to sign in to One Note 2016 on Windows 7</h2>
                    <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
I downloaded One Note Free Version from https://www.onenote.com/download . I'm able to install but unable to sign in..I've tried to sign in multiple times, but One Note just wont connect. When I put in my email address to connect to onedrive, it asks for my
 password. I input that, and the window disappears. But nothing happens. I can sign in again, but nothing happens. Help. I have windows 7 Pro with SP1.<br />
<br />
There is no accounts given in Credentials Manager.<br />
<br />
And secondly, Is this version of One Note is free to use ? https://blogs.office.com/2015/02/13/onenote-now-even-free/&nbsp; I'm using this along with Office 2007.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've tried that. One Note is opening. But it is asking for sign in again. After sign in with the SAME ACCOUNT, it is saying you don't have permission to see the notebook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried sign in from One Note , file =&gt; accounts, after entering password, the dialog box closes and no error message and not logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right upper corner of One Note is always showing "sign in". </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm on my office Domain network. Does it affect this in anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repaired the One Note, still same issue is there. I tried installing this on my personal laptop. I'm facing same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any supporting software required? I've latest .NET framework and Visual C++ redistributable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me and my colleague also facing same issues with this. I think the issue can be easily reproduced by installing OneNote by downloading from onenote.com/download. Please note that I don't have any other microsoft products which requires login. I've office
 2007 in office PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know whether following will help of or not. I've captured the network packets during sign in using Wireshark.</p>
<p>I'm seeing some errors in that. Following is the one:</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Even we were facing the same issue and tried searching for a solution everywhere on blogs, microsoft community but no solution. Finally tried below fix and one note is working fine now on my windows 7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We had Internet explorer version 8(by default)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Just updated the Internet Explorer to Version 9 (though we guess even higher version like 10 and 11 should have same effect)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Tried signing IN from onenote app...It worked !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps others as well !</p>

            Judging by the number of complaints MS have problems on the server side, which is why your contacts are not syncing down to your phone. You'll just have to be patient, this happens every few months, the contacts will eventually re-appear on your phone.<br />

    <title>Outlook 2013 cannot add domain to safe senders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathy miiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 cannot add domain to safe senders</h2>
                    <p>Our company regularly receives important emails from an address that does not have a complete domain (no ".com"). For example, the email comes from "VariableName@mycompany"
</p>
<p>The problem is that Outlook is sporadically sending only some of these to Junk and there is no apparent way to add domain in safe senders list since Outlook does not see "mycompany" as a true domain. The sender, VariableName, obviously changes. Because these
 are critical and time sensitive emails that come to almost everyone in our company, we need to get a fix so these do not land in Junk.</p>
<p>We have Windows 7, Outlook (Exchange) 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your help is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>MVP and this is your reply buddy? Not helpful, that route is obvious and I'm sure the OP wouldn't be asking the question if they could simply remedy the issue at the source.&nbsp; Sorry that kind of answer is a pet peeve of mine I am sure you are a helpful and
 generous soul, just refrain from that kind of response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People like me find these threads because we have the same issue and want to address it through the method for which we are asking the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the answer elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those that follow, like me, even though this is an old thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: this was tested on Outlook 2010 but should be similar in other versions</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on the email in the Junk Email folder, hover your mouse over the <strong>
Junk</strong> option and choose <strong>Junk E-mail Options</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the Safe Senders tab</p>
<p>Click Add</p>
<p>It accepts wildcards so you can put in "*@mycompany.*"</p>
<p>Then not only will it allow a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to pass through but a name@mycompany as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use this because we have internal servers that email us from root@servername and despite it being an option to go through all 153 servers now and add a domain name which isn't required it was simpler to adjust my outlook to not put the emails in junk.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community Forums. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
What is the make and model of the computer? <br />
<br />
</span><span>The black screen issue could be related to display drivers and might get resolved by updating the display drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't
 work properly.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Your efforts to work on this issue is very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Let us unplug all external devices and restart the computer to check if you still get the black screen.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, then you may update the Display driver from the Device Manager and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.<br />
2. Expand “Display Adaptor”.<br />
3. Right click on the video driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
</span></p>

Alternatively, you may also manually download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website and install it to check if this helps.<br />

            Hello Lain,
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />You are correct, connect accounts should no longer work in O365 outlook web as per below article. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connect-email-accounts-in-outlook-on-the-web-office-365-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connec...</a>
<br />
<br />Do you see them still syncing in outlook client application or on the web version?
<br />
<br />If, it is outlook client desktop application, please check your profile if, they exist there. 
<br />
<br />To Remove the profile 
<br />In Outlook, click File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Manage Profiles 
<br />
<br />Select Show Profiles.

            Hi Lain,
<br />
<br />Thanks for the information. as it is from the web version, seems like the settings are still there in O365 account settings, but we can't no longer change/check in web settings. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check with Microsoft support. as this is O365 account, probably there is some backend fix or powershell cmdlets to check the settings.

<p>Hi Iain,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the office 365 connected account feature is not available now, as you said your office 365 account is still checking other accounts for emails. May I know if you could see any prompting message said that your office 365 account is checking emails from
 other accounts, or you still receive the emails that should belong&nbsp; to other accounts? For example the emails were sent to other accounts not your office 365 account, and you still receive them in your own office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please share more clarification with me, some generated screenshots will be better. And I will do some more research for you, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Lain,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, my understanding is that the emails sent to previous connect email addresses are still appearing in your office 365 Outlook Web App (
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</a> ). Please clarify if I misunderstand your text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, first please help check if you enabled the emails forwarding feature for the previous connected account. I mean if you opened the forwarding feature in the previous connect email accounts and forward the emails to your office 365 account. If so, in
 this scenario, you will still receive the emails sent to the previous connected accounts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In general you can check the forwarding feature in the web mail settings of your previous connected accounts. If you have enabled it with your office 365 account, please disable it and see if it can make any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, may I know <span>&nbsp;</span>if the previous connected accounts are also office 365 account or other types accounts? If they are office 365 account too, please check if you have set up any inbox rules to forward the emails to your office 365
 account which you mentioned in the forum. And as you still receive the emails from the previous connected account in your office 365 account, you can try to run office 365 message trace for your office 365 account and then check if you could find why you still
 receive the emails. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/message-trace-scc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Message trace in the Security &amp; Compliance Center</a>. For a clear check, you can try to send a test email to the previous connected account and if you still receive it in your office 365 account, you can try to run the message trace for this test email.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are not the admin of your office 365 account, please ask your admin to help you run the message trace.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And you can share the full message trace result with me via <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">

<h2>            Microsoft Lumia 950 is the biggest piece of crap I have ever used</h2>
                    I am so disappointed. &nbsp;This is my third Lumia phone and have been a huge proponent of W10M for the last 5 years. &nbsp;Both the Lumia 950 and the OS failed to deliver. &nbsp;This is the slowest buggiest phone I have ever had. &nbsp;It doesnt matter that the infrastructure
 has yet to catch up, the phone is a nightmare to use. &nbsp;The only thing superior is the camera, when it works. &nbsp;I have had several experiences with the phone locking up when trying to use the camera. &nbsp;This will be my last Windows Phone.&nbsp;

I have exactly the same issues and frankly, for a phone that cost roughly 4,000 DKK, it's just ridiculous when compared to what else is on the market. 



Most apps do not work properly if at all. Many constantly won't load, and those that do often kick me out half way through. The Outlook app for instance, has a hard time connecting and often just returns with a message saying 'Something went wrong' + a load of numbers and then the option to close. Cheers. 



Apps such as Messenger or Whatsapp - well, good luck! When they work they work, but there is a reasonable chance that they simply won't open, or the keyboard disappears mid sentence, and the only option is to restart the entire **** phone - if not completely uninstall the app and start from scratch.  



The camera is the only saving grace, but it's not even possible to share pictures from the album - if I try this option the phone just blinks and nothing happens. I have to either connect to my computer or email to myself... like the goo

            <p>I have a 950XL, so a little different to the 950, but mine is fast, smooth, stable, and I get all day on a charge (except when tethered - that does chew up the battery).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have some issues when I installed the anniversary update (Edge and Settings wouldn't load). A hard reset fixed those issues. Yes, I shouldn't have had to do a hard reset, but it wasn't much of an issue.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>many of the issues that I reported earlier have been fixed with updates. &nbsp;Issues that remain are terrible battery life, I am on my second battery and I get about 8 hours of standby with BT and location disabled. &nbsp;Other issues include, getting kicked out
 of messaging when typing in a contact name and occasional spontaneous reboots. &nbsp;Also the USB-C connector is difficult to get a cable to plug into. &nbsp;I have looked inside of it but do not see any obstructions. &nbsp;</p>

            I have to agree. Now with added updates that screw up the phone even more. So glad MS failed. The hardware is great, but the os is crap. I just bought a cheap moto android, and what a joy to use after this rubbish.

            Hi, I've got a 640xl a much cheaper fun. After upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile it froze, I lost all Lumia apps especially the camera app. I downgraded back to Win 8.1 and its great again. I'll use it as long as I can. Had original 7.0 phones from very beginning.
 I've got an Android to for the apps I need but still prefer my Windows 8.1 OS.

<p>Agree...all the way. As an IT pro I have had them all from 640 up...</p>
<p>windows 10 is a disaster for phones. Phones are supposed to be convenient not combersome and unreliable. As usual MS dumped the most loyal of customers with the exit of the phone. They say support will still be provided. How do you support something that
 is fundamentaly broken and for all intensive purposes...a giant waist of time?</p>
<p>After all...they did drop it all!</p>
<p>Most complaints are valid and very real. Anniversary or not...it blows hard. Look at what they did to the PC. How do like racing to your machine for a quick task and WAIT...we are applying a forced uncontrolled update!</p>
<p>MS is in the personal data game now. I went back to ios...as i had no choice. Ever try running a smart home with a Lumia?</p>
<p>Get me a long rope please!</p>
<p>Microsoft..."we are not happy till you are not happy!"</p>

            <p>Hi ski1420,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood correctly&nbsp;your calendar events appears to be an hour earlier than it should be. Let me help you with that. In addition to what ZigZag3143, MS-MVP has posted,&nbsp;it is possible that your time zone settings&nbsp;are causing the issue. Since you
 have checked that the time zone in your computer is correct, <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
you can check the time zone settings on your calendar if it matches the settings on your account information and make the appropriate changes if possible</span>. Below are the steps on how to do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the <strong>Calendar </strong>page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in <strong><a href="https://calendar.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. </li><li>Go to <strong>Options</strong>. </li><li>Under <strong>Time Zone</strong>, click the drop down button and select the correct time zone for your country.
</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom of the page.</li></ol>
<p>Under the <strong>Account information</strong> page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in <strong><a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Edit personal info</strong>. </li><li>Under <strong>Home</strong>, click the drop down button beside <strong>Country/region</strong> then select your country.
</li><li>Set the region of your Country and the Timezone. </li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom of the page.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how things turn out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Calendar cleared</h2>
                    I did a microsoft office update on my macbook air (version is 15.29) this morning and now my calendars have been cleared. And I am unable to add accepted meetings to my calendar or new tasks. Email is working fine.

            <p>Hi NicoleBryant,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, only the Exchange mode support to sync calendars and tasks. Please make sure that you didn’t use IMAP or POP3 protocol to configure your Office 365 Business account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, to investigate this issue, I’d like to collect the following information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the affected account an Office 365 for Business account or Hotmail/outlook.com?</li><li>Does the Outlook Web App work fine?</li><li>Can you create task and calendar items normally?</li><li>Regarding “I am unable to add accepted meetings to my calendar or new tasks”, did you receive any error message? If yes, please send t to us for further troubleshooting?
</li><li>Some screenshots about this issue. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            &#34;You&#39;re already using your Windows Live ID on the maximum five devices.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>This is a joke, right? I've used Windows Phones for years and always tried my best to defend them. I'm ready to write a scathing review and jump ship to the iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the by, I'm only logged in on one PC (posting this question) and that's it, but my POS Windows Phone can't connect to anything in the Marketplace, can't sync any documents on SkyDrive. What's the point? Where's the functionality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's bad enough there's no VPN client. It's bad enough there's no native RDP client. It's bad enough I can't use it as a tether for my Notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I can't even access and edit my Office documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what do I say when someone shows me their iPhone? Because really they have a better device with more functionality.</p>

            <p>I got same issue today...I was even not logged in anywhere. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think they are going thru some marketplace changes but as always poor communication from MSFT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Here is how I fixed this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Connect your phone to PC and launch Zune.</p>
<p>2. Click Settings link at the top-right -&gt; Phone tab in the middle.</p>
<p>3. 'Sync Options' should have been selected by default. Click on it otherwise.</p>
<p>4. Under 'Device options', click on 'Forget this phone' button.</p>
<p>5. Click OK and Disconnect and Restart the phone.</p>
<p>6. Connect it agin and establish the sync relationship using wizard</p>
<p>7. Disconnect and now go to marketplace and now it should work whatever was not working for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish there was better message.</p>

            <p>There was an unexpected service issue with the Zune service today, which caused some Live ID accounts to experience this issue.&nbsp; I was one of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to try it again just now, and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. SkyDrive - Office docs on SkyDrive will automatically sync to your phone.&nbsp; If not, please describe the problem you are seeing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. VPN - While there is still no VPN capabilities, be patient.&nbsp; The iPhone didn't have one either a year and a half after its launch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. RDP - Partners and developers have competitively created a variety of RDP clients:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/search?q=rdp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/search?q=rdp</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Tethering - The newer, post-mango phones have tethering capabilities.&nbsp; However, the carriers have enforced separate tethering plans:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably not the set of answers you're looking for, but you should be able to at least re-connect to SkyDrive now.</p>

            1. Neither the Office Hub or SkyDrive can sync to my SkyDrive. (Nor the Pictures Hub.) I only have available what's local on the phone from the last time any of them successfully synced (weeks ago), and have no access to what's live on the drive now, nor
 can I successfully update/upload a document. If I create a new OneNote Note, it can't be successfully uploaded to any Notebook that lives on my SkyDrive. If I edit a document that exists on the phone (from the last sync weeks ago), it will fail to upload/save.
 If I add a document or folder to my SkyDrive via a computer, I'll never see it browsing on the phone.
<div><br />
<div>I was hoping today's hiccup might be some kind of simple answer for the problem, alas, I'm still SOL with my data on SkyDrive. But I can at least update existing apps via the Marketplace now, yes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for the rest, not the answers I was looking for, no. I'm the test user for Windows Phone at my company, and I wish I could recommend WP as the platform on which we should standardize at a corporate level, it's not working out that way.<br />
<div><br />
<div>2. But the iPhone has that capability now. It's lame that Windows Phone doesn't; saying your competitor was once lame too doesn't make it not lame that Windows Phone isn't at this point lame re:VPN. It doesn't make it any less embarrassing that in my completely
 Microsoft environment at work (Exchange, AD, SharePoint), coworkers with iPhones can access things that I can't. Bear in mind we haven't decided yet what mobile device we will standardize on at the corporate level. I'm the test user for Windows Phone (a longtime
 Windows mobile device user and not a fan of iOS), and yet I'm having a hard time saying that Windows Phone is the way to go. Which is pretty sad since we're Microsoft with everything else, and yet the iPhone meshes better than the Windows Phone. I can't really
 recommend it at this point; not when I can't even edit my online documents.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. I'll have to take your word for it; without VPN I can't use RDP anyway. Disappointed that it's Third-Party App only.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Be that as it may, my phone is only 6 months old and I'm the idiot sitting there unable to tether while everyone else does. So my eval of Windows Phone can include "maybe they don't all suck, but mine does?" It's kind of a bummer, because I've always
 liked having a Windows Phone... up until the point it no longer contributed to productivity. Now, you know, if I say "we should standardize on WP," everyone knows I'm full of [B.S.]. The iPhone is clearly better at this point, to argue otherwise I'm arguing
 against fact.</div>

            <p>You're right.&nbsp; If &lt;product a&gt; has features and functionality available today that &lt;product b&gt; does not, and having those&nbsp;now&nbsp;is a requirement, then &lt;product a&gt; is the way to go.&nbsp; Can't argue or fix that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, here are three *native* Microsoft work enviroment functions you cannot do with an iPhone (so your evaluation isn't completely futile):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; From Outlook on a Windows Phone, go to "folders", then "show all folders", then "inbox".&nbsp; If you have sub-folders within your inbox, which is common in the workplace, you can hold one of the folders, then pin it to the start screen.&nbsp; Imagine setting
 up an Outlook&nbsp;rule that copies email from your manager or a customer to a sub-folder, then being able to quickly go it without having to scroll through folders like you must on the iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; From the Office Hub on a Windows Phone, while on your corporate network, flick to locations, then select "SharePoint".&nbsp; If you have an internal SharePoint workspace or document library, add its URL or import your links from your My Site (if your work
 uses those).&nbsp; If your company has a UAG Server, then employees can access the corporate SharePoint sites from their Windows Phone, through that.&nbsp;

http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/office/use-office-sharepoint-workspace-mobile.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; From OneNote on a PC, go to File, then click on "Share on Web or network".&nbsp; Select a Web location on SkyDrive.&nbsp; Then, create a test note.&nbsp; From a Windows Phone, go to the Office Hub, then pin the test note you created on Start.&nbsp; I use this&nbsp;feature all
 the time, whenever I need to make a quick note or link to myself (i.e. groceries, links, restaurants).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-US/howto/wp7/office/use-office-onenote-mobile.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-US/howto/wp7/office/use-office-onenote-mobile.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in order to experience&nbsp;#3, your phone needs to be able to successfully sync to SkyDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your phone, when you go to Settings then "email+accounts", does the Windows Live ID match the one you'e logging in with on
<a href="http://www.skydrive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.skydrive.com</a>?&nbsp; So that, when you're at the SkyDrive site on your PC and you hover your mouse over the name on the top right, does the drop down highlight the same Live ID that's on your phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May be a basic question, but just trying to understand what you're seeing, to rule out the obvious.</p>

            <div>Bear in mind I'm rooting for Windows Phone, I'm not a fan of the iPhone or anything.</div>
<div><br />
1. "Neat." Far less useful than being able to sort my mail by Sender or by Subject, which WP doesn't give me the option to do. (Pretty basic.) This has already come up as a talking point, to which I don't really have anything to say other than "no it can't."
<div><br />
<div>2. It's a typical corporate environment which means SharePoint is available, but nobody uses it; email is still the main file system. So Email sorting and parsing tools (like sorting the Inbox) are more important at this point. SharePoint isn' t anything
 new; shared storage has been around since the Bronze Age; for all the documents that simply live on file servers, well it's too bad my device has no access to those. Where for art thou Explorer? At any rate, that one hasn't scored the phone major points for
 us, at least not in a significant enough fashion to compensate for the major points it's been losing elsewhere, like #1 for example, or lacking VPN, or everyone witnessing me be unable to actually use OneNote (which when I could sync would frequently puke
 with conflicts by the by, enough to be a nuisance) or Office via SkyDrive. I was so sure I was going to be all kinds of cool over the folks with iPhones, but so far I'm just frustrated and embarrassed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Yup, they match. I don't get any kind of specific or descriptive errors, either. Just generic stuff like "we encountered a problem" or "couldn't sync." Or worse, it doesn't even tell me there was anything wrong, just offers up a dated version of the
 document that's been sitting locally on the phone deprecating for a month or two.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And back in days of yore when it was syncing, it would oddly wait a bit before automatically syncing. It would give me a little while and allow me to actually start editing my document -- I'd input a number into a cell or what have you -- THEN it would
 say "oh there's an updated version do you want that?" Ugh. [A] Yes of course I want the latest most up-to-date version, and [B] You've taken away much of the file management by automatically handling where things are stored, what their path is, and not showing
 me the path. I can't really make use of half of the control, I either need all of it or none of it. Of course now that it doesn't sync properly, it doesn't ask. When opening the file to edit (the ones I can still see because they've been there for a long time),
 it doesn't tell me there was any kind of problem; it simply doesn't say anything at all. The problem is only reported if I try to save. It's like an answering machine that says "hello?" and let's me talk for a minute before then saying "oh I'm not here leave
 a message hahaha." Fortunately I know how the document is supposed to look, so I know that it's out of date before I even bother trying to edit and save; I know it's an answering machine, so I don't play its silly game.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I wish these things would work better so I could say "yay Windows Phone," but at this point I'm actually shopping for/looking at my options for how I can switch to an iPhone. I won't even go into how any kind of App I actually want exists for Android,
 exists for iPhone, but either doesn't exist for WP or is a featureless afterthought. Really it's just embarrassing being a WP user, it's already lost its cool factor now that everyone realizes I'm handicapped. This from a guy who loved when people asked "what's
 that?" when looking at my HTC Fuze or TyTn.</div>

            <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way to sort by sender or by subject in iOS mail natively?&nbsp; Yes, I&nbsp;agree, WP Outlook&nbsp;should let you sort by sender or by Subject.&nbsp; However, I've found&nbsp;the people hub and search to be faster.&nbsp; For example, if I want to see all of the email Joe
 has sent me, I can go to Joe in the People hub, then flick to history.&nbsp; There, not only are Joe's email listed, but also his SMS and IM messages to me, his recient tweets or Facebook postings, and latest photos are consolidated.&nbsp; When I demo this to my enterprise
 customers, they're drawn to how quick and easy I am to find stuff based on a contact.&nbsp; However, not being able to sort by sender is a drawback if you need to find messages from someone not in your contacts.&nbsp; In that case, I would use the search feature in
 WP Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You really should give folder pinning a shot.&nbsp; I have some customers addicted to it because now they can jump to an entire discussion in one click or visually see the number of new messages at a glance, instead of having them buried in their inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; SkyDrive connectiveity and syncing need to be fixed on your phone in order to properly demo the Office integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; On your WP, when you go to the Office Hub, under locations, underneath SkyDrive, does it show &lt;your name's&gt; SkyDrive?&nbsp; If so, when you click on SkyDrive, are you taken to documents?&nbsp; If so, what's listed?&nbsp; If not, what message appears?&nbsp; (please provide
 verbatim)&nbsp; Also, have you tried creating a test Windows Live account, then adding that to your phone to see if syncing works with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we aren't able to solve this through this forum, would you be open to talking with someone in support to help resolve the issue?</p>

            1. Well, sometimes I use the search feature, but most of the time I just wait until I get to a desk. It is an emotional response yes, but the general feeling around here (myself included) is that the mail client isn't powerful enough. (For example the
 different views (unread, flagged, urgent) are preset. Or what if I'm looking for an attachment? Oh and where do I find those attachments after they've been downloaded? That one in particular bothers me.)&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>As to folder pinning, is that really a feature of WP, or is it just people discovering that if they organize their mail (which can be done on any platform) it's easier to deal with? Once they go beyond "leaving all mail in the Inbox" they've already made
 the leap, the shortcut to the Home screen is kinda just icing on the cake.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Yup, that's the killer. If SkyDrive can become usable, maybe we're back to something. It isn't really just SkyDrive or syncing that's under the gun there, but the platform's stability and support. If the pilot user ends up having significant features
 break, it isn't a good sign. If it doesn't get fixed, it's a death knell.</div>
<div><br />

 it tries to Refresh it tells me "Something's wrong | We encountered a problem and couldn't complete this task. | [ok]."</div>

<div>I haven't created or tried to sync new accounts, no. What I tried to do is go to Microsoft.com, find my way to Windows Phone/Support and/or Support/Windows Phone, and contact someone from tech support to get some kind of ticket opened or something. What
 I got is a revolving door manned by nimble matadors. Eventually I gave up, and Google dutifully led me to this forum. Are you sure there actually *is* support? I'm not. Yes please.</div>

            <p>Sorry for the delay.&nbsp; Hectic last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I did manage to dig further internally at Microsoft and we may be able to narrow this down to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just curious, are you able to automatically sync pictures from your phone to your SkyDrive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, if you're willing to figure this out over the phone, please email 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and I'll&nbsp;help get&nbsp;the&nbsp;issue resolved.</p>

oh after a total farce of a conversation with live chat (which they fail to listen nor fix my issue) 


ive been told i have to wait 30 days for my windowsphone.com account to clear before i can use 


my phone properly again, i am logged into my phone using my windowslive id but i cant DL from  


the marketplace as apparently im using the maximum about of devices (5). 



But im not as both zune  the windowsphone.com site have no phones sync'd!? 


So im stuck now with a brand new working phone with no smartphone capability 


as i can only partially use my windows live id!? 



Total farce, why there is a limit i dont know? 


I factory reset each phone when swapping them for the replacement  remove the sync 


relationship each time, so i dont know how i can even hit a limit of 5 devices!? 



Its all a complete farce, you wonder why iphone  android are laughing at this mess 


of a phone, especially with the poor app support/availability  so forth. 



Really mad  as a die hard windows fan

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you may be aware, the current build of Technical Preview contains two Windows Store apps – the old Windows 8.1 Store (simply called “Store”), and the new Windows
 10 Store, called “Store (Beta)”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout the forums, you can find troubleshooting methods for repairing the Store app – for example,
</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows8_1-windows_store/how-to-solve-windows-store-starting-issues/c4497a58-d287-465c-b547-0c83b2f8105b"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">this
 Wiki article</span></span></a><span> provides an excellent compilation of these methods.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, these techniques will generally only repair the older version of the Store in Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are having problems launching the new “Store (Beta)”, we recommend running the following PowerShell script to re-register the new Store:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the Search box, type
<strong>CMD</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> and choose <strong>Run as administrator</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the command prompt, enter the following command:</span></p>

<h2>            Emails automatically placed in Delete Folder</h2>
                    A Majority of my emails are being automatically deleted. I've read the other posts and answers about people not receiving emails and have tried these but my emails are still being deleted. The one thing I cannot do is find out the size of my email storage
 being used. &nbsp;The gear box does not appear when I move my cursor over the Folder on the left. Any suggestions on how to stop my emails from being automatically deleted? Thanks

            <p>Hi Donna,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your efforts for getting back to us and for providing us more information about your concern.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>One of the possible reasons why your emails were deleted from your mailbox is that you are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account. This often happens when using the POP3 protocol
 to retrieve your mail and the option <b><i>“Always leave a copy of the message on the server”
</i></b>is not selected. </font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>There are also security programs that include e-mail filtering systems. There are instances when the software configuration causes false positives causing valid messages to be either sent to the junk folder or deleted altogether.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Please note that if you have configured your emails on your phones using
<strong>POP3</strong>, you might lose your emails too if you haven't chosen to leave a copy on the server. We suggest that you use
<strong>Exchange Activesync </strong>(<strong>EAS</strong>) to access your emails on your phone instead of POP3. EAS keeps everything in sync between your phone and Hotmail, so whatever you do on your phone, like delete and email, add an appointment, or update
 one of your contacts with a new number, will also be reflected on the web, and vice-versa.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To prevent this incident in the future, please make sure that you have selected
<b><i>“Always leave a copy of the message on the server” </i></b><span>when you access your
</span>account using third party email client. </span></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the other hand, please be informed that users who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were sent notification messages concerning the upcoming upgrade. Accounts that were automatically

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can someone point me in the direction of the download for the NGSC client. I have followed the links from
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/</a> and eventually end up with onedrivesetup.exe that appears to load version 17.3.6281.1202 (taken from HKCU registry).</p>
<p>From this page <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 to date implying it is the old&nbsp;client.</p>
<p>If I follow the shortcut back to the program files I find it is running groove.exe not onedrive.exe.</p>
<p>I am getting very confused now so would appreciate any clarification.</p>

<p>Hi Baz:</p>
<p>From your description, you have downloaded and installed the correct version of OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client. The icon in task bar means that you are still running the legacy sync client and not using the new one.(To be clear, we can
 use both sync client on the same computer)</p>
<p>I find that you haven’t finished the <strong>setup process</strong> of new sync client. So please follow the detailed steps in the article to complete setup:

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the confirmation I was doing things correctly, I had followed the deployment pack including the registry keys. Re-reading the guide though I spotted that&nbsp;onedrive.exe was in fact loading into appdata, after failing to run it directly it occurred
 to me that because MS had combined the clients my GPO in Computer Configuration\Windows Components blocking Onedrive personal was kicking in.</p>
<p>I guess this is an unconsidered consequence of merging the two clients because previously I&nbsp;was blocking Onedrive personal whilst letting for business (aka Groove) remain available. Now this is sorted I can look at the ADMX to reinstate personal blocking.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Baz</p>

<h2>            Our subscription is being retired, really confused on the migration process. Anyone been through it&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">We're currently on a Office 365 Small Business Premium subscription that will expire at some point. I'm not sure when. But we can renew with one of the new plans at any point. Because we're using the old plan I cannot add an additional
 subscription and migrate my users one at a time. Instead I have to renew to the new plan meaning all users will have to convert over at the same time. Thankfully I only have 44 users, unfortunately I'm it for IT. From what I understand all users will have
 to reinstall office. I can't imagine what this is like for big orgs with hundreds of users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does anyone know when the plans actually expire? We're month to month currently and have been renewing without any issues.</li><li>How long after renewing to the new subscription do users have to reinstall office?</li><li>What is the retention rate for email? I don't think any of my users have email stored locally, but just in case I think they will lose that. I'll have backups before any of this is done.</li><li>Anything else others who have done this migration can point out? Any gotchas?</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I'm going to have to coordinate with 44 users spread across the US and Europe. I would love to do a test run on a separate account and build some documentation from that. As well as test the process myself. I discussed this in multiple
 support cases with Microsoft but each department only knows their small piece of the puzzle. Billing knows the subscription side, migration knows the technical side, office knows the product side, etc. There isn't one support person I can talk to that actually
 knows the whole process inside and out. And&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Renew-Office-365-small-and-midsized-business-subscriptions-afa5dee4-091d-4152-b849-6aef8463ca9c?CID=3d0e24de-7b01-4e45-815c-7e340d0d6712&amp;SrcID=MOP.CSR&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a>&nbsp;is

            <p>Hi Mikmeh,<br />
<br />
Here is the answer to your question:<br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1] Does anyone know when the plans actually expire? We're month to month currently and have been renewing without any issues.</span></em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You’ll be notifying by an email, when it’s time to take action. However, the Office 365 plan you’re on today (<em>Office 365 Small Business Premium</em>) is no longer available. Until an Office 365 Small Business Premium customer moves to the new plans,
 you will continue to receive all the benefits of Office 365, including any feature and security updates and any new services that Microsoft releases that are relevant to the subscription.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have Office 365 Small Business Premium product keys. You will be able to redeem keys to the old plans for renewal or to add licenses until
<strong>September 30, 2016</strong>. If you come up for renewal and still have an unused key to one of the old plans, you can use it to extend your current subscription. When you no longer have any old keys, you will renew to one of the new plans. For your
 reference: <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/moving-to-the-new-office-365-plans-for-small-and-midsized-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Guidance for renewing to the new plans</a><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2] How long after renewing to the new subscription do users have to reinstall office?</span></em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Action will depend upon which plan you are moving to:<br />
<br />
If you are moving to <strong>Office 365 Business </strong>or <strong>Office 365 Business Premium</strong>.<br />
&gt;All of your Office users will be prompted to update or reinstall Office between 1-3 days after renewal.<br />
&gt;Skype for Business users will need to sign in to the Office 365 portal and install the version of Skype for Business that comes with the new plan.
<br />
<br />
If you are moving to an enterprise plan (such as <strong>Office 365 Enterprise E3</strong>) or
<strong>Office 365 ProPlus</strong><br />
&gt;All of your Office users should first uninstall their current version of Office before installing the new version from the Office 365 portal.<br />
&gt;Skype for Business users will not have to reinstall it—it will be installed with the Office applications.<br />
<br />
For more detailed information, see under <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Renew-Office-365-small-and-midsized-business-subscriptions-afa5dee4-091d-4152-b849-6aef8463ca9c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What to expect for your end users after renewal</a><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3] What is the retention rate for email? I don't think any of my users have email stored locally, but just in case I think they will lose that. I'll have backups before any of this is done</span></em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Data will move automatically. If the services in the subscription that you move them to are the same or a higher version of the service, then the users will have access to the data after the switch. If you switch users to a subscription that doesn’t have
 the same data-related services as their current plan, they won’t be able to access the data that’s associated with those services after you’ve switched them to another plan, you might be able to

back up the data</a> for the services that you'll lose before you switch plans.<br />

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 830 and watch Garmin Epix</h2>
                    When I try connecting with Bluetooth watch Garmin Epix and Nokia Lumia 830 wp10, watch very quickly freezing. Nokia Lumia 830 is on Garmin list of compatible mobile phones&nbsp;who should work with Garmin Epix. I doubt that my wp10 is missing some update or
 this update is not given for my region (Croatia). My question is for Microsoft - can you doo something about this problem. Before&nbsp;I have android phone and watch worked fine with him.

<h2>            Read-only mode in Word 2016 &#40;Mac&#41; locks out any edits until Duplicated and saved&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why do all docs opened in read-only mode (like every attachment from Outlook) lock down the file for no editing until it is saved? The new error bar comes up and says Read Only: To Save a copy of this file, tap Duplicate. Then tapping the Duplicate button
 brings up a save dialog box. I definitely don’t want to save the dozens of attachments I access on a daily basis, but sometimes you want to tweak some spacing to print a resume or any other number of things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get that Outlook saves into the temp folder, and I've ensured there are read/write permissions on that folder. Is there a setting I'm missing to fix this? I can't tell if it's a bug or feature. Forcing a save first would be a new and rather invasive design
 choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else getting this behavior and find a fix?</p>

<p>I found a workaround to this issue.</p>
<p>I have a Mac with El Capitan (not relevant) and Office 2016. When I open a Word attachment from Outlook, it prompts to Duplicate which requires that I save it first in a non-temporary folder area before I can edit it.</p>
<p>My workaround is </p>
<p>1. open the email in Outlook.</p>
<p>2. You will see the attachment with a Word icon. Next to it is the PREVIEW button which uses the Mac's built-in Preview application. Click on the preview button to open it in the preview application.
</p>
<p>3. In the preview window in the upper right corner click on the OPEN IN WORD icon. It opens it in Word in edit mode without requiring a save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not find the problem or resolution to be related to illegal characters.It's a deliberate sandboxing issue which makes sense from a security and UI point of view. It is a pain but, was put in place deliberately for a reason. I only started to investigate
 it after one of my Mac users complained about the extra steps. The biggest pain for the person was saving to a non-temporary folder area. If it defaulted to DOWNLOADS or MY DOCUMENTS, then this would have been more palatable.</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have an RDS-based server for some of our co-workers to work on. On this server Office 365 is installed, with the SharedBasedComputer option turned on. Everyone on the server can use it, sign in, register it, it all works. But, Visio is also installed.
 Also the One-Click Visio Pro Retail edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was installed within the same .xml with the Office installer. In the registry I can see the MediaType is CDN, same as Office. And of course SharedComputerLicensing is set to 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for some reason, Visio does not recognize the license. The users have Visio Plan 2, so it should work for offline Visio, but it just says it is unlicensed. Anyone who knows what could solve this?</p>

<p>Hi Gloria,</p>
