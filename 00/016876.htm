<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Office 365, there is no such a service to not only connect third-party applications to Office 365 calendar but also let third-party application read data from Office 365 calendar.
 We can only <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-an-Internet-calendar-in-Outlook-Web-App-5de44446-aa16-4e8f-9ddd-84f170446226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Cell background color changes due to selection of dropdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lenny33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cell background color changes due to selection of dropdown</h2>
                    <p>I have seen code on various sites referencing either coloring a column of cells or coloring the type, but am working on a form where the user wants a dropdown as follows:
</p>
<p>1st position blank (am using two space bars so dropdown is blank until selected)
</p>
<p>2nd position is R (Red) </p>
<p>3rd position is Y (Yellow) and last position is </p>
<p>4th position is G (Green) In the dropdowns neutral state, the cell color is null or white or no color
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If "R" is slected, the cell turns red If "Y" is selected, the cell turns yellow and If "G" is selected, the cell turns green The 2003 code I used in an earlier version of Word is erroring out big time (Currently on Word 2010 on System 7) Since this dropdown
 replicates itself in a number of cells and I will have to reference each new position, I have left the default naming convention of "Dropdown1, Dropdown2"... etc. alone as a bookmark.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the TableCell Macro to determine the cell reference, I have ascertained that the first affected instance is in Table 3, Cell D2. In the code, does this translate into ActiveDocument.Tables (3).Cell(4, 2).Shading.BackgroundPatternColor = wdColorRed
 ? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See my sample code below... </p>
<p>Sub ColorCell() </p>
<p>With ActiveDocument </p>
<p>If .FormFields("Dropdown1").DropDown.Value = "R" Then </p>
<p>ActiveDocument.Tables(3).Cell(4, 2).Shading.BackgroundPatternColor = wdColorRed
</p>
<p>Else </p>
<p>ActiveDocument.Tables(3).Cell(4, 2).Shading.BackgroundPatternColor = wdColorWhite
</p>
<p>End If </p>
<p>End With </p>
<p>End Sub </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cell D2 or .Cell(4, 2) is my target cell, but can the cell the dropdown be the target cell?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards - Lenny33 </p>

<p>Our staff has been receiving a large amount of emails being kicked back as though our recipients are recognizing our emails as spam. &nbsp;This issue has not been prevalent throughout the company until recently. &nbsp;I've attached a screen shot with the error message,

 says that it's on the recipients end, but we've been emailing people we've been in contact with via email previously. &nbsp;This leads us to believe it is not on their end and on our end. &nbsp;Is there some maintenance work or something else being done to affect how
 other domains are receiving out emails? &nbsp;I'd say this happens to maybe 10% of our emails going out.</span></p>

 It's possible it's a temporary issue with their email system. Try to resend the message. If the problem continues, contact the recipient by some other means (by phone for example) and ask them to tell their email admin about the problem. Be sure to give them
 the error above, as it will better help them diagnose the problem.</span></p>

This error is being returned by the recipient's email system but it doesn't include a valid, specific, enhanced SMTP status code, making it difficult to assess exactly what the problem is. Please carefully examine the error reported by the recipient's email
 system to help diagnose and troubleshoot the problem. Only the recipient's email admin will be able to fix this.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, I’d like to collect some information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Does the issue occur when you send emails to all recipients in that organization?<br />
2.&nbsp;Do you have any issues when sending emails to others?<br />
3.&nbsp;Can you provide the full non-delivery (NDR) report? To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message：</p>

<p>1. Yes. &nbsp;(ex. <em>(removed by moderator to protect your privacy)</em> is a domain that seems to be kicking back our emails. &nbsp;They are a frequent target of our emails.</p>
<p>2. Not all domains are kicking back out emails.</p>
<p>3. I responded to your message with the domain.</p>
<p>The previous representative stated that we need to have the companies that are kicking back out emails change their settings. &nbsp;How would this make sense if we've frequently sent/received emails from many other clients with the same domain up to now?</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>I have checked all NDR and noticed that emails have been delivered from Office 365 servers. Based on the error message, the issue is related to recipient’s side. I understand that you can email them before. Since the configuration of email system may be
 changed at any time by recipient’s admin or mail providers, given the situation, we suggest you contact the recipient’s admin or their mail providers. Based on my experience, you can let their admin check related rules or block list. If they have any 3rd party
 mail filters, they can also check it and add your domain to the white list to check whether there is any improvement.</p>
<p>If you need any other information from Office 365, please feel free to let us know. Your understating is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

            <p>Hi Perry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows phone only displays email currently available on the server. It does not download and store mails locally the way a PC mail program often does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue of disappearing mail is typically caused by a PC that fetch and delete mail on the server, so I suggest adjust the settings on the PC to suit your preferences. The option is usually found somewhere in the account settings in the PC mail program
 as 'Delete mail on the server after ...'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps?</p>

            Kindly check if the Background Intelligent Transfer Service is started. To do this you need to open the Services Console.
<br />
<br />
If you are using Vista or Windows 7 go to&gt;Start Search&gt;Type Services.msc&gt;hit Enter.<br />
If you are on XP, go to RUN&gt;Type Services.msc&gt;hit OK.<br />
<br />
In the Services Console look for Background Intelligent Transfer Service. See if it is on Automatic or Manual (Default).
<br />
If it says Disabled, double click on it and Modify the Start-up Type as Automatic or Manual. Try to Start the service.<br />
<br />
If turning or starting the service returns an error for 1053, kindly reboot then check if you can update.<br />

    <title>OneDrive for Business a complete and utter failure&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seangarland- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive for Business a complete and utter failure&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a question for all the MSFT support people on this forum. &nbsp;Does Microsoft even use Microsoft products internally? &nbsp;or is the entire business run by using open source, or other non-Microsoft products? &nbsp;I ask this because I use Microsoft products daily,
 and am regretting it more and more. &nbsp;I recommend the purchase of AND spend a TON of money on MS products even as a "partner". &nbsp;Every new release of any of their products contains more bugs than the previous one. &nbsp;The solution is typically as you see in one
 of the early replies to this thread - about 10 steps, sign in, sign out, stop processes with task manager, clear cache, delete accounts, recreate, uninstall re-install...</p>
<p>I don't know about MS employees, or the corporate guys up top, or even people in this thread, but I don't have time to *** around with my system every day for a few hours, trying to get a "paid" RTM product to work. &nbsp;This also includes all the productivity
 killers that are introduced in each release that I have to find work arounds for... &nbsp;I have thought recently about putting up a "why I hate Microsoft products" site, but don't think anyone at MS will care enough to ever find or read it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One such product, OneDrive for Business, has been broken since day one. &nbsp;I have moved customers to it, and regretted it with constant problems with syncing. &nbsp;I tried to use the "Sharepoint Sites" and libraries to "share" files between business members, which
 fails miserably... &nbsp;Now we have a new onedrive sync client, which doesn't update automatically, doesn't support "sites" and doesn't support Windows 8.1 (uh, all of my stuff is on 8.1 now)... &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the existing client, I have just finished a battle with the "</p>
The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version of Office.
<p>Error discussed in this&nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/p/424931/1091090&nbsp;forum. &nbsp;After getting my computer to finally stop popping up this error, I thought I was okay. &nbsp;I modified some files, and BAM!
 &nbsp;No more syncing again. &nbsp;I have been waiting days now for 59 files to sync. &nbsp;They won't, no error, no nothing. &nbsp;Just won't sync. &nbsp;I'm reaching the end of any rope I once had... &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft please READ and attempt to respond!</p>
<p>I would like to know what the plan for OneDrive for Business is, and a time frame for rollout. &nbsp;In the meantime, I'd like to either be reimbursed for a portion of my O365 fees, such that I can move over to Dropbox or Google Drive until you actually have
 a working product!!!!, or just simply provided with a free account somewhere with a product that works. &nbsp;I would recommend some products you could buy in-house to do what Onedrive for Business won't do, but I'd be afraid that MS would buy it, and break it...
 &nbsp;so just please fix your product(s) or provide me with an alternative as part of my subscription!</p>
<p>Since I'm on Windows 8.1, I cannot use the next gen client, which only sort of bridges the gap. &nbsp;Why can't you develop an app that just works? &nbsp;Google did it with Google Drive, Dropbox has had it for years now with it's system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I (try to) keep 4 computers in sync with OneDrive for Business. &nbsp;I was out of town yesterday, and attempted to access the files I worked on yesterday morning on a desktop - NOPE - they aren't syncing. &nbsp;AGAIN. &nbsp;Instead I had to run TeamViewer, and do a file
 transfer to get the files from my OD4B directory on my Desktop, to my OD4B directory on my Surface. &nbsp;Thanks MS.</p>
<p>Also - I could update to Windows 10 on my desktop, but not on my netbook nor my Surface Pro 3 (without complete rebuild, and even then it might not work according to the internets) nor would it make sense on my other laptop. &nbsp;So that isn't a workable solution.
 &nbsp;I'm just screwed.</p>
<p>One VERY FRUSTRATED PARTNER!!!</p>

<p>I can't really help except to suggest submitting a service request &nbsp;- not to get the problem fixed (which never seems to happen) but to validate your request for a refund. For what it's worth, &nbsp;I don't think the problem with ODFB is the sync client itself
 - the problem (and with Sharepoint Online in general) is ... Sharepoint. It's an antiquated, legacy technology that wasn't developed for and is not well suited to the cloud. Msft is milking it for all it's worth but ultimately until they replace the core platform,
 it's unlikely to improve.</p>

<p>This is also my experience, this has been unacceptable for some time now with no action.</p>
<p>Having to clear out cached files for clients constantly so they then have to start all over again is not practical &amp; most of them are starting to ask for alternative's, no one can blame them as the product should not be in the market in it's current form.</p>

<p>Is there a place where MSFT employees/product managers would actually see our complaints? &nbsp;I've been directed to the stupid onedrive suggestions page, which is absolutely ridiculous. &nbsp;Most of the stuff on there would be neat, but doesn't address the primary
 goal (as I see it) of the software, or what (at least) I'm trying to do which is eliminate servers for small clients, and provide syncing/protection for all (I use, well try to use this to keep 4 computers files in sync).</p>
<p>I think MS has missed the point with their own products, which is why I asked if they even use their own products. &nbsp;If the product doesn't (hasn't ever) work, then pull it from market. &nbsp;If it's supposed to do x, y, and z - then develop that (the next gen
 client doesn't support Windows 8.1, nor team sites)...</p>
<p>I don't ever feel like anyone at MSFT reads these that often, and if they do they just choose from the list of answers and paste.. &nbsp;I doubt any product manager knows that their PARTNERS are out here struggling to make it work. &nbsp;Or even how the product is
 marketed, or how we're trying to make it work...</p>

<p>One thing Msft is expert at is fending off criticism and protecting employees from user experiences. A brief read in this forum makes it more than obvious that O365 isn't built for the real world and certainly isn't tested in it.</p>
<p>An example: 3 months AFTER Msft acknowledged a confirmed bug I'd reported in a service request, I got a phone call from them saying they still weren't sure if they were going to fix it. That's the arrogance of a monopoly that hopefully soon they won't be
 able to afford. &nbsp;</p>

                    I have just updated to the new November 2015 updates for Office 365. I can't seem to find the "Morph" transition in PowerPoint. I also tried reinstalling Office to see if that would do anything, to no avail. Is there something I am missing? Am I leaping

<h2>            Not able to connect to MSN account via Iphone 8 Mail app</h2>
                    <p>I had my Mail on my&nbsp;IPhone 8&nbsp;set to my Outlook.com email account (msn.com).&nbsp;&nbsp; Since yesterday, I can no longer send&nbsp;emails&nbsp;and my phone mail is not syncing to my MSN account.&nbsp; This is the mail app that comes with the IPhone, not the Outlook app.&nbsp; I get the
 message that it is not connecting to the server or cannot get mail, the connection to the service failed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the account in settings and started all over again and get the same&nbsp;results.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot even download my old mail that is in my folders so I have no access to them on my mobile device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a known issue that&nbsp;IPhone users are having problems connecting to the server and getting emails and sending emails?&nbsp; This just occurred and nothing I do changes the error messages that I am getting.&nbsp; It is very frustrating not to be able to download
 my old emails in my folders or to send emails or receive them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is not an Apple issue because my husband has the identical phone and has is email on his phone the same way I have mine and he has no problem getting into any of his folders or sending emails from his phone.</p>

<p>Hi Darlene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Upon reviewing your case, we can see here that you are having issues sending emails and syncing your account. After further validation, the recent launch for iOS11 and their built-in Apple mail app has incompatibility issue with Outlook.com Office 365/Exchange

            This error (805a01f4) usually indicates temporary problems with the store. Hopefully they are working to fix the certificate error 80070020 which affected hundreds of users. You need to wait for a few hours.

<h2>            outlook 2013 stops syncing with Exchange online</h2>
                    
<p>we have 2 incidents in two different users' accounts. both of them are using outlook 2013 x64 and they have a mailbox larger than 35Gb. Outlook suddenly stops syncing, saying that it is connecting to Exchange online but it is updated more a couple hours
 ago. I did press Send/Receive and i restart PC and Outlook without any success. However the problem is resolved when i moved emails from the main mailbox to online archive. this shouldn't happen since they can have a mailbox of 50GB. what can we do so this
 can be resolved?</p>

<p>hi sis01kn,</p>
<p>from the description, i understand that 2 different users’ account whose mailbox are larger than 35gb sync to exchange online very slow.</p>
<p>generally, there are many factors that can affect the office 365 account to sync&nbsp;to exchange online such as network connectivity, mailbox size, message size, etc.</p>
<p>in this scenario, please try syncing to exchange online in the outlook online mode. below are the detailed steps of how to turn on the outlook online mode:</p>
<p>1. click <strong>file</strong> &gt; <strong>account settings</strong> &gt; <strong>account settings…</strong></p>
<p>2. double click the mailbox, untick the <strong>use cached exchange mode</strong> box.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=57f0dbaf-f3ec-4722-bb1a-a65f7982b522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d57f0dbaf-f3ec-4722-bb1a-a65f7982b522" /></a></p>
<p>3. click <strong>next</strong>.</p>
<p>if the issue persists after syncing to exchange online under the outlook online mode, please try&nbsp;switching to a better network environment to sync to exchange online.</p>
<p>once you get any updates, please don't hesitate to post back.</p>
<p>best regards,</p>
<p>mouran</p>

<p>the problem isn't that the connection to the Exchange online is very slow. Outlook says that it is connected to the exchange but no new emails are coming and also it shows that the last updated was a couple hours ago. We actually use Cached Exchange mode
 to cache all the emails but i didn't see any different by disactivating it. As i wrote before, the users started to get new emails when i move emails from their mailboxes to their online archive.</p>

<p>Hi Sis01kn,</p>
<p>I’ve run a test from my side. Here are my test result: If a user sends emails to a large mailbox when it’s downloading old emails from Exchange online, the new emails will not reach the inbox immediately. But after the old emails are downloaded completely
 from the Exchange online, the new emails will arrive at the inbox. This seems to be an expected behavior on the Outlook client side.</p>
<p>We recommended you using OWA (Outlook Web App) during the Outlook client downloading the old emails.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chee Loon</p>

Are you using a browser to access your email?&nbsp; If so you have outlook.com and there isnt a version to it since it is not installed on your computer<br />
<br />
If you arent using a browser you are either using Microsoft office (outlook) or an email client like Outlook express(XP), windows mail(Vista) or windows live mail(win 7 &amp;8)<br />
<br />
Can you give us more information?<br />

    <title>Microsoft Access can&#39;t set the LimitToList property to No right - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank cheeseman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Access can&#39;t set the LimitToList property to No right now.</h2>
                    I've google'd and read a couple of (virtually identical) articles regarding this, but don't see how it can be fixed.<br />
I have columns in a table and fields on a form that are connected to lookup fields (that shouldn't have been implemented that way).<br />
It seems that if I could set <strong>LimitToList</strong> as 'No', we'd be back in business.&nbsp; When I try, the subject error occurs.&nbsp; The full text is:<br />
<br />
<p>Microsoft Access can't set the LimitToList property to No right now.<br />
The first visible column, which is determined by the ColumnWidths property isn't equal to the bound column.<br />
Adjust the ColumnWidths property first, and then set the LimitToList property.</p>
<br />
The articles I've read seem to say that this is a designed behaviour, and can be relieved by making "the first visible column in the combo box the bound column,
<strong>OR</strong> if you set <strong>ColumnWidths</strong> to <span>0";1".<br />
<br />
Neither of these seems to work for me.&nbsp; The <strong>BoundColumn</strong> is 1 (0 is not allowed), and the widths
<strong>are </strong></span><span>0";1".</span> <span><br />
<br />
What next?&nbsp; I have at least three columns in my table that really need to escape the bondage of the lookup list.<br />
(The database, a contact book, is no longer a collection of many people from a few companies &amp; sites - I need to freely add companies &amp; sites as easily as people, as the contact database grows)<br />
Thx&amp;Rgds,<br />

            0) Thanks for the fast feedback!<br />
1) Thought so.<br />
2) Read that, agree, but didn't see a smooth fix available (spent most of today looking for the 'best' way to flatten out lookup content as automatically as possible)<br />
<br />
Do you have a recommendation for how best to get rid of unwanted lookups?&nbsp; I can query to a new table, but don't know how to correctly preserve the lookup relationships in fields that are ok as they are (and manually search-replacing of IDs with full labels
 on the resulting tables seems a bit kludgy).<br />
<br />
3) We're using Access 2007, though the original designer chose to store as .mdb (presumably compatibility-worried at the time).&nbsp; The connection between companies &amp; sites &amp; this is that the database is a contact list (very like the 'Evil' example) originally
 built to track contacts at 5 organizations in 7 locations (so implementer used a 'picking' approach on several fields I'd rather now have a 'raw entry' approach).<br />
<br />
PS:FIX FOUND!<br />
This article showed me the way:<br />

<h2>            Not Secure https&#58;&#47;&#47;outlook.live.com&#47;......</h2>
                    Why does the website address say Not Secure when I am in my email account? (see subject)&nbsp; I am using Windows 10, Microsoft Edge, and have Norton.&nbsp; I have tried to disable Windows Defender so it won't conflict with Norton Security although I am not sure
 that I did it correctly.&nbsp; This is new.&nbsp; I have just started noticing it in the last month or so. What does this really mean and how do I fix it? I have not noticed this when I am on other websites.

<br />This sounds like there is mixed content - a script or image usually, that is not using HTTPS. Best guess is something - possibly your isp or a browser plugin, is injecting something into the page. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Does it come up all the time or just occasionally? If you aren't using the premium or ad-free version it could be an ad that triggers it.

I turned all the add-ins off but it didn't help. I didn't do a fresh install because I don't know how.

<p>I too have the same problem (sorry to butt in on the original post) - I use 'live' account and a gmail account and it doesn't show on my gmail a/c so I'm not convinced it's an ISP or browser plug in problem. I don't have a 'premium' subscription so do MS
 allow ads that cause it on a non-'premium' a/c?...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Build 10525 not available for Windows 10 Education</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Windows Insider since the very first builds back on October and I've installed all of the subsequent Windows 10 builds until the 10240 build which was the latest one. Then, when on DreamSpark they made available the Education edition I chose to upgrade
 my Windows 10 Professional to Education by changing the product key. All worked flawlessly and I was still set to receive Insider Builds. In fact I even have installed the Insider Hub.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with the release of Windows 10 Insider 10525 that build seems to not be available for Windows 10 Education but my other laptop which I haven't yet upgraded to the Education version does show the 10525 Professional build. My guess is that only those with
 the Professional build will get the Insider Builds even when my edition is still set to receive Insider Builds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to continue using Insider Builds but I which to maintain my Education edition installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

            I'd like to hear an answer on this as well. Prior to Win10's release I could usually get new builds in a matter of hours. Since activating my Education key, I haven't been offered either Build 10525 or 10532.

            Then why do we have the option to get Insider Builds and we can also use the Insider Hub and Windows Feedback as being a Windows Insider? It doesn't make sense and I believe Microsoft should clarify this. If this is indeed the case I will reinstall my
 machine with the DreamSpark Pro key, of course loosing all the Education/Enterprise features

</p><p>Please don't interpret this message as badgering. &nbsp;I'm just trying to get final resolution on the issue as to whether a fully activated Windows 10 Education Edition can migrate to the Insider Preview program and receive preview builds. &nbsp;You say "no" in this
 post, but is that an official MS decision, or is that your understanding of the situation. &nbsp;I've been with the Insider Program from the beginning, but recently</p>
<p>did a clean install of Windows 10 Education Edition, Build 10586.63, on four machines. &nbsp;All have</p>
<p>MS logins and all have been toggled to receive Preview Builds. &nbsp;The machines tell me that I'm all</p>
<p>set to receive new builds, but your post says that despite what the dialog is telling me, I'll never</p>
<p>receive Insider builds. &nbsp; &nbsp;Please note that all four of these machines have been on Preview builds</p>
<p>from the beginning, and I've done clean installs every time an iso comes available. &nbsp;Previously,</p>
<p>I had no problem migrating the machines to receive the insider builds. &nbsp;But something must</p>
<p>have changed lately, say since the fall. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a professor and we get the Education Edition two different ways: &nbsp;Dreamspark with a stand-alone
</p>
<p>license key and, alternatively as an iso which has to be activated through our campus kms server.</p>
<p>Previously, I went that route which meant that every time a new build came along, I had to</p>
<p>reactivate, a bit of a pain. &nbsp;Now maybe even that option is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just looking for answers.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>What I am saying is that I believe that Education and Enterprise Editions don't receive new builds through the regular Insider program but through the organization that owns the license and gives you the KMS key. &nbsp;So far as I know only Home and Pro users
 get insider builds automatically by simply connecting to the internet. &nbsp;This is probably controlled by a registry setting. &nbsp;Whether or not a Home or Pro user gets new insider builds is controlled that way so you may want to explore how that works for Education
 users &nbsp;&nbsp;Are there Dreamspark forums available to you? &nbsp;If so, I'll bet someone in a forum like that has it figured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't speak for Microsoft. &nbsp;No one in the forums speaks officially for Microsoft, although Microsoft employees may reference official sources from time to time when they answer questions in the forums. &nbsp;It seems Microsoft Legal has a thing about who can
 make official (i.e., binding) statements and in which venues such statements can be made.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Problems getting external data from Access into Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems getting external data from Access into Excel</h2>
                    <p>I can't refresh an&nbsp;Excel&nbsp;pivot table linked to a MS Access database on my Desktop.&nbsp; The database was created on someone else's Desktop and copy/pasted to my Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the connection properties to replace the other users path so the path is pointed at my desktop but am unable to change.&nbsp; I have also tried Browse to identify the Database which now resides on my Desktop unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test, I tried creating a brand new database with a Test table; when I try to link to this table in Excel using the External Data Source as Access I get the same result, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally I would expect to see a listing of all available objects to link to in the database but in either case I don't even see the dialog box; nothing results, only a blank Excel tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an Option selection issue or possibly a Driver issue?&nbsp; Has anyone resolved a similar issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
                </div>

            I can't replicate your problem. Maybe you need to run an Office Repair from the Control Panel&gt;Programs &amp; Features. Be sure to reboot after you run the Repair...just in case.

            <p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>My suggestion is to use the import&nbsp;function in the Access 2003 to accomplish your goal.</p>
<p>Follow the steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Open the destination database. Make sure the database is not read-only, and that you have permissions to make changes to the database.<br />
2.&nbsp;On the File menu, point to Get External Data, and then click Import.<br />
3.&nbsp;In the Import dialog box, in the Files of type box, select Microsoft Excel.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click the arrow to the right of the Look in box, select the drive and folder where the worksheet file is located, and then double-click its icon.<br />
5.&nbsp;Follow the directions in the Import Spreadsheet Wizard dialog boxes.<br />
You can select the file in the Wizard, and you also can select which sheet in the file you want to import.<br />
When the import operation is complete, you will see a message that informs you of the status of the operation. If there were errors, Access creates an error log table in the database and displays the name of the table in the message.<br />
6.&nbsp;Review the imported data and the error log table and take corrective action</p>
<p>For more detail steps, please refer to the link, and there are also other ways to bring Excel data to Access:<br />

    <title>Microsoft Office Losing NTFS Permissions and Ownership - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephens3350  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office Losing NTFS Permissions and Ownership</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The issue I am having is difficult to replicate. Several users' files completely lose NTFS permissions and ownership after saving or making a change to a Word document or PowerPoint file (I assume Excel as well, but we do not use it that much). If they try
 to save the file again or try to open it from "Recent Documents", they receive a message that says "File could not be located or Access Denied". Once the permissions and ownership is lost, it looks as though the file was deleted. In reality, they just can't
 see it because they don't have permissions.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The only way to recover it is for me to login to the file server. I then have to locate the file and take ownership as an administrator. Once I take ownership and add even just 1 account back to the security, all of the original permissions repopulate and everything
 is fine.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
From looking at my Object Audits, it appears that when the user saves the file, the temporary file that is created does not copy over the permissions from the original file, thus resulting in lost persmissions.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This has only happened ever since we installed new desktop computers with Windows 10 and Office 2016. I have also upgraded our File Server from 2008 to 2012.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I believe this has something to do with Office 2016 because the computers with that version are primarily used by our students, who are the ones experiencing the issue. Our teachers and staff use Windows 7 and Office 2013 and have not had any issues.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Is there any way to prevent the temporary file created when saving from losing all of the permissions and ownership from the original file?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Stephens,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address your issue on NTFS permissions, may we know the type of permission that was set on each affected files? For further isolation, have you tried using Office 2016 on a Windows 7 machine?</p>

            As for Office 2016 on Windows 7, I do have a select few computers with it installed, but have yet to have any issues with them. The only files affected are Office files. I haven't seen this happening with any 3rd party files or any files outside of Office.

            <p>Is this issue being caused by only one user on the network? Can you play around with a dummy file, and change permission settings to that file for a particular user/s, who can still edit and save the file, and see if changing it will make a difference?<br />

<p>I did had the same Issue on my DFS Server</p>
<p>In order to keep NTFS rights on my file, i had to put rights on the folder where the file was located and active inheritance on files and subfolders</p>
<p>If i just put rights on the file, every new save of the file in office was changing the rights of the file from those of the folder because the owner of the file was changing at this very moment</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it's a mess.<br />
We can mostly reproduce the Problem but what we have found out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It only happens with existing files never with new created ones</p>
<p>- It only happens with files that are placed directly in the root of the permissions tree</p>
<p>When you create a sub folder and place the file there it does not happen</p>

            <p>I noticed something strange this morning after creating some folders to move files into to test what you are seeing. I created the folders on the server and moved the files and then accessed the share via UNC from my workstation, and what I saw did not match
 the contents of the folder. I hit refresh and nothing happened, after about 5 mins I hit refresh again and the folders were the same.</p>

    <title>Merging Multiple Contacts in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sammiblinkchick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging Multiple Contacts in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I have one file of over 11,000 contacts that I need to have consolidated. There are a number of duplicate contacts, but the lines are not identical. So despite being the same email for instance, maybe the address or the source of the contact is on line 1
 while line 2 has those fields blanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not something I can tackle line by line and it is not something the merge duplicates will work for. I need to figure out how to do this consolidation in bulk because I then have to cross check this 11,000 contact file against 20 other files once
 the contacts are merged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<br />
<br />Hello SAMMIBLINKCHICK
<br />
<br />This is not an answer that you want to hear but based on your description, there is no foolproof way to accomplish what you want to do for one very important reason, which that you need at least one rule (or set of rules) to follow as to how things "should be merged",  Without that, how would an automated process determine what data to choose.
<br />
<br />For instance, you mentioned that in one case you could have two identical email addresses but the fields in the second field are blank and populated in the first record. Take another two records and reverse which of the records have populated and un-populated. Which is the most accurate in each case - the first or second record?
<br />
<br />The other key question is "what actually constitutes a "duplicate" contact? Is it jsut the email address or email address/firstname/lastname or account# (if it exists) or email address/company name/last name etc etc (you get the idea).
<br />
<br />One the issue of defining a duplicate is resolved, the next issue is "which record" contains the most accurate data. One thing dealing with fields that are blank but what about when all records contain values? 
<br />
<br />I could go on but I hope you get what I'm trying to convey. If you can't define the rules you want something to follow, there's no way a "bulk process" can be successfully completed. Comes down to how accurate you want the final result to be. Once you have some rules defined and depending on what those rules are, would submit that using Microsoft Access would be a far superior choice to get to where you want to be.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Email address would be the merging point of reference. If the contact has the same email the rest of the information should be consolidated into one of the lines with said email
        </p>

            Given that, one way to accomplish that would be
<br />
<br />#1 - Save the data as a csv file
<br />#2 - From within Outlook, create a new contact folder
<br />#3 - Import the CSV file into the new contact folder using the Outlook import wizard and set the option to "replace duplicate with items imported"
<br />
<br />The above is not a merge but at least you'll end up with only one contact record per email address.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, you are more then welcome to try the ContactGenie Duplicates Remover which has "merge functionality". Note the program is now discontinued  but will gladly provide you with a license to see if it works for you (program would be provided "as-is" - it will either work for you or it won't). If interested, send me an email to &lt;karl @ claxton.com&gt; and include a link to this thread.

    <title>multilevel list duplicate numbers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            multilevel list duplicate numbers</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Could someone assist me with the best way to achieve using the same number twice in a multilevel list. We have a number of documents where content needs to be manually removed depending on circumstance. I want to achieve the example below:</p>
<p>1 main point</p>
<p>1.1 sub point</p>
<p>(i) item one</p>
<p>(ii) item two - option 1</p>
<p>(ii) item two - option 2</p>
<p>(iii) item three</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            This is the sort of situation in which manual numbering might make more sense than auto numbering, but what you could try is to create a new style identical to but not based on the numbered style, with the same hanging indent but no numbering. Then insert
 a cross-reference to the number of the relevant paragraph as the number of this paragraph and follow it with a space or tab to match the numbered paragraphs. Cross-references do not update dynamically (as soon as the referenced number changes), but they do
 update automatically when you update fields (as by printing or switching to Print Preview).

    <title>Windows phone music management is very frustrating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macfast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows phone music management is very frustrating</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I have a Windows phone, Nokia Lumia 928 with Windows Phone 8.0.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I’ve had it for about a year and finally decided to transfer my music library and playlists so I could stop carrying the phone and my IPod touch around.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Unfortunately I find the process of managing music on the Windows phone to be unbelievably clunky and trouble prone. I’ll describe in the hopes someone can help.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>1. I’m using Windows Media Player.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I pointed it to my ITunes folder and it found and indexed all the music in there.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>2. I plug in the Windows phone and the computer sees it but Media Player doesn’t.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Did some trial and error.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Apparently I have to have the phone plugged in and unlocked before I start Media Player.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Did this and Media Player sees it.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Is that really the way it has to be done?</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>ITunes doesn’t require this with my IPod. (That will be a continuing refrain)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>3. Sync’d my music library to the phone.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So far so good.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>4. Created a smart playlist containing some, but not all, of the songs already sync’d to the phone.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Tried to Sync it.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Not enough room.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>5. Created two test playlists with same two songs each.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Sync’d to phone.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Sync’d OK but now have 3 copies of these songs on my phone.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Apparently every time a playlist is added it recopies the songs to the phone.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>That’s why there wasn’t enough room for the initial smart playlist.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>That doesn’t make sense.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Is there a way around it?</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>(Doesn’t happen in ITunes)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>6. Tried to delete the test playlists from the phone.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Can’t find a way to.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>No apparent delete function on the phone.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>They don’t appear in the phone tree in Media Player.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>How do I delete them?</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Will the duplicated songs also be deleted? (Not a problem in ITunes)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>7. Tried using the Windows Phone desktop software, which is supposed to integrate with I tunes.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I checked only one playlist, on the Phone interface, not ITunes.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It tried to sync everything, music, audiobooks, videos.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Basically the interface was useless.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This is all very frustrating.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It appears that Microsoft has once again released an incomplete product and is using its customers as beta testers.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If this can’t be resolved I’m going to an IPhone when my contract is up.</span></span></p>

<p>That's actually your first problem. While you can get that to work, it is not how it is intended. WMP has always been able to work with external devices that look like USB drives. That was for earlier PMPs (Portable Media Players) or just thumb drives you
 could stick in a car stereo. Windows Phone's appearance as a USB drive, of sorts, is somewhat of a concession.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Media Management for a Windows Phone is intended to be done using the WP Connection &nbsp;application appropriate for your OS. You can find and get to the right one at&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/basics/sync-my-windows-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sync my Windows Phone</a>
<p>I won't try to say this will solve all your issues/complaints, but it should be a start, as it is the intended way to do this. WMP working, sort of, is sort of incidental.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. yes, you do need to unlock the WP for the PC to see anything on it. I am a bit surprised you need to do it before connecting. Watch the device when you plug it in and see if it doesn't pop up the unlock screen when you do that for a short period, to
 prompt you. &nbsp;Thinking about it, you don't want people to be able to bypass your device lock by just plugging the device into a PC, so it needs to be unlocked.</p>

<p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>I live in Singapore and my account profile is set as Singapore. I called up Microsoft Singapore and was informed that I will not be able access Office Web Apps if the system has any Microsoft Office package installed. However I tried on another system later
 without Microsoft Office but still cannot use the Office Web Apps!</p>
<p>The 1st system is with Windows Vista(32bits) and ie8 with Office2003 installed.</p>
<p>The 2nd system is with Window7(32bits) and ie8, without any Office application.</p>
<p>Last tried using a iphone to access and I can use the Office Web Apps.</p>
<p>Strange!</p>

<p>Hi Tan Hun Beng,</p>
<p>From what I can tell, given the list above, the Office Web Apps have not been deployed to Singapore yet. &nbsp;As such, customers in that region (such as yourself) will be unable to access the Office Web Apps on SkyDrive. &nbsp;That said, as occurred during the earlier
 blog post, the Office Web Apps team is constantly working to increase the number of markets they support.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am unsure of where the Microsoft Singapore representative is getting their information, but I can tell you with the utmost confidence that the Office Web Apps work fine with Microsoft Office already on your computer. &nbsp;While the Office Web
 Apps do not <em>require</em>&nbsp;that Microsoft Office is installed,&nbsp;some functionality (namely Open in Client) only works with Microsoft Office 2003 (or later) on your computer.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your quick response.</p>
<p>In fact, I was rather doubtful when I heard from the Microsoft representative of not able to access Office Web Apps if you have Microsoft Office installed in that machine. Then I thought since it is coming from a Microsoft representative, I shall take his
 word for it. Well, thanks for the update, at least now I know it has nothing to do with Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>Any idea when Office Web Apps will be deploy in Singapore?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>HB</p>
