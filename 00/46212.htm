<h2>            internet backgammon stopped working</h2>
                    I have been playing internet backgammon regularly since having my laptop with Windows 7 installed many months ago. It has suddenly stopped working, when I click on the icon, the gameboard does not appear anymore. Have you got a solution or explanation
 to this problem? Thanks!

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Suddenly Slow and Buggy</h2>
                    Starting this past Thursday October 8th, my Microsoft Edge app&nbsp;started having issues loading and displaying large webpages such as Facebook, Tumblr, and YouTube. It also takes longer to start up, and navigating through the Hub or opening Settings is nearly
 impossible. I have run a virus scan, run the maintenance task, cleared the cache and other app data (which took a while because it kept crashing), and cleaned out my hard drive a bit, but nothing has fixed the problem. I have noticed that when I have these
 issues the Task Manager reports that System, Service Host: Local Service, Antimalware Service Executable, Service Host: Unistack Service Group, Host Process for Windows Task, and Microsoft OneDrive all go crazy using up tons of CPU and Disk especially. Oftentimes
 something random will jump in like Store Background&nbsp;Task or Photos Background Task as if I were leaving my computer idle.&nbsp;Also I've noticed that Edge takes up a lot more RAM since the problem began (and not j

            Thank you for your response. I have not been getting any error messages. The day before this problem began, I installed DwimPerl, WinSCP, and Notepad++, and the&nbsp;Programs and Features panel&nbsp;says that several Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable packages
 were installed, though I had no hand in that. I uninstalled and deleted all file data from DwimPerl and WinSCP, but the problem persists. All Windows Updates have been installed, and every driver on my computer is up to date (except for the Intel one that
 causes that awful sleep bug). The troubleshooter you linked to detected no issues.

            <p>I've been having the same issue.&nbsp; I just found on another thread that someone thought this&nbsp;could be&nbsp;related to their anti-virus software.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just checked for updates on Norton 360, it downloaded and installed and now my internet connection seems to be back

            After another week of troubleshooting, I finally cleared up the issue. I ended up opening my event log and seeing a bunch of alerts that I had a bad sector in my drive. So I ran dskchk to fix and restore data, but halfway through it gave me the error (766f6c756d652e63
 461). I fixed this problem by using the restorehealth function on DISM. I ran dskchk to completion, and now my computer works fine. I'm not sure if the problem was with&nbsp;my Windows 10 image or with my disk, but it was one of those two.

            What I'd recommend doing is trying to run in an elevated command prompt dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth and then dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth. If it&nbsp;reports file corruption, you can use dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth to
 fix it.&nbsp;It takes a while, but this fixed&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;for me.

<h2>            Radeon Settings&#58; Host Application has stopped working...</h2>
                    <p>For the last few days to a week, I've been getting the error of the "host application" of my card drive stop running. I got the same problem with Catalyst and now with Crimson.<br />
</p>
<p>Only now, with Crimson, it shows another error beforehand: http://prntscr.com/9ghare
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed as well, and I'm not sure it's related, but I suspect it is, is that the CPU usage has been going up to 90%-100% when when there are no programs running. (except for a few in the background)</p>
<p>
</p><p>if it helps, here are my specs:</p>
<p>AMD R9 200 series GPU</p>
<p>Intel 2-core 3.0GHz CPU (Overclocked to about 4.0GHz)</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
<p>300GB Storage (Partition of 500GB HDD)</p>
<p>

<h3> ktreyes  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot detect wireless connection</h2>
                    
<p>I have a wireless modem set up and other laptops in my house can get a signal but my own personal laptop cannot. The wireless network list on my computer shows that the network is detected and that I am connected. &nbsp;Despite this, the signal comes in and out
 and tends to be very weak. The signal on the bottom right shows full bars so the signal is supposedly very good but somehow I cannot get on the Internet. &nbsp;I have tried multiple websites and the message that Internet Explorer cannot open the web page comes
 up.</p>

<p><span>Hello Ktreyes,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Answers forum! Please follow the information listed below for help with troubleshooting your issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Basic Troubleshooting for Wireless Network related issues:<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>First
 try and power&nbsp;off your modem, router and desktop/laptop. Then power on the modem, then the router, and then finally the&nbsp;desktop/laptop. Please do this in that order, allowing 60 seconds in between each device to enable the device to be fully booted and able
 to accept connections.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Update
 the drivers for your wireless network adapter via Windows Update, or by using the website for either the company you bought your PC/Laptop from or the manufacturer of your networking device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Ensure
 that your router is set to broadcast it’s network name (SSID), ensure that you are connecting to the correct wireless network (SSID) and that you are using the correct WEP/WPA<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;passkey on both devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Please
 use “Windows Connect Now” or “Wi-Fi Protected Setup” if available on your wireless router to ensure that the connection is setup correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>If
 you are trying to use WPA or WPA2, please ensure that both your network adapter and wireless router support this protocol. If you are having issues detecting your wireless network when using WPA or WPA2, try configuring your router to use WEP instead and see
 if you can connect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Please
 note that the change between WEP/WPA/WPA2 will need to be made on both your computer and wireless router.</span></p>
<p><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>If
 you are only able to connect using WEP, then your networking hardware may need a firmware upgrade. If you are not comfortable doing this yourself, please call your hardware/router manufacturer for help in doing this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>If
 you are having a problem with your wireless connection after resuming from hibernate or sleep, or are having intermittent connectivity issues, try to adjust your Power Management profile to change your Wireless Adapter Settings to Maximum Performance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>To
 do this click “Change Plan Settings” next to your Power Profile, and choose “Wireless Adapter Settings” and set it to Maximum Performance. You should do this with all of your power profiles. Additional guidance is available here:<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/power-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/power-management</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Call
 the support line for your router manufacturer. It is likely that neither Windows nor the router are having problems, it is simply an issue of getting the configuration settings on both set up to work correctly together. The router manufacturer will be the
 best resource to know how to configure their device.<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Most of the contact numbers are listed here:</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/vendors/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/gp/vendors/en-us</span></a></p>

    <title>2 license keys for 1 account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judechauhan  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 license keys for 1 account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently built a new PC and was going to move my windows 10 key to it from my current one.</p>
<p>Instead I was thinking I would just buy a new key since i'm not selling this one but giving it to my brother.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to have 2 license keys linked to my account and log in on the other one and it use the second key or do I need an entirely separate account for the other key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jude</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br /> 
<br />You can use one Microsoft Account for multiple computers and it is possible to have 2 license keys linked to one Microsoft Account. It is the hardware that is being "registered" and a single Microsoft Account does not matter.  Microsoft keep separate records for each of the computers running windows 10 under the one microsoft account. 
<br />

            Hi Jude
<br />
<br />Rest Assured, there is no problem having multiple Windows 10 licence keys linked to a Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />I currently have 3 laptops linked to my Microsoft Account for my 3 laptops. There used to be a limit of 200, that was reduced to 20, which was quickly abandoned, now, there is no limit to the number of Devices or licences linked to a Microsoft Account . . .

<p><strong>You can also provide the hub with 5VDC and 2.5A using Radio Shack Enercell item # 273-333.&nbsp; Check if any of the 3 Adaptaplug that come with the&nbsp;power adapter&nbsp;fit your</strong> USB hub. They give you free the correct size one, so take the hub with

    <title>Windows 8.1 Pro Control Panel not functioning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amitg43  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Pro Control Panel not functioning</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 8 Pro from .iso disc in 2012. Later I upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro on line and hence there is no .iso disc with me for this version.<br />
<br />
Everything was working fine but during last 10 days, I installed/deleted/updated some programs but can't recollect which ones. On Aug 9, to do some changes, I wanted to open the Control Panel. The Control Panel opened all right, but when I tried to click on
 the menu items (I tried several), the header bar showed "<strong>Control Panel (not responding)</strong>" and then the panel vanished from screen, taking me back to Desktop screen.<br />
<br />
My laptop Dell Inspiron N5110 is using 64-bit version. Besides the .iso disc for Windows 8 Pro, I created System Recovery discs on 3 DVDs. I know that Windows 8.1 creates Recovery media on USB drive only, but it was foolishness on my part not to create this
 one.<br />
<br />
I tried <strong>Change PC Settings &gt; Update and Recovery &gt; Recovery</strong>, selected the first option "<strong>Refresh your PC without affecting your files</strong>", clicked "<strong>Get Started</strong>" button. After few seconds got a message that "<strong>Insert
 Media: Some files are missing. Your Windows installation or recovery media will provide these files.</strong>"<br />
<br />
But as explained, I do not have this media for Windows 8.1.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have Avast Anti-virus Free edition and MBAM antimalware installed. Using those to scan the PC did not report any malware.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My system is set to download Automatic Updates but I decide when to install. Just a control measure as I install all important updates - not only for Windows but for all the software that are installed. While trying the aforesaid steps today once again, I got
 a message that 18 new important updates were available. These have also been installed.<br />
<br />
My question:&nbsp;<br />
1. What to do now without going through a pains-taking re-installation of programs and their updates&nbsp;<br />
2. Can I use the media created for Windows 8 Pro? (assuming that missing files are same and system can choose and pick!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (It may be noted that the Product ID's for those two versions are different - so if the system rejects the discs, then I have no recovery media at all!)</p>

            <p>Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering all the time why the event log for Application was showing IDTNC64.cpl as faulting module. On checking the use of this file, I found it to be tied to Control Panel and IDT High Definition Audio that came with my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking a chance, and as Control Panel was not working, I opened <strong>Programs and Features&nbsp;</strong>from the menu opened by right-click on the Windows icon on Desktop. From the list of Programs displayed, I deleted
<strong>IDT High Definition Audio</strong>. The Control Panel started working normally!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though my original problem has been solved, I now face a new one. I wanted to install
<strong>IDT High Definition Audio Codec</strong> afresh and for this purpose, I downloaded the cabinet file from</p>
<p><a href="http://download.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/driver/drvs/2013/08/20582849_f93e417ac5ffafe793f2b4e9dc5f99b7f8a22b40.cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/driver/drvs/2013/08/20582849_f93e417ac5ffafe793f2b4e9dc5f99b7f8a22b40.cab</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But after expanding the cabinet, when I pointed to its location for driver update for the speakers through Device Manager, the system pointed out that my laptop already had the best driver for the hardware and my manual update was not necessary!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is true that I can hear the sound when playing a music, but even at maximum position of volume slider the sound output is not satisfactory. With IDT High Definition Audio Codec installed earlier, the sound was much better. Is there any way I can reinstall
 without getting bypassed by the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>_______________</p>
<p>Warm regards.</p>

                    <p>I know other people have posted the same question before, but previously posted solutions aren't working for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus X200M laptop, and my hard drive was dying and I got stuck in the Aptio setup utility. I replaced the hard drive with an SSD and I have a Windows 8 bootable USB drive plugged in. Aptio recognizes that a hard drive and USB are plugged in, but
 won't do anything about them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other threads, they recommend disabling Secure boot and Fast boot options, which I have done. They also recommend enabling CSM, which is not an option that comes up for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I try next?</p>

            For clarification, it turns out that the issue was that the bootable USB was for 32-bit Windows when I needed 64-bit Windows.

                    My fantastic windows 10 was acknowledging :(c), so I shut down and installed 2 more drives and restarted only to find the boot manager missing. I shut down, uninstalled the two new drives and restarted and still get either BM missing or it requires an
 installation disc. I do not have a Windows 10 repair disc set up yet as this is all new. I cannot see anywhere on microsoft site where there is a downloadable startup repair/recovery disk. Has anyone got any Ideas (I tried starting using F11-but this function
 also will not work)

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I downloaded the ISO file (pitty microsoft didn't include the words repair and recovery in the title). Loaded the file to a flash drive and my desktop PC computer will not recognise it. Tried burning the file to DVD however my windows
 10 laptop (the desktop PC is the one with trouble) tells me the file is too large. (I have an AMD laptop and a windows i7 7700k PC desktop) I did burn a start up disc from the laptop however the PC will not recognise the disc, it says it is a non system disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed the HDD's leaving the original boot HD however the computer will not recognise it. At boot up I have been through the BIOS several times trying different settings, however, after the BIOS screen goes the computer asks for a boot disc or flash
 drive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also burnt a recovery disk from another intel descktop and all I get is that it is not a system disc. I redownloaded the ISO file to an SD card and that worked but only as far as making me type in the product license number then select express or
 custom install. It will not go further. I have tried this with two HDD's and the result is the same. I have done two CMOS resets also and this makes no difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get the command prompt screen up but, although entering 'dir' and it shows windows files, it starts off with a directory 'x' and will not change to any other drive. I have input /c/r however this does not work. Given this computer is just over
 a week old I cannot see why it would be a motherboard or BIOS issue, nor the intel chip. It appears to be a windows 10 issue.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />Regarding your question:
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Try to add the Bluetooth device again.
<br />
<br />3. Try uninstall and reinstalling your Bluetooth drivers and look for updates first
<br />
<br />4. Try to download the driver from the manufacture website.
<br />
<br />Also, I attach some link with more procedures in case the steps above didn't work:

<br />I hope it works,

<h2>            How to delete a stubborn &#39;Windows system folder&#39; &#40;required by Windows&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>On first BootUp following the last Win10 upgrade (late SEP2018), my BootUp HardDisk partially failed; a very long BootUp sequence allowed only Desktop Icons to operate; no Start, Taskbar or Search, and (horrors!) no Net. My Win10 Repair Disk failed to work
 with a message something like 'disk is locked', although a command prompted CHKDSK and fixMBR seemed to complete OK, rebooting gives this same 'locked' message every time.
<br />
Then, using an old XP PC (with Net access - phew!), after a very, very long, Full Format op one empty folder remains on the disk.
<br />
An extended (fix file system errors &amp; recover bad sectors), again lengthy, XP CHKDSK completed OK.
<br />
But, a simple Delete Folder op failed with the warning: "a Windows system folder" (required by Windows) ... "cannot be deleted". I think this may be the reason the Win10 Repair disk failed to work with the 'locked disk'.
<br />
Could it be a lack of Admin Rights causing the prob? <br />
How might I remove this empty folder to clean the Disk completely? <br />
Does this incident suggest it is an unreliable Disk?</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay but I wasn't notified someone had replied to this question while I was notified properly about my other query.
</p>
<p>I think I answered these two questions in my posting but for the avoidance of doubt:
</p>
<p>The Win10 OS was corrupted and a Win10 Repair Disk failed to recover/repair or (finally) during my I-give-up-and-I'll-have-to-reinstall-Windows phase, it failed with a message like 'disk is locked'. I don't know what OS was in play while the Repair Disk
 was failing. </p>
<p>Then, using an old WinXP PC, I simply tried to delete the folder which failed, and then tried to simply reformat the HDD. This took way too long and ultimately, left the folder on the drive. I've since deleted the partition but Formatting once again failed
 to delete the folder. </p>
<p>It was known as D:\Documents and Settings\Favorites - I think it may be a remnant from the original XP Internet Explorer ver3 or ver4.
</p>
<p>Until I get this off my HDD, I cannot Clean Format it and its reliability remains questionable.
</p>
<p>Thank you if you can help.</p>

    <title>Xbox App on Windows 10 Toshiba Satellite Laptop will not open&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigfatsushiroll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox App on Windows 10 Toshiba Satellite Laptop will not open&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Sooooooo... I've pretty much done everything in my power to remove the app from desktop using Powershell prompt, re-installing it through Windows store and trying to open it again. It continues to do the same thing. Flash a green screen inside a window box
 and close almost instantly. There's no option to sign in, sign out or even check it's settings. Anyone experienced have a solution to this? It's driving me insane. I barely bought this laptop 3 days ago. Did not think it would do this out of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also before a windows agent chimes in, I've already run troubleshooting. Nothing seems to come up.

    <title>Lost my &#34;Downloads&#34; FOLDER and somehow re-named my User - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reed92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost my &#34;Downloads&#34; FOLDER and somehow re-named my User Profile with this same &#34;Downloads&#34; Folder - Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I really made a big mistake - I have a large secondary mechanical drive, and I decided I would free-up some space on my smaller SSD drive by moving my "Downloads" folder to the D: drive.&nbsp; Well, this started a chain reaction of events.&nbsp; The computer works
 fine, but now, I can't "see" my name under the "Users" folder - I used to be able to see a "User" file&nbsp; named "Charles."&nbsp; It now has a "User" file called "Downloads" with a blue arrow (pointing down) icon.&nbsp; That folder contains items like "3D Objects," "AppData,"
 "Favorites," "Documents," "Google Drive," etc., the same as the User file "Charles."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the "Charles" User Profile Folder still exists on my system - see picture below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f05f077f-6b89-42e3-8335-ce3dafe12c77?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f05f077f-6b89-42e3-8335-ce3dafe12c77?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't think I have totally messed things up!&nbsp; Everything works as it should, but I can't "see" the Charles User profile name under the "Users" Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to get it back to the way it was?&nbsp; Or should I just continue using it "as is?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried a System Restore, and that didn't work (it said it couldn't get a file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type&nbsp;C:\Users\Charles in the location bar and hit enter, it brings me to the Downloads folder (pic below):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de3d7924-654b-4595-95a9-19497880586b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de3d7924-654b-4595-95a9-19497880586b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I click in the location bar, it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d141d7ba-ac12-4e7b-ad76-6d98a146228d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d141d7ba-ac12-4e7b-ad76-6d98a146228d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Charles" profile doesn't show up when I look in the "Users" Folder (see pic below):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c6bccb0-ccbd-408a-bc95-de28fd1d979e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c6bccb0-ccbd-408a-bc95-de28fd1d979e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Downloads" folder is in the "Charles" Users Folder (see pic below) as it should be, but when you click on it, it doesn't show my downloads - it shows the exact same files you see below!&nbsp; So basically, both the "Charles" User Folder and the "Download"
 Folder point to the same location!&nbsp; Whatever gets added or removed from one gets added / removed from the other!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/817c36dc-c9d1-42c5-ab83-47deb11816cf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/817c36dc-c9d1-42c5-ab83-47deb11816cf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help to un-tangle this would be greatly appreciated - thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Charles</p>

<p>I just went ahead and reset my computer - it took all day, but everything is back the way I want it.&nbsp; And I learned a good lesson: "Don't mess with the 'Downloads' folder - it is an integral part of your Windows Systems."&nbsp; Besides, when I was making the
 changes, it kept prompting me that this process "CANNOT be undone."&nbsp; So that should of clued me in that I was about to do something I probably shouldn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a HardDisk IMAGE of my system (Instructions here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3154713/windows/how-to-create-and-restore-an-image-backup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3154713/windows/how-to-create-and-restore-an-image-backup-in-windows-10.html</a>).&nbsp;
 Windows has this option HIDDEN, so most people don't even know about it!&nbsp; I am glad I found it because I was just about to buy a program to make a disk image.&nbsp; Now, I will just "image" my system once a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I ever mess up again, I can just re-install the image, and I won't have to install each and every program.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Android does not recognize USB-connected camera with built in microphone</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>I have a USB camera with built-in microphone which works perfect in other Android applications that can access the USB host. However, the Skype app refuses to identify the camera and the microphone. My Android version is 7.1 and I have downloaded the latest
 version of Skype. The USB camera model is a Sony CMU BR 200, which I used it with my Sony TV when Skype was still supported on Smart TVs. Is there a way to make Skype to access the USB port and identify the camera?</p>

            The Android applications are designed to work with internal cameras with set resolutions.&nbsp; To possibly get it to be noticed you may have to use 3rd party software or a way to redirect the identification of the external camera to an internal mount/id location.&nbsp;
 Mimicking phone resolutions may also be required.&nbsp; I personally do not own such equipment or I would be testing it out myself without resorting to program/package modifications, which I believe are not allowed under the terms of use.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>What is the exact model number of the Flash drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yellow exclamation mark means that it need a driver software to be installed. The SanDisk Flash Drive model that you have provided is not available in the SanDisk website. I
 would suggest you to try installing the driver that is available with you in the compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>

            You could try Command Prompt. (Click the start button and type CMD)<br />
Change Directory&nbsp; to the folder (cd folderpathname)<br />
List the folder (dir /a /b). If anything is in it, it will be listed.<br />
If you still want to delete it:<br />
Change Directory to parent folder of folder (cd .. ) Yes, that is two dots together.<br />
Delete Folder and everything beneath it (be very very very careful that the foldername is correct):<br />
EITHER<br />
&nbsp; (rmdir&nbsp; /S&nbsp; foldername)<br />
OR<br />
&nbsp; (rmdir /S&nbsp; /Q foldername)<br />

            Went through all the checks you suggested but still having problems so had a good think about what changes have i made prior to this happening then it clicked on me that i fitted a VGA converter to watch livestream TV so disconnected and think this has
 solved the problem as not loosing connection anymore but if occurs again will let you know so a big thankyou for your help<br />

<h2>            HDMI connected secondary Dell D2409W monitor not detected</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently upgraded two machines from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Both laptops have secondary monitors attached. The one with VGA connection is working. The machine, HP Envy 14, equipped with an HDMI port, no VGA port available, is not detecting the connected
 monitor. The installed graphics card is an AMD Mobility Raeon HD 5000 Series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows 10 upgrade I installed all the graphics device drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Catalyst Control Center version is 15.7.1</p>
<p>Driver Version 15.20.1062.1002-150715a-187327C</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, I am unable to detect the HDMI attached monitor. I have searched online and have not been able to find a viable solution for this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my hope that someone with knowledge of this problem will be able to help me resolve this problem. Thanks in advance. I do look forward to recommendations that lead to resolution of this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>THANX(MKD).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response and recommendations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method # 1 did not work. I received the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry, but your operating system is not supported by Microsoft Fix it at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Method # 2 does not resolve the problem. I checked Windows Update an I have all the latest required patches. Please note that in my initial update I indicated that I installed the latest graphics card device drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the event log and did not see anything that I would explain why the OS is not recognizing the connected monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In trying to figure out what is going on I did the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>+ I removed the HDMI cable from the HDMI port. The monitor came on and displayed the message "No HDMI Cable"</p>
<p>+ Plugged the HDMI cable into the laptops HDMI port. I received the message "Entering Power Save Mode", then the monitor goes black.</p>
<p>+ With the HDMI cable plugged into the HDMI port I checked the Device Manager, all that the system reports is one Generic PnP Monitor</p>
<p>+ From Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Display, I click on "Project to a second screen". when the pop up is displayed I click on Extend. Then I go to Display &gt; Screen Resolution, I click on Detect and the system does not recognize the second
 monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that the system does not recognize the second monitor. Can someone please help me to resolve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
