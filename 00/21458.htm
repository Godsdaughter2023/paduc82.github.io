    <title>Outlook Live - Can&#39;t view or download attachments - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook Live - Can&#39;t view or download attachments</h2>
                    <p>I just created a Outlook Live email account, and I can neither view nor download attachments.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click to view an attachment, the document never appears - I just get a never-ending spinning wheel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to download, I get an error message - "access denied". </p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, if there are multiple attachments, "Download all" seems to work. It creates a zip folder and I can go from there. But if it is a single attachment, no luck.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a "Download to OneDrive" but I don't use OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using Google Chrome as well as Microsoft Edge and have the same issues on both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send and receive attachments with no problem. My settings have been set to "Always show previews," and "<strong>Show attachments, pictures and links for senders with good reputations</strong>."</p>

            I've been having this same problem for over a year now - since i had the forced upgrade to the new outlook. i used to be able to use web mail and the offline / computer based outlook on my laptop. no problem. however, since the update i can only use web
 based outlook and cannot open, preview or down load any attachments.

<p>Are you having the problem in the Desktop version of Outlook or in Outlook.com in your web browser. &nbsp;Since you posted in the Outlook.com forum I'm guessing it's in your web browser which it likely means your primary email is a non @outlook.com or similar
 Microsoft email. &nbsp;If so follow my steps here and <strong>wait 24 hours</strong> and hopefully once you set it to an @outlook.com or similar Microsoft based one instead of your own private email it should start working.</p>

            If you're using Outlook 2007 to access an Outlook.com mailbox, you should be able to connect to the mailbox with Exchange and attachment handling should work as it always has worked in Outlook 2007. What type of account do you have configured?

<p>I've been having this same issue for over 6 months! I was able to get around it by saving to One drive and then opening (very annoying) but now I can't even do that. I can only open/download it if I receive a folder or multiples and download all, then I
 can open the folder in the downloads on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am signed in under a @live.com account, which is the same as my microsoft account</p>
<p>-I exclusively use outlook.com, I do not have a downloaded version of Outlook or any apps (besides that on my phone).&nbsp;</p>
<p>-I'm able to open most documents on my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that is not working is trying to drag and drop attachments to a new email to be sent but that is not a huge problem. What IS a huge problem is not being able to open/preview/download pdfs or documents! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry I missed that you replied to this.&nbsp; If you follow the instructions in my link before under your manage Primary Email Alias does it list another email alias on your account?&nbsp; If so as long as you know the password for that account you could try switching
 to that one especially if it's another @Hotmail.com, @live.com, or @outlook.com one.&nbsp; Then wait a day and see if it works before trying to switch back and wait another day to see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like maybe you still are not using the same @live email address that the account was originally setup under.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not 100% sure but I think you can log into your account with a different email account even if it's not the Primary.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to export history of Skype to Skype calls, but if the calls are Skype to mobile/landline numbers, there is a detailed information that you can check on your Skype account page. Here is the direct link:

<h2>            Help w&#47; &#34;Navigation to the webpage cancelled&#34; Constant Pop-up&#33;</h2>
                    Hopefully someone can help me with rather annoying problem developed recently. There is a small pop-up on the bottom right of my screen that is constantly coming up covering the lower right of the system bar (area where it displays my clock and a few programs).
 It then will then go behind it showing half of the pop up and then disappear for a millisecond and reappear again.
<br />
<br />
The pop-up is a lower case white-colored "i" inside a blue circle. It says "Navigation to the webpage cancelled" followed by a "What you can try:" and then under that is "Retype the address". I can't seem to make this go away and with it continuing to pop up,
 it also forces me to stop typing as if I am hitting a break wall as I type, I then have to click the bottom system bar but then it just pops back up.
<br />
<br />
If I right click on the pop-up box in question and click "Properties" the box that comes up has a "General" tab and it states the following:<br />
<br />
Protocol: Unknown Protocol<br />
Type: File<br />
Connection: Not Encrypter<br />
Address (URL): res://ieframe.dll/navcancl.htm#injector://res//AlertSearch.html<br />
Size: 2713 bytes<br />
Created: 1/13/2014<br />
Modified: 1/13/2014<br />
<br />
My only option is to then click "Certificates", "Ok" or "Cancel". <br />
<br />
I am running Windows XP Professional SP3 on this particular computer, and I have Internet Explorer 8. I have tired everything: System Restore, unintalling Internet Explorer, running Malwarebytes, Microsoft Security Essentials, Ad-Aware, Malwarebyters, Advanced
 One Care and nothing seems to work. <br />
<br />
Help would be appreciated in removing this. <br />

            While I am sorry to hear you are having the same issue, it's nice to know my problem isn't rare that just myself is having it. I did a search online and noticed others are as well. It's extremely frustrating becaue I can't seem to find anything that works.<br />

I have tried running several anti-spyware programs and none seem to work in getting rid of it. What I have ended up doing in the meantime is right-clicking the box that appears and going to "properties" and once open I then take my cursor and drag the box down
 below the system tray bar. This way it doesn't continuously pop-up and be a distraction. Naturally i'd rather get rid of it completely rather than go with the "out of sight, out of mind" approach but Im getting ready soon to reformat this computer and then
 selling it but for those who are experiencing this problem and don't have the luxury of having a new computer, I feel the same frustration.
<br />
<br />
I have not been able to find anyone who can help so far, and as you can see, no one has posted a resolution here too.<br />

<p>Looks like&nbsp;a security&nbsp;feature is working?&nbsp;&nbsp; But I'm not sure if&nbsp; navcancl has such an anchor in it in which case it may just be a spoof.&nbsp; Unfortunately in IE8 you don't have many tools to help you diagnose this.&nbsp; Fiddler2 and ProcMon are two options.&nbsp; E.g.
 try to find out where that HTML originates.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a start though you could make sure that your tab options are putting all popups into a tab instead of opening new windows as you appear to have them doing.</p>

            Does the invoice appear correctly in "Print Preview". In other words, does your printout look like "print preview"?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There's several workarounds. You could print to PDF and then print from adobe reader.<br />
<br />
Or you can copy and paste everything on the form to something like word or excel and print from there.<br />
<br />
In what format is the invoice in? Is it a picture pasted into an email? Or is it something from a spreadsheet pasted into outlook? Is it a snapshot from a website?<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
What I printed off looks exactly like the emailed invoice, but a section 3/4s of the way down is missing.&nbsp; I don't want to have to copy and paste it anywhere else, I just want to print off the invoices I receive by email several times a week by clicking 'print'
 as I used to on hotmail and have all the text present.&nbsp; It was very simple and not being terribly computer literate I wouldn't know how to do the things you have suggested.<br />
<br />
The invoices originate from a shipping website and after payment, the invoice arrives as a confirmation, with tracking numbers and addresses and it is one of these sections that is missing.<br />
<br />
By the way, I don't quite know what you mean by 'Print Preview' and just clicked on the email and then when it appeared, clicked on the (...).<br />
<br />
Any further assistance you could give in layman's language would be gratefully received.<br />

            Whenever you go to print something, for instance, say your in an older version of outlook and you bring up an email and want to print it, there should be a command either right next to print that says "print preview". Print preview is a command that displays
 exactly what your printout will look like with your current settings.<br />
<br />
Whenever you print, you should always look at the print preview to make sure that what you intend to print is what is going to print. What version of outlook are you running? I'm using Outlook 2013. Print preview automatically shows up when you hit print. But
 older versions have a separate command for it. <br />
<br />
Check out <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/preview-a-page-before-printing-HP010108388.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this webpage</a><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.addintools.com/documents/office/where-print-preview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This webpage</a> shows where it is and more on how to use it if you are running outlook 2007 or 2010. It also shows some helpful screenshots.<br />
<br />
If you get in the habit of using print preview, you will never again have any surprises when you print.<br />
<br />
When you select "print", do you also have the option of printing to "pdf"?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click it and you will see option such as mark as unread etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below that is a SEPARATE way to select print THIS opens a new browser window but the WHOLE email on display - you can then print from there just as you need it</p>

This use to work fine in hotmail but microsoft have somehow managed to mess up this function with outlook.com. I have not changed any settings or installed newer browser versions or installed any newer versions of add-ons. The only thing that has changed is
 hotmail -&gt; outlook.<br />

<h2>            Windows will not let me install McAfee because it &#34;may damage my PC or destroy data&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to run the setup for McAfee 2013, Windows 10 gives me a notification saying&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This app can't run on this PC" &nbsp;(Which I know is not true because before I upgraded it worked just fine (coming from 64 bit Windows to 64 bit Windows)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows blocked McAfee Total Protection 2012 and 2013 from opening because it may damage your PC or destroy data."</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I trust McAfee will not do either of those things. clicking the notification does nothing but dismiss it, there is no source application that it says it is coming from, except 'Compatibility assistant' which just brings up the notification area settings.
 This is incredibly annoying, because I used to be able to disable this and install whatever I want on my PC because this is America and I do what I want. Now, there is no option for me to get around it, there is nothing I can do about it, and worst of all
 I CANNOT REACH MICROSOFT TECH SUPPORT BECAUSE WHEN I GO TO THE SUPPORT PAGE IT SENDS ME INTO A REDIRECT LOOP TO ASK ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHICH PRODUCT I AM USING SO I CAN BE DIRECTED TO THE CORRECT ANSWER TECH. I've tried this on IE10 or whatever the newest
 one is, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge or Project Spartan or whatever it is called. So I have resorted to asking someone here if they know how to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR I cannot bypass some stupid compatibility assistant that won't let me install a perfectly fine program that I trust. &nbsp;Someone help me install McAfee, because God knows Microsoft won't.</p>

            Because I paid money for McAfee and I want to use it. It has never given me problems in the past. The problem is not with McAfee, but with this Windows Compatibility Assistant garbage that I cannot turn off.

            I don't think you want to force it.&nbsp; Antivirus/Antimalware software is more tightly integrated into the OS than is typical for software in general.&nbsp; If it won't install it probably means they've changed the API or RPC's for hooking into the OS.&nbsp; It is
 fairly typical for a compatible version of the AV/AM to only be released at RTM for the OS.&nbsp; Occasionally the AV/AM provider will make a beta available but it's not unusual if they don't.&nbsp; I own a multi pc license for Norton 360 but have no qualms about using
 MSE for this beta.

<h2>            Error sync calender and slow mail for Exchange</h2>
                    I have a Nokia E90 with Exchange Business software. I the last to month i get an error when synchronizing calendar. The phone completely locks with an error message. It is still possible to sync mail and contacts.<br />
<br />
Today i upgraded the firmware to newest version, and now the Exchange application is very slow, and i still get the error message when trying to sync calendar.<br />
<br />
Do you now what is wrong?

            What do you mean "completely locks"? What is the error message. Is there an error in the admin logs? Look in the \MailForExchange directory using the FileBrowser.<br />
<br />
There is likely a bad calendar item on your server that is causing this problem. Let's try to locate it. It could be anywhere in the Calendar. Change the calendar "sync back" setting as low as possible. This will reduce the number of items that will be synched.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, take a look at your repeating items. Look for items with hundreds or thousands of recipients or large attachments in the body.<br />
<br />
Another way: there is a way to change the Calendar view in Outlook to a list instead of a calendar. From this view, you can temporarily move small groups of your calendar items to another folder until synching succeeds. Then you know that the bad item is in
 the last group. Now move the items back to the calendar one by one until you find the bad one.<br />
<br />
Once found, recreate it so that you have a working copy, but don't move the bad one back into your calendar.<br />
<br />
Make sense?

<p>Guys I think this is a problem that needs to be fixed.&nbsp; My other friend is having the same problem with exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It downloads the emails fast from the exchange server but then takes ages to display them then when you hit reply it hangs for up to 2 mins then when you hit send it will hang for 2 mins.&nbsp; It does this when using fast wirelss or 3G.</p>
<p>Often the phone will time out before the email is sent or loaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we get some help on this?&nbsp; We are ealy adopters of the new phone (its just come into Australia) so when something goes wrong we are the first to get the problems.</p>

<h3> mariettegoldring  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does it matter which Skype account you merge another into&#63; On the &#34;cell phone account&#34; you have Ofice 365 a skype number a subscription to North America.</h2>
                    <p>I need help to clear my problem. I´ve got a Skypeaccount created by default on my phone. By then I didn´t realise it was automatically connected to my cellphone number. I thougt it was connected to the Outlook account I recently had created on the phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later I tried to logon to the same account on my computer - but the account didn´t exist - so I thought I had to open the account from scratch on the computer to get connected to the account on my phone. Unfortunately not - it didn´t work that way.... [big
 sigh] :( </p>
<p>
</p><p>Later I found out that since I´ve used the e-mail I wanted to use via my cellphone when I opened the Skype account on my PC I wasn´t able to use it connected to my Skype account on the cellphone. Neither could I Close the Skye account - If I did I would
 also cancel my whole Microsoftaccount and my Outlook e-mail at the same time. There was no possibility to keep the e-mail but Close the Skyoeaccount connected to the Outlook adress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I´ve bought Office 365 Personal on my cellphone I want to use the features for Outlook on the Outlook e-mail I by misstake used to create/connect on the PC, I need to merge the two Skype accounts together. But if I merge wrong into the other Skype
 account I will loos my skypenumber as well as my two subscriptions. Therefore I need help to be directed step by step how to do. PLEASE I need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´ve asked similar question/s on the Community the past Days but I haven´t got the help needed. The phonecall I got - I lost in a transfer and "they" didn´t call back. Reply on my communityaccount only said I had info in my inbox... but the message in my
 inbox only replied the same - "I have info in my inbox". Back to first page again...&nbsp; My hope is to someone to answer, I can´t use my Office 365 if I have to connect the subscription to wrong e-mail account to get started.</p>

<h3> michaelcshindler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Application Virtualizer Virtual Process Launcher</h2>
                    <p>I am working from Windows 10 and Office 2013. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the last week or so, this message pops up with alarming frequency (every 30 seconds or so).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Microsoft Application Virtualizer Virtual Process Launcher has stopped working ... A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Please close the program." And, there is a link to "Close the Program"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not interfere with any Office-based work, but it needs to be closed out and it's annoying. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions how to get rid of this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Activation Key for 10074 does not work - now what &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I downloaded the 10074 build a week ago (US-UK version) and received the Pro version. At least that is what the screen is telling me.</p>
<p>The announced Key to work with this is 6P99N-YF42M-TPGBG-9VMJP-YKHCF but it does not work. Message :
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>The key didn't work, please check it and try again, or try a different key.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The other Key I see flying around in these forums is this one : BD8NM-JGY2P-8JJYD-WTYKR-HQRJM and it gives the same result.</p>
<p>VTNMT-2FMYP-QCY43-QR9VK-WTVCK (officially for Enterprise) same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was from a clean (ISO) install.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I DO NOT INTEND TO UPDATE TO A NEWER BUILD AT THIS TIME</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You know what ? I don't care that the Key fails. But the question is : <strong>
how long can I last with this situation</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am developing an app for W10 and all I know is that I am fine as it is with build 10074 and I don't want to find myself locked out suddenly.</p>
<p>IOW, is there is grace period in order ? Is it infinite for this build anyway ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with Word, which is the topic of this forum.</p>
<p>There is no way to see that.&nbsp; If you are concerned about what other people may do with your computer, don't let them anywhere near it.</p>

            This has been answered several times before (if you had searched). It is not currently possible to purchase apps using a debit card. A credit card is needed.

<div>The repair of Office Starter 2010 products comes under the category of repairing&nbsp;<i>Click-to-Run products</i>. It sounds like you are having trouble opening the
<i>Programs</i>&nbsp;applet from within the <i>Control Panel</i>. This is not the same thing as
<i>All Programs</i>. I've described two methods to get where you need to be in step 1 below.</div>
<br />
<div>Note:&nbsp;Repairing Office Click-to-Run products require an Internet connection to be available during the entire repair process.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>In Windows 7, click&nbsp;<i>Start</i><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fblufiles.storage.live.com%2fy1pqC6F6eOPKVGXzlDtTuRp5kauk0WEI8eCIm43xk--ocOr6nUfHce-EE-m9-SndIbfojS2i_JhCoc%2fStart_sm.jpg%3fpsid%3d1" />&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<i>Control Panel</i>&nbsp;from the right-hand list then select&nbsp;<i>Programs</i>.
 If you are having trouble with this,&nbsp;click&nbsp;<i>Start</i><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fblufiles.storage.live.com%2fy1pqC6F6eOPKVGXzlDtTuRp5kauk0WEI8eCIm43xk--ocOr6nUfHce-EE-m9-SndIbfojS2i_JhCoc%2fStart_sm.jpg%3fpsid%3d1" />&nbsp;and type
<i>programs</i>&nbsp;then select <i>Programs and Features</i>&nbsp;from the <i>Control Panel</i>&nbsp;section of the list above.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Office Starter 2010</i>&nbsp;from the list of installed programs and them click&nbsp;<i>Change</i>&nbsp;from the commands available above the list.</li><li>Check&nbsp;<i>Remove Office user settings</i>&nbsp;if you want to reset all options to factory defaults. Uncheck it if you wish to retain any&nbsp;customization&nbsp;that you have performed on the program(s).</li><li>Click&nbsp;<i>Repair</i>&nbsp;and follow the procedure through to its conclusion.</li></ol>

 type <i>appwiz.cpl</i>&nbsp;then hit <i>Enter</i></span>↵<span>. This directly opens the

<h2>            windows has blocked this software because it can&#39;t verify the publisher</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen an older thread reference this issue but it seemed as though someone needed to create a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer having this issue is a&nbsp;Windows 7 64 Bit box with IE 9. I go to a particular website&nbsp;I get prompted to install the ActiveX in question. When I hit install I get the: "windows has blocked this software because it can't verify the publisher" message.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed the steps outlined in the previous thread detailing the activeX settings under trusted sites to no avail. I've also gone into Properties &gt; Internet options &gt; Advanced &gt; and checked "Allow software to run and install even if the signature is invalid"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm still getting the same error, any other ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Options to share PowerPoint online - social media, blogs</h2>
                    <p>I am wondering what would be the best way to share PowerPoints via the internet. Convert to video then upload to Youtube then share? I have Office 365 and noticed something about interactive videos? (I will have to look into that more).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enjoy creating PowerPoints and would like to share them with family &amp; friends online or possibly in a blog (if I can find the time to start one).</p>

<h3> bassman99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reverse the Windows downward spiral&#58; TouchMousePointer&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I'm an avid PC fan, since I like the "open" approach used by Microsoft, rather than the "closed" approach of Apple, or the buggy/odd nature of Linux and Android.&nbsp; I'm *really* trying to stick with Windows...</p>
<p>...but...</p>
<p>...the desktop to-date is HORRIBLE on a touch-screen.&nbsp; A lot of people (like myself) want to "kick-back" with just a touch-screen on the full desktop: *without* a physical keyboard or stylus.&nbsp; For proof, I defer to the horrible reception of Windows 8 to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I *am* a Windows guy, and write this, in hopes of reversing the Windows downward spiral.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; TouchMousePointer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I heartily recommend either buying this company or duplicating the functionality of this product: http://www.lovesummertrue.com/touchmousepointer/en-us/
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing this, *finally* I can use my Windows tablet without a keyboard for routine activities.&nbsp; Naturally, for a lot of extensive work, I'd want a keyboard.&nbsp; For a simple spreadsheet, presentation or just getting organized?&nbsp; I want to kick-back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, hopefully you can "fix" the desktop experience, per above.&nbsp; Simply having Metro ("modern interface"?) and desktop apps on the same screen won't help reverse Microsoft's downward spiral if people still need a stylus, or worse, a keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once-more, I really prefer to use Windows.&nbsp; For all Microsoft's millions/billions, though, Microsoft doesn't make it easy to remain committed to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

    <title>IE11 Problems on Windows 7 Ultimate - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IE11 Problems on Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 Windows 7 Ultimate systems with IE11, all clean builds, that all experience the same problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>WINDOWS 7 systems</p>
<p>1) Desktop with 6G RAM, Intel MB, Intel iCore7 extreme (v2) 1TB disk</p>
<p>2) Desktop with 16G RAM, Intel MB, Intel iCore7 extreme (V3) 1TB disk</p>
<p>3) Laptop with 2G RAM, Intel Pentium M, 100G drive</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also have 3 Windows 8.1 Pro systems, clean builds, with IE11.&nbsp; My Windows 8.1 systems and IE11 work very well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>WINDOWS&nbsp;8.1 systems</p>
<p>1) Desktop with 4G RAM, Intel MB, Intel iCore7&nbsp;500GB disk</p>
<p>2) Desktop with 16G RAM, Intel MB, Intel iCore7 extreme (V3) 1TB disk</p>
<p>3) Surface Pro,&nbsp;4G RAM, 128GV drive</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since I experience precisely the&nbsp;same problematic behavior with IE11 on Windows 7 across three separate systems, and the same clean behavior across all of my Windows 8.1 systems I believe that IE11 was not ready for Windows 7 - or IE11 should never have
 been released for Windows 7.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Furthermore&nbsp;the fact that this thread and others like it exist points to a real problem, and not widespread user issues.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Problem exist for all browsers not only Internet Explorer. That's why we have this forum so you could share your problems and issues and we work together to fix them.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 11 supports new standards and features which are not available in previous version of IE and other browsers.

<p>I had the exact same scenario on my Win7 64 bit machines - IE11 crashes often on page loads, compatibility and functionality problems, etc. Most of the "answers" on these boards are either techie work-arounds that don't work (and also remember, most users
 are<em> not</em> technically oriented) or outright arrogance that the rest of the world simply needs to catch up to IE11. As a web developer, I'm forced to make sure all my work is backwards compatible to at least&nbsp;IE8. To have a current standards compliant
 browser is great, but to ignore deprecated code or misinterpret it will doom your product. Microsoft should not have pushed the upgrade as an Important update; should have left it as optional.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For me, the only workable solution was to downgrade back to IE10. Runs smooth as silk again. I only run one machine with IE11 and only that's to check for compatibility problems with it.</p>

<p>Same here, but I went back IE9. IE11 is awful with Win7 Home.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Hello Mick as well as others;</strong>&nbsp; It is My feeling that all of You have a Malware &nbsp;problem, and believe me it is dug in deep! I also have the same equipment as all of you and when I loaded IE-11 &nbsp;into windows -7 Ultimate &nbsp;64 bit, It migrated
 like it was a marriage made in heaven. &nbsp;The OS systems that You are running make Me wonder if You, are a Microsoft software engineer? Back to Your situation Mick and Lenzmic. &nbsp;IE- 8,9,10 will not help with your problem at all,Trust Me on that.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;First
 of all I assume that all of you received a "Cumulative Active-X Security Update for IE-11 which also covers Windows-7 Ultimate. &nbsp;Internet Explorer of any ki</strong><span><strong>nd is going to crash regardless without constant maintenance</strong>.</span><strong>
 I loaded Internet explorer - 11 into My Windows -7 Ultimate &nbsp;(Fifteen Minutes or so ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>with absolutely no hitches 2 months ago and it is running better than ever! &nbsp;</strong>Do You Really think that Microsoft &nbsp;Corporation &nbsp;has a Problem making IE-10? and is also having a glitch with IE -11 and Windows - 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;Really? <strong>&nbsp;You all have a virus/Malware problem. It is either that or your IP Adapter is not configured properly.</strong> Again I say check for<strong> "Cumulative Security Update and Active - X Killbits for Internet Explorer 11 for Windows - 7 for
 x64 based Systems (KB2909210)"&nbsp;</strong>By the way,that is also the same update for IE- 10! &nbsp;Should You not have that update,It deals with 21# Security issues where a hacker can assume remote control of Your computer stealing your identity.......If You need
 help with that Update</p>
<p>use the Microsoft download Center and link to connect (KB2909210)<strong> The link is http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows 7. &nbsp;this is a standalone &nbsp;</strong><strong>Hotfix for updates as they should.</strong> &nbsp;It is called &nbsp;the " system update readiness
 tool" and it can find and replace corrupted files. Next try running the SFC scan. Go to all programs ,under accessories and click on the command prompt (rt ,clk) as You must run as an Administrator,let program run a sec and type in "sfc/scannow"and press enter.
 This will dig deeper for corrupted or out of place updates or files and replace them. To determine which files could not be repaired by the file checker tool,open an elevated prompt,at the prompt type in the following. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<strong>finfstr /C:"[SR]"%windir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log&gt;%userprofile%\Desktop\sfcdetails.txt" Next run a Quick Scan, If even one pup shows up ,run a full scan to solve Your Problem.</strong> I hope You have something powerful to run. If this still does not fix this
 situation, it is a Firewall/adapter mis-configuration . </p>

            <p>Ronald,</p>
<p>While what you say may be true for some, that was not the case for me and I'm sure others. One workstation only goes on the network to access MS Update manually. No malware. All updates successful. Necessary hotfixes applied. IE11 would crash opening local
 html files located on the same hard drive. The event log was reviewed and investigated for each crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, over the past 6 months or so, most of my previous issues have disappeared. My assumption is that these issues have been addressed through the cumulative updates. When first launched, IE11 on Win7-64bit was crash heavy. Now, it runs pretty well
 - maybe one hang in the last 60 days and that likely wasn't a browser problem. I simply waited it out for updates to be released.</p>

<p>Eric @Big E.... If you had really taken the time to &nbsp;read &nbsp;my response ,You would have noticed that I had mentioned Updates as in "cumulative" "active-x" &nbsp;"Killbits" &nbsp;"(KB2909210)" "Standalone Hotfix for Updates" etc. I stated That was most likely the problem
 ,if not a firewall or Adapter mis-configuration. Understand ? Please understand that I did not intend to afend any of my colleges. I understand that many of You are Microsoft engr's or Web designers. I was just trying to help. I to will consider this case
