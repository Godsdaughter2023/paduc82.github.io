            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

            <p>Thank you...I was able to get the clean boot, and believe the problem is that my Vista laptop doesn't have Live Mail...the download for the 2011 version is no longer available, so I'm out of luck there, but I was able to download it to my Win. 7 laptop,
 but haven't tried it out yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I will have to use my Win 7 laptop to access Live Mail....if you know of any way to get the 2011 download, that would (I suppose) be helpful...I'm not going to Windows 10, I gave it a short try, and within 5 minutes, the entire screen flipped around
 to a horizontal orientation....I'm not fighting with that...when and if they ever get the program kinks out, maybe I'll try it again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks again, K</p>

            <p>Hello, I have similar issues and ran the SFC scan; most of the files were fixed and there are some corrupt files. I don't know why this has occured but I'm afraid to try to fix those files manually because I am a self-taught user and don't know anything
 about about that section. I wish there was a link you could send to fix these other corrupt files. I'm just trying to apply to a job when it said the dll file was missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are any of those programs that say download this and all will be fine worth it? I looked first at microsoft community because I know you'all have the same interests as mine in getting my computer working right.</p>

    <title>The Kinect &#38;amp&#59; the Controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galactic geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Kinect &#38;amp&#59; the Controller</h2>
                    
<p>Well, we all know that the new Kinect can detect the controllers &amp; track them regardless of who holds them because of the IR sensors on both the controllers &amp; the Kinect &amp; how they interact together with each other (based on various Xbox One Kinect demos
 &amp; images on the official Xbox website &amp; abroad). This also enables each player's individual controller settings to be quickly, easily, &amp; automatically transferred as the controller exchanges hands (such as fighting game controls, inverted controls, etc.).
 It is my belief that this could potentially be the sole reason why the Kinect can't be unplugged - even in a low powered or disabled state, this feature will likely work all of the time because without it, the Xbox One won't be able to tell your controllers
 apart from 1 player to the next. The Xbox One no longer has those 4 bars on the controller or on the console indicating which controller is player 1, player 2, etc. like on the Xbox 360 - those have been replaced with a single white Xbox logo instead, which
 I'm told does glow (white, naturally). This also makes me wonder if this IR connection is how you'd connect the controllers to your console, because if it is, it would eliminate the need to press a button on the controller &amp; on the console to "sync" or "tether"
 them together, which like in most cases with the new system, streamlines the whole process making things much easier for everyone involved.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think of this? Does this ease of use make the requirement of the Kinect (being plugged in) worth it to you? Why or why not? Please discuss rationally &amp; with respect towards others.</p>

<p>I think it's a nice feature... No doubt... But I rarely play split screen as I have two nice flat screens and when my mate brings his Xbox over, he goes on the other tv, thus eliminating the half screen view, and the possibility of controllers getting swapped.
 The same thing happens when I go to his place.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Split screen was cool as a kid, but my preference is full screen now I'm older. I still put this in the optional feature basket, it's nice, but hardly necessary for my situation. If this is the sole reason the Kinect2 must be plugged in at all times, I'm
 still not completely without concerns and I still would feel like I should be able to use the main console without the Kinect plugged in if anything was to happen to it. I'm certainly not suggesting things should be changed to suit me the individual, I'm just
 putting forward my point of view.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am trying to be logical based on my individual situation. I have heard all the arguments from pro and anti Kinect people, so please do not bombard me with them. I'm answering GG's post with respect... Lets try to make this a Kinect discussion that isn't
 filled with bile and snide remarks, lets try to make it constructive, not the other way around. I appreciate GG's question and line of thought, and his stance on supporting Kinect2, mine is slightly different, which it's allowed to be.</p>

<p>Xeno, I'm curious - what's your take on the 2nd 1/2 of my post then (as shown below), which has nothing to do with how many players there are, but rather with connecting your controllers to the console altogether?</p>

<p>. </p>
<p>Well, like I said mate it's a nice feature, but pressing a button isn't that big of a deal for me. It's a sweet convenience not to have to, but for me, not that much of a reason that mandatory plugging in should be hung on it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My personal feeling is pressing a button isn't that difficult :) Plus aren't the controllers connected through WiFi Direct? Now if they say the WiFi Direct antenna is in there, that's a different story.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If it is in there (which I doubt due to some comments I've read about in needing to be in the box itself), I can see why it's required to be connected continuously... I'm no expert so please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>This might also be a way to lengthen batteries life for the controller. It will no longer need to send a radio our wifi signal. It will just need to broadcast an ir beam which uses very little power? I dunno, I think you are correct though and the kinect
 is more connected to controller function than people think. That would be why kinect can't be unplugged.</p>

<p>@ Scottiths</p>

<p>I understand your point, and I'm sure (hopeful) there's a good reason besides convenience that Kinect2 is mandatory (to be plugged in). But for me, conserving battery life hardly seems like a solid reason for having to have Kinect2 plugged in at all times
 for the console to operate.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'm trying to think practicality, not convenience. I am not going to bash the Kinect2 like others, but I'm simply putting forward my perspective on the points being discussed.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>See, this can be discussed without descending into chaos... It's nice for a change!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'm happy to have the Kinect2, to pay for it, to leave it plugged in, but not so happy about it's absolute dependency. I've heard all the, "its part of the console", "its not a peripheral", "buy it or don't" statements, and I'm not lobbying for a separation
 of the two sales wise... It would just give me even more confidence in the product if the main console itself could function without the Kinect2 if required.</p>

 to get a Safe Download of Movie Maker</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now just add in your clips (photos and videos), add music, make edits, etc. Save the project first (to a .wlmp file) so you could come back to make further edits if necessary. Then save it as a movie (.mp4 file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check that the movie plays as expected, then just copy it directly to a USB drive. Safely remove the USB and connect it to your smart TV and select to play it from your TV menus. I wouldn't put it on a DVD because the MPEG-4 format isn't playable on a DVD
 player. It would be playable on a Blu-ray player, however.</p>

<p>I just use the File menu. Click on the first tab on the left (or press Alt+F).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pick the option "Save project" and that will save to a .wlmp file (WLMP stands for Windows Live Movie maker Project)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that is saved, go back to the menu and choose "Save movie". It will default to saving an .mp4 file which is your movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can now play that file and make sure it is what you want. If you want to make more edits, go ahead using the project file. Then save another copy of the movie until it looks like you want.</p>

<p>You can disable the animation.&nbsp; Type the word "animation" into the Start menu, and an option for what you seek will appear.&nbsp; Choose it, select the checkbox for "Turn off all unneccesary animations (when possible)" on the page that appears, and click OK.&nbsp;
 Taskbar display/hide will now be instant, as will several other functions that previously had animations, such as minimizing/restoring windows.</p>

    <title>fuzzy-blurry screen while laptop is in battery mode on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> butch214  say:</h3>
<h2>            fuzzy-blurry screen while laptop is in battery mode on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>why does my screen randomly turn into a blurry, fussy mess when using my&nbsp;dell laptop running windows 10&nbsp;on battery mode? It sometimes lasts 4 or 5 seconds and sometimes a minute or more before it goes back to normal screen.&nbsp;It does not do that while it's
 hooked up to the power/charger cord. I bought a new battery pack thinking that may be the cause, but no it's not. Yes,&nbsp;more than&nbsp;two weeks of using the battery pack at least once a day I would charge it back up after using just&nbsp;20% to 30% of a full charge.
 So my battery pack should be at max storage. Yes, my screen still randomly goes blurry, fuzzy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<span><span>Since your user account is corrupted I
 would suggest that we try and </span></span><span>Fix the corrupted user profile. You can try to repair it. You will need to create a new profile,
 and then copy the files from the existing profile to the new one. </span>
<span>To create a new user profile</span>
<p>
<span><span><span>To create a new profile, you must first create a new user account. When the account is created, a profile will also be created.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Open User Accounts by clicking the
</span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Start</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>
 button, clicking </span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>,
 clicking </span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>User Accounts and Family Safety</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>
 (or clicking </span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>User Accounts</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>,
 if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking </span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>User Accounts</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<span><strong>Manage another account</strong></span>. <span>
&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<span><strong>Create a new account</strong></span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Create Account</strong></span></span><span>.
</span></span></p>
<span>To copy files to the new user profile</span>
<p>
<span><span><span>After you create the profile, you can copy the files from the existing profile. You must have at least three user accounts on the computer to complete
 these steps, including the new account you just created.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Log on as a user other than the new user you just created or the user that you want to copy files from.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Open Documents by clicking the
</span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Start</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>
 button, and then clicking </span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Documents</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span>

<br />
but hit a problem in so far as I'm trying&nbsp;to transfer a User Account&nbsp;on the same computer. The link suggests i should just be able to treat the old user account as being on the old computer and the new user account as on the new computer. However on progressing
 through Easy Transfer there is a message "Windows cannot detect the other computer on your network", even though basically the 2 User Accounts are on the same computer, or indeed, in my case are connected to the same network - i.e. over a wireless router.<br />
<br />
Do I have to use a separate device to transfer the files to? I do have an external hard drive. Would it be better to try to transfer using this?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.

            Dear Uma R,<br />
<br />
Further to my last post, I have endeavoured to use the Windows Easy Transfer facility using an external hard drive.<br />
<br />
I presume as I only want to transfer my User Account, I should use the 'My user account, files, and settings only' option and then look to exclude the User Account at the next stage.<br />
<br />
However, when I come to choose the options, there is no obvious way to exclude the old user account.<br />
<br />
I presume I should be looking in 'Windows Settings', but there is no specific 'User Account' as I thought would be obvious. I have expanded all the options to try to establish if there is an obvious setting, but nothing leaps out as being the obvious one.<br />
<br />
Consequently, I'd be grateful for a step-by-step guide through this next part of the Easy Transfer process.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.<br />

To any Moderator,<br />
<br />
Please could you look at this issue again.<br />
<br />
It&nbsp;seems&nbsp;to be a fundamental flaw in the advice to restore a User Account.<br />
<br />
The advice does not give details on <strong>how to exclude</strong> the corrupted User Account from the Easy Transfer process.<br />
<br />
I presume I cannot use my back up either as this will contain the corrupted file.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't an improved fix be to simply copy into the corrupted User Account&nbsp;a 'clean' User Account file, rather than setting up a new User Account. Presumably with a new User Account, the paths to things such as the Outlook .pst file, IE Favourites and so on
 will all be different?<br />
<br />
I'd be very grateful for your help here.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.

Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I'm understand exactly what you want to correct here.&nbsp; The instructions was to copy the settings from the old profile to the new profile except for the corrupted parts.&nbsp; Is that what you done so far?<br />
<br />
Let us knows,

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean install
<br />You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

</p><blockquote>Hi. <br />
<br />
Try to enter Safe Mode to later repair. <br />
Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC <br />
If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive
 times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />
Then you proceed to repair the computer: <br />
With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to
 default factory settings. <br />
Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again. <br />
Select Reset. <br />
If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />
After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen.
<br />
Click on Reset and the resetting should begin. <br />
<br />
Would you be so kind to say if this solved the problem? </blockquote>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Nothing appeared to work. as suggested. I ended up installing win 8.1 and had it vindicated through Microsoft so I ended up having 2 OS 's on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did an update to win 10 pro and is now functioning as the second OS on my computer. Its being running for 3 days now . I now need to know how to<strong> delete the first win 10 pro</strong> which is still glitchy.</p>

 superfetch enabled.So my question is,if there is some trick so i can still have superfetch disabled but readyboost enabled ?

<p>Hi SmokeyD,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>Disk cache is used by the system to cache recently used data.&nbsp; ReadyBoost uses the intelligent memory management of Windows SuperFetch to pick small amounts of data that are slow to get from the hard disk cache and makes a copy of them on the flash drive.&nbsp;
 It's important to remember that this is only a copy, so even if the stick is unplugged, no data is lost and the system keeps going.&nbsp; The net result is that when the system needs to access small pieces of non-contiguous data, it can get it much faster from
 the flash drive than the hard disk.&nbsp; If the system needs to access larger chunks of data, it simply uses the hard disk.&nbsp; At this point it is important to point out that we use AES-128 to encrypt everything that we write to the device, so if you remove the
 device, your data stored on the device is still secured.</p>
<p>So, I suggest you to enable superfetch and then you can use the Ready boost feature.</p>

<h2>            How to change the quality of the video while editing in Windows Live Movie Maker</h2>
                    Hey there, I have been using Windows Live Movie Maker for a long time now, and each time I use it, it freezes and lags very often. This happens especially when I add a new clip in, or when I'm simply just trying to preview my movie. The quality of my videos
 are very good while editing, but it comes at a cost since editing them is a big problem. Being patient doesn't really work because it happens so often. I remember one time, when I added a clip (that I already processed before) into the movie, it gave me a
 popup that suggested to lower the quality of the clip so that WMM would run more smoothly. I did, and even though the quality was slightly lower, I noticed that there was no lag or freezing at all! It was extremely easy and fast to complete my movie and upload
 it, and on youtube the quality was still perfectly fine like all my other videos. I'm just wondering, is there any way for me to change the quality of my movie while I am editing it, so that it won't freeze up? (I am not talki

            <p>Yes, that blue menu is what is known as the File menu. Under that you have Options. That's where the Advanced settings would be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it seems like you may not have the latest version. Your title says Windows&nbsp;<em>Live</em> Movie Maker. The "Live" branding was dropped after 2011 so that the latest version is just called Movie Maker 2012.<br />

<h2>            US based Xbox 360 S compatibility with other Xbox models available is India</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having Xbox 360 S model, which includes kinect sensor, 250 GB hard disk and few US based games. Recently it is not working due to some hardware issue. This device were originally purchased in US and compatible with same region. Now I have relocated
 in India and I have used this same device for sometime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some assistance, understanding on below few queries -</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If it is not get repaired in India </p>
<p>1) can 250 GB hard disk of existing&nbsp; Xbox 360 S model (US based) compatible with other Xbox models available in India (Xbox 360 S, Xbox 360 E and Xbox one and so ....)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) can kinect sensor of existing&nbsp; Xbox 360 S model (US based) compatible with other Xbox models available in India (Xbox 360 S, Xbox 360 E and Xbox one and so ....)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) can remote (joystick) of existing&nbsp; Xbox 360 S model (US based) compatible with other Xbox models available in India (Xbox 360 S, Xbox 360 E and Xbox one and so ....)?</p>
<p>

<p><strong>1) can 250 GB hard disk of existing&nbsp; Xbox 360 S model (US based) compatible with other Xbox models available in India (Xbox 360 S, Xbox 360 E and Xbox one and so ....)?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, they're all interchangeable with other xbox 360 models except the original white xbox 360, which uses a different hard drive on top. The xbox one's hard drive can not be switched.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2) can kinect sensor of existing&nbsp; Xbox 360 S model (US based) compatible with other Xbox models available in India (Xbox 360 S, Xbox 360 E and Xbox one and so ....)?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, they are all compatibly with each other. Note that the kinect for xbox one will not work on xbox 360 as that's a Kinect 2.0 and the xbox 360 must use a kinect 1.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3) can remote (joystick) of existing&nbsp; Xbox 360 S model (US based) compatible with other Xbox models available in India (Xbox 360 S, Xbox 360 E and Xbox one and so ....)?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can use all xbox 360 controllers on all other xbox 360s. But you can not use them on an xbox one, you'll need an xbox one controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that won't work is the power supply/power brick. The USA uses 110V/60hz while India uses 220v/50hz and if you plug in the wrong power supply it will literally destroy your USA console - like smoke and maybe fire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, digital games bought in another region may not work anymore if you migrate your account to India
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/accountmigration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://live.xbox.com/accountmigration</a> Make sure you read all the warnings before you migrate your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disc games from the USA will NOT work in an India console because they are region locked. a PAL console (India) can NOT play an NSTC (USA) game. It's the same as DVD region locks. Xbox one does not have this disc region lock but xbox 360 does.</p>

<h2>            No default e-mail application registered on computer.</h2>
                    <p>Have just upgraded to Windows 10 and am using the Microsoft Mail app. &nbsp;When attempting to e-mail a scan from my Brother printer, I get the following: "There is no default e-mail application registered on your computer. &nbsp;Please configure the default e-mail
 application."</p>
<p>Mail is selected as my default program, and in "Set Program Access and Computer Defaults," under "Custom", the only choice for e-mail is "Use my current e-mail program."</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

            This happens if the printer or the scanner software is using MAPI (API) to attach files to mail. That means, you'll need a desktop mail client like Thunderbird, Mailbird or Office Outlook in order to support sending files to mail directly. The Mail app
 doesn't support MAPI.

    <title>Sick of Dashboard Advertising... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sick of Dashboard Advertising...</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know about the rest of you, but I for one am sick of all this dashboard advertising. Xbox live is a paid service and we all dish out every month to play our favorite games online. We should not have to be subject to the rediculous amount of advertising
 and uncustomizable dashboard.</p>
<p>I mean really, the home page on the dashboard is currently 3/4 advertising with my current disc game accounting for only 1/3rd of the 1/4 left over space.</p>
<p>This is getting to be rediculous and with each update we get more and more advertising that we are all PAYING to see....complete BS.</p>
<p>I do not use my Xbox as a media center or for apps, thats what our computers, tablets and smart phones are for. If Microsoft put half the effort into developing new and good games as they do into dashboard advertising updates and useless media apps, there
 would be no comparison which system is the best.</p>
<p>My desire to leave xbox live increases everyday when I am forced to be subjected to advertising that I am paying to not want to look at.</p>
<p>Oh for the day when a game console is exactly that.....a game console.</p>
<p>Shame on you Microsoft.</p>

<li>from the dashboard use RB to scroll to the settings section of the dashboard and press A to select
</li><li>scroll to highlight 'Console settings' and press A to select it. </li><li>scroll to highlight 'Startup and Shutdown' and press A to select it. </li><li>scroll to 'Startup' and press A to select it. </li><li>scroll to Disc and press A to select it. </li></ol>
<p>Now when you start up you Xbox 360, it will automatically load any game disc in your disc tray, totally bypassing the dashboard and any ads located there. If you just want to play games on your Xbox 360 and nothing else, this would be a pretty good option.</p>

<p>3/4 of the time I don't see ANY advertisements at all for my dashboard still doesn't load properly upon startup since the last dashboard update, which is just fine with me, I simply start the game via the guide button which bypasses the blank dash entirely,
 best "glitch" ever! &nbsp;Just don't tell the sponsors for I don't think that they'd be too pleased with Microsoft if they were to find out that their paid billboards were invisible...:-)</p>

<p>Agreed.&nbsp; The cost of Xbox LIVE has always been overinflated and the ads are there strictly to generate additional revenue, not to make up for a shortfall.</p>

<p>I agree with the OP 100%. This is completely ridiculous. I do not agree with Switch because let's say you want to replace the game inside the tray with another one, the console will start, you have to hit the home button, then see that ugly dashboard, then
 put a new game in it. Doesn't make any sense. We should have the option to disable this dashboard that looks like vomit anyway. At least let us Gold subscribers choose what we want.</p>

<p>Yeah, the only alternative I find is once you get to the Dashboard, hit the Guide button and use the Xbox Guide, which is similar to the old blade design.</p>

<p>So, with out the Gold membership fees, and ads, what services would we loose? It all costs money to provide all the services to us. Many are free yet cost to create them.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fees are too high, but they've never changed. Do we get more value for the money now, or when the fees were first introduced?
</p>
<p>The ads only promote services, promotions, contests that are available on Xbox Live. At least that is all I ever see. You could just ignore them, they are not full page ads. At least they are not as of now.</p>

<p>These would be helped me if you navigate me to how to back up to the offical windows 10 pro version without lose the datas, or maybe ward of the issue of targeted error... With a basic solvation method as you order, rarely help with an seriously windows
 problame like that.</p>

            Hi Ariel... try the following to clear up windows update.
<br />Go to search and type services.msc and open it.
<br />Stop the  Background Intelligent Transfer Service and Windows Update 
<br />Then go to file explorer and go to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution
<br />Delete everything in that folder.
<br />Then Right click your start button and go to powershell (Admin)
<br />Run the following hitting enter after each line.
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver
<br />
<br />Reboot and see if that works.

            Hi Ariel, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily turn off any 3rd Party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />Windows 10 Pro for workstations probably cannot be upgraded using update assistant.
<br />
<br />Try updating to 1809 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

<p>I bought the xbox one for my father and since it never greeted by name before, the fact that his info was under MY email was never an issue. Now the system greets and I don't think he'll very much enjoy HIS system greeting him under MY NAME. Is there anyway
 to change this?</p>

<h2>            Open GL 2.0 and 1.4 render not supported after upgrade to windows 10 on angry birds game</h2>
                    <p>I did follow the fix that Microsoft had fixed when the XP upgrades had same problem but that did not fix this one and I'm not getting any other error message to follow.&nbsp; the drivers again changed to a Microsoft generic version after reinstalling drivers&nbsp;
 Still getting message.&nbsp; Is there another thing I have to turn on so that this works.&nbsp; Seems like the other games grandson plays are working fine, just the angry birds have this issue.&nbsp; Could use some help.&nbsp; Thanks for being here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other night after upgrade I lost sound and we found all the fixes here.&nbsp; Sure hoping this one goes also.&nbsp;

            <p>not number one because the game is from a disc we have from Roxio... I did go to their site and download their GL extension that has fixed earlier upgrade problems but that did not work. Have email to them also though since it happened after the ten upgrade
 there is something that needs to be turned on I think just like I had to do with the sound after the upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did number 2 and 3 when it happened and nothing yet.&nbsp; I will try again in the morning and see if that has helped.&nbsp;

            just put game on different/new computer and it did not have the problem.&nbsp; The friend using old computer doesn't play the game so it's not a problem.&nbsp; So it had no fix needed.&nbsp; Just didn't reload the game on that one because you only get to use it a few
 times and I decided to just buy him new computer because the one he was using of mine was an older laptop

    <title>Unknown software Exception error message at shutdown. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> koven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown software Exception error message at shutdown.</h2>
                    I get the following message when I shut down - "The exception unknown software exception 0xc000005 occurred in the application at location 0x768CBE16".&nbsp; It will shut down normally and start up normally, but it has been plaguing us since we took this computer
 out of the box.&nbsp; I can't see any problem that it causes because everything runs fine, but I want to create a backup disk without having an error message on it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Running Vista SP1.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!

            <span>Shutdown issues are generally caused by a program and/or process that is refusing to exit gracefully. The program and/or process can be from malware or can be legitimate (such as an invasive antivirus like Norton or McAfee).
 If you are using a Norton or McAfee product,&nbsp; uninstall it and replace with a better program such as NOD32, Kasperksy, or Avast (free). The Windows Firewall is adequate for most people. With Vista, shutdown issues can also be caused by old/poorly written drivers
 so make sure all drivers are updated. See Step B. below for general driver directions.<br />
<br />
A.The first step is always to make sure your computer is virus/malware free.<br />
<br />
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware<br />
<br />
B. Drivers - The First Law of Driver Updates is "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Normally if everything is working you want to leave things as they are. The exception is that heavy-duty gamers will usually want to update their video and sound drivers to squeeze
 every last bit of performance out of the hardware to get the fastest frame rates. If you're not one of those people, you don't need to update your drivers if there are no problems you are trying to solve.<br />
<br />
Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />
<br />
http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html - Belarc Advisor<br />
http://www.gtopala.com/ - System Information for Windows<br />
<br />
C. If the computer is virus/malware-free, drivers are current, and no Norton or McAfee programs are installed, then do clean-boot troubleshooting to see which program/process is the culprit:<br />
<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Vista and XP - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796<br />
<br />
D. If you need more information, here is an excellent shutdown troubleshooter:<br />
<br />
http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/shtdwnxp.htm<br />
<br />
Standard caveat: If troubleshooting the issue is too difficult - and there is absolutely no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a computer repair shop. This will not be your local BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. Get
 recommendations from family, friends, colleagues.</span>
