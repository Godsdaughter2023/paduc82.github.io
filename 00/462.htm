<h2>            Excel 2016 - test a range of cells for &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a range of cells. lets say A1:A10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three possible values in these cells - "Y", "N", "N/A".</p>
<p>I want to create a cell that checks the value of the range.</p>
<p>If the range has all "Y"s, I will populate the cell with a "pass"</p>
<p>if the range has any "N"s, I will populate the cell with a "fail"</p>
<p>if the range has any "N/A"s, I will populate the cell with a "N/A"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Iain</p>

<h2>            My computer have some issues with the Webcam diver</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original Title:&nbsp;Webcam Driver&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Monitor Integrated Webcam In my Dell SP2008WFP model monitor doesn't work in build 14295 it is installed correctly in 14291 at this time and it has a whopping 26 drivers installed right now but in 14295 it only had 2.......trying to update the driver
 in 14295 is no help because it say it found a driver for it but it had a problem installing it .......and then it says something like it is not working on this platform or something like that.&nbsp; But it works in 14291 however when I did a reset of my 14291 I
 had to unplug all my USB connected hard drive and accessories including the webcam and the reset went smoothly I booted to my desktop and promptly reconnected all my USB devices with the normal installing pop ups when you connect External HDD's and such.&nbsp;
 But when I check device manager the Monitor integrated webcam device has a little yellow exclamation mark on it and when I query it's properties it says it doesn't work and the driver can be found but can't be installed......I have restored my computer from
 an image of 14291 when the camera was installed without errors and it works with my Proprietary Dell Webcam software but the native windows camera app doesn't work says you've disconnected your camera roll and you'll need to reconnect it in order to use the
 camera app.</p>

<h3> janevir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need a third-party app for syncing Outlook contacts to an iPhone 5c</h2>
                    <p>I had a Windows phone I was completely happy with and my life was "perfectly synced"...but then it took a dive into the toilet and I was given an iPhone 5c (can't look a gift horse in the mouth when you'd have to pay full price for a phone).&nbsp; I loved my
 Windows phone and now that I can compare it to an iPhone from personal experience, I really miss it.&nbsp; But I digress...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What is the best third-party app to use for syncing my Contacts in Outlook 2010 to my iPhone?&nbsp; I need one that will constantly keep them updated when I either add a contact on my phone or add one to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Important:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; I DO NOT want to use iTunes or iCloud, as both of those have caused me great consternation (and hours of wasted time) because they did not sync properly with Outlook,&nbsp;multiplying and mixing&nbsp;up all my contacts.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; I would&nbsp;like the app&nbsp;(if possible) to sync Contacts from Outlook.com.&nbsp; And my Outlook Calendar.&nbsp; I DO NOT need to sync email.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; I DO NOT use Microsoft Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<h3> jackbutcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Editing shared documents via online and offline</h2>
                    
<p>I work in a business where multiple people need to access and edit files. We all use OneDrive.<br />
<br />
For example everyone who the file is shared with can edit and see live the edits being made when using online Excel.<br />
<br />
If someone opens the document with the Excel office application it does not update to the shared OneDrive.<br />
<br />
Could someone help me out with this issue as the documents need to be kept up to date constantly and not everyone is comfortable using the online editor, it defeats the purpose of having the access to the file in the the File Explorer as it will only save locally
 and not update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Jack Butcher</p>

            <p>I have and continue to have this problem.&nbsp; I can fix it by running the Windows Fix Printer application as an administrator but the fix is only temporary.&nbsp; My patience with Windows 10 is failing and think I might have to go back to Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; Here
 is the link to the fix.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-printer-problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual issue is that print spooler services is not running.&nbsp; I have changed the registry to automatic, saved and rebooted but it always seams to stop.&nbsp;

<p>Just another question since I'm trying to grasp the issue, so forgive me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said above "<span>Microsoft edge is blocking access to google". If you open edge and enter www.msn.com, does that connect, or do you still get the same message? I'm assuming you get the same message.</span></p>

    <title>How can you tell if a message has been resent&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cherylwright  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can you tell if a message has been resent&#63;</h2>
                    I've sent a few emails by scheduled delivery, which all came back as undelivered, so I've been resending them, but I can't tell if the original message has been resent (so may well be resending them twice) even though I've been trying to make sure the
 original is deleted once the new one has gone, and if I look in my sent file only the original messages show up (which are flagged as undelivered in the tracking column). &nbsp;Is there a way of being able to tell if a message has been resent?

            <p><span>Unfortunately it is&nbsp;not possible to find out if&nbsp;the emails were delivered&nbsp;to the recipients,&nbsp;for the messages which&nbsp;were already sent from Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>But in future to avoid this issue you can try the&nbsp;steps given below:</span></p>
<p><span>You can try enabling the read receipt and delivery receipt&nbsp;option in Outlook.&nbsp;This would help you in finding out if the emails were delivered and viewed by&nbsp;the&nbsp;recipients.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try the steps below to 'Enable read receipts' in Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on file-&gt;Outlook Options-&gt;Mail-&gt;Tracking-&gt;Check the Box for ‘delivery receipts confirming the message was delivered to the recipient’s e-mail server and also check the Box for ‘read receipt confirming the recipients viewed the messages.</span></p>
<p><span>(Note: Not all email servers and application support sending receipts)</span></p>

            I already have read receipts as standard, but this doesn't tell me immediately if the undelivered message has been resent, which was my original question.&nbsp; I left some to be delivered over the weekend, but according to my sent messages folder they all
 went on Friday timed as I set them up, which I know didn't happen, so the time is false.&nbsp; I think this is just a fault with Outlook that it isn't versatile enough; maybe it has been fixed when using with Server 2008 (we're still on 2003) but this I'll probably
 never find out.

<h2>            &#34;Word could not ....Check the temp environment variable.&#34; when trying to change read only access.</h2>
                    <p>I have already changed in the registrar "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_CURRENT_USER \Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders"</span>&nbsp;to have &nbsp;the following "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache"
 in cache.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;That took care of the message when &nbsp;open the word program up. But I noticed that I can not save the file because it is read only. When I try and change that I get the dreaded message.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2e24818-b157-434b-a056-803266a12448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2e24818-b157-434b-a056-803266a12448" /></a></p>
<p>And when I check to see if it is read only access still it is. for the life of me I cant figure out how to make this message to go away and for the access not to be read only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also The documents folder is on my OneDrive so I think it has to do with the environment variable for one drive. Do you happen to know where in the registry it is assigned that variable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited I also noticed that my both my documents folder on my local machine and the documents folder on OneDrive are ready only and can not be changed. When I do change them they it seems like it works how ever when I go back to properties it hasn't really
 changed at all.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Remember, every time you close a document, the temp files are deleted, put into the recycle bin. And if you have the autobackup feature turned on, the .bak file will be deleted too.&nbsp; So if you have separate problems with the recycle bin, it would impact

<h2>            SIGN IN REQUIRED prompt on only 1 of 5 machines with Office 365</h2>
                    On only one of my 5 machines with Office 365 installed, I get prompt "SIGN IN REQUIRED Sign in as [myemailaddress] to verify the account associated with your Office 365 subscription." every time I open an Office application.&nbsp; Problem started on 8/9/2018
 (I think).&nbsp; I do not stay logged in to my Microsoft account on any of my machines nor do I want to.&nbsp; I tried repairing Office 365, Deactivated it from the Office Account site, uninstalled it, and then installed it back on from the Office account site but it
 still prompts me to sign-in, as if I "have to" stay signed in to use my Office 365 applications, but I know I do not have to.

<p>Should have troubleshot more before posting the above, but resolved the issue shortly afterwards.&nbsp; It turned out to be a user profile registry issue.&nbsp; In short, I resolved the issue as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created another user account in Windows 10 Pro, logged into it, opened Excel and Word and did not get the "SIGN IN REQUIRED" prompt.&nbsp; I logged back into my regular Windows 10 profile, opened the registry editor, backed up my Outlook profile, deleted my
 "current user" office folder, then restored my Outlook profile back into the registry.&nbsp; All is good now.&nbsp; Have no idea what caused this problem all of the sudden but suspect it may have been due to a similar issue that happened almost two weeks ago (Googe
 search "Office 365 "The fine print" popup message - is it legitimate?").</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have your EXACT same problem.&nbsp; One user account works fine, the other constantly prompts for an office 365 sign-in.&nbsp; I don't use outlook at all.&nbsp; Can you tell me in more detail what you did (and where) to the registry?&nbsp; Like you, this problem has surfaced
 in the past few days.</p>

<p>No problem Paul.&nbsp; See the below.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Please note that you have to be careful when editing the registry.&nbsp; Also, when you navigate in the registry to the location mentioned in the below steps, be certain you are opening up the "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" section as mentioned in below steps, and not
 another registry branch! </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>1. Login to the Windows account that has the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Make sure all Office applications are closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Open the registry editor (regedit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. On the left pane, navigate to and select the "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. (Optional but recommended) Right-click on the "Office" folder, choose export, then name and save the .reg file to your desktop (or some other location if you wish).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Name the file whatever you want (I named mine as "HKCU_SW_MS_Office.reg" which is short for the registry path).&nbsp; Keep in mind that when you do the next step (step 6) you will loose any personal office application settings (i.e. it will be like the
 first time you opened each app).&nbsp; Also, the same applies if you have other Office apps like Visio, Project etc. that were purchased separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note added on 8/21/2018: </strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"IF" you use Outlook, see my 8/21/2018 reply to "WordsBySusan" on how to backup and restore Outlook profiles PRIOR to performing the next step (step 6).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Right click on the "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office" folder and choose delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Close the registry editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Open your Office application(s) and hopefully you will no longer get the SIGN IN REQUIRED prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added Note: The registry file you created in step 5 above can be used to restore your original current user office settings (including the "sign in required" problem)&nbsp; if for some reason you wish to do so (but should be unnecessary unless you had some custom
 app settings that you can't live without, or recreate etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

</p><p>Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem returned for me as well.&nbsp; Not sure if it had anything to do with the updates that got installed today or not.&nbsp; I went through the steps I posted again and it is back to normal but not certain if it will stay fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if the problem had something to do with some of the Windows 10 settings (if you are on Windows 10).&nbsp; I suggest you take a look at the below settings which I stumbled on today during some further research into the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Settings &gt; Accounts:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Your Info - If you sign-in to Windows with a local account (versus a Microsoft account) make sure it shows your name, local account, Administrator (if appl.) and not your Microsoft account.&nbsp; If it lists a Microsoft account and you don't want that, there
 should be a link to click on to stop signing on to the Microsoft account and then it will show the local account.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Note: I always use a local account to login to the machine but it appears I accidentally changed that to a Microsoft account when I previously clicked on the sign-in prompt and clicked "next" rather than choosing the "Only Microsoft Apps" links on the left
 side of that dialog window ( I recall neither was an option I wanted to select).</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Sign-in options - Scroll all the way to the bottom of the sign-in options and under Privacy, make sure the two settings listed are set the way you want them to be. The last one "Use my sign-in info to automatically...after an update or restart" setting was
 on and I turned that off.&nbsp; Took me a while to cool off once I saw that such a setting even existed and was turned on by default.&nbsp; Not sure if that is a new setting that was added recently or has been there since Windows 10 v1803 was released this past April.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of things I do know at this point.&nbsp; The return of the problem was not due to the normal monthly updates because my machine had not updated yet.&nbsp; Also, as part of my attempted fixes, I did a full system restore back to Aug. 5 and the problem was
 still there.&nbsp; I have always used a local account as well and can confirm that my machine is set up as such now.&nbsp; By the way, the account I am using is a standard account (not an administrator) - but the problem also occurs on the administrative account I only
 rarely use.&nbsp; I have switched my normal account between standard and administrative several times to see if that could be the issue, but that does not seem to solve the problem.&nbsp; Finally, I have had the "Use my sign-on to automatically update...." setting on
 for months.&nbsp; My understanding is that it just allows the overall monthly update process to run to completion without requiring log-on credentials after a restart.&nbsp; I don't think that is the root cause of the problem here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can think of that might be triggering this is renewing my Office 365 subscription.&nbsp; I originally installed and activated Office 365 as part of an install that came with a new Dell computer a little over a year ago.&nbsp; The license was shown
 as coming from Dell. Less than a month ago, I renewed the 365 subscription and it transferred the license to Microsoft.&nbsp; For a few weeks all was well.&nbsp; But if Office phones home once a month, perhaps that could be the problem.&nbsp; The other new item for me, is
 that within the last month I also activated another machine under my Office 365 subscription - I have two machines active of the five allowed.&nbsp; In a little over a week I will be activating a third.&nbsp; I suppose the addition of multiple machines under my subscription
 could also be causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that we are both having this problem, it is probably not something either of us actually did.&nbsp; I, like you, have reapplied the fix you outlined.&nbsp; Nine hours later all still works, but I doubt it will last the day.&nbsp; Perhaps the fix should be applied
 to HKEY Local Machine as opposed to HKEY current user.<br />
</p>

<p>Paul,<br />
I have not got the prompt again and has been two days since I repeated the steps again. Fingers crossed the issue does not return!&nbsp; As for the settings I suggested you check, I did not think changing those would resolve the issue.&nbsp; I was basically out of ideas
 and was looking for things I thought may be related to the problem in some way.&nbsp; Yesterday, I all the sudden had a different issue on the same machine.&nbsp; I received the below notification:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft account problem<br />
We need to fix your Microsoft account (most likely your password changed).&nbsp; Select here to fix it in Shared experiences settings.&nbsp; 8:25 PM</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I think I fixed the above issue but have no idea why it popped up all the sudden, and I am thinking it is a separate issue having nothing to do with the sign-in required issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the comments in your latest post…I am on my fifth year of using Office 365 and have always had it through Microsoft (i.e. not transferred from Dell like yours).&nbsp; I have not added Office to any PCs any time recently, and I renew my subscription
 around mid-February each year.&nbsp; Regarding your thought about applying the fix to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, if you delete the Office folder under there the Office install will no longer function unless you were talking about uninstalling Office and then deleting
 that folder in the registry if it is still there.&nbsp; I agree with you that neither you nor I did something to cause the problem.&nbsp; I wonder if it happens due to some change Microsoft made, possibly where our systems look for licensing or EULA acceptance information
 (who knows).&nbsp; Guess we will just have to see if the issue returns and if it does, I hope that it happens to many people so we can find a fix on the web or MS will fix it for us.</p>

<p>This just started happening to our 40 clinicians who use Office 365 subscriptions in the last few days</p>
<p>
</p><p>We share 10-person subscriptions so do not want users to be signed on to Office all the time so this seems like a policy change by Microsoft because we have used properly activated Office 365 subscriptions but without being signed on because we do not want
 to share information between those using the same subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives Microsoft?&nbsp; Why this policy change?</p>

            My issue with Auto-Complete is using my FAVORITES in the address bar.&nbsp; I am not one to scroll through favorites, folders, etc., to find a destination.&nbsp; In Explorer, I've been accustomed to typing a few letters and my favorite automatically populates (or
 shows on an available list).&nbsp; Edge gives me NONE of this.&nbsp; Hope that gets corrected soon.

            <p>I'm moving my post from the IE11 forum to Edge:</p>
<p>I'm on Windows 10, Build 10240, Edge browser. Each time I go to my Hotmail account I have to type in my full email address. It wasn't like that in IE11 where I just type the first letter and there's a dropdown&nbsp;and I click my email address. I do have 'Save
 form entries' on in Advanced settings. Also, I have Autocomplete Form History unchecked in CCleaner. The autocomplete works on some sites but not on other sites (like Hotmail). This version of Windows was an upgrade from Windows 7, so all of the settings should
 have stayed the same. And all the usual remedies like clearing browser cache etc. don't work, we need

            This is really annoying. I have to type in my FULL email address&nbsp;EVERY time I&nbsp;log in to Hotmail. And considering Hotmail/Outlook is owned by Microsoft, one would&nbsp;expect autocomplete to work on that website.&nbsp;Useless bunch of overpaid morons.&nbsp;Hey Satya,

None of the steps you suggested work. I even rebooted several times. Microsoft Edge auto complete still doesn't function. When does Microsoft plan to fix this problem as I have not seen anything definitive adequately addressing this vexing issue.? Does anyone
 have any other ideas? I do not use a proxy server making another suggested fix useless. Are there many others experiencing this annoying problem? If so, then Microsoft should do something about it rather quickly. Furthermore, auto complete in Microsoft Edge
 should have been thoroughly tested under numerous scenarios and conditions prior to release. I believe Microsoft has some serious explaining to do here.

                    When I use the touchscreen on my Windows 8 laptop on Microsoft Word 2013 to scroll up or down the touch-screen keyboard keeps popping up, and I was wondering how would you disable it from automatically popping up everytime?

</p><p>It may not be that one formula that is causing the issue. &nbsp;It could be another one in the workbook.</p>
<p>You can find references to other workbooks by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use key combination <strong>Ctrl + F </strong>to access the Find Dialog</p>
<p>2. Enter this into the Search Box: <strong>[</strong></p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>4. Make sure that you have selected: Within: <strong>Workbook</strong>, Search:
<strong>By Rows</strong> &amp; Look In: <strong>Formulas</strong></p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Find All</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This should bring up all cells that reference another workbook. &nbsp;Double Check to make sure the references are correct and no file names have changed.</p>

    <title>Best practice alternate email for admin roles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petermalling6454  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best practice alternate email for admin roles</h2>
                    
<p>Each of our O365 admins use a dedicated account only for O365 admin purposes (mainly using Admin Center). They also have a regular user account that they use to log into O365 for email and other personal use.</p>
<p>It is possible to use the personal email address (on the O365 tenant) as the alternate email address for the admin account. In some respects I would find this more secure than using a private email totally outside our tenant. Would you recommend this for
 the majority of admins? (We have about 50 admins, mostly password and user mgmt).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could then have a couple of global admins for whom a private email is used as alternate email (in case the tenant is unavailable), while for the majority of admins we use their O365 regular user account.</p>
<p>Would you recommend this approach?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Peter Malling.</p>

<p>hi peter,</p>
<p>we can use the personal email address (on the o365 tenant) as the alternate email address for the admin account. however, it’s not recommended. this alternative email address is used for important notifications, including resetting the admin password, so
 the user must be able to access the email account whether he/she can access office 365 or not. in this article
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/assigning-admin-roles-in-office-365-eac4d046-1afd-4f1a-85fc-8219c79e1504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            OneDrive pops up at random times, very annoying</h2>
                    <p>I rarely use One drive, but then it only allows for a storage space of 5GBs, which is very small by today's standards.&nbsp; I don't know what it is now, but before, I found triggers within the Task Scheduler which I DELETED from the Task Scheduler.&nbsp; The issue
 went away for some time, and it just now reared it's nasty head again.&nbsp; It doesn't pop up with just one window (similar to Windows Explorer), but with 2 of them when it does happen.&nbsp; I have seen it pop up as many as 3 of them things in one go.&nbsp; I don't need
 this sort of thing popping up interrupting the work that I am doing on the computer.&nbsp; I want to be rid of this annoying issue, though not necessarily rid of the app itself.</p>

            Hi RRDodge,
<br />
<br />If like me, you rarely use OneDrive, you should uninstall it altogether. Then if you do want to back up a file or two, you can just open OneDrive in a browser and copy the files into Onedrive that way . . .
<br />
<br />OneDrive can be uninstalled like any other application from Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />
<br />Also, Open Task Manager - Startup Tab and disable OneDrive on that tab ...       
        </p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;BradYarbrough,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience, the issue most probably occurs on POP accounts. If you are using a POP account, please go to Tool &gt; Accounts &gt; Advanced &gt; Folders, then choose the
<strong>Don't store a copy of sent messages,&nbsp;</strong>and check if it helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not in this situation, please close Outlook, go to mail web application and check if the issue persists on web side. If so, you need to contact your mail provider for further assistance. If the issue only occurs on Outlook for Mac, you can contact
 in-app support. We have dedicated team to help you with the issue. Please click <strong>
Help &gt; Contact support</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

<p>I have Outlook on two email accounts.&nbsp; One is provided through Cox.&nbsp; Its web mail does not seem to have the duplication issue.&nbsp; It seems go occur only within Outlook.&nbsp; It is this cox.net account which creates dozens of duplicate emails in the SENT folder.&nbsp;
 Attempts to delete them from that folder only results in more duplicates in the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other email account is through my company's domain name (*****.com).&nbsp; I always end up with two copies of a sent email in my SENT folder.</p>

<p>Hi Daryl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "My outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication" option may not be enabled and that is why you're seeing the error message whenever you send an email. We recommend that you check the "Outgoing Server" in "Internet E-mail Settings"&nbsp; to see if the option

<h2>            I keep getting 400 error messages its driving me nuts</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I have an error that is driving me absolutely nuts. I am not fully computer savy which is possibly half the battle as I need really specific instructions to be able to do things and make changes to settings. Basically im a computer user but not trained in
 how to fix it and cant afford to pay someone to fix things. Also I have an eye condition which causes me a lot of pain and I cant stay connected to the internet too long before I have to get off and rest my eyes. If I dont I end up with severe headaches, neck
 and back issues and am currently waiting on further surgery. So I need to limit my time on the computer or I pay for it physically. So im limited in time to learn how to fix things. Theres all these different 400 error messages.</p>
<p>I have these 400 errors... example:<br />
</p>
<p><span>HTTP Error 400. The request verb is invalid.</span></p>
<p><span>further errors:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">HTTP Error 400. The request URL is invalid.</span><br />

<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Another error says:</span><br />

<p>It is almost impossible to get to a web page or it takes several reclicking of the browser line to be able to finally get to a page. i get there and if I click on something on the page I starts again with the errors and I have to complete the above process.
 Its making going on to the internet a complete misery. i hate having to use my computer but need to. I keep up to date with all my virus scans and up dates and try to keep my computer up to date. I even run defrag on a regular basis. My son came over on the
 week end and we "reimaged" wiped the computer and reinstalled everything. I have used up pretty much all of my data trying to resolve this and I still have no joy. I am so close to tears right now trying to fix this and have already spent too long today on
 the internet and have extreme pain. Sorry im a bit emotional right now but if you know how to fix this and stop it please let me know. Im not angry just completely frustrated as I dont have the knowledge on how to resolve this.</p>

    <title>Find My Phone Accuracy.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leftysgirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Find My Phone Accuracy....</h2>
                    <p>How accurate is the Find My Phone location service? A neighbor turned my smashed phone into us today, but the find my phone service was stating it was 6 miles away at a specific home address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the long winded-details : )-&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I drove a mile down the road with my phone on top of my roof! It was in a shock proof case-military screen, &nbsp;etc. When I realized what I did, I turned around to look for it, but I couldn't find it. So I went home and logged on to Find My Phone after scouring
 the front yard/driveway etc. My husband called my phone, and it rang like normal. We couldn't find it driving our way back either. I used the Find My Phone service, and it gave me a specific address to a persons home 6 miles away, about 30 minutes later. In
 a gated community of course, and we could not get in. I reported it to the police next morning, and hung up signs for my missing phone outside that person community hoping it was a good Samaritan who picked it up. I added my address too on the signs hoping,
 maybe they would just put it in my mailbox! haha..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well a smashed phone was found on our street today as reported by a neighbor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So could it be possible that the locating service was wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a theory that the person may have drove back here and threw the phone out the window. We kept calling it, and even texted them their address. The police showed up to their community as well, but I had not received a clear answer from the cops if they
 talked to the homeowner yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one have any guesses how a smashed phone may affect the GPS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            On windowsphone.com it states how large the distance can be, usually this is 1 mile or could be more depending on the surroundings (built up or not) and also states how long ago this information was, could it be possible that the address 6 miles away was
 the last time you went past and the last time that it checked the location? Something could have happened to the GPS as all the information that is sent to windowsphone.com is done locally on your device.

<h3> budie22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Utility Chest 49</h2>
                    This week when I loaded IE9 another site had taken over my home page it was called "My Search". I was able to disable it in add on's but I can't remove it. Today I noticed I have a program running in Task Manager called 49brmon.exe; I find it is related
 to Utility Chest 49 a tool bar. I uninstalled it from the control panel. I got a message that it will be removed when I reboot.&nbsp; I didn't install this. It was on both Firefox and IE9. Anyway to get to the point I am afraid to reboot in case it is a virus or
 something that will crash my computer. Any suggestions?<br />
