<h2>            Webpages not loading correctly after Insider Buils are installed.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am currently sitting at Build 14936, I have no issues with Edge or other browsers. Issues started occurring a couple months ago, when new builds were released. We're currently sitting at 14965. My Alienware M17 installed the Build correctly with&nbsp;no issues.</p>
<p>When I open Edge, I notice that portions of a page are garbled or don't load at all. Many pages load slowly.<br />
<br />
Looking at Device manager I noticed older display drivers are loaded, likewise Network adapter. AMD HD8970 Display and E2200 Killer Network adapter. I updated both and retried. Issues still exist.</p>
<p>I suspected possible cookie issues, so tried Private Mode.<br />
Then I tried opening pages in IE11 as well as Firefox</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting to a previous Build (14936)&nbsp; seems to be the only solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this problem has occurred, I noticed I can't Cortana to perform a search when I highlight a word. It returns an error, I have lost connection. Though I can copy the same word and input it into the Cortana Window.<br />
Unsure if this is related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other Applications appear to run correctly including email.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - IMAP &#34;Mark items for deletion&#34; does not work</h2>
                    
<p>In Outlook 2010 account settings, Deleted Items tab, I select the radio button to Mark items for deletion.&nbsp; This is how many other IMAP clients like Thunderbird or Mulberry work.</p>
<p>However, after I select that radio button, exit settings and restart Outlook 2010, and press delete, the email does not appear as strike thru and rather just disappears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is a bug.</p>

<p>I read that post from February. &nbsp;However, the settings dialog box is not consistent with that post. &nbsp;There is a radio button for "Mark items for deletion but do not move them automatically"</p>
<p>Why doesn't Outlook 2010 behave that exact way when I select that option? &nbsp;This method is the most "imap standard way of doing it"</p>

<p>Yep, you have to choose another view.</p>
<p>I don't know what the exact description is since I'm using a Dutch version of Office, but when you click on the last menu (View), you can change your view to "IMAP" instead of "hide deleted items".</p>

            <p>This IS the answer for me. The View ribbon has a Change View pulldown which reveals serveral envelope icons representing VIEW TYPES. The types&nbsp;are: SENT TO; IMAP MSG; HIDE MSG; GROUP MSG; PREVIEW. Mine was sent to HIDE MSG.

In my case I had to go to tab 'View' -&gt; 'View Settings' -&gt; 'Advanced' and clear the default rule (IMAP status equals unmarked).<br />

    <title>How to add custom namespace metadata in Office files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to add custom namespace metadata in Office files</h2>
                    What is the approach for adding custom metadata for a unique namespace to Word/Excel/PowerPoint files without using a enterprise solution like SharePoint? I'm hoping someone might be able to point me to a starting point for setting up custom file properties
 in a namespace that matches what we are using with other applications.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <div>It depends on what you mean, really. I haven't come across any info. on "how best to do this stuff," so apologies if I have missed the mark but...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>For Word/Excel/Powerpoint, there are some advantages to following the SharePoint way of doing things even if you are not using SharePoint. For all three, you may be able to use a slightly more helpful DIP. FOr Word, you may get some advantages when using
 Content Controls. But more about that later.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Without following the SharePoint way of doing things, the facilities offered by Office are more limited.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>What you get to do is store XML documents in Custom XML Parts, and manipulate them via the relevant object models, e.g. via VBA. The only "freebies" AFAICS are that you can always connect suitable Word Content Controls to an element or attribute in an
 XML document in a Custom XML Part. In Word you may also get some advantages if you can insert the associated XML Schema in the Office Schema Library.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>[Incidentally, if you need to use non-XML stuff such as data in JSON data in Custom XML Parts, as far as I know you have to put it in an XML wrapper. I did read once that you could put non-XML data in Custom Parts, but AFAIK Word will not then open the
 document, and the object model doesn't seem to be able to do it either. Perhaps it was possible in the Office 2007 rereleases.]</div>
<div><br />
<div>But assuming that you are going to want to manipulate your metadata via the object models, I think the questions are then really about:</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. is your existing approach to namespaces adequate, or does it need to be improved? e.g., is there a standard or a set of best practices for defining XML documents that contain metadata rather than other types of data? (don't know). Do you need to review
 how you assign and document namespace URIs? Are there widely used systems out there such as Document Management systems that impose requirements on the XML, and is it worth your while trying to conform to them? I believe these kinds of questions are not really
 to do with office, but are more to do with "being well plugged into the XML standards world"</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. once the namespace thing is sorted, you can generate XML documents that conform to the schemas that define your metadata. You can put them in Custom XML Parts. You can reach any of the data via the object model. You can link Word Content Controls to
 them. Do you need anything more. e.g.</div>
<div>&nbsp; - does your processing require access to the metadata schemas, a subset of them, or even additional information? If so, perhaps that can also be put into Custom XML Parts. But then proliferation may be a problem if the schemas are large.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Back to SharePoint now...</div>
<div><br />
<div>AFAICS there is only one pattern for defining your metadata that allows you to take advantage of as many of the features of Office as possible without actually using SharePoint. And that's to follow what SharePoint does. But&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. the only document I have found that describes the Custom XML Parts that Sharepoint creates is this one (Other than the older one that relates to the ECMA standards)</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee908652(v=office.12).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee908652(v=office.12).aspx</a><br />
<div><br />
<div>"Standards speak" generally leaves me cold so the only way I have found to understand this is to look at the Custom XML Parts that SharePoint actually creates, and&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;- I haven't gone far along that path</div>
<div>&nbsp;- it isn't always clear what is essential, what is optional, and in terms of naming conventions, what has a chancing of playing well with other systems long term.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as I can tell, by following that pattern in your own documents and by using Microsoft's namespace names, in Word (and probably Excel and Powerpoint) a "freebie" is you get a "Server DIP" that can present some basic properties not included in the
 basic DIP, even if you don't have SharePoint. But&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;- you don't get the same validation stuff as you get in a real DIP</div>
<div>&nbsp;- you don't get to use all the types of value that you can use when connected to SharePoint</div>
<div><br />
<div>(I would have to check even that, as it's a while since I looked).</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, if you are using metadata definitions that have in essence been reserved for use by SharePoint, if anyone checks the document into a SharePoint system and out again, the metadata will be gone. (That can probably happen even by "copying" a document
 from one SharePoint library to another).</div>
<div><br />
<div>So there's a case for avoiding "hijacking" the SharePoint namespaces. You will lose the opportunity to have a slightly more helpful DIP. In Word, you will also lose the fact that Word generates entries in the "Document Properties" list in the Insert-&gt;Quickparts
 menu, and that inserting content controls linked to those properties will require some other approach. AFAIK there is no equivalent of those features in Excel/PowerPoint.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So if you decide you don't need those features, what does the Schema part inserted by Sharepoint actually contain? Well, it contains enough stuff to allow both Word and InfoPath present the right kind of controls (text boxes/dropdowns), do the right thing
 in terms of looking up stuff in SharePoint, value lists where the SharePoint column is an enumeration, and so on. Also, it contains some name mapping info. and some attributes that are primarily to do with presentation in the DIP (whether the property is visible,
 some formatting stuff and so on). i.e., not much useful for metadata that's not going to be in the DIP.</div>

            <p>I ran the trouble shooter apps&nbsp;from both MS and HP (fix doctor) and both report that all the systems are fine.&nbsp; I also tried all the suggestions posted in the article for fixes for both MS and HP.&nbsp; Yes, the printer was selected as the default printer from
 the get go.&nbsp; What is really strange is that we have 2 HP Pavilion laptops, both with&nbsp;Win 10 recently installed and&nbsp;both will not print.&nbsp; They printed before with Win 7 installed.&nbsp; &nbsp;We have uninstalled the printer software on both and reinstalled the full HP
 printer&nbsp;suite using their guided set up.&nbsp; The software sees the printers on both laptops, but when we do a test print from Printer Properties it goes to the queue for a moment and disappears.&nbsp; The Device Manager shows the printer installed with a " The Device
 is working properly" status noted.&nbsp; No other printers are installed.&nbsp; I had a friend who is a retired IT network specialist work on it for 2 hours with no success.&nbsp; While he was working on it he installed the drivers to his own Dell Laptop and it worked just
 fine in a few minutes.&nbsp; My Desktop works off the printer using Win 7 and works fine as well.&nbsp; And BTW, we attempted to run a direct print job though a CAT cable to the router and it would not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to point to Win 10 and maybe something corrupt??&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I had the same results for Windows 10, except when I ran the HP Officejet Pro 8620 Printer Assistant. In the printer assistant, when I selected Maintain Your Printer and then selected Print Quality Diagnostics Page on the Device Services tab, the printer
 printed the print quality diagnostic page.&nbsp; This was true both for the USB connected printer and the wireless network printer.

            Later, I found that if I uninstalled the HP printer software, the test print page printed on the 8620 printer, both in the network mode and usb mode. Not certain why, just empirically, it worked.

<h2>            Access 2003 Form will not longer allow data entry or change</h2>
                    <div>
<p>For a couple of years I have been using an Access 2003 database to keep data on our medical expenses. &nbsp; I created a form for data entry and to add information and change the status of the medical service.&nbsp; The form has two list boxes for entry and all of
 this has been working well for years.</p>
<p>Now I decided to add a list box of providers, so the doctor or hospital's name will be spelled the same each time a new service is added.</p>
<p>First I tried a combo box, because the list is long.&nbsp; I could not make it work, so I tried a list box and set the new list box using the same properties as the previous list boxes that have worked all along.&nbsp; The providers are in table.&nbsp; When I open the
 form, all the data is displayed, including my list box of providers, but I cannot add data or change anything.&nbsp; It is read only.&nbsp; The form is based on a Query which is set up as a dynaset, but the form itself is a snapshot.&nbsp; If I change the form to dynaset,
 no data is read to the form.</p>
<p>I am retired, so I don't have occasion to develop new databases very often anymore.&nbsp; I have been very careful reading all the information in my User's Guide and everything I can find on Microsoft's website.&nbsp; They convince me that I'm doing everything right,
 but I am obviously not doing something correctly.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<br />
Which websites are you getting Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<span>The issue could be due to various reasons like firewall, third party programs causing the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>I would suggest you to try the steps in elevated command prompt.<br />
a. right click on the start and select Command prompt (Admin)<br />
b. Once the command prompt is opened Type.<br />
c. Ping &lt;the website you are facing the issue to open&gt;<br />
c. You have to get Sent packets = 4 and Received packets = 4.<br />
<br />
If you are not getting that data, then Ho to Method 2:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />

Note 2: </strong>Make sure </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">you reset the computer back to normal mode after you perform clean boot.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> received 'Request timed out' message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Turned off all Add-ons - browser page loading speed was quicker but still encountered the 'Page cannot be displayed' message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset IE to defaults - still encountered the issue. Re-turned off 'Use SPDY/3' but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update drivers - only had 2 graphics drivers requiring updates, these were applied but still encountered the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should also point out that if you refresh the browser one or more times then the page eventually displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are also behind Windows Small Business Server 2011 - we couldn't see anything on here that could have been influencing the issue.</p>

Which antivirus program is installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
The issue also could be due to antivirus program on the computer. The antivirus program might be causing the issue server not to respond. I would suggest you to disable all the antivirus on the computer and check if the issue persists.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 365 to Wear OS - No Notification</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook client running on my Android v7 Phone but it cannot send any notification to my Fossil Watch running Wear OS v2. I've checked an confirmed that all the notification setting for Outlook is turned on, both in the phone notification and Wear
 notification, but still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read the post "connecting Outlook 265 to ear OS" in this forum where it state that there is an app I need to install on my watch (that thread is closed so I can post my follow-up question) but in my Google Play, it stated that my watch is not compatible
 with Outlook. What does this mean? Why it's not compatible as wear os is the latest? Is this app really required for me to get the Outlook notification to my phone?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Outlook notification to my watch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>How to stop IE from caching WPAD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> townendk  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop IE from caching WPAD</h2>
                    <p>Hello, first of all - I've looked at this article which unfortunately has not worked for us. Even once performing the Reg change and rebooting, WPAD files are still being cached.
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/271361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/271361</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to prevent WPAD from caching because our hosted web security solution requires that our users all connect from a range of known IP addresses. This is fine for our office workers, but when our roaming users try to connect - they're unable to access
 the internet as their session cannot authenticate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a problem/limitation of our hosted solution - but to work around this we use WPAD. WPAD, or 'automatically detect settings' should search for WPAD and use that if found, otherwise allow direct access to the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our wpad.dat file lives on an internal webserver with a DNS CNAME of wpad - so when out of the office, this should be unreachable (we've blocked firewall access to this webserver if using a VPN connection too).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IE8 however is caching the WPAD file locally, which means that until the user deletes the wpad[1].dat file in their temporary internet settings - they're unable to authenticate with our proxy service and are hence blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All attempts to prevent this cache have failed, so I can only think I'm either missing something - or something is overriding the registry command and is causing this to cache regardless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

    <title>Links to purchase Office Professional Plus through HUP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vti008  say:</h3>
<h2>            Links to purchase Office Professional Plus through HUP</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone knows the previous HUP links to purchase Microsoft office professional plus? I understand that microsoft is promoting office 365 and has defaulted/ redirected all HUP link to Office 365 page. But i want to get the link to purchase Office Professional
 Plus as this program is still available until 30 June 2019 for my company. Office 365 does not come into effect till 01 July 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried contacting microsoft technical support but they are unable to help. The lady from the microsoft technical support team told me that there’s nothing they can do to help to provide me with the link that is not default to office 365 - even though the
 offer on the website specially stated that HUP microsoft office professional plus offer is still available until 30 June 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi VTI00:</p>
<p>Office Pro Plus editions are generally offered by a School or Employment organization. If you are in a school setting, you can enter your student email address
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, and Microsoft will send you instructions on how to get Office 365 for Free, for as long as you're enrolled in that Institution. If your school is ineligible, the site at the link I gave above has links to other options that are available to you. Or
 you can always ask at your work to see if they offer Office for free or at a discounted rate. Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dustin</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Dustin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks heaps for your reply. I am actually looking for a link to purchase Office Professional Plus through HUP (Home Use Program) not Office 365. HUP is a corporate sponsored offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company have been provided with the HUP link by MS licensing team for the offer to purchase Office Professional Plus - however the link has now been defaulted / automatically set to be redirected to Office 365 by MS (Microsoft).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company support team told me to contact MS technical support team for the old HUP link that direct me to the Office Pro instead of Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS licensing team has also sent out an email to my company and circulated to staffs members that the offer to purchase Office Professional Plus will be valid till 30 June 2019, before Office 365 comes into effect on 01 Jul 2019. But it looks like MS has
 already disabled the offer before the agreed date of 30 June 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping that someone can provide the HUP link to office pro plus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

            If you logged in with your work email and it only shows 365 HUP, you may be out of luck. However, you can go&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-or-reinstall-office-through-microsoft-hup-d99c6e4a-6756-4ece-99a0-b1df654ec7d3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;to
 buy a digital license of Pro Plus 2016 for a fair price. If nothing else, at least this will solve your problem by giving you the software. Hope this resolves your issue.

<p>Some people have reported that they were still able to find onetime payment licenses on their HUP pages by scrolling a long way down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like everything else, MS is putting 365 in our faces, and doing what it can to hide or obfuscate the existing of onetime payment licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to talk to MS Support about HUP specific problems you have to go to your HUP page and find the Contact Us link.&nbsp; "Normal" MS support knows nothing about HUP offerings. They don't even know how to redirect users to the right place.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>The method for achieving this would be to</p>
<p>Copy the Pivot Table from Excel</p>
<p>Switch to PowerPoint.</p>
<p>Select Paste Special from the Paste drop down menu.</p>
<p>Change the option to Paste Link. It will leave you with Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object.</p>
<p>Click OK.</p>

            <p>It shouldn't get pasted as a picture. I tested it in the 2007 version and it worked perfectly OK as G North describes.</p>
<p>If you want to manipulate it from PowerPoint you will probably have to set up (embed) the Worksheet and Pivot Table within PowerPoint itself. I have not tested this but I do expect it to work (and cannot think of any reasons why it wouldn't).

<p>If my comments have helped please vote as helpful. </p>

            <p>The guys are right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the entire pivot table, hit CTRL-C</p>
<p>Go to your PowerPoint slide</p>
<p>Click the Home tab, click the drop down arrow on Paste</p>
<p>Click on Paste Special</p>
<p>Check the Paste Link</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once it's in there, to edit it in place:</p>
<p>Right click on it, select either Linked Excel Object, Open</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Update links</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit the Pivot Table in your Excel file and the next time you open the PowerPoint it should prompt you to update the links.</p>

            Call divert is a network function that's simply activated by the phone sending special codes to the network.<br />
<br />
If you can't find the relevant functions in the phone's menus you can always send the codes yourself manually.<br />
<br />
Details on GSM codes for call divert can be found here:<br />

<p>This is factually INCORRECT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 10 does NOT SUPPORT visual voicemail on dual sim devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS has not explained why, or if they plan to support this at some point so at this point users should presume this support is not planned and will never
 come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here we are... Another compromise the user has to accept to shell out $700 for the latest Lumia flagship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned my 950XL and reverted back to my Lumia 920... it still works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the following phones will NOT work with visual voicemail due to Windows 10 limitations:</p>
<p>Dual-sim Lumia 950XL unlocked</p>
<p>Dual-sim Lumia 950 unlocked</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following phones do support visual voicemail.</p>
<p>Single-sim AT&amp;T locked Lumia 950</p>
<p>

                    <p style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">
Is there any option, that my friend plays my rest of the game?&nbsp;​e.g. I left at 4th level and he begin​ at 4th level and clear my other level.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">
Actually what I want is, I can share my game with him, and then he continues it where I left and then he again share it with me. I just want 5th level to clear from him. Is there any other game which provides this facility?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">
Further,&nbsp;I don't wan to share my subscription&nbsp;login credentials&nbsp;with him.&nbsp;</p>

My commercial excel workbook "Files or Folders" can list files in folders and also provide a popup image when hovering over the file name.&nbsp; See picture below.<br />
3 week free trial, no ads, no cookies, no trackers, no registration.<br />
If this appeals, I will put the file up on Dropbox for download.&nbsp; Let me know.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for standing by. This feature will be available for OneNote app for Windows once your Office 365 account is associated with it. Since the said feature is unavailable in the OneNote 2016 that came from the Office 365 Home program, this can

<p>This is a tricky one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>MS is in the process of "<em>improving</em>" OneNote out of Office and into Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windows version does not have all of the features of the Office one ... &lt;sigh&gt; (that is some improvement).&nbsp; But then the Windows one has some features the Office one
 does not. Glitter pens is one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here is the tricky part. You need to have an Office 365 subscription to get the glitter pens in the Windows OneNote ... (?!?)</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Pink ponyyy</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to disable any security program on your computer and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer, make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Second the issue may be caused due to a corrupted add-on in Internet Explorer. To confirm the same, run Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><strong>To open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode,&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>a. Click the Start button, click All Programs.<br />
b. Click Accessories.<br />
c. Click System Tools.<br />
d. Then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</p>
<p>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</p>
<p>Delete the corrupted add-on and restart Internet Explorer normally and check if the issue reappears.</p>
<p>After you have used this process to determine which add-on is causing errors, you can disable that add-on. Or, you can uninstall the software that installs the add-on. We also recommend that you contact the software vendor that provided the add-on for additional
 troubleshooting and support.</p>
<p><strong>Refer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer add-ons: frequently asked questions</strong><br />

<p><br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>If the above steps do not fix the issue, then I would suggest you to try to perform Internet Explorer Optimization on your computer and check for the issue.<br />

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature&nbsp;</p>

<h3> geno101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blueberry A9630 Smartphone Phone, Won&#39;t connect to internet - says &#34;No modem detected, check settings&#34;</h2>
                    A few days ago I inadvertently left my Blueberry phone, with Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional OS, connected to my Laptop over night, the next morning a programme had been downloaded to my computer without my permission, I think it had something to do with
 Windows Mobile Advice Centre, I'm not sure because I immediately uninstalled it. Since then I cannot get my phone to connect to the internet via my service provider (ASDA - Vodaphone) I open up Windows Explorer but I only get a Message saying "Modem not detected
 check settings and try again", I've re-input the required settings as before but still get the same message. I can only assume that he unwanted downloaded programme has somehow disabled the ability for my phone to connect via my service provider, if not it's
 a coincidence. The phone still connects to local Wifi OK. Today I reset the phone to the makers default settings but it still won't connect. Has anyone got any ideas please?

I just want to get a little better understanding of the issue.&nbsp; Are you trying to connect your laptop to the internet via your device?

<p>Thanks for the replies Guys. I'm not trying to use the phone as a modem, I'm assuming my phone has a modem, or something which it uses to connect to the internet, built into it. My phone is exactly the same one as illustrated in this advert:</p>

<p>I am still trying to understand a little more clearly the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you left your device connected, what was the reason?</p>
<p>Do you use&nbsp;WMDC (Windows Mobile&nbsp;Device Center)&nbsp;to sync Contacts, Calendar etc to Outlook on your laptop or were you just charging or both?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jack, I'd connected the phone to my Laptop to charge up and unfortunately left it connected when I retired to bed, when I arose the next morning the programme had been downloaded and installed onto my Laptop. I'd never heard of WMDC before but I'm sure
 it was the one downloaded, it was definitely a Microsoft product. To be honest I panicked and uninstalled it quickly without taking particular note of what it was. I must add that there is a possibility that my phone coincidentally became faulty at that time,
 I did put the question to the retailer in Hong Kong but got no real answer from him.<br />

<p>If you connect a device that does not have WMDC installed, it will automatically go out and get it.&nbsp; You use WMDC to sync a device (Contacts, Calendar, Tasks etc)&nbsp;with Outlook on your PC (laptop).</p>
<p>When you are connecting to the internet on your device, you are doing it with a data plan (not via your PC) ... correct?</p>

            I'm sorry I'm not sure what you mean, I've only recently bought the phone and this was the first time I'd connected to the Laptop to charge the battery. Prior to that I'd just used it to connect to the internet via my mobile phone service provider or Wifi
 and as a phone of course, now, when I try to connect via my service provider I get a message saying "No modem detected or check settings". Has WMDC installed a programme onto my phone which could disable it's ability to connect to internet, I know Outlook
 seems to take over when I first started it up it took over my phone contacts list. Is it possible to uninstall WMDC from my phone?

<p>Ok, you answered my question</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you installed anything on your device yet?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, WMDC is the replacement program for activesync on your PC.&nbsp; When it install, it doed not install anything on your device.&nbsp; You have "activesync" on your device.&nbsp; Just as an FYI, when Vista first arrived, they redid the activesync program for PCs.&nbsp; It
 was renamed WMDC (Windows Mobile Device Center).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;Is it possible to uninstall WMDC from my phone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it is part of the ROM</p>
<p>All devices are running the Windows Phone ROM but individual vendors do make slight changes to the look and feel.&nbsp; I am unfamiliar with your device so I cannot be quite sure of what you can or cannot see for changes.&nbsp; On my HTC Touch Pro2, I have a screen
 that I can access where I can choose one of three items for how the device attaches and can sync with Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three setting are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable fatster data synchronization </li><li>Disk Drive (for file transfer) </li><li>Internet Sharing (use the phone as a modem) </li></ol>
<p>Although I doubt that you have something like that, my first thought was if you did, Internet Sharing&nbsp;might be&nbsp;checked.</p>
<p>I would like you to check this and tell me what you see.&nbsp; Go to START/SETTINGS/CONNECTIONS and then press on the Connections icon.&nbsp; Click the advanced tab then the Select Networks button.&nbsp; At the top where it says programs that automatically connect to the
 Internet..., what is in the box?&nbsp; If you click on the drop down menu, what choices do you have?</p>

            Thanks for your help Jack, I haven't installed anything onto my device, apart from a programme Called Memory Map which will work in conjunction with GPS, when I've figured out how to use it.&nbsp; I have my phones SIM in another phone at the moment but this
 evening I'll put it back into the Blueberry and check I have all of the settings entered correctly, although I have checked them several times.

                    After updating to the latest build, my graphics (Intel HD5500) become very unstable. My system wouldn't re-boot and stalled prior to login screen. I couldn't access my secondary screen. All drivers for external screens failed to load properly.&nbsp; Re-loading
 previous drivers fixed the problem momentarily. After a couple of days of trying to stabilize, I resorted to going back to&nbsp;the previous build.
