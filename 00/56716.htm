<h2>            Find &#34;My Apps&#34; in the Windows 10 Store</h2>
                    <p>How do I find all the apps that I have downloaded previously &nbsp;in Windows 10 store.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>On my Surface RT, I go to Store/Account/My Apps.&nbsp; I don't see a similar setting in the Windows 10 store.&nbsp; IMO I prefer the old store.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>

</p><p>Also,&nbsp;the App interface of Windows Store might have changed but the web interface continues to be the same.
<span>I suggest you to post your valuable feedback about Windows 10 in feedback app. So, that it will be helpful for the developers to integrate the changes suggested by you.
</span></p>

            What I am trying to do actually is on a new PC, download all the Apps I had installed on my old PC.&nbsp; Windows 8 used to sync the apps, Windows 10 does not.&nbsp; I need a page that lists all my apps that I have downloaded so I can download them again.&nbsp; I don't
 even know what to search for as I don't remember all the apps I downloaded previously.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you of the benefit of using one Microsoft Account across all the Windows devices. The most obvious advantage would be that all the user settings and apps will be synced. This feature is same for both Windows 10 and Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in case you are using a Local User Account, I suggest you to connect this account to the Microsoft Account you own.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below steps to connect the user account to a Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>and then&nbsp;<strong>PC settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click&nbsp;<strong>Users and accounts&nbsp;</strong>and under&nbsp;your Profile&nbsp;s</span>elect<span>&nbsp;“Sign in with Microsoft account instead”</span></li><li><span>Type in&nbsp;your Microsoft account email ID and password and then choose <strong>
Sign in</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the next step, just provide your old local account password and click on
<strong>Next</strong>. </span></li><li><span>If you want to set up a PIN, set it up here else click on skip.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We&nbsp;apologize in case I was unable to apprehend the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the apps refuse to sync on the current Windows 10 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider the below important points and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>Check if the <strong><span>Date, time and Time zone </span></strong>is set correct. Follow the steps to set the date and time:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a. Type <strong><span>“Date and Time”</span></strong> in the search bar.<br />
b. Click <strong><span>Change date and time </span></strong>button.<br />
c. Click <strong><span>Apply</span></strong> and <strong><span>Ok </span></strong>to save the date and time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Click on the <strong><span>Time Zone </span></strong>tab to check the Time Zone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, deploy the Microsoft Account troubleshooter from the below which automatically resolves sync issues.

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
Microsoft account has a security feature called <strong>Trusted PC</strong> for verifying your identity automatically and performing sensitive actions.
<p>
</p><p>You can mark a device as trusted just by selecting a check box. When you're prompted to enter a security code to verify your identity, select the

            Yes, an OS file called csrss.exe is corrupt and there isnt a copy to replace it with.&nbsp; Time for a repair install as csrss.exe is one of 4 files critical for windows to run<br />
<br />
Before the repair try a malware scan<br />
<br />
Please download the free version of Malwarebytes. <br />
Update it immediately. <br />
Do a full system scan <br />
Let us know the results at the end. <br />

            I downloaded the malwarebytes, but somehow I can't install it. An error message Error 5: Access is denied pops up. There was also an error code 80070005 in the windows update as well. Could these problems be related to the csrss.exe file being corrupted?
 Is there a way to repair this file as well?<br />

I talked to my internet provider. My internet service is working fine. On the other computer in the house my speeds are normal. Something on this machine is limiting it's upload speed. I was on a support call for hours with Symantec as the problem seemed to
 start after I had uninstalled Norton. They ran a cleaner on my system so that product is not on the&nbsp;machine. That did not fix the problem. Is there a tech support through Windows I can call to access this computer and fix it? This problem is too complex for
 a forum to solve. Thanks

Ok, updating to the latest version of the program fixed the problem!
<div>My internet speed trouble had to do with the software suite for my Asus motherboard, particularly a networking utility. As I don't use those much I just uninstalled it. &nbsp;Thanks for your help!</div>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run a malware scan?</p>
<p>Have you opened the PC to have a look at dusty / blocked components which could be overheating?</p>
<p>Use a program like&nbsp;SpeedFan (Available from www.almico.com/speedfan.php) this will show you how hot your components are, just post back the CPU and HDD temps.</p>

                    <p>Original title: multiple issues with Skydrive on Windows 8.1 RT (Surface RT)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After unboxing and setting up my Surface RT, I moved to installing and applying all updates (including the win 8.1 update). I really like the Surface, except I have several issues with SkyDrive that unfortunately prevent me from using my new device:</p>
<p>(<em>Surface RT 32Gb, Windows 8.1 RT, SkyDrive default settings - files and folders available online only</em>)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;SkyDrive fails to show all content locally;</strong> </p>
<p>even after 3 days, I cannot see locally&nbsp;the entire structure of files that I have in cloud</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>2. SkyDrive is apparently stuck;</strong> </p>
<p>no matter how long I'd wait; in Explorer view, on Desktop, it continually shows the 'syncing' icon</p>
<p>with no other&nbsp;error icons shown.</p>
<p>when launched, the Metro skydive app continuously shows only the progress moving dots on the top of the screen, without anything else apparently changing. No progress information, no uploading or downloading details. No errors shown on the files and folders.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>3. part of the locally synced files&nbsp;from SkyDrive do not open;</strong>
</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, SkyDrive doesn't show locally the entire structure of files. Although&nbsp;a great part of files and folders are shown locally, most of them cannot be opened.</p>
<p>When trying to open a document or a picture from the Explorer view (Desktop) or from the SkyDrive app (Metro) I get the infamous
</p>
<p>"<strong><em>Error: 0x80040A41: No error description available</em></strong>"</p>
<p>The Office programs can only open the documents from the cloud SkyDrive; when trying to open the same document from the local SkyDrive image I get the same error</p>
<p>As suggested in other MS community forums...<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>I have created a blank Excel document and saved it. No problem in opening from my local drive.&nbsp;</li><li>I have run the Skydrive troubleshooter. It gave a message that "maintenance was required", but nothing changed with regard to the 0x80040A41error.</li></ul>
<p>Now, given all these problems I would love to reset everything and re-start from zero; unfortunately I forgot to make a recovery stick.</p>
<p>Is there any possibility to somehow reset SkyDrive app, preferably deleting the local SkyDrive structure without affecting the one in the cloud. It's my first experience with Win RT and I'm afraid not to propagate the deletion in the cloud.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When looking in TaskManager to end the processes:</p>
<p>- SkyDrive app doesn't appear to be running unless I start it by clicking the icon in Metro view</p>
<p>- there's no <strong>SkyDrive syncing host</strong> process running, I don't know if it's supposed to be there or not in RT</p>
<p><br />

            <p>HI Rohit, thanks for the reply</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here we go:</p>
<p><strong>2. Confirm that the SkyDrive Sync Engine host is running.</strong><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>as I mentioned above, <em>after a device reboot, neither SkyDrive or SkyDrive Sync Engine Host processes are running</em>.
</span></li><li><span>when launching the SkyDrive metro app, I can see in Task Manager:</span></li></ol>
<ul>
<li><span><em>SkyDrive application appears to be running</em></span></li><li><span><em>SkyDrive Sync Engine Host appears for a second under Background processes then it disappears</em></span></li></ul>
<p><span><strong>3. Confirm that available updates to Windows 8.1 have been installed. -
<em>Confirmed</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>4. Confirm your sync issues by checking SkyDrive:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><em>No errors shown at the top right corner in SkyDrive metro app</em>; as mentioned before, nothing showing in Progress: no errors, no uploading and/or downloading files. Only the dots moving at the top of the screen with no end</span></li><li><span>In File Explorer: the <em>SkyDrive folder show the double arrow icon</em> indicating it's syncing;
<em>no other file show an error or the fact that is syncing</em></span></li></ol>
<p><span><strong>5. SkyDrive troubleshooter</strong> - <em>have run it twice; It gave a message that "maintenance was required", but nothing changed</em> with regard to the 0x80040A41error</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>In conclusion: This didn't help; This was like re-describing the description&nbsp;made in my previous post.</span></p>
<p><span>I have downloaded a recovery image, I'll reset the device and start again from Windows 8.0 and see how it goes; I'll report back</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem and the issue was indeed from my colleague's computer, microphone disfunction. Now you have to check with your buddy if his mic is ok, or, you can test this problem with another person and if the problem persist, clearly the problem
 is on your buddy`s computer/microphone.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is quite a daft but annoying problem and I can't seem to find a straightforward solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I rotate the screen via the Ctrl+Alt+Left key combination the screen passes from landscape to portrait but the mouse cursor responds to the touchpad as if it were still in landscape orientation. This never occurred on windows 7 and came about only after
 updating to 10.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'll try being extra clear. The laptop's touchpad works fine in normal landscape orientation. Suppose I now rotate the screen anticlockwise by 90' into portrait mode by typing Ctrl+Alt+left and also rotate the monitor so the screen is in the correct upright
 position. The mouse cursor on the screen is pointing upward, however if I swipe upward on the touchpad the cursor doesn't move up as would be expected, but rather moves to the right, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially the cursor moves the same even after the screen rotation, while I'd want it to move accordingly with the portrait orientation. This was the case with windows 7 prior to the upgrade to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is clearer.</p>

<h2>            South Park Stick of Truth DLC not working even with Ubisoft&#38;&#35;39&#59;s help</h2>
                    
<p>I have a code to unlock the Ultimate Fellowship add-on for the 360. It goes to unlock it for me and then I get an error. The code is good and I have never used till today. Ive tried on my 360, my xbox one and on the xbox live web site. all give me the same
 results. Its like that add-on no longer exists, but it is in the store for purchase. Can you please help me?
</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>
<p><br />
I contacted Ubisoft and they researched it and also had me submit pics of the DLC card that came with my game. They then sent me a new DLC code for the same game add-on and I am STILL getting the same results. Why is this, when the item is for sale in the store?
 Makes no sense. Its very frustrating! I can buy it, but get it for free with a valid code and I get errors.</p>

<p>Yeah, the DLC is definitely still available so that shouldn't be an issue. There was a service alert up for a little but earlier about making 360 purchases. I'm not 100% sure that would have been a cause of the issue, but if you haven't tried it sometime
 in the past hour or so, you may want to try again.</p>
<p>I know you said you've contact Ubisoft, but have you contact Xbox support yet?</p>

<p>You are now chatting with 'Mikael'.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:18:51</p>
<p>Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. My name is Mikael. Please give me 2-3 minutes to review your question.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:19:03</p>
<p>I appreciate the time and patience for waiting in queue. I hope you are still doing fine despite the issue you have.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:19:06</p>
<p>It seems that I am unable to see the description you have placed though. May I know how can I be a help for you?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:18:52</p>
<p>Also, the add-on is for sale in the xbox marketplace, so there should be no reason I cant access it and add it to my game.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:19:14</p>
<p>I have a code for a add-on to a south park game the stick of truth</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:19:44</p>
<p>the code was never used. I get an error when using it.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:20:45</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that one. No worries we will try to sort tings out for this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:20:50</p>
<p>To get us started, may I have the gamertag and email address associated please?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:20:52</p>
<p>I then contacted Ubisoft and sent them pics of the card that came with the game. They verified its valid, so they gave me a new code just incase the one I had expired. THe caode they gave me comes up and when I go to unlock it, I get an error with that as
 well</p>

<p>Mikael: at 4:22:30</p>
<p>I appreciate the things that you have tried just to make things work.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:22:40</p>
<p>In order for me to access your account and for your security, I will need a code from you. A code will be sent to the email address associated with your account. Can you check your email address and provide to me the code please?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:22:02</p>
<p>I tried using the code on various computers thru the website. With my xbox 360, and with my xbox one. All a no go</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:23:25</p>
<p>I see, so basically the code is not working even though you are able to redeem it?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:22:49</p>
<p><strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:22:54</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:23:07</p>
<p>Same with the new code from Ubisoft</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:24:18</p>
<p>Thank you for that, can I try to have that code so I can check it from here?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:23:32</p>
<p>The addon is in the store. I purchased the other ones for the game and they work</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:23:54</p>
<p>il give you both. First the one that came with the game, then ubisofts</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:24:54</p>
<p>Sure that would be helpful.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:24:20</p>

<p>Andrew T: at 4:24:36</p>
<p>-------------------------code hidden</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:26:22</p>
<p>Thank you for providing that code. Yes, I can see it from here that this code is still active and is ready to be redeemed.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:26:48</p>
<p>Since you are having a problem with redeeming that code. Let us try to do some troubleshooting just to isolate the issue. Will that be all right?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:27:02</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:27:13</p>
<p>I did clean the cache on my systems</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:27:30</p>
<p>I reset my modem and router just incase it was my internet</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:28:41</p>
<p>Oh! I see, thank you so much for that. Let us try to continue the process since you already clear the cache.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:28:48</p>
<p>We need to remove the profile first please go to Settings&gt;account&gt;remove accounts.(Note: Please make sure you have the login credentials for the account.)</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:28:47</p>
<p>Will this delete anything from my memory</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:30:42</p>
<p>Oh! No worries for that, this will not affect your games saves nor game titles.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:33:01</p>
<p>Am i doing this on xbox or my computer?</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:34:05</p>
<p>From the Xbox please.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:33:15</p>
<p>I dont see that on the xbox under settings</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:34:13</p>
<p>That step if for the Xbox One.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:33:36</p>
<p>ok let me get on xbox one</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:34:54</p>
<p>All right, thank you. By the way, do you own the game that works for this add-on via game disc?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:35:16</p>
<p>OK I deleted the account. Yes I own the game</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:36:17</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:36:23</p>
<p>Please go to Settings &gt;All settings&gt; network &gt; advance settings &gt; alternate MAC address &gt; clear &gt; restart</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:36:45</p>
<p>Il try this, but how is this gonna help if when using my computer or another way to access the internet, the codes dont work</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:38:34</p>
<p>I do understand that, this is to sync up the changes made for the account. Since this account was signed in with a different platforms this may need a little refresh just to sync all the changes being made before.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:39:11</p>
<p>its restarting</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:39:58</p>
<p>ok its back on</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:41:06</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:41:10</p>
<p>We re-download your profile. On the dashboard, select the little profile icon on the upper left hand corner of the screen, select add new, enter you credentials and let your profile re-download.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:44:31</p>
<p>Im trying to add my account and its asking for a guest key</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:44:41</p>
<p>I cant get past that for some stupid reason</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:46:03</p>
<p>Oh! I am sorry to hear that, it might be a parental lock set on your account?</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:46:12</p>
<p>A pass key perhaps?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:45:37</p>
<p>I dont think so since I own the xbox one</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:47:07</p>
<p>Hmm.. Let us try to isolate that one first.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:47:25</p>
<p>If you've forgotten the passkey that you use to sign in to your Xbox One console or that you have set for purchases or managing child accounts, you can resolve this issue using your Microsoft account password.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:47:39</p>
<p>To use your Microsoft account password to reset your passkey, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:47:39</p>
<p>1.When you are prompted to enter your passkey on the console, enter any six-digit combination three times.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:47:39</p>
<p>2.After you enter a passkey three times, Xbox One will prompt you to enter your Microsoft account password. Type your password.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:47:39</p>
<p>3.Select Make a new passkey.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:47:39</p>
<p>4.Enter a new passkey, and then enter it again to confirm.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:48:28</p>
<p>I remembered what it was so Im past that and added my account</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:50:01</p>
<p>Oh! Cool. Sure thing, take your time.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:49:32</p>
<p>whats the next step</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:50:45</p>
<p>After it is signed in, we will now try to check if we can redeem the code.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:50:22</p>
<p>ok let me try both</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:51:21</p>
<p>Sure thing.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:51:25</p>
<p>Standing by.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:56:16</p>
<p>Ok its a no go. Tried both codes only now it gives me the error right away</p>
<p>Mikael: at 4:57:33</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that may I know what complete error message did you receive?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:57:29</p>
<p>Would this be easier if the amount I think its like $2.99 was just credited to me and I then go in and purchase the add-on</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:57:56</p>
<p>0x80153005</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 4:58:18</p>
<p>all this hassle over a $3 add-on is crazy</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:00:04</p>
<p>I really want to do that for you however, we don't have that option.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:00:18</p>
<p>I did try to search for the game code. It do shows this result.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:00:57</p>
<p>You see the following error message when you try to download content on Xbox Live: •The content offer is no longer available. For example, a game demo is no longer available.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:00:52</p>
<p>No that si not the message I get</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:01:42</p>
<p>Just to be sure, you can connect to Xbox Live, right?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:01:13</p>
<p>USE PREPAID CODE Ultimate Fellowship Prepaid code Subject to the Microsoft Services Agreement and xbox.com/usagerules. There are no refunds.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:02:09</p>
<p>Yes, that is not the message you get. This is what I get from searching the error code that you have provided.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:01:21</p>
<p>that is what I get</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:01:40</p>
<p>then I hit confirm and i get the error</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:02:46</p>
<p>I am connected via many ways to xbox live and all are a no go with this valid code and I have now 2 valid codes</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:03:45</p>
<p>Thank you for providing that information.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:03:18</p>
<p>Even the code given by Ubisoft the company that made the game</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:03:23</p>
<p>its not working</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:06:46</p>
<p>I really do understand that, how about this one. Since we are unable to get it activated on your account. You may need to contact back them and let them know that it still doesn't work. Also please do ask them if this add-on still work within the game since
 this might only be a promotional item. That can be redeemed with a specific time.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:06:14</p>
<p>Whats stupid, is if I went and bought the add-on, it would work and give it to me with no hassle.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:07:18</p>
<p>For your reference, you can try to open this link as this the error message that we've got.</p>

<p>Andrew T: at 5:06:51</p>
<p>THe other addons for the game are active I purchased them yesterday</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:08:08</p>
<p>Yes, I can see it from here that you did purchase the other add-ons.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:07:48</p>
<p>This isnt a promotional thing</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:08:41</p>
<p>However, we just have a problem with this one. Also, may I know from where you purchase the add-on code?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:08:25</p>
<p>It came with the game. Was on a card like you get with a 2-day free trial of xbox live</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:09:40</p>
<p>Oh! I see, may I know from where you did purchase the game with?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:09:09</p>
<p>No expiration date on the code. and Ubisoft says the code is still active. They even gave me one they generated to be sure</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:10:08</p>
<p>Why does it matter where I purchased the game? It was a gift. The game was new unopened. Your system will not allow me to access the addon with a code that is valid. Yet if I buy it it will.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:11:43</p>
<p>Do you need me to send you pictures of the code card???????????</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:13:06</p>
<p>Yes, we can see that from here that this two codes are active. Only that this add-on may shows to be the not available for the game anymore. That is what the code state. We may need to have the proof of purchase since we might need to escalate the issue
 and for this to be added on your account. Also, we can't provide any refund because the purchase was made on the store.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:13:29</p>
<p>We really do apologize if this has taken much of your time however we are just trying to complete the process on all possible things to &nbsp;isolate this issue.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:14:00</p>
<p>THE ADDON IS ACTIVE IN THE STORE!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS STUPID! IF its for sale in the store and all other addons are avalible and I have them, why is this one a problem? NOw you want a receipt?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:14:55</p>
<p>Its a friggin $3 addon that you cant manage to give access to even with a valid code to unlock it.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:15:42</p>
<p>Do I need to give you a receipt from Ubisoft for the code they gave me?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:16:45</p>
<p>Timothy @Ubisoft Support May 25, 2016 at 07:59 PM EDT Hey, SADISTIKAL. Could you please try the following code for your South Park: Stick of Truth: Ultimate Fellowship Pack 6PV9H-code hidden-HVYVZ You wrote May 25, 2016 at 06:59 PM EDT Activation Key / Redeem
 Code: V3PDQ-4code hidden-6TVJZ I have a code to unlock the Ultimate Fellowship add-on for the 360. It goes to unlock it for me and then I get an error. The code is good and I have never used till today. Ive tried on my 360, my xbox one and on the xbox live
 web site. all give me the same results. Its like that addon no longer exists, but it is in the store for purchase. Can you please help me?</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:17:56</p>
<p>I really do understand that however, we don't have the ability to unlock any codes. The code shows active however, the only case is that we are unable to redeem it. And base on the error code that you have provided. It may means that the add-on is not available.
 That is why we are trying to isolate that issue for you. I do appreciate the patience you have shown however, I don't have the control over if the system is not allowing us. I hope you can still extend your patience over this matter.</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:17:43</p>
<p>Im trying to but your making it very difficult</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:18:26</p>
<p>Id go buy the stupid download and then get a refund, but that looks impossible</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:19:31</p>
<p>I really do apologize for that, I am not making it difficult for you. I am just basing this information from what I can see from our end. I know that this may have taken much of your time. I do apologize for that.</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:21:48</p>
<p>I appreciate it, let me connect you to our supervisor to clarify things up. Will that be all right?</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:22:11</p>
<p>This is a joke. So Im not really getting anywhere here really. Other then the run-a-round. Its your system, everything on my end is valid. I purchased 2 addons for this game with no issue, the one addon I have a code for, you guys cant seem to handle. I
 even get one from Ubisoft and still you guys cant fix the issue</p>
<p>Andrew T: at 5:22:17</p>
<p>Sure whatever</p>
<p>Mikael: at 5:23:17</p>
<p>Thank you for that confirmation.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface 4 will not connect 4k to Acer CB281HK monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hi, for some reason my Surface 4 running windows 10&nbsp;connected once to my monitor at 4k. Now it will only connect at 1920 by 1080. I have not changed the cable or any settings. I have tried resetting the monitor - this did not help. The monitor connects to
 my other computer at 4k no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody assist with my problem?</p>

            You need t o make use that you are using the standard USA based keyboard input method.&nbsp; You are probably using a keyboard input method that is replacing the apostrophe (') with the accented e."&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably a French or Canadian French input method??<br />

Here's how I tamed the beast...<br />
<br />
1. It takes Win8 Pro. The functionality isn't there on Win8 "vanilla". As far as I can tell, this limitation is not documented anywhere. In fact, there's next to no documentation of any kind on Sync, from what I could discover.<br />
<br />
2. The relevant directory(ies) must be explicitly shared as read/write for the Homegroup on a Home/SOHO network, otherwise you won't be able to write to them from the remote/client system whether you're online or offline. I found that not all sub-directories
 necessarily inherit the share, so there were a few I had to share individually.<br />
<br />
3. A host folder set up as a drive on the remote won't show up in Sync Center as a partnership, nor as an available resource to sync. It will sync, however. I've yet to find anything that shows up as "available" for sync in the Sync Center.<br />
<br />
4. Sync takes its own sweet time about keeping up to date. It's essential, if you need to work on stuff on the road, to manually initiate a sync and let it run to completion before you unplug from the network.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Weather app as desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hello! Is there a way to make the inside of the Weather app a desktop background? I really like how it looks like. Thanks!</p>

    <title>When I type in Chinese in word, the programme freezes every so often - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eleanorplews  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I type in Chinese in word, the programme freezes every so often with a repeated letter, how can i solve this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I type in Chinese often in word, but now and again I will start to type the pinyin of a character and the first letter will just repeat, e.g. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Word then freezes and I can't change programmes on the desktop but I can&nbsp;change to&nbsp;windows 7 pages.
 The mouse also does not show up on the word page but does on the task bar and on windows 7 pages. This is very strange! After doing nothing in particular (I have tried ctrl+alt+delete, logging off and on etc.) it eventually unfreezes after about 3 minutes.
 What is happening and how can this be stopped?</p>

    <title>why do I keep losing my internet connection on Road Runner&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimbales  say:</h3>
<h2>            why do I keep losing my internet connection on Road Runner&#63;</h2>
                    Good morning,
<div>I have Road Runner with Time Warner Cable. Ever since &nbsp;I started Road Runner last winter, my internet would drop randomly for no apparent reason.</div>
<div>I would get a DSN notice saying that I was not connected, but when I check the connection I get a message saying that there is not a problem with the internet connection or it will say contact your ISP or administrator.</div>
<div>I have had Time Warner out here several time and they spend time inside and outside and on the computer and tell me that it is fixed, but after they leave, it's the same situation. Very frustrating. &nbsp;I even bought a new router and it still does it.</div>
<div>Does anyone know how I can stop this from happening?</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
<div>My Best, JIm</div>
                </div>

<div>I am using Windows Vista on my laptop and Windows XP on my desktop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>They both go off the internet at the same time. &nbsp;They are not connect to each other in any way. &nbsp;Any other wireless users in the house also lose their connection which means it is not the devises that is the problem. &nbsp;I even upgraded the router,
 thinking that the router was faulty.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Earlier this year I changed over from DSL to Roadrunner and have had this disconnet problem ever since. I have had Time Warner out several times and each time they spend a lot of time doing things that they think will fix it, and it still happens.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just the other day I had a man here from T.W. that spent a couple of hours working on the system. &nbsp;He changed cables outside he did stuff inside and even got on the computers and tried to work out the problem. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thinking he was done and the problem fixed, &nbsp;I went to the computer before he left and there it was with no internet connection again. &nbsp;He spent another half hour with his own computer and talking to someone on the phone that did these tests,
 and didn't seem to know why it was happening.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had an internet connection when he left, but it was not long before I was off the internet again as if nothing had changed. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Very frustrating. I am about to change my broadband service again, but I don't know if that is going to solve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sincerely, Jim Bales</div>

    <title>Microsoft...the new Apple&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcclow13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft...the new Apple&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What is Microsoft thinking? I apologize in advance for my rant, but I've had it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No way to customize the installation of Office 2016 Pro? I can't use Outlook 2016 because it's not compatible with Exchange 2007, which my company requires me to utilize to login into my corporate email account, but I can't choose to not install it. Seriously?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 with Microsoft's protection plan and it's&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not a global plan</span></strong>. I'm stuck in Shanghai, China with a failing Surface Pro 3 and Microsoft can't/won't do anything about it.
 Mind you, this will be my second broken Surface. My first one stopped responding to touch and this one's fan is rubbing and will most likely stop working any day now, stranding me with no PC...unless I go buy a new Surface Pro 4 in China...oh wait, then I
 won't have a warranty in the USA. I just happened to be in an Apple store yesterday because my buddy is looking at a new MacBook Pro and I warned him about buying it in China because of the warranty. The salesperson quiclky explained that Apple Care is global.
 What a novel idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, Windows 10 on the Surface Pro 3...press the end button on the pen and you open the generic "free" version of OneNote. In Windows 8.1 you could select to open the full blown version. Not in Windows 10. So I contact support and they want to login
 into my Surface to tell me it's not possible. PC Settings and Control Panel and neither of them can do what the other does? I have to navigate through three different windows to add a hidden network? Windows 10 is half-baked at best, but seems to be the norm
 for Microsoft lately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a Microsoft fan for years, since my first PC in 1995...I'm starting to rethink my stance. Their new business model absolutely sucks and is alienating the longtime users that liked the freedom to do what they want with their PC, when they want.
 The more they become like Apple, the more I'm thinking about going and trying the OS that everyone claims, just works. With every new release from Microsoft, they come closer and closer to becoming their rival, so it looks like I have less and less of a reason
 to stay with Microsoft. They wonder why they're losing market share.</p>

            Hi Ron,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Could try uninstall then reinstall Skype?
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.34.0.78.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.
