I have a problem with my DVD/CD internal optical drive. It can read, write and play
<span>&nbsp;</span>self made CD and DVD’s, burn music and DVD files to disc. It will read and play some older store bought DVD’s but will not read and play any of my newly store purchased DVD’s. The drive clicks, whirrs and tries very hard to load but eventually
<span>&nbsp;</span>self made CD and DVD’s, burn music and DVD files to disc. It will read and play some older store bought DVD’s but will not read and play any of my newly store purchased DVD’s. The drive clicks, whirrs and tries very hard to load but eventually
 gives up. During this time any media player app becomes unresponsive and I have to “end task” in Task Manager. I have tried the same DVD’s on my husband’s and another computer (new at work) and they load and play fine. This is the first time I have tried to
 play a new DVD in this computer since the windows 10 upgrade.</p>

<h3> ericmatthews1  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;System&#34; using 100&#37; GPU in spikes. Windows explorer and desktop screen slow, everything else is perfectly fine</h2>
                    <p>What could possibly cause this? When using Firefox or any other program my computer seems to run perfectly. If I have the desktop selected or I am in windows explorer, the screen freezes for 5 seconds at about 3 second intervals. When I open task manager,
 "System" is found to max out the GPU to 100% whenever the screen freezes. This all started when I registered a program actually (FL Studio) and it restarted, causing my computer to have the spikes since then. What in the world could this be? A virus? What
 can I do to fix it? This is a brand new laptop (literally got it today). I have already restarted it twice</p>

<h2>            My Asus laptop continually loses internet connection and won&#39;t reconnect unless it&#39;s restarted.</h2>
                    <p>My Asus laptop continually loses internet connection and it won't reconnect unless it's restarted.</p>
<p>I'm using windows 10. I'm on a Linksys wireless connection. There are several other computers on this connection that have no problems. There is one other computer in the office having this problem too, though. This has been happening since the last update.
 It does not seem to be a problem with the power management settings. I have tried running a diagnostic at the time the internet goes out, but its solution is that there's a cable disconnected, which, I know, is not the problem.</p>
<p>One other thing I have noticed, our wifi router operates on a dual band, my laptop connects to the 5 GHz signal, and so does the other computer having issues. The computers on the 2.4 GHz&nbsp;are not having problems. Another twist to this is that my cell phone
 also connects to the 5GHz signal, and does not have issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can help, this is driving me CRAZY.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Yes I did my best to follow the steps in the link provided. The wlan&nbsp;report I posted here, as I have no idea what it means.
</p>
<p>I followed these steps below while I was connected and got this:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/832dc3dc-6f7c-4069-a98f-0f372677f8f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/832dc3dc-6f7c-4069-a98f-0f372677f8f1" /></a></p>
<p>I also tried doing this step right after my connection went out (before doing the restart) and at that time there was no default gateway listed.</p>

    <title>If I buy a new PC, Can I reactivate windows 10 onto it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> parthrax  say:</h3>
<h2>            If I buy a new PC, Can I reactivate windows 10 onto it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, So in the next few weeks, I'm going to be buying a new gaming PC. I plan to reuse my HDD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awhile back, When the Upgrade to windows 10 (From win7) option was available I took it. I contacted Microsoft Support and they help me extract my Windows Activation key from my PC. But I read on some articles that if you took the free upgrade that you cannot
 switch to new devices, You must buy a new copy of windows. Is this true?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my activation key saved and a windows 10 installer saved on a USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I get the new PC, I plan to remove the activation key from this PC by using command prompt,&nbsp;slmgr/ upk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I boot the new PC from the USB, Install windows, And use the activation key that microsoft helped me find, Will I have any issues? Those blogs/threads saying I couldn't kind of confused me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all the help in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ability to transfer the free upgrade depends on whether you upgraded from a retail or OEM copy of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            Can you get into safe mode with networking and get those files saved off then do a clean install?
<br />Can you do a repair upgrade?
<br />See link by Andre on how to do that.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files which should always be backed up if you value them at all since the hard drive can die at any time without notice! 
<br />
<br />These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>I have gotten a "can't read from the source file or disk" error for a handful of files, so I am concerned there may be some hard drive failure at play (computer is only about 6 months old), but I am successfully saving the vast majority of them, so thank

            Hi again -
<br />
<br />Windows which is preinstalled by the manufacturer at the factory has it's Product Key embedded in the BIOS or UEFI firmware chip on the motherboard, and should reactivate on its own.  
<br />
<br />You can check this at any time by  running ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> and look in the list for the OEM BIOS key.  If it's not there then what is the Status listed at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation.
<br />
<br />As long as you stick with the steps in the Clean Install it should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.       
        </p>

<p>So, I may have done something very stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going through the steps of the clean install, and was deleting the drives, but I had second thoughts on deleting C, as there are some files there I would have liked to save if possible which would have taken way too long with the notepad method. So
 I did not delete C, in hopes that I could recover files later from the Windows Old file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the installation was in the "preparing files" stage, it appeared to be frozen at around 67%. I read that this could be caused by a bad copy of the Windows 10 USB, and I followed instructions on that to create another one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing that and trying again, after choosing the USB from the BIOS boot menu, it goes to the black HP splash screen, with the "loading spinner", but then just goes to a lit black screen. The Windows Installer never comes up.</p>
        </p>

            Are you booting the media as a UEFI device if offered?   How was the media created?  Try DVD if using flash, to compare.  
<br />
<br />Not having files backed up at all times is reckless.  Your hard drive can die at any time.   If you don't have a flash or USB external drive large enough, you can drag files into OneDrive to upload up to 5gb free, or sync using Google backup up to 15gb free, and both sell more space for cheap.  
<br />
<br />Troubleshooting Install failures:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<h2>            Random drive f&#58;&#92; popped up and cant seem to access or remove it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, yesterday i found a new drive when in file explorer it's name was: "Local Disk (F:\)" now this had never been on my computer before and i dont remember changing anything or downloading anything near to the time that it appeared. I have tried to open
 it up to see what it shows but it comes up with the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have been denied permission to access this folder</p>
<p>to gain access to this folder you will have to go to the</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">security tab</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i clicked on the security tab link and it opened up the properties panel but there seemed to be no security tab there. I am the administrator which made me concerned about the drive i then left it for the next day to deal with it. Now the next day i tried
 the same thing, didn't work then i tried switching off my internet connection and trying again. nope still didnt work well then i used a couple of anti-viruss and they said it was clean then i asked them to shred it "an error occured when trying to delete
 the file/files". Now as i know how to program i made a simple program in multiple languages to delete the file but nope none of them worked. Also i have tried looking all over the internet for answers but none helped. i have tried all the ways that i could
 think of or find out about and still couldnt even find out what it is and how it got there.</p>

            Unfortunately, you cannot upgrade from the Home edition of Windows 10 to the Pro edition for free. You will need to purchase a license.

    <title>Windows 10 downgrade to Windows 7 went wrong - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 downgrade to Windows 7 went wrong</h2>
                    <p>So I was downgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 7 the other night, and my laptop started the process. I have a Satellite C55 Series with windows 7 pre-installed on it. I started watching TV and sometime later I saw my computer was off. It was still plugged
 in and everything, so I assumed it was done downgrading. I went to turn it back on and I got a quick blue screen of death and it dumped the data and when straight to a black screen which gave me two options, use startup repair or start windows normally. I
 tried startup repair and it gave me this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem Event Name: StartupRepairOffline</p>
<p>Problem Signature 01: 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Problem Signature 02: 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Problem Signature 03: unknown</p>
<p>Problem Signature 04: 21199403</p>
<p>Problem Signature 05: AutoFailover</p>
<p>Problem Signature 06: 2</p>
<p>Problem Signature 07: 0x7e</p>
<p>OS Version: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access safe mode fine so is there anyway I can fix this without having to copy all my files over to an external drive and wiping my laptop?</p>

            <em><strong>Re-install Windows 7</strong></em>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed.</strong> Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first.
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>

    <title>WINDOWS 10 SLOWER THAN 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard carlile  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 SLOWER THAN 8.1</h2>
                    <p>It's not just the boot up, it's the whole damn thing.&nbsp; My memory is 4GB which has served 8 and 8.1 successfully in the last two years I've had the computer.&nbsp; But apps such as Edge take ages to load up, Firefox takes ages to load up and Cortana seems to appear
 whenever I don't need it.&nbsp; The Store refused to appear for 5 hours today and the choice of apps, when it did finally appear, are not exactly cutting edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having read online what some people are saying, Windows 10 has not been a qualified success and many are experiencing worse problems than 8.1.&nbsp; The reappearance of the Start Button wasn't needed either.&nbsp; On Windows 8.1 I could just move my mouse across and
 click down to wherever I needed it.&nbsp; This time most of the tile apps don't appear and the power button simply doesn't do anything when pressed.&nbsp; Never had this with the previous Windows.&nbsp; I knew it was a risk downloading the upgrade, but unfortunately I appear
 to be stuck with something that looks like it was developed in the late 1970s.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern, and we in Community will try to help you in the best possible way</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue occurs if the system file is corrupted or damaged. I suggest that you follow the methods below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span><br />
I would suggest you to run System File Checker.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. (Also applicable for Windows 10)<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method2:
</span></strong><span><br />
I would also suggest you to Run DISM or System Update Readiness tool</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The DISM or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors. (Refer to Windows 8/8.1

    <title>Updates, programs, security, UAC, ... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ben robberecht  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updates, programs, security, UAC, ...</h2>
                    <p>Well...</p>
<p>=&gt; Over time MicroSoft released many a version, I have been around since DOS based Windows 2.03, and I have been through 18 versions (some I refused to get, like the hopeless 8 series) and 4 I think Windows 10 pro x64 builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...........Why they make these annual versions like the 1709 Fall Edition are being made, i do not get it, they would be far better off making small, file like upgrades (like the normal Windows update) so instead of having to AGAIN install a new version/build
 we could continue going on, small adjustment after small adjustment.</p>
<p>This would be FAR more user friendly for one, time consuming for both user AND MicroSoft (since no more need to push out the big eggs), which again would make a LOT of time working on QUALITY over QUANTITY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...........Now, quality wise, MS did a great job, I am really not complaining, though I do have a few issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For one, there's the instability of Windows File Explorer.</p>
<p>I have had issues with it since the early days, I get the feeling WFE simply cannot deal with large quantities of data.</p>
<p>It crashes a lot, or starts hanging in the operations, quite bloody annoying.</p>
<p>I really hope there will be a decent working version of WFE soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...........Security: Network: OMG Home Networking is a DISASTER in Windows 10.</p>
<p>Seriously, are you mad, back there in MS???</p>
<p>Most of the time, I cannot log on or the system asks for sign-in (Username/Password), it loses Homegroup a lot for no reason, it loses shared partitions for some reason, or sharing a partition/folder simply is not accepted, although I have the settings for
 sharing correct, half the time it cannot find a network computer, I mean, DAMN, do you folks at MS do this on purpose?</p>
<p>Back in the day of Win 7 Ultimate x64, or XP Pro x64, networking was such a stabile, simple thing.</p>
<p>All went down the toilet after Win 7, but why did you do this?</p>
<p>Makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>And I am seemingly not the only one either thinking this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...........Security: Programs: OK, so we have Defender, it is highly noted on several sites, only being surpassed by the ever beastly Nod32/ESET, Kaspersky and if I am not mistaken, BitDefender.</p>
<p>Now, I have a few programs that are false positives (I wrote these myself, mostly), but these get detected.</p>
<p>Detected, auto-quarantined, which in itself is a good thing, however... restoring files can be problematic, and when I exclude a folder/file, Defender often ignores this and STILL goes in the folder to removes the file.</p>
<p>While otherwise, well known thingies like malware get in and do their thing.</p>
<p>Some fixes here would be quite nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...........Security: Settings: Another sometimes ridiculous thing, some parts are seriously OVERPROTECTED.</p>
<p>Example: The Windows File Explorer has this thing called Quick Access, which in my case is utterly useless.</p>
<p>Being serious autistic (Asperger), I cannot stand useless things.<br />
I am a fairly intelligent and pragmatic person, and thus I kill everything which has no use for me.</p>
<p>However, removing this Quick Access crap is quite a job, really, it includes messing in the register with permissions, editing keys, ...</p>
<p>Very user unfriendly for such a small, useless piece of programming, really.</p>
<p>Moderation in these things would be heavily appreciated by me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...........Security: Programs: part 2: The inability to remove dead, useless sub programs in Windows.</p>
<p>I am speaking of silliness like Edge, Internet Explorer, ...</p>
<p>Now, I am using Firefox since the very early stages, and I am DARNED happy with it.</p>
<p>It is set as my primary browser, but STILL I can't remove either Edge or IE from from my system.</p>
<p>Firefox is MORE than capable to run updates from MS, but no, you FORCE IE upon us for whatever reason to handly such simple tasks, and by doing so, you add clutter to my system, clutter that I HATE with immense PASSION, being a perfectionist and minimalist.</p>
<p>Garbage is meant for the bin, not for lingering around.</p>
<p>Each time I delete it, it simply spawns back upon the next start up.</p>
<p>Come on now... tssssk... I am not even master anymore in my own system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>...........UAC.</p>
<p>In itself not bad, a good idea really, IF it was implemented correctly!</p>
<p>I mean, I do get the every so often malware in, and sometimes it's not being detected, it activates, and I get no warning for this.</p>
<p>The system does not ask me if I want to run whatever in the background, it does not care.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I have a ton of software, that when I fire it up, it gets 'blocked' requiring a permission from me to run.</p>
<p>Why on Earth is there no option to whitelist programs?</p>
<p>I mean, come on, this is a basic power that we users should have, considering UAC can be pretty annoying doing this.</p>
<p>Implementing this would be quite the thing for many a user, I bet!</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are merely a few things that can get on my system, something simple as crashing WFE can REALLY get me in the red.</p>
<p>Autism, well yes, but I figure I am not the only one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Win10 - Can&#39;t Install Anything As Admin.</h2>
                    <p>Windows updated and my MSI gaming laptop went from about 5 seconds boot to about 60 seconds.&nbsp; I figured I screwed something up in the update and anything I found online suggested that I do a repair.... so I ran a repair - the option that kept my data on
 a my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I cant install anything that pops up with the "log on as administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the administrator of my laptop.</p>
<p>I edited the registry to make sure LUA (Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System) is set to 0.&nbsp; I confirmed this in the control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can click on the icons, set it to run as admin.&nbsp; I can set to compatibility mode to run as administrator.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas because this operating system is really frustrating.</p>

            Hi Trevor, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Here are some steps you can try to resolve the permission issue:
<br />
<br />First type file explorer into the search bar, then select it from the results.
<br />Click This PC.
<br />Right-click the hard disk icon, then click Properties.
<br />Click Security, then click Advanced.
<br />Click Change Permissions.
<br />Select the user account you want to change, then click Edit.
<br />Under Basic permissions, check Full control, then click OK.
<br />Now the account can enable software installation.
<br />
<br />There's also a useful video tutorial for this made by HP here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKatwf6dSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKatwf6dSM</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/rKKatwf6dSM?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/rKKatwf6dSM?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>
<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know how you go. Thanks!

<p>Thank you for your help.&nbsp; However, it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a plethora of errors when I do this.&nbsp; Here they are.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here are the specs for my laptop Graeme.&nbsp; I have a hard time imagining the update would be that significant to slow down the boot up as much as it did.&nbsp; Also, this is not the first update to screw over MSI gaming machines.&nbsp; By no means is my laptop a top

    <title>Unable to see screen share on Skype for Business on one computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to see screen share on Skype for Business on one computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to see the screen shared by my colleagues on skype for business on one of my computers (my desktop). It works fine from my laptop, and from my phone. I have even tried joining the meeting from both computers at the same time. Laptop/phone shows
 the content, and on my desktop it doesn't. Sometimes I get a pop-up on the desktop when someone starts presenting asking if I want to accept the meeting content, but after clicking yes, nothing comes up.</p>
<p>I have Office 2013 installed on this computer which is not working and Skype for Business Basic 2016. Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<p><span>Hi Mindcandy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a customer that had the same issue before resolved the problem via changing his mouse, and cause of which is incompatibility between the mouse and Teams. If it is convenient, you can try to change the related devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can make sure the related devices are ok, after done some researches, I found there is a known issue, the phenomenon of which is similar to yours, the customer cannot share his/her screen at all, and the issue occurred after he/she upgraded the pc
 to the latest version of Windows 10(1809). Following are the detailed steps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>1. Run <em>Regedit </em>as Administrator.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to "<em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters</em>".</p>
<p>3. Search for <em>MaxUserPort </em>entry, if there is no such entry, follow below to add one:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· Right-click <em>Parameters </em>to <em>New </em>&gt; <em>DWORD(32-bit) Value</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· Complete the name with "<em>MaxUserPort&nbsp;</em>"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· Press <em>Enter</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· Right-click on the new entry and choose <em>Modify</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· Select <em>Decimal </em>and enter "<em>5000"&nbsp;</em>as the value</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· Click <em>OK</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note:</span>&nbsp;It is also recommended to test via entering "15000" as the value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to share the outcomes with us.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Betty</span></p>

<p>thanks,</p>
<p>1--I understand that you can also reinstall upgrade version every time your computer is infected with virus or if you have onother computer you can install this version on the new computer.</p>
<p>am I rihtg ?</p>
<p><strong>That is correct, the computer you are transferring it to must have a previous qualifying license installed before you can install it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to reinstall Windows 8:</strong></p>
<span>
<p>To do it, do the following:</p>
<p>· Press <strong>Windows key + i</strong> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>· Click <strong>Settings</strong></p>
<strong><br />
</strong>
<p>· Click <strong>Change PC settings</strong></p>
<strong><br />
</strong>
<p>· Click <strong>General</strong> in the left column</p>
<p>Click <strong>Update and Recovery </strong></p>
<p>· Under <strong>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</strong>, click <strong>
Get started</strong></p>
<strong><br />
</strong>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>2--you tell me OEM version cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older version ,but what I understand that with OEM version you can do clean installation on older version,&nbsp; am I right?</p>
<p><strong>That is correct, the OEM version simply does not preserve your personal files, apps and settings. You will need to ensure those are backed up and prepare to reinstall your apps.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
