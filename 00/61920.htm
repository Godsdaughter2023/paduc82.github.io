<h2>            Windows 10 Invalid After Computer Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>So this first started about a year and a half ago or so. I've been tolerant of it so far, but now it's really getting frustrating- my first computer had Windows 8.1 installed on it when I first bought it- everything worked fine, it was a genuine copy of
 windows, etc. Of course, it was a Hewlett-Packard, and my brother insisted I upgrade my computer- faster performance, easier managing, so I went along with it. My computer parts arrived later that month, but before that, both he and I installed the free Windows
 10 update. <br />
<br />
When I upgraded to Windows 10, everything worked exactly as it should- everything was fine, everything was perfect, but then we started to build my computer, and instead of buying a new hard-drive and a new version of Windows 10, (I'm sorry, we're tight on
 money- we can't afford to buy another Windows Product Key, really, we can't) we just put the hard-drive from my Hewlett-Packard into my new computer- that way I could start from where I left off, same files and the same familiarity I had with it before, and
 so we wouldn't have to scrape for money for a new product key.<br />
<br />
Upon putting the hard-drive in my computer, we were more focused on the fact that it would work and do what I needed it to- it did, and it was perfectly fine, until after I started using it, I noticed something was awry.
<br />
<br />
On the bottom-right hand corner of my screen, I have a permanently irremovable watermark telling me to activate Windows as soon as possible, and it has locked me out of a few features that now, are starting to bug me. The only features I'm being locked out
 of are only <span>personalization</span> features. While the personalization features aren't that big of a problem, the watermark IS. It gets in the way of a lot of things that I do, and it'd just be really great if it were gone.
<br />
<br />
So, naturally, I tried to activate Windows- and it wants my product key. So, I looked around, and looked for the Product Key on my Hewlett-Packard, only to find that, there isn't one there. I showed my brother, and there certainly wasn't one there, to be sure.
 I eventually found the key, and I entered it in, only for Windows to tell me it's an invalid product key, and Windows is still unactivated to this day. Windows 8.1 was a genuine copy on my Hewlett-Packard, and it was even a genuine copy AFTER I installed the
 free Windows 10 upgrade- only until after the hard-drive was changed did it think it was a non-genuine copy.<br />
<br />
My brother keeps saying he'll buy a new hard-drive and get a new product key, but I really don't want to spend money for something dumb like this- we're already in some financial issues, and we really don't have any to waste trying to activate Windows even
 though it came with the computer that the hard-drive was from. He also keeps saying that if worse comes to worse, we'll have to call Microsoft and have them activate a new product key, and I will stress the reason above again- we really don't have the money
 for it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The watermark is tolerable, and has been for a long time, but now I'm just getting sick of it, and I want it out. I'd also like to have complete access over what I paid for- buying another product key to get rid of a measly watermark and restore very minor
 features to Windows 10 isn't enough reason to spend money on, so I'll finally ask the big question:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something that can be done about this that doesn't involve me buying another key? Am I stuck with this, or is there something I'm overlooking? Should I just accept that I'm stuck with it and deal with it? Or is there some better way to get Windows
 back to a legitimate copy, as it was when I bought it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            If I've understood your post correctly, you took the hard disk with an OEM copy of Windows 8.1 installed on it by HP (upgraded to 10 by you for free) and moved it to your new system, correct? In case you don't know OEM copies of the OS are tied to the
 original hardware and cannot legally be transferred to a different system. Only retail/system builder copies can be transferred. The free upgrade to Win10 inherits the transfer rights of the version it upgraded - OEM or retail. At this point you can either
 put the drive back into the HP system and activate Windows, or if you simply cannot afford a genuine copy of the OS for the new system and want to do things legally then switch to a free OS like Linux.

Ah, you've got to be kidding me- I didn't actually know that, actually. When I got my computer, I'd never used a computer that belonged to me, so I never dabbled in what anything really meant honestly. Yeah, that's exactly what happened, I had no idea that
 was something that could cause problems- I thought there was just some fault going on, and that there was a chance it could be fixed relatively easy. I guess that puts me in a tough spot- deal with the unactivated version or buy a new copy.
<br />
<br />
Well, thanks for the help anyways! It helps a lot- the knowledge of knowing is a lot better than being confused as to what to do at all. I guess it'd be best to buy a new copy, though I'll probably have to hold out for a long while until then.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!<br />

            If it's an OEM licence on the original PC (highly likely) then you can't move it onto a new PC.&nbsp; New PC = new licence I'm afraid.

<h2>            Achievement hasn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t been unlocked</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I never had any issues with achievements so it is a bit different than what is described here: http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4268/t/1795226.aspx</p>

<p>Two days ago I fulfilled the requirement for an achievement but due to the latest Xbox LIVE issues the achievement didn't unlock. I got an error everytime I started the achievement app. So I went to bed to check the other day.<br />
Yesterday I started the game and the app and nothing happened. I accomplished the requirement again and the achievement still stays locked.<br />
</p>
<p>This morning I checked again and it still won't unlock. And it has been 24 hours since! (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/games/troubleshoot-achievements-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/games/troubleshoot-achievements-challenges</a>)</p>

<p>Thank you Microsoft for programming the achievements like this, that they won't unlock when you're offline or the Achievement app has problems.</p>
<p>Probably the achievement won't simply unlock by accomplishing the requirements, but by getting the in game screen for a completed challenge. I already completed the challenge, thus I will never see that 'challenge completed' screen ever again, meaning I
 can't get the achievement ever!</p>
<p>Have you ever played Trials?! Do you know how hard this game is? And no, I will not reset my game progress in order to reset this challenge to get the 'challenge completed screen' again!! I have 4 days pure playtime and worked my *** off for getting all
 the challenges done and the platinum medals!</p>

<p>I heard that the achievements are cached somewhere and maybe they get syncronized somewhen... Where is it cached? In my profile? In the game data itself? On the console?</p>
<p>There has to be someone from the tech staff who is involved in the achievement programming knowing how all this works and how to unlock it without resetting my game progress. I want to chat with that person!</p>

I can see that you're aware that we're running into issues with it right now.<br /><br />We are very much still working on it. It's going to take longer than expected, but we do not have an estimated time frame. All we can ask is that you be patient with us and understand that we're hard at work to get you those achievements that are sitting at 100%.<br /><br />Again, I am very sorry that you're being affected by this.

<p>It would have been nice to get an official statement about it, because the last time I heard about this was last week and the official twitter support said "that it had been fixed and achievements may 'take a few days' to pop".</p>
<p>On a sidenote, as far as I remember my Achievement progress for this specific Achievement is not at 100%.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X Wake From Sleep Issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just replaced my Xbox One OG with a new Xbox One X and am having a strange issue on wake from sleep/instant on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Xbox One X is in sleep/hibernate mode and i turn it on via the controller or the the button on the console it won't wake. The light turns on solid, as it should, but i just get a black screen. It may flicker with an image of the home screen but
 is generally blank. A quick press of the button to turn it off and then turn it back on results in the same behavior.</p>
<p>Pulling and replacing the power cord from the console will get it working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a hardware issue where i should consider returning the console or is this a software issue?</p>
<p>

<p>So I think I figured out what was going on and am going to share my thoughts in case others come across this strange issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It had to do with a Microsoft Kinect Adapter I purchased off of Amazon. The adapter eventually died and I removed it from my Xbox and I don't seem to have the problem anymore.</p>
<p><br />
The adapter was a 'used' one from Amazon.com and came in a brown box that looked like OEM refurbished packaging. I'm not convinced it was a legit adapter. Any who, I am returning it to Amazon and forking over $75, an obscene amount IMO, for a new Microsoft
 branded <span>adapter </span>.</p>

<h2>            Trying to install Sim Classics&#58; Maxis Collections 2 on my Windows 10 Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install a copy of Sim Classics: Maxis Collections 2 on my Windows 10 Laptop and I'm having a problem doing so. When I run the media on the disk I end up getting an error message saying "Can't launch the installer from CD" and then that's all
 that happens. Is there anything that I can do to get my game to work? I tried going into the properties of the actual game file and selecting compatibility mode and then I tried a few different versions of Windows (with Windows 98 being my obvious first choice)
 but that did nothing (I got the same message again each time). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance to all who reply.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>Edit:&nbsp;Here's a picture of what Event Viewer is saying is going on:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2a08657-5e3d-41e3-8cd0-cce0f6049035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2a08657-5e3d-41e3-8cd0-cce0f6049035" /></a><br />
Does this mean that I won't be able to play my game then?</p>

<p>Hello Carlo Fer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I tried to create an account following instructions. But I failed to log in. Now I noticed that English also doesn't show correctly for some websites. It's really frustrating. I tried to explain to my IT support team in the company
 but they can't see any problem. Some websites are really unreadable for me. Please, help! What can I do more? I used a computer with a Chinese Windows installation before but never faced this kind of problem. Thank you!</p>

            it has a pop up that says security warning do you want to open this file...then puts the name of the file in it...has a place with a check mark to always ask before opening this file&nbsp; then has a button to open or cancel...it does it for every picture I
 have now no matter what it is. I have had these pictures on the desktop in folders for a long time and never had to do this to open them. Once I remove the check mark and click open it does open but I have to do it for every photo and i have thousands of them.
 I use windows gallery to open photos...this all happened when I did the last update by Microsoft yesterday. It changed a lot of things but this is the worse one.<br />

            What happens if you directly open your photos from File Explorer, and not use Windows Gallery (Windows Live Gallery)?<br />
<br />
If the issue is only in Windows Live Gallery, you can reinstall it. If not, keep us posted, as some community members might have answers to this.&nbsp;

            these are photos either on my desktop that I got off of my own camera or some I downloaded from FB or emails...but they have opened all of this time on gallery until now...some are in individual folders on my desktop for each family member...but they always
 opened for me... I think it is somewhere in the security thingamajig that I can't find&nbsp; to undo so it will leave them alone...please help if you can... I have tons of photos on my computer and have to undo the warning on each one as I go to view it...then
 it opens for me from then on....but this will take the rest of my life to do each one and I am already 70 years old and don't have that much time left to do it...LOL

<p>2. Choose <strong>Advanced options</strong>, click <strong>View you update history</strong>, and select

            Hi Pagefile'sys,
<br />
<br />In your Registry you should have the following main keys under Computer:
<br />
<br />HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
<br />HKEY_USERS
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
<br />
<br />HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT - The software settings about the file system, shortcut information, information on file associations and other user interface information are stored in this hive. The file association information are essentially used by Windows to invoke the correct program when a file is opened using Windows Explorer.
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER - The configuration settings for each hardware and software item in the computer system, corresponding to the currently logged-on user are stored in this hive. This hive is dynamic, i.e. whenever a user logs-on into the system, the settings corresponding to the user are retrieved from the respective subkey of H_KEY_USERS as user profile and stored in this hive. If a currently active item modifies a registry entry in its course of operation, the change will affect only the current user.
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - The configuration settings for hardware and software for all users of the computer are stored in this hive. The information stored here is computer specific and not user specific.
<br />
<br />HKEY_USERS – The configuration settings for each hardware and software item in the computer system, corresponding to each of the users of the computer system are stored in this hive. The information on the user's folders, user's choices of themes, colors and Control Panel settings are stored here as user's profile. This hive has a subkey for each user storing his/her user's profile.
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG - The current hardware configuration settings, pointing to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEConfig are stored in this hive. This hive is dynamic, meaning it is built on the run.
<br />

    <title>gdb filename extension conflict bettween Microsoft, Adobe Reader and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iliasgeorgiadis  say:</h3>
<h2>            gdb filename extension conflict bettween Microsoft, Adobe Reader and Garmin</h2>
                    <p><span>Map Source is a charting and plotting programme of Garmin and I have been working with it in the last 15 years at least. Furthermore, I am not a novice with laptops and
 software. </span></p>
<p><span>With Windows 7 or earlier and the Map Source chart plotting program in my laptops or desktops I never had any problem.&nbsp; If Map Source is not installed than a Garmin “gdb”
 (it stands for “Garmin or Geo Data Base) file does not open and Explorer proposes alternatives.&nbsp; So in my Windows 7 computer I prepared a USB stick. &nbsp; In my Windows 7 computer I can use the Garmin gdb files either with Garmin Map Source or another Garmin program
 named Basecamp. The said USB stick containing my folders I wanted to use with Basecamp which is installed also in my Windows 10 computer while Map Source is not due to incompatibility.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>In &nbsp;the Windows 10 computer with File Explorer I opened and I saw all my folders.&nbsp; When you see folders you do not see file names.&nbsp; To see a file name and to open a file
 contained therein you first open the folder and then click on the file name.&nbsp; <em>
<strong>When I open the folder and before clicking any file I see all my filenames with the Adobe Reader icon on the left. If I press the file name it opens as a pdf. File Explorer does not propose another program and the only proposed choice is to look for
 in the store. Then I went to Windows 10 settings in my Computer for default programs for all file extensions to find out that only Adobe Reader is available for opening a gdb file.</strong></em>&nbsp; I was not intending to put it as a subject in any forum.&nbsp; I
 only wanted to bring the matter up with Microsoft, Garmin and Adobe Reader. &nbsp; I eventually found myself in the Adobe forum because Adobe does not foresee a relevant subject in their site’s questionnaire and subsequesntly Microsoft for the same reason. Most
 probably Garmin also is to difficult to contact.</span></p>

<h2>            Cannot copy and paste from a remote desktop </h2>
                    I'm running Vista Home basic, 32-bit and trying to copy and paste back and forth from my remote desktop connection to my home computer.&nbsp; When I log on, I checked the local resources tab and made sure that the printer and clip board options were selected.&nbsp;
 I even de-selected them once to try and trick the system, but that hasn't worked.&nbsp; Any suggestions??????&nbsp; It's becoming quite a hassle to type everything twice!&nbsp; It worked in the past, but just decided to stop working for whatever reason.&nbsp; Thank you!

            Hi Mulli-dog,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com.<br />
<br />
Essentially, the information on the Local Resources tab should have CLIPBOARD selected.&nbsp; Since, you have already have&nbsp;this setting checked, let me ask a few questions:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Are you remoting from this Vista system to an XP system&nbsp;?&nbsp;or vice versa? or Vista to Vista? &nbsp;If so what is the Service Pack for both revisions of Windows on the computers involved?&nbsp;and do those systems have all the recent Windows Upates&nbsp;installed?<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Do you remember loading any software or maybe an intelliport mouse prior to this issue occurring?&nbsp; are you using a wireless keyboard and mouse?<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Do the copy and paste functions work normally on both systems outside&nbsp;when not involved in&nbsp;Remote Desktop?<br />
<br />
Please let us know any information that may be necessary in helping to&nbsp;resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update Failure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update Failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to update my Surface Book Pro with the Anniversary Update. I have now tried this multiple times and seem to always get to the same outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today the upgrade downloaded and the PC restarted. The update continued to 11% and then restarted with the message 'Restoring to Previous Version of Windows'. I have tried to find an error message but there does not seem to be one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another post here I saw that one person suggested looking at the setuperr.log file in c:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Panther directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The relevant messages from this file seem to be as follows:</p>
<p>
2016-09-10 11:47:46, Error &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SP &nbsp; &nbsp; DRVMIG: Failed to inject driver package in the new OS (payload hardlinked): C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\ehdrv.inf_amd64_62b7df15a8c66286\ehdrv.inf.

</p><p>
</p><p>Whilst I somewhat experienced in faultfinding on a PC I am afraid that I am out of my depth here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone point me in a direction that will help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link. I eventually found that the problem was due to my ESET Nod32 Anti Virus software. Once I had disabled this the update went through well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can appreciate why this caused a problem and should have checked it earlier. I think that the frustration that I have; and believe that so many other people have, is the absolute lack of useful error message from Windows. Whilst I would never expect the
 upgrade software to report something like, 'your ESET Virus Checker has caused a problem,' it would be helpful if the upgrade process was more able to give useful advice when problems like this&nbsp;occur; especially given that almost every computer will have a
 virus checker of some kind running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a long term Apple Mac user and whilst I like Apple products I also use Windows everyday&nbsp;professionally and I'm not a Microsoft hater. I can only comment that in the 8 years that I have been using Mac and upgrading it annually I have not once had an
 issue with an upgrade. I just wish that Microsoft could emulate this success rate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been frustrating and reminds me why I walked into a Apple store in 2008.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help and sorry about the rant, it is just getting it off my chest and I know that you are not responsible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help. </p>

    <title>USB Mass Storage Dvice - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prof_gvk  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Mass Storage  Dvice</h2>
                    <p>I loaded some files on my&nbsp;USB mass storage device&nbsp; at my home computer (Windows 7). At&nbsp;the lab at school, I plugged in my device into an&nbsp;Apple with&nbsp; simulated Windows. .&nbsp; was able to access my files. Later on I went to another similar computer and&nbsp;the "explorer"
 could not see my device. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now my home computer does not see the device. I ran the troubleshooting that gave me the following message:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"Windows cannot use this hardware device because it has been prepared for "safe removal", but it has not been removed from the computer. (Code 47)</p>
<p>To fix this problem, unplug this device from your computer and then plug it in again."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried several times plugging and unplugging the device but still the "explorer" doe s not see it. The device is a Seagate ' Free Agent GoFlex 320 GB."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would appreciate any assistance. Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try connecting the device to another Windows computer to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Code 47 error, we need to unplug the device, restart the computer&nbsp;and then plug it in again.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After connecting the device, I would suggest you to download and run the Seatools&nbsp;utility from

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the outcome after running the utility.</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did try to run from another computer but still the Explorer does not see it. I took your suggestion and downloaded the Sea Utility. It found my device and I ran the Short-Generic option. It did not report any errors.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The computer that caused (?) the problem is a Mac &nbsp;in&nbsp;the college lab. It&nbsp;&nbsp;runs&nbsp;virtual windows.&nbsp; A colleague told me that there is the possibility that the Mac reformatted my device. Is that possible? And if that is the case, can I recover my files?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Incidentally, the device shows in the Device Manager but when I click on the "Troubleshoot" tab it put the block sign on the on the device icon.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I appreciate your help. Thanks</p>

                    I'm not sure how I ended up with two separate accounts on my new Windows 10 OS,&nbsp;but the one I want to delete is not associated with an option to delete.&nbsp; Both accounts are&nbsp;"local" accounts and both are "administrative" types.&nbsp; The account which I want
 to keep is associated with a delete option, but I want to keep it because I have customized it and downloaded a lot of special software on&nbsp;it.&nbsp; Remedy?

<h2>            Microsoft Print To PDF Printer Doesn&#39;t Work Suddenly</h2>
                    <p>I'd been using "Microsoft Print To PDF" printer for a while until mid-April 2019 when it didn't work any more.&nbsp; It seems like some drivers have been deleted and it cannot be reinstalled.&nbsp; I used Windows 7 but it was automatically updated to Windows 10.&nbsp;
 I used it very often and it was really a great tool.&nbsp; What should be done?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi Vijay, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see the results in&nbsp;Italic fonts with underline&nbsp;after I&nbsp;tried some of the following methods:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>*****************************************************************************</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incorrectly configured settings, PDF file name issue, default printer issue, outdated application, and outdated Windows operating system. To fix your concern, follow the methods below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Check Windows for any updates.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>- In fact, I could not update Windows successfully.&nbsp; Windows 7 had been automatically updated to 10 and followed by other problems.&nbsp;
</em></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check Windows for any updates by following the steps on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/gl-es/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">link</span></a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Re-enable Microsoft Print to PDF.&nbsp; <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I disable the feature, restart computer, but I could not check it again.&nbsp; I then recovered the PC.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong><em>Control Panel</em></strong> in <strong>Search</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Programs</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong> and uncheck the box beside it.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Restart</strong> your computer.</li><li>Type <strong><em>Control Panel</em></strong> in <strong>Search</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Programs</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong> and check the box beside it.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Make sure that there are no commas in the PDF File Name.&nbsp; <em>
<p>
</p><p>If the PDF file name includes commas or any special notations, it will be created to 0 Bytes size and you won’t be able to find it
<span>in</span> the saving folder. This is the reason why Microsoft Print to PDF not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4: Set the Microsoft Print to PDF as the Default Printer.&nbsp; <em>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong><em>Control Panel</em></strong> in <strong>Search</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Devices and Printers</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Set as <span>default printer</span></strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 5: Change the Output Directory for PDF files.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>I cannot use Microsoft Print To PDF function so is its Output Directory for PDF files.</em></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are times that an issue with the default browsers affects the Microsoft Print to PDF function. No notification or PDF reader opening when printing files to PDF but the output goes directly to the root of C:\Users\%username%\%internetDocName%site%.pdf.
 Use a different browser to choose or change the output folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 6: Update the Microsoft Print to PDF driver.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>I couldn't update its driver with error message "the driver is not digitally signed".&nbsp; When I add printer driver using wizard, error Ünable to install Microsoft Print To PDF, Type 4 - User Mode, x64 driver.&nbsp; The configuration registry database is corrupt."appears.&nbsp;
 But I have been using "Microsoft print to PDF"many months.</em></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong><em>Control Panel</em></strong> in <strong>Search</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Devices and Printers</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Remove device</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes.</strong></li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the blank area on the Devices and Printers window.</li><li>Select <strong>Add devices and printers</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>The printer that I want isn’t listed</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong><span>Use</span> an existing port</strong>, select <strong>

    <title>Dual Monitors stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robinsof  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Monitors stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi all<br />
<br />
I have an interesting challenge that suddenly started occurring today only and I wonder if anyone can help<br />
<br />
My set-up<br />
Surface Pro 3 (i5, 8gb ram)<br />
Surface Pro 4 keyboard cover<br />
Surface Pro 4 dock/hub<br />
2 x Apple 27" cinema monitors (non-thunderbolt units migrated from my MacBook pro)<br />
<br />
All was working fine with both monitors being driven successfully (extended desktop) from the hub and Pro 3 with Windows 10.. No issues at all (Yes DPI scaling a bit weird from time to time, though) until this morning<br />
<br />
<strong>Left the unit(s) on and came back into the room later and both monitors were blank(off) and only Surface screen on</strong><br />
Don't know if something automatically updated while I was out</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I have tried to get both screens working again<br />
- Unplugged all and restarted with no monitors plugged in.. Surface screen working fine<br />
- Plugged in one of the monitors into the dock, screen came on as primary screen and Surface as secondary (fine)<br />
- Plug second screen into dock...both ext monitors then go blank/off with only Pro 3 screen working<br />
- Go back to one ext monitor (unplug/plug back in and also rebooting) and then plug second into Pro2 directly.. Both ext screens go blank<br />
- Plugged in one by one (swopping monitors to check monitors themselves) ; each works by themselves (so no power/screen issues)..
<strong>Only issue when both plugged into the unit at same time</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I &nbsp;am now down to using a single external monitor. Whenever I plug the second one into the dock, both go blank and the disply switches to the Pro 3 only... Tried rebooting multiple times etc. Have done a reset (power down while holding down volume etc then
 reboot)<br />
<br />
Any other ideas from anyone please??<br />
<br />
Thank you </p>

            I suspect that your current display mode is incompatible with the monitor you use. Open the Control Panel, click Dispay then play with the various settings. When finished check your keyboard too. Its full stop key appears to be defective.

<p>Thanks for the advise. It still does not work. In win 10 ver 1703, the option is not available. Cortana was not able to help as well.</p>
<p>Op my pc with win 10, ver 1607 I am able to change the font size for tool tips etc. Ver 1703 just does not allow you to do this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am using the same version you are, so, yes. It works.</p>
<p>Let's try it this way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Windows Logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click the Settings icon (Gear shaped thing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click System (not Personalization), SYSTEM</p>
<p>Click Change the Size of Text and choose one of the options OR click Custom Scaling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for trying but this option is not available. I can resize the scaling, but that's not what I want to do. The "change size of text" does not offer any options.</p>
<p>I was able to obtain another way of changing my tool tip font size &amp; size on another site.</p>

<p>It does if you click on it.</p>

 sorry I couldn't be of more assistance. I know the option you were talking about. Where we could change all these things, font sizes, tooltips, etc. INDIVIDUALLY.&nbsp; And that seems to have vanished as Windows progresses towards the future. We can still change
 our mouse pointers individually (it's under "devices") but, yeah.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change is always annoying...at least at first.</p>
<p>I get you.</p>

<p>As I said, I don't want to increase the scale of windows.</p>
<p>I want change the font size of my "tool tips".&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows 10, version 1607, when you go to system &amp; you get to the screenshot you sent, there is a option in blue, below multiple displays, that says "Advanced display settings".</p>
<p>When going in there, you have the option to pick "advanced sizing of text &amp; other items".</p>
<p>This version you &amp; I have, does not offer those functions. Where has it gone to in ver 1703? Why has it been removed?</p>
<p>This has caused major issues at work where about half of the pc's have the Ver 1607 &amp; the others this frustrating ver 1703.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying. I need someone from Microsoft to give advise to correct this issue.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately Microsoft in all of their wisdom has removed that feature...</p>
<p>Something to do with phasing out Control Panel functions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would be OK if they provided a replacement...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a 3rd party tool that will return the ability to change these settings as well as others... It's called WinAeroTweaker...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try this, watch for the option to run as Portable instead of installing...</p>
<p>It seems to work better, and once your settings are made it may not be needed again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something I ended up doing was to export the registry settings of my 1607 setup, and then merge them with the newer builds... They are located at...</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I exported the entire WindowsMetrics folder...</p>
