            Hi Louise.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This is best configured in the old Control Panel being phased out now.  So type Control Panel in Start search, then choose Autoplay, then tick the box at top for Choose What to do with Each type of media, then adjust the drop down to tell each type of media what should play it.  
<br />
<br />This is illustrated the section of this tutorial for Enable or Disable AutoPlay in Control Panel:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/236241/how-to-enable-disable-and-customize-autoplay-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/236241/how-to-enable-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Can&#39;t Download Apps from Microsoft Store</h2>
                    <p>So for a couple of weeks now I have been unable to download anything from the store. When I try to, the store will tell me it's "starting download" or "acquiring license" but then after a few seconds it will just me "there's been an error on our end with
 a different error code each time.</p>
<p>It says to try again later but even a week later I can't get anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I've been able to download only on app (Sea of Thieves), the download started after a few hours of restarting it again and again and even stopped a few times along the way but eventually it completed. However I've been unable to reiterate this success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried a few things :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Clear the cache (through settings menu and through cmd).</p>
<p>- Updating windows.</p>
<p>- Doing a system scan.</p>
<p>- Uninstalling and reinstalling the store.</p>
<p>- Using the store troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of those were conclusive.</p>
<p>

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />Still not working, then I recommend you perform a repair upgrade:

<h2>            Microsoft Windows 8.1 Store Problems</h2>
                    So I have been having issues using Windows 8 apps. This happened right after I upgraded from Windows 8 to 8,1. I'm currently running Windows 8.1, but I still get the problem where the windows store is stuck on loading when I use it. Here's the real issue
 I have tried nearly everything, and I was willing to refresh but I have Office (i.e Word, Powerpoint) So if I refresh will I still be able to re-install these programs, and if so how? Any solution, and or answer would be awesome, thanks.

            <p>So, to confirm the issue - you load up a Store page for a game, the price loads, you click that and it spins for a bit (maybe a few minutes) and then nothing happens. Is that correct? So you never get a screen popping up (overlaying the Store page) that asks which payment method you would like to use?</p>
<p>Are you able to buy content at <a href="http://store.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.xbox.com</a> instead? If so, try that.</p>
<p>If not, go to <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://billing.microsoft.com</a> and make sure that your billing information is correct (payment methods, addresses) and that the regions (country) there match your physical location and account region.</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

<p>Hello Maxen,</p>
<p>Sorry for not replying sooner,</p>
<p>I am able to download free games on my iPad but I cannot seem to buy games that require money, even though I have more than enough local currency.</p>
<p>Your description of my problem sounds about right, i don't get a screen about payment nor does an error code appear, on the console?</p>
<p>I have made sure that my billing information is correct but still seem to be unable to purchase/download anything on my xbox one?</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>K1NGZ</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>Just to elaborate on the problem I am experiencing I click the buy button and then a page (overlaying the store page) comes up with a loading icon on it. Then after a few minutes the loading icon stops then the overlaying page goes off and then I am on the
 page where you can choose they buy button.(back where I started).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>So there's a couple different issues here:</p>
<p>On iPad when that does not work, are you looking at Xbox 360 games? If so, it's a known issue that that site (<a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://marketplace.xbox.com</a>) does not recognise the currency on your account, so to buy games you will need a debit/credit card or PayPal account on file. You can use currency to buy Xbox 360 games only through an actual Xbox 360.</p>
<p>If on iPad you're trying to buy Xbox One games (<a href="http://store.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.xbox.com</a>), then that may be an issue with the mobile browser. Try a desktop browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge) and see if that works better.</p>
<p>As for the spinning circle, I'm not sure what's causing that, but I actually experienced the same thing yesterday and I thought of this thread and what you had reported. I tried a few times in succession and eventually worked. So if you've not done so already, could you try loading the overlaid page a few times and see if it eventually sticks? If you've tried more than four times in a row without backing off the same game's page, let us know and we'll see if something else works.</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

            <p>ive been trying to purchase COD MWR points for hours now. It shows the loading screen then pops up a black box and nothing happens. I've reset the Xbox (with keep games and apps) and I've even called my internet provider. I have a download speed of 380 and an upload of 37 (according to the last speed test) so I know it's not an internet issue. Is this another fault with the game just like having to wait forever to play multiplayer in a party (but when you play out of a party you find a match instantly)?</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Welcome to the microsft community!
<br />
<br />&nbsp; I recommend you to manage the color profiles of the printer, since depending on the device you are using, it can have different profiles designed for different types of paper or ink.
<br />
<br />The customization options will vary from the printer you have and if you have the updated drivers, so I recommend you do the Windows updates before performing these procedures.
<br />
<br />To start you can open the Start Menu, write Color Management and select this option to customize the Color options.
<br />In the Devices tab locate the printer you want to use and validate the profile you want to use in the Profile Selection section.
<br />
<br />Once you select it, click on Set as default profile, restart the computer and validate if you can already do the printing as you wish.
<br />
<br />I hope this information is helpful
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<h2>            Dawnguard commonly asked questions &#40;may contain spoilers&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Since I'm no longer bound by an nda I can talk about dawnguard now and here is a few questions that are usually asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. When does dawnguard start?</p>
<p>&nbsp;It starts at level 10 and you have to wait 24 hours. Then a guard tells you about the dawnguard. Also you start the dlc at level 1 as long as you find fort dawnguard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. How do I join the vampires?</p>
<p>spoiler: You accept the reward at the end of the first mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. How do i join the dawnguard?</p>
<p>spoiler: Reject the reward at the end of the first mission</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. any new spells?</p>
<p>Just restoration and conjuration spells</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.How long can you be a vampire lord for?</p>
<p>You can be a vampire lord basically forever it never runs out. Then you can revert back to human form and turn back into a vampire lord as many times as you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. How do I revert back if I'm in vampire lord form?</p>
<p>Press up on the d-pad and look for the Revert form</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. When do the new dragons show up?</p>
<p>levels 60 and 70</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. How do i level up vampire lord and werewolf perk trees?</p>
<p>Press the B button</p>

<p>I'll post more as the week continues because I really don't want to spoil a lot. but feel free to ask questions on here and I'll quickly get back.</p>

<p>No. Perks for creatures are separate from perks from leveling. You don't increase skill with Vampire Lord/Werewolf. When the bar fills up under the tree, you just receive a perk instead of increasing a skill.

<p>Might be worth noting that Legendary dragons usually dont spawn until level 78. Though Ive heard rumors that they can spawn earlier.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>And a tip for those who dont want to be a vampire, but also dont want to miss out on the 11 perk achievement. Just do a manual save before accepting/refusing the gift then go roflstomp a couple of cities as what appears to be a troll hair doll. Took me about
 20 minutes to fully max out the tree. But I believe there are multiple opportunites to become a VL, even after the DLC quest is complete. Though Im not entirely sure on that.</p>

<h2>            &#34;RPC Server is unavailable&#34; connecting to&#47;from Win7 and either Win7 or XP</h2>
                    <p>The situation is that I have a home network with multiple XP/Pro computers that have applications that talk to each other with TASKLIST, Shutdown and other commands. My computers at home are all in the same WORKGROUP.&nbsp;Everything has been working just fine
 for years, but now we are starting to get Win7 computers and I can't get them to talk to each other.</p>
<p>Using the TASKLIST as the test command, if I enter a "TASKLIST /S othercomputer" command on either the XP or Win7 computer with the othercomputer a Win7 computer, I get the error message.</p>
<p>I am now at a computer lab where all the computers are Win7 and are&nbsp;in the same WORKGROUP and trying again, just so that I eliminate anything that I may have messed up at home. I have sign on's to two computers (#15 and #18) with the same&nbsp;user name and password,
 and the two computers&nbsp;have been set for some file sharing and I can see/update files on the other computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I open a CMD window and try a TASKLIST to the other computer, I get the error.&nbsp;&nbsp; When trying the Win7 to Win7 test, I did find a message with Event
 Viewer - Custom Views - Administrative Events that said "DCOM was unable to communicate with the computer XXXXX15 using any of the configured protocols".
</p>
<p>As far as checking the SERVICES, I have checked and DHCP Client, RPC Endpoint Mapper, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator, and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) are all&nbsp;Started.</p>
<p>Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated. </p>

            <p>I feel like Microsoft is passing the buck. I thought that posting things here was supposed to get me some help. All I see is a "go away" attitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems the RPC is a somewhat complex part of the operating system. Maybe someone can point me to an expert that can help fix Windows-7 so that it will communicate properly. I am sure that there is just some system parameter (Registry value or permission)
 that needs to be set to get this working.&nbsp; Someone else must have had system to system problems somewhere along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I did go to the requested community and really it doesn't look like that is the correct place either. It all seemed like Server problems, not Win-7 issues.</p>

<h2>            Code 45</h2>
                    On my Surface Pro 3 (Windows 8.1) my Marvell Avastar Wireless ac adapter shows "device not connected to the computer (Code 45) To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer." Obviously, one cannot do that in a Surface Pro. I have
 already uninstalled and reinstalled the driver and restarted the SP. What else can I do?

<h3> thinktwice77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One X randomly disconnects all controllers during middle of game.</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought an Xbox one X and just come across this issue. After turning on the xbox ( with controller) the xbox&nbsp;will disconnect from all controllers and not allow them to reconnect. Posting up the reconnect banner like it lost power or something.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to restart the xbox to sync the controllers back. This happens randomly at any point. I want to know if anyone else is having this problem, if its a bug in a update, the controllers? I just don't know.&nbsp;</p><p>Its still under the 30 days from purchase and would like to know if it would be worth it to return it,&nbsp;(already downloaded a bunch of games), or wait for an update? I don't know, please help with all of your opinions. Thanks</p>

            <p>I don't get the same problem as you but kind of similar. My Xbox one X turns itself on randomly and also suggest stopped doing anything when the A button is pressed on the home screens. It recognizes that you pressed the button, it just doesn't do anything. If you hold the button down it might recognize it eventually. It does this with every controller I have so it's not the controllers.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>I've been using rechargeable batteries for years and from my experience, the only trouble I've ever had with controllers disconnecting is when the batteries are very old and barely hold a charge anymore. The last set I had would only last about 2 hours before starting to disconnect and died after about 3 hours of use. They were about 3 years old when they started doing this. Newer rechargeable batteries have never caused disconnect issues, at least for me.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Right now I'm using Duracells, 2500mah NIMH rechargeables. They're about a year old and still going strong. I'm on almost every night, at least 5 hours and they still go probably more than a week between charges... no disconnects.</p>

            <p>I have a similar issue. I have the original one and it doesnt happen to that console at all. I will by playing and in the middle of the game usually when I'm about to get in a gun fight they just disconnect from the console and i have to press the button to reconnect them. It is very annoying. Now out of nowhere it is giving me Network lag with play PUBG&nbsp;usually right before a gun fight and kick me from my party, also doesnt do it on the original xbox one. I still have it in my living room and I tried just to make sure. I also thought the controller thing was the battery pack, i removed it put in AA batteries and although it did last longer without disconnect it still eventually did it. I'm pretty annoyed because the one x is a beast and I just want it to work right. If I end up having to return it I will just ask for a refund as it is only two weeks old.&nbsp;<br /></p>

            <p>I just used regular copper top batteries for about 4 days, then when they went almost dead I installed my EBL brand 2800 mAh batteries right from the charger fully charged and within 30 minutes controller was disconnecting and I could play. This is with the Project Scorpio. Must be the new xbox X needs more voltage than rechargeable can provide. Copper top volts was over 1.6, ebl2800 was 1.4 fully charged.</p>

In fact it's happening right now, I had to take the batteries out of the Elite controller and use the standard controller. It only happens with the X console and when using the Elite controller. If I use the Elite controller on my day one edition of the One it never happened. Xbox support has no answers except the usual nonsense, which does nothing for this problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I just started getting this pop-up after creating a mapped network connection to a USB drive inside of the RDC client.&nbsp; The map was successful, and I can see all the data on that drive.&nbsp; The pop-up appears in the RDC Client.&nbsp; Both machines are Windows10

    <title>Underwhelmed and dissatisfied with xbox one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Underwhelmed and dissatisfied with xbox one</h2>
                    
<p>I'm sure I am not the first person to say this, nor will I be the last. I am positive there are many who disagree, that is fine...there are many who agree also, as that is what is so great about sharing our opinions!</p>
<p>I hate the xbox one more than any other gaming console I have ever used (with the exception of Nintendo's Virtual Boy). There are so many things wrong with it I don't even know where to start. Has team xbox lost sight of what a gaming console is supposed
 to be? Why are corporations obsessed with change for the sake of change? If it wasn't for the time and money I already have invested in xbox I wouldn't even bother writing this, or turning my xbox on for that matter.</p>
<p>There are so many re-releases, remakes, remasters, editions, and versions of games that have already been released it makes me want to cry. Am I just imagining that I am meant to be distracted from the fact that xbox one game development is a bit behind
 schedule? The xbox one dashboard feels thoughtless and painful. There is way too much going on that doesn't need to be and everything I use the most is buried in layers of menus that seem to be organized by the offspring of a hurricane and a tornado. Half
 the time my pins don't load, my achievements won't show or show all zeros, everything is so big I have to scroll for 20 minutes to get to the end of a list of giant squares. It takes me 5 minutes to scroll through my rockband dlc, unacceptable.</p>
<p>Speaking of rockband, would I want to browse the xbox one store for dlc or stab myself in the eyeballs repeatedly so I never have to see the xbox one store again...hmmm...too close to call. I actually turn on my 360 or use my pc when I want to purchase things
 because the xbox one store looks like an html 1 webpage from the 90s. A blind middle school kid that uses text to speech and voice input could code a better looking page, unacceptable. I could honestly design a better dashboard layout in about 20 minutes using
 nothing but notepad. You would think a corporation like microsoft that survives by selling people things would want to make a digital store that is easy to navigate, easy to look at, and capable of displaying all the products in an organized list with filters,
 you know...not a store that turns people away to another device.</p>
<p><br />
I could deal with the oneguide and the community tabs if they worked every time and not just when they feel like it, and my list of games didn't have to be pinned to home from another menu buried in the depths of the xbox one menu labyrinth. If you have more
 than a few games you may be scrolling for 10 minutes finding what you are looking for. Lets forget pressing the xbox button to access a menu that contains everything we need, because that would make too much sense. Who needs simple features that we all deserve
 and have grown accustomed to over the last 10 years, which provide basic functionality and fluent control? Apparently not anyone who shelled out for an xbox one according to microsoft. Why even mention windows 10 when the only feature it shares with xbox is
 edge? If i can't run windows apps, its not windows, period.</p>
<p>Not to be too negative here, I do appreciate having filled my 1tb drive within the first month of having my xbox one, and that is without copying countless audio cds to enjoy while I game. /sarcasm</p>
<p><br />
Conclusion: I went from a very happy xbox 360 customer (still am) to a disgruntled xbox one owner who can get more enjoyment out of last generations xbox.</p>

<p>So you hate it because of the menus? What do you think of it for gaming?</p>
<p>I think the menus are easy to navigate. When I turn on the console I pull the right trigger and it takes me right to my games. I have a lot of games and it take 10 seconds to scroll through them all.
</p>
<p>I do agree that the store could be designed better. The game section is fine but the dlc section is woeful. Wouldn't be easy to have 1 square for Rockband and then when you click on that it will take you yo the million things for Rockband to sort through.
 Instead you need to scroll and scroll and scroll to get to the next game. </p>
<p>I'm not sure about the One Guide as I haven't watched tv in many years.</p>
<p>The remasters and remakes isn't anything to hate the console for. &nbsp;That's just the industry trying to make a quick buck. Thankfully that trend seems to be dying down. There are less and less remakes coming out. There are just as many on PS4.
</p>
<p>My achievements don't load all the time either. I'd say they didn't load about 5 times in the 2+ years I've had the console.</p>
<p>Spotify and Sony have a deal so it won't be coming to Xbox One. </p>
<p>Overall I love the console. I use it everyday and Im extremely happy. I guess it boils down to what people use it for. I use it for gaming period. It does a great job of that.</p>

<p>..........</p>
<p>Hello "CHiLLiONS" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>I love my Xbox One &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>The only game that I play on my Xbox One is Destiny &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>Other than Destiny, my Xbox One is basically just a Blu Ray player. &nbsp;I play my Xbox 360 WAY WAY WAY more than my Xbox One.</p>
<p>The games that I'm playing right now on my Xbox 360 are Diablo 3 vanilla, Monster High: New Ghoul In School, and Hannah Montana: The Movie Game &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>I am very bored with my Xbox One at the moment &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>I can't wait for the new Destiny Expansion DLC &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>...........</p>
<p>With that being said, a lot of the titles on the Xbox One aren't that interesting for me &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 is my favorite game console of all time &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>The Original Xbox is in 2nd place &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>The Xbox One is in 3rd place &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>In all fairness, the Xbox 360 and Original Xbox have completed their " Life Cycles " while the Xbox One is only 2 years old.</p>
<p>The Xbox One still has 6 to 8 years in its " Life Cycle " so I can't say at this point of time that the Xbox One has disappointed me &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>I will wait until the " Life Cycle " of the Xbox One is complete before I decide on how successful the Xbox One has been in my book&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night "CHilLLiONS" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>.........</p>

<p>I love the XBox One for Games, But must agree, The Menus are bulky and cumbersome.</p>
<p>I like to play a variety of games, But it appears i can only have 4 on the main screen. Then i have to scroll down to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>The Achievements auto snaps to the side. They should come up full screen if you haven't asked for them to be snapped.</p>
<p>I don't use it for Music, as i like to play my games full screen, I only rarely use BBC iplayer, and Youtube.</p>
<p>And don't get me started about the store. It is the worst Store i have seen on any Gaming rig. Why can they not do like the Xbox.com Site, and have the prices on the main Pictures instead of me having to traverse icon after icon, just to see a games price.
 And why can i not select them in Price order, Then i can could see them in some sort of order, not the way Microsoft want me to see them.</p>
<p>The Xbox one for me is a Great Gaming Console. But lacks on the User Interface and Ease of Use side of things.
</p>
<p>I know they want to run Win 10 across the board, But a gaming console, should be a joy to use, with Ease and comfort. As of this moment, it isn't that.</p>

<br />
Also there used to be a program called, "Microsoft Plus! Digital Media Edition"<br />
(released in 2003 I think) that would install what they called "Plus! Dancers". <br />
If you have that software...maybe it would be worth a try to uninstall it.<br />
<br />
Also there was a free version called "Microsoft Plus! Dancer LE".<br />

<h2>            Handwriting recognition input doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Surface Book. The handwriting recognition and input works great in Word and Firefox, but when I try to input handwriting and have it converted to text in some other apps (e.g. Foxit PDF Reader), it doesn't work. I can bring up the handwriting
 input panel and my handwriting is recognised, but when I click on the word it just doesn't appear in the desired textbox. Is this n issue with the app or with Windows? Any ideas on how to fix this, or alternatively any suggestions for a good PDF reader that
 supports it? Cheers

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you meant by, "I can bring up the handwriting input panel and my handwriting is recognised, but when I click on the word it just doesn't appear in the desired textbox"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you have a surface book and that the handwriting recognition works in Word and Firefox and not in other apps. This being said, from when is the issue persisting? And is the issue specific to only Foxit PDF Reader or to other apps including
 Microsoft Office apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may try creating a new account and check if the issue persists in that account as well. To create a new account, please follow the below step.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. Type <strong>Settings </strong><span>on the search bar</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click on&nbsp;<strong>Accounts</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Family and Other users</strong>, in that click on&nbsp;<strong>Add someone else to PC</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. In there click on&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Account</strong>&nbsp;if you want to create an MS account or else click on&nbsp;<strong>Local Account</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. There give a
<strong>name to the account</strong> and provide password if you want.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if the issue is only specific to FOXIT READER, please redirect the query to them as they are capable to assist you further in this regard.</p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I have discovered the issue also occurs when I try to input text into the Search Windows textbox, and also in Drawboard PDF. What I mean is when I click on the text box I want to write in, then select the stylus
 input from the Touch Keyboard button (the one next to the clock in the bottom right corner of the screen) and write in the input box that appears, this text won't then appear in the selected text box. I've attached a screen shot to make it clearer - in this
 example, "hello" won't appear in the Search Windows text box. Do you have any ideas how to fix this? Cheers</p>

            Just an update - it seems to have fixed itself! Also, Drawboard PDF works really well with the stylus, I'd recommend that if someone's looking for a PDF viewer - it comes with Windows 10<br />

            Hi Jonathan
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there isn't a way for you to unlink a Skype account from a Microsoft Account because it is a connected service. 
<br />
<br />Since October 2016, Skype accounts are now linked to Microsoft Accounts just like other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive. Due to this change, it is no longer possible to delete your Skype account without also closing your Microsoft Account. 
<br />
<br />The best thing you can do is no longer sign into that account 
<br />
<br />Users have been asking for the option though, so, you should consider submitting feedback to the engineers so they can hopefully consider your suggestions for future implementation.
<br />
<br />Sorry this is not a solution to your particular problem.       
        </p>

            <p>Yes it is compatible, but not with the factory driver or driver that installs when plugged in. Go to HP support and install the "HP LaserJet XPS Driver Update"</p>
<p>We originally ran into this issue when switched from a CITRIX to Windows RDP protocal. We have 3 P1102W working now.</p>

</p><p>My Windows 10 settings doesn't have the "Turn off/on" button.&nbsp; Microsoft should create a quicker function to turn the Touchpad off and on, without having to go into settings.&nbsp; Because in my case, there is NO turn off/on button.&nbsp; In this case, what should
 I do?</p>

            Problem not solved.&nbsp; I can turn off the touchpad (without radio buttons); however, the touchpad is on when I go away and re-enter my computer (Windows 10).

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are several factors to consider for this kind of issue. First is the make and model of your computer, next is the build of your Windows 10. If you want to completely disable the touchpad function on your computer, we would suggest to uninstall
 it from the device manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here’s how:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press <strong>Windows Key + X </strong>and select <strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></span></li><li><span><span>Under <strong>Mice and other pointing devices</strong>, look for the driver for your Touchpad.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Right click on the driver and select<strong> Uninstall.</strong></span></span></li></ol>

<p>I am never amazed at the idiocy of the intellectuals.&nbsp; Instead of making the problem bearable, they make the whole task more unbearable.&nbsp; So, Venancio, you want us to "uninstall" the software, only to reinstall it later.... You're a real F--ing GENIOUS!!&nbsp;
 Why didn't we think of that??&nbsp; Really dude!!!&nbsp; Forgive my SARCASM... but you really blew it out the window.&nbsp; We're looking for solutions, not things that are going to make things worse, or our work more difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft just needs to send an update that will allow us to disable the software with a click of the button -- without having to uninstall the whole thing!!</p>

<p>Why is this issue still not resolved?</p>
<p>I am still searching for a way to disable the TouchPad while typing, like I used to be able to do automatically. Why am I having to navigate to 3rd (and 4th) party sites to get questionable answers about tapping into my operating system files to modify configuration
 files and such? Microsoft, why is this option not available? There is no reason it should have been removed as it DRASTICALLY reduces functionality and is extremely irritating while typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the very least, if you cannot introduce the 'feature' to disable the TouchPad, at least provide a reliable solution to TEMPORARILY DISABLE THE TOUCHPAD WHILE TYPING. I cannot use the 'suggested' options the disable the TouchPad as there is option available,
 and disabling/uninstalling the Driver is not remotely acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the caps. They were necessary.</p>

<p>Searching the internet for this, it was clearly possible in Windows 10 at one point.&nbsp; You can see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223404/how-to-stop-accidental-trackpad-clicks-in-windows-10-and-other-mouse-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshots
 of how it used to work in this link</a>.&nbsp; However the setting used to be under a heading called "Mouse &amp; Trackpad".&nbsp; In my version of Windows 10, "Mouse" and "Trackpad" settings are separate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the developer forget to include this setting when separating "Mouse &amp; Trackpad" into "Mouse", "Trackpad"???&nbsp; This smells like a
<strong>defect</strong> to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<em>Asking us to disable the trackpad totally misses the point.&nbsp; Asking us what computer model we have misses the point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>You should escalate this.&nbsp; It's probably super simple to fix.&nbsp; I'm trying to use a Windows 10 PC after switching to Mac 6 years
 ago.&nbsp; This is the sort of thing that makes the Mac feel so much better.&nbsp; BTW, I'm using a Surface 3 w/ the cover/keyboard.</em><br />
</p>
<p>Why is this so important: because when I'm typing, and my hand brushes against the trackpad, text can get selected and when I continue typing, it gets deleted.&nbsp; There's a reason it was there in the first place.&nbsp; There's a reason you get a ton of hits when
 you search for it.</p>

<p>I opened my own thread regarding this issue and received a number of helpful (albeit ineffective) responses centering around 3rd-party software and driver updates. Still missed the mark of why it isn't a generic option within Windows 10. I've googled the
 subject extensively and while there Are ways to fix it, they involve either 'hacky' methods of delving into operating system and configuration files or some 3rd-party software (developed exclusively for this purpose, no less).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are solutions, and many makes and models have their own configuration, but it still makes no sense why there is no basic Setting to pause the touchpad while typing in Windows 10.</p>

<p>I played around with it a little more and for my Surface, it's actually related to the Touchpad &gt; Taps &gt; Sensitivity setting.&nbsp; If I adjust it to be less sensitive, I can see a noticeable delay in when the touchpad is active or not after typing.&nbsp; &nbsp;It could
 be different PC to PC, since some PCs have "precision trackpads."&nbsp; So YMMV.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Sensitivity," seems to be the wrong word to describe the setting to me...&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2>            How to delete autocorrect&#47;suggestion  cache</h2>
                    <p>I have been using my Windows 8 tablet for school last year, and last year I was in Biology, and now I am not in biology but it still recommends suggestions from my last year class. For example, if I type "The" in the mail app using the touch screen keyboard,
 the next word that it suggests is diploid. This is really annoying since I am not in biology and I am not interested in biology. Where is the cache for the suggestions stored and if its safe to delete.&nbsp;(looked for 30 minutes in the C:/Windows folder and couldn't
 find anything)</p>

            <p>First off, even if I do that, it still suggests me what to type if I am using the on screen keyboard, second, I still do want autocorrect on, please read my post, it is word suggestions it isn't auto correct. I am trying to clear the cache so it didn't suggest
 words from last year. This is really starting to annoy me. I start typing an email, 2 seconds later it suggests something very disgusting.

            <p>Hi Kirill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You had created this thread under Windows 8 and that is the reason why I gave the steps for Windows 8 to access the "<strong><em>Autocorrect misspelled words</em></strong>" settings. However now, I have moved it to Windows 8.1. You may follow these steps
 for Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press “Windows Logo” + “C” keys on the keyboard to display the Charms bar.</p>
<p>b) Click on “<strong><em>Settings</em></strong>”, “<strong><em>Change PC Settings</em></strong>” and then “<strong><em>PC and devices</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>c) Click on “<strong><em>Typing</em></strong>”</p>
<p>d) Under “<strong><em>Spelling</em></strong>”, turn off the options: “<strong><em>Autocorrect misspelled words</em></strong>”.
</p>
<p><span>e) Restart the computer and then navigate to the same settings as above,&nbsp;re-enable the same option and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please let us&nbsp;know the result.</span></p>

            I followed the steps, (disabled autocorrect and text suggestions, restarted, re-enabled autocorrect misspelled words and "show suggestions as you type") but it is still showing those text suggestions.

<h2>            Communication with the Xbox Live servers has been interrupted</h2>
                    
<p>SSDD in the life of a CoD AW player.</p>
<p>One new aspect of it is the brief appearance of the dialog asking if I want to download Atlas Gorge before the error message appears. The truly interesting part of that is I've downloaded and played the Atlas Gorge content already.</p>
<p>Before a mod asks, I've done all the nonsensical crap the typical mod response suggests, and my NATs are OPEN:OPEN (that's Xbox:Game).</p>
<p>It's such a brilliant use of time to sit and repeatedly try to connect to a multi-player game for a couple of hours before being able to connect. The error referenced in the subject line of this post, and the error stating "The Call of Duty:Advanced Warfare
 service is not available at this time. Please try again later." are starting to burn in on my television screen.</p>

            <p>Hey there Wizard231!</p>
<p>I'm sincerely sorry to hear about the Xbox Live issue! What is the make and model of your router as well as your modem? Also could you list any troubleshooting steps you have tried so far? That information will help us out a lot!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post back with the information and we will do our best to help get this sorted! :)</p>

<p>You have no need to know the specific make and model of anyone's router and modem. Let's just say it's a fairly common hardware configuration. If there are makes and models of specific routers and modems for which known issues exist, why not save everybody
 a lot of time and post those issues? </p>
<p>Simple fact is that 99.9% of Xbox Live issues have nothing to do with the consumer endpoint. Most likely, it's poorly written code that doesn't allow for graceful termination of previous connections.</p>

            <p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Unfortunately each situation can seem similar, but the difference can be in the the details (model numbers, hardware type, etc). Having specific detailed information like that actually helps us solve most of the network issues reported on our forums.</p>
<p>We do have a separate forum for known network issues for many home network devices. Check out our&nbsp;Networking Hardware Information&nbsp;forum and see if your device is listed, but in order for us to continue troubleshooting we will need your hardware information. Please let us know when you are able to provide your hardware information so we can look into this issue further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p>

<p>I have an AT&amp;T U-verse router with no modem. I connected my xbox one to the Ethernet cable so I wouldn't have any internet problems with the Advanced Warfare game. Now i can't get online and receive this "Communication with the Xbox Live servers has been

            <p>Hi Devashish, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you&nbsp; upgrading for your previous OS or performing Clean Install?</li><li>Do you get the same error when you Clean install?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the error and the troubleshooting steps that you have performed, I suggest that you create a backup of your personal files and perform a Clean Install via the Windows ISO image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To download the&nbsp;ISO, click on the link below</p>

            <p>Hi Devashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your query, I would like to inform that during the process of Clean Installation, when the process fails there are two scenario's that you will incur.</p>
<p>1. If&nbsp;the process fails, you will get an option to return back to the old operating system. The system will indicate where the process failed and that&nbsp;it will roll back.</p>
<p>2. The other is when, you computer will be stuck and frozen while the upgrade. Here you will lose the ability to&nbsp;perform any&nbsp;task. If such is the case, you might lose files and folders which are essential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However,&nbsp;when you perform Clean Install of the OS and it succeeds, it will erase all you personal files and folders that have been saved in the PC.&nbsp;Hence creating a backup for the same is an essential part of the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get that under both scenarios (1 and 2) above I am going to loose personal data that is not backed up.</p>
<p>But your second scenario is a scary one. I think the only option left would be then to go to a Dell Store to get the laptop restored and working correctly. That would obviously cost me something. And right now it seems that both scenarios have a 50% probability.
 I surely don't want to endure all that headache of having to deal with a frozen laptop.</p>
<p>After your reply, I am not sure whether I should proceed with the clean install or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only the engineers could find the exact reason for that error, things would have been perhaps, easier. Microsoft took the efforts to give the error a unique code, but didn't provide a reason or solution for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess, the only option through which I can get Windows 10 is to buy a new computer.</p>

                    We have never faxed anyone nor did we know we could fax with our Inspiron 5315,&nbsp;so I deleted the fax portion of this computer. The fax icon began showing up with startup although not initially when we purchased this computer a couple years ago. Now we
 see an error message upon start up :&nbsp; Error&nbsp; IM32FAX.DIL.&nbsp;Should we reinstall the fax capabilities and if so, how? Does it make any difference in this computer and can we stop the error message from showing up on startup if it doesn't make any difference that
 this capability has been deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />
