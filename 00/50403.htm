    <title>Network adapters show up in device manager but not network connections - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benxas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network adapters show up in device manager but not network connections</h2>
                    <p>So I have this issue and I've trawled all the forums and it seems others have had this problem but none of the suggested solutions work for me. Most of them are related to windows 7 however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, I have 3 network adapters which are all listed in device manager and say they're working, but they don't show up in connections manager and so I can't set IP's or anything and therefore can't access my local network or the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One in the embedded gigabit nic in the motherboard, one is a pci gigabit nic and the third is a USB2.0 nic, to ensure it wasn't any one of them that didn't work. I've tried uninstalling and re-installing latest drivers for all three but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried adding and removing various reg keys suggested on this forum and others. I've tried resetting winsock. I even removed or disabled all of them physically, restarted and then added them manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest anything else I can try (I'd rather not reset windows or rebuild from my last backup if I can help it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running windows 10 pro which was upgraded from windows 8.1. It was all working fine for ages and then one day I noticed that I didn't have internet connection. DNS lookup was failing. I checked the network connections property page for my NIC and I didn't
 recognise the DNS settings, so I wiped them and went back to DHCP (I normally have static IP set). This then never identified the network or got an IP. All other devices on the network are working fine and I checked the router still had IP addresses available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I disabled and re-enabled the NIC. Nothing. Then I uninstalled it from device manager and it disappeared from network connections. Not a problem. When I then rebooted and re-installed, device manager said it was fine but it didn't appear in network
 connections and now I can't get any of them to appear in network connections. It's like something is stopping the service from rebuilding the list of network adapters and presenting their properties to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the swift reply. All my connections are wired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I probably wasn't explicit enough about the 3 NICs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first is an Intel 82579V integrated on an Asus P8Z68V-Pro motherboard</p>
<p>The second (which I added to see if it would work) is a Realtek PCI GBE controller</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver details for the Intel network adapter are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>e1i63x64.sys</p>
<p>Intel Corporation</p>
<p>12.12.50.6</p>
<p>20/03/2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to update these with the latest ones I downloaded, it goes half way through installation and then states that it cant find any network adapters of that type (even though it's displayed in device manager). I also found the property under advanced
 you mentioned above 'receive side scaling' and tried disabling and restarting, but this didn't help so I've returned it to 'enabled'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver details for the Realtek network adapter are as follows, I haven't tried to find the latest drivers for this card as i just wanted to see if it would work so they're the drivers the OS has as default:</p>
<p>
</p><p>rt640x64.sys</p>
<p>Realtek</p>
<p>01/04/2015</p>
<p>9.1.401.2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've included some screenshots showing how they show up in device manager but not network connections.</p>

            <p>As an update, I just tried to update the realtek 8169 drivers to the latest windows 10 ones from their website and it just sits there for ages saying 'installing driver' and then eventually throws an error stating 'The realtek network controller was not
 found. If deep sleep mode is enabled, please plug the cable'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updated driver described in device manager is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Realtek</p>
<p>23/07/2015</p>
<p>10.3.723.2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the computer with the new driver but same problem. Nothing shows up in network connections. so that hasn't helped.</p>

</p><p>So no idea why I didn't think of this before. SYSTEM RESTORE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did a system restore to a few weeks ago and now everything is working fine. It would be nice to understand what the underlying bug in windows 10 is that causes this, but at least I have a working internet connection again. I will report the bug through the
 windows 10 feedback system.</p>
<p>

            <p>Doing a restore now. I did about the same process beginning to end lol. Maddening! Fingers crossed... and in case it has a hand in causing the issue, I have an Intel ethernet adapter and motherboard. Also this as well as many other problems (mostly driver)
 happened after the new window 10 dev update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok clicking restart button now that restore has finished..... got a bsod. now system keeps on and off over and over... my luck.</p>

<h3> chris dey  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10 Pro upgrade from W7 Ultimate x64 with GA-P55A-UD3 &#40;r.2&#41; motherboard. Is there a work around&#63;</h2>
                    I have a PC that meets or exceeds Windows prerequisites for an OS upgrade from W7 Ultimate SP1 x64 to Windows 10 Pro with the exception of the mo/bo chipset. After 90 days of working with level 2 support I am told the chip-set on my Gigabyte GA-P55A-UD3
 (r.2) motherboard will not/ can not be upgraded or worked around to allow the W10 install. Several techs seemed to think W10 should work anyway. Actually in installs normally but fails after I choose the language (US) I would like to operate the keyboard in.
 I am then given many options to workaround, clean install etc. All have been tried. iso boot, no usb, expand C drive memory. I have already performed a couple clean installs of 7 again but the upgrade fails after choosing the keyboard language. Its clear a
 new mo/bo would solve my problem and they are reasonable in price. Its the new processor and memory and cooling fan (probably) that have me asking if anyone is aware of a work around. My Lynnfield processor, Corsair 16 mb DDR3 RAM, all hardware is gaming speed
 but I don't game or overclock.&nbsp; Any ideas or do I need to gut it and start over just to get W10? Thank you for your thoughts.

            Hello Stuart.<br />
I appreciate your effort in assisting me however after trying both the DVD ISO and usb iso installation using the tools recommended and as instructed I manage to get no farther in the set up as choosing the language.&nbsp; Its frustrating to say the least. It "feels"
 like it wants to install. I just don't have the intuition to find the problem. I tried your instructions several times. again, my thanks for your time.<br />
<br />
Kindest regards,<br />

            <p>Hello, yes, that made a difference and probably pointed out my issues. I do use SATA ports 6 and 7 simultaneously to run Windows 7 O/S&nbsp; on 2-Crucial SSD C300 128 g drives using the Marvell 9128 in a RAID 0 format for several years now. Really helped my start
 up time. I run 2 Western Digital 1 tb Black platter drives from the blue SATA connectors and subsequently the Intel P-55 also in RAID 0. These hold most of my data. I back up the entire system externally to a RAID 10 WD 1 tb x 4 drives via a USB 3.0 cable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course the back up and any usb is disconnected during W10 update. I assume you run a single platter drive off the Intel P-55.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When working with Level 2 tech support from Windows on and off for 3 months they had me reformat my drives and re update my drives. Said the configurations were fine as long as usb was unplugged. When removed the SATA cables from the white to to blue and
 used the ISO discs you recommended the installation moved along quickly and further but even after code key activation it would not allow me to proceed because I was not installing W10 exactly as it was installed initially it insisted I reinstall W7 from the
 new SATA ports and THEN install W10 since it is considered an upgrade. As it is Pro I would really like to own it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I went about reinstalling W7 from the new SATA ports 0 and 1 W7 detected the old installation. I attempted to reformat the drives and successfully recreated the RAID 0 in the BIOS but W7 still detected the old installation even though I formatted from
 the installation disc. This is a lot of work now. My only option would seem to be re-installation Windows 7 on a single or dual WD 1 tb black platter from the blue connectors 0-5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I am this far along the P-55 runs RAID 0-10. While I prefer the back up to be exterior I could run everything from inside. I have 2-optical disc drives, could run them from the the white SATA 6 and 7 ? Gigabyte suggests I buy a new board which puts
 me back to new hardware for a PC that is plenty fast and more than enough power at 850 watts.&nbsp; Is there a simple way out of this? Thank you for your time. Its a lot for an OS upgrade but if it allows me to keep my good hardware. Thank you and feel free to
 contact me directly if it saves you time. </p>

            <p>More than likely Windows 10 does not detect or have a built in device drivers which is why&nbsp;you can't upgrade. The simple solution is to drop down to a non-raid configuration (Initialized but empty drive)&nbsp;to get the upgrade using a single 0 - 5 port. Disconnect
 all other drivers before you upgrade. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try this by making your own installation DVD (no product key needed to complete, just don't connect to the Internet and choose activate later).</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;you complete the Windows 10 install connect to the Internet and run Windows Update. Reboot the computer, run Windows Update&nbsp; second time to insure all the updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next shut down and connect a pair of formatted but empty drives to the White RAID ports, reboot and run Windows 10's "Windows update" again and see if Windows Update installs the Marvel chipset diver. A reboot is required to complete most driver updates.</p>

</p><p><strong>In the mean time I'm going to check my P55 computer and see if the RAID drivers are active. This may take a day or two as the system need to be re-configured. If you want to wait reply back with a Yes I'll wait or No thanks.</strong></p>

            <p>Well I managed to get Windows 10 using a single disk drive connect to one of the White Marvel SATA ports after 2 tries. Even the second try failed to properly configure the normal partition arrangement but it installed, downloaded all drivers available but
 when opening 'Device Manager' it shows that there is no "Marvel 91xx config ATA Device"&nbsp;driver available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent drivers on Gigabyte's web site are for Windows 7.&nbsp; Take note that the User's manual does mention Intel RAID but to do that you need to press F6 when installing Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a reported driver for Windows 10 here: <a href="http://www.driverscape.com/manufacturers/gigabyte/laptops-desktops/p55a-ud3/2226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Used a&nbsp; stand alone 160 WD&nbsp;external drive from the E-SATA port on the front of my case for clean 7 install, W10 update on top of that. &nbsp;A pair of 1 tb in Raid 0 ON&nbsp;SATA 3 &amp; 5 for b/u.&nbsp;The SSD's are on ports 0 &amp; 1 as individuals. Will RAID easily in BIOS.&nbsp;Gigabyte
 says w/everything on P55 W10 will migrate to anything else on P55 in CMOS. Rules prevent them from instructing me how, just mind the RAID's they say and back up. I'm just a novice but.....&nbsp; MSN said they will tell me how for $149.00, no 1 time charge. I'm
 hitting the books. Thank you for your time. New board etc. next year if I cant get these to SSD and over to SATA&nbsp;6 &amp; 7.

    <title>Xbox Wireless Gaming Receiver not showing up in device manager - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Wireless Gaming Receiver not showing up in device manager</h2>
                    <p>I ordered an&nbsp;"Official Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver"&nbsp;and it arrived today. I want to use it to hook up my Guitar Hero controller to my PC.&nbsp;I am running on Windows 10.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>To begin with, after plugging in the&nbsp;receiver&nbsp;to a USB&nbsp;port (for the very first time), it would show in the Device Manager under "Other devices" as "Unknown Device", which was normal because all I had to do was download the driver that it needed. I did this and reached to the point of nearly finishing the process&nbsp;until it told me that the driver could not start.</p>

<p>Following this I&nbsp;attempted&nbsp;to uninstall the receiver device under "Other devices" in hope that it would just remove any drivers that it had installed on it so I could just plug the receiver back in and start again. However, since I did this, there is literally no sign of the device anywhere in the manager. I've looked around for people who have had the same issue but I couldn't find much or anything that could help me. I have tried restarting my computer, updating windows, scanning&nbsp;for any hardware changes and replugging the receiver into all of the USB&nbsp;ports&nbsp;on my PC&nbsp;multiple times&nbsp;but it still never recognised it, not even as the unknown device. I have several other laptops and desktops around the house with different versions of Windows but none of them could recognise the device either, not showing a trace of a wireless receiver in the device manager.</p>

<p>It has been bugging me a lot because I've been wanting to use one of these for a long time now.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Any help and&nbsp;any explanation on what I've done wrong will be greatly appreciated,</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi xiTzPrOxSniiPex! <br /><br />If the receiver isn't being recognized on any Windows 10 device you test with it, that would indicate a hardware issue with the receiver itself - in this case, we'd recommend looking into options for replacing it. <br /><br />If you purchased that from a third party retail store, returning to that store to inquire about an exchange may be quickest, but that would depend on that retailer's policy. Alternately, you can also look into <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/warranty-and-service/getting-your-product-serviced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">processing a service request</a> through us as well. </p>

            <p>Homegroups and Workgroups are completely different systems that aren't compatible with each other. All computers in your LAN should be connected to the same private network which assigns all of&nbsp;their IPs within the same address&nbsp;range.&nbsp; If you have been using&nbsp;the
 homegroup system and&nbsp;your homegroup disappears over the Wifi connection then it could&nbsp; be due to an addressing problem or to network restrictions on the WiFi connected computer itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using two routers there could be a number of problematic scenarios that you've inadvertently created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each router&nbsp;is capable of creating a different local network. These networks would be independently able to access the internet while computers attached to either router&nbsp;might not&nbsp;be able to connect with each other.&nbsp;Only one router&nbsp;should have routing and
 DNS addressing enabled to ensure that whichever hardware&nbsp;connection is being used, all of&nbsp;your computers are always&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;the same local network. The second router/repeater should be configured as nothing more than a switch which passes routing/DNS&nbsp;info
 through from the first router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows automatic networking configuration tends to&nbsp;default WiFi&nbsp;or secondary network connections in general&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;use Public rather than Private network settings. Allowing that setting will prevent the computer in question from accessing your&nbsp;network shares
 whenever you use the WiFi. Similarly if both routers have WiFi active they will be treated as different networks&nbsp;even if you use the same password on both. &nbsp;Ensure that your WiFi connection in the computer is set&nbsp;as a&nbsp;"Private" or home network and that it
 is receiving an IP address&nbsp;in the same range as it normally would via the Ethernet connection.</p>

            <p>Thanks for that. I wont be able to get back onto this till the weekend. </p>
<p>But i did speak to a network admin at work and he also mentioned that i perhaps had to setup some settings on the Billion .&nbsp; Unfortunately ,&nbsp; i haven't found any specific instructions on what this entails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i may have to do some reading but the manual does not describe the purpose of the Billion settings just what they are called.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll go through your comments and see if i can get further. I'm not sure how the Comcast works, whether it considers itself a router or just a repeater.&nbsp; The 4 inch Chinese to English manual that came with it is fairly useless.</p>

            I can't find any instructions or a guide to turn the Comcast repeater onto bridge mode. As only the Billion is on all the time it must be the one in charge of the lan. Only the Comcast can therefore be bridged. But how to do that.&nbsp; All instructions I've
 found are specific to other routers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I'm not sure of the principals involved I don't know how to translate this to the Comcast.&nbsp; Any one know a good article that could educate me.

            <p>Thanks for that.&nbsp; I have tried the forum&nbsp; before but found no similar posts.&nbsp; As i'm not an xfinity customer I cannot post.&nbsp; However, it appears that the comfast repeater cannot be set up in bridge mode.&nbsp; So its creating a second LAN which is in conflict
 with my existing LAN.</p>
<p>The Comfast repeaters appear to be only suitable to extending internet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already given up using a second&nbsp; Billion router to extend my wifi range and will take a look at Internet over power supply.
</p>

<h2>            Lexmark X4650 not printing, recent install of Windows 10</h2>
                    My Lexmark X4650 has stopped printing, I have recently installed Windows 10, it doesn't give an error message, just seems to freeze at about 50% 0n the printing status box on the pc, the printer does not acknowledge it has received anything and then it
 goes into the print queue which I then delete, does anyone have the same problem?

here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Firewall troubleshooter can automatically repair Windows Firewall problems especially when Windows Firewall doesn't/won't start.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update us with the result so we could further assist you.</p>

</p><p>In this case, we suggest that you perform a clean boot. It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs that can eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>

<h2>            Unable to reply to posts.</h2>
                    
<p>For the last 2 days I have not been able to reply to any posts in any threads, not even ones I have created. The problem is that the last post in every thread I read does not have a reply button. Every other post in the thread has a reply button but when
 I click on them they simply disappear from the screen and nothing happens.</p>
<p>As you can see I can still create threads though so it seems to be a weird problem. I have tried clearing my cookies but it has made no difference. I am all out of ideas on how to fix it from my end so hopefully this can be passed on to forum building team
 to look at.</p>
<p>Just remember you wont be getting a reply from me in this thread but I will be reading any replies.</p>

<p>I've been having issues with even trying to log into the website :/ I'm currently using a different PC in the house just so I can be here but I shouldn't have to do that. Rather frustrating. In FF I keep getting a 400 error and in IE it just gives me a message
 saying site is currently unavalible.</p>

<p>WOW you wont believe the amount of stuffing around I had to do to get back onto these forums!! dunno why I bothered really lol. Anyways I switched to firefox but that would not even bring me to the forums. Only after disabling 3rd party cookies has it let
 me get to xbox.com, sign in and post.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, IE9 still has the no reply button problem for me. Looks like the site does not recognise FF paragraphs though.</p>

<h2>            Bricked my boot record trying to clone to ssd need help.</h2>
                    I recently bought a ssd to install in my laptop I removed the disk drive and got both a hdd caddy for the disk drive slot and a usb enclosure that lets me still use the disk drive when needed. I then removed the original HDD then installed it in the caddy
 also installed the ssd into the laptops drive slot. Booted the system and started the cloning procedure. I shut down the PC and removed the old drive restarted and it wouldn't boot I went into the bios and changed the boot order (noticed only my one drive
 was listed as a boot option. Rebooted it went into repair mode I tried to refresh but my recovery partition is encrypted with bitlocker (did it testing BitLocker out and never turned it off) and the key that I have saved to my microsoft account isn't unlocking
 it. So I am locked out of my recovery I go into command prompt and enter something I found online it says it saved the changes but then when I restart the computer I can't get the recovery options to come up any more and with either drive connected it just
 is a black screen with a blinking cursor. This is an upgrade version of Windows 8 and I don't have the recovery disk I do have a full Windows 8 disk I know I recently tried to use the disk to enter one of my upgrade product keys and it would reject them do
 you think that I can use the full version's disk in order to repair the upgrade version or will I need an upgrade disk (I should have some that I made from iso's but I can't find them and I can't locate the iso files which you would think would be important
 to save. If I have to reinstall the upgrade version I will have to first reinstall Windows 7 home premium which I have the COA for then install Windows 8 again (dirctly on the SSD no more cloning for me.<br />

            <p>Hi <span>Derek Smith,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Which cloning software did you use?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suspect that the cloning was not successful. You can try contacting the cloning software team to see how they can help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, you can try booting the computer using the old hard drive and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, you have to have a Windows 8.1 installation/recovery media to perform Repair operation form Recovery Environment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>

            Ok I have tried using the recovery media but the bit locker encryption is locking me out and I can't find where I saved the bit locker key. I have decided to reinstall but I can't install Windows because the partition is GPT I have connected the drive
 to a hdd doc that I have and am attempting to use diskpart to change the drive to mbr but that isn't working either getting a error message about the disk not being convertible then says dvd's and cdrom aren't convertible so I am unsure if the computer is
 seeing this as a optical drive I have tried it on both disk and it won't work I&nbsp; don't know what the problem is I do know that I will probably need to go get a new drive in order to get this to work which isn't making me happy since I already have two drives
 that I can't use. I wish I knew where I put that bitlocker key I could have sworn that I saved it to my sky drive I have a document called product keys where I usually store all of my keys.

            <p>no it is claiming my ssd and another hard drive can't be converted then it says optical drives can't be converted if I can't ever change this ssd back to a mbr how will I ever be able to use it it is only 64gb so besides as a system drive what good would
 it be. It is a transcend disk and it comes with a link to their cloning software. I am downloading W7 Home Premium as we speak going to install using coa for the machine then I'm going to reinstall Windows 8 Pro upgrade. I have class at 9 tomorrow want to
 install 7 tonight at least. Bit Locker is causing the real issue I had the key stored on my Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials install but I reinstalled that last week because I added a ssd to it.

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're probably well on your way to Win 7 by now....</p>
<p>How everything is giving a GPT issue I don't know... that doesn't even apply to an optical drive...</p>
<p>That is a SSD \HDD drive format...</p>
<p>There are circumstances where Win 8 actually REQUIRES a GPT drive type... this is usually only when used with a UEFI BIOS setup though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have Win 7 on your machine, your Full Win 8 disk should work with the upgrade key, but I've never actually tried that... It might work better if you do the upgrade while Win 7 is running, but you could try at boot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download a Win 8 ISO and\or a bootable Flash with your upgrade key if needed, but I still think your DVD should work...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You normally don't run into that kind of problem when Cloning... It may be that you booted with both drives attached, and TWO Windows Installations... You probably should have removed the original HDD before rebooting....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do this again, you might consider an Imaging program on a bootable CD instead... that is my method... I use Acronis TrueImage which comes on a CD that you can install, or boot with....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create an image from the original drive to a external drive of some type...</p>
<p>Switch the drives, and then Restore the Image to the new one...</p>
<p>An extra step, but more reliable... plus... you still have the image to do over again if there is a problem later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are free programs that will do the imaging, but I am reluctant to suggest something I haven't tried...</p>

            <p>Thanks for the link the dvd I had used wasn't working saying it was missing drivers I made it while I upgraded in November 2012. I do have a full version but had trouble with it not working with an upgrade key in the past. My computer supports uefi but it
 always loads in BIOS mode I don't know why I just tried to look in the boot menu for a uefi option but didn't see one there. Hopefully I can install it like that from what I am downloading. If not don't know what I'll do with this ssd (build a system to put
 it in (people around here would kill me currently have 14 pc's)). I think I will use Arconis I have heard nothing but good things about it and people on the WeGotServed site recommended only using bootable disk software instead of online tools but I didn't
 listen so I'm learning the hard way. </p>
<p><strong>Edit: Everything went fine I went into the boot menu before hand and my flash drive was listed as uefi It installed on my SSD without any issues I now have a dual boot system but I may just format the Windows 7 partition since technically I was supposed
 to install over it</strong> <strong>plus I have to other dual boot Windows 7 and 8 and I don't think I have used the Windows 7 partition more than a handful of times. It does make it much easier to do clean installs of Windows 8 upgrade version (It took me
 all day to reinstall 7 complete all the updates and then upgrade to 8 which is still updating and I haven't even gotten to installing 8.1 yet.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't sure if you would be able to use UEFI or not... there is a BIOS setting to select UEFI or Legacy, and sometimes a combination of both... But I haven't messed with it much...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to mention using Win 8 on a Flash drive, as it is my understanding that is the only way to get the UEFI install to work properly... I built my machine as well, and at the time didn't know much about UEFI...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just assembled the parts and ran the Win 7 Pro DVD... I later upgraded to Win 8&nbsp;and&nbsp;8.1...</p>
<p>It wasn't until sometime later that it even occurred to me that the UEFI wasn't giving it's full benefit...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the machine boots so fast with a SSD anyway, I never bothered with reinstalling...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Acronis to make an Image of all of the OS's you install... you can reload them at anytime in about 15 minutes... Mine sure come in handy... They enable me to play around with software stuff and not have to worry about something crashing my machine...
 If it crashes, it's as good as new in 15 minutes or less...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad you were able to get everything sorted out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... the new Acronis 2014 Premium, and maybe the standard as well, can be burned to a bootable flash.</p>
<p>Way faster. The only problem is that you have to install it to make the Flash drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed it on a drive I was going to delete anyway, so I don't have to deal with it running in windows all of the time.</p>

            does Arconis make images of data drives too. Also how much room do the images take up on a hhd. I have Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials install that backs up all of my clients and the server I just haven't gotten back to adding all my clients yet so thats
 why I ran into problems was curious about the space since you can never have to much redundancy for your data.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acronis will image data drives... it will do the incremental as well....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only use mine on a bootable CD, or more recently, a bootable USB Flash....</p>
<p>I only use it for my OS partitions, but it will do the entire drive if you want...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all of my Documents, Downloads, Videos, Pictures, and etc. stored on a a different drive than my OS.</p>
<p>Windows is on a SSD now, but I have always done that. Somewhere along the line I got tired of losing my data, downloads, etc., everytime I had to reinstall windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as file size, that depends on the files... Acronis compresses the image, and some file types are more compressible... My 128GB SSD is half full, but 20GB of that is Page File and Hibernate File.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can make an image of the C:\ partition in 20GB... I have a lot of stuff installed....</p>
<p>When Win 8 was a fresh install, it took up 4GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how Acronis acts with Clients and Servers though... I have never tried any of that.</p>

            Actually you can't use it on a server unless you pay $500 to get the server version. My server actually makes back ups of all my computers twice a day but I have yet had the opportunity/misfortune to use it and when I needed it the other day I hadn't joined
 that PC to my domain yet so no backup to use.&nbsp; Thanx&nbsp; again for helping out.<br />

<h2>            DeScribe Word Processor. Version 5.0.5. July 1, 1996</h2>
                    <p>I have used this program for years under WIN-NT, WIN-XP sp3, without any problem. Now, under WIN 8.1 and 10,, it has become unstable and freezes the computer after about 10 minutes. I've tried the WIN compatibility program with partial success. I think it
 may be an IO problem: saving and opening files. </p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I just got done putting my machine together and am trying to install Windows 7 from a disk but I'm getting the following error right after I select the language, etc. :</p>
<p>D:\Sources\unbcl.dll&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't even get past 0%. &nbsp;This is the first PC I have built so I can't figure out if that error would be a hardware or a software issue. &nbsp;The disk I am booting off of is a little scratched but it seems to be working fine up until that point.</p>
<p>The hard drive which I am trying to install onto is being found during the install, so I don't think it would be hardware issue, but I'm unsure.</p>
<p>Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>Connecting two accounts in OneDrive on the same computer is not yet available as this could put the accounts in question at risk. However, you can refer to the post of Chris Hillman from this

    <title>How do I get rid of a failed Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> froglips  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get rid of a failed Windows update</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung ATIV 500t which I have upgraded to Windows 8.1 solely to be able to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade went well with one exception.&nbsp; I was required to load all Windows Updates before I was "invited" to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; One of those updates was the Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework driver (and several other sub drivers that appear
 to have loaded with it.)&nbsp; This driver is showing not loading properly in Device manager.&nbsp; I went into Update History and it shows it installed but if I try to find a method to uninstall it there is none.&nbsp; Although Intel indicates that this driver does support
 the Atom processor, something tells me that Samsung doesn't.&nbsp; How do I get this driver off of my computer or where can I find the version compatible with Windows 8.1 x32.&nbsp; I have version 7.1.0.2.0 partially (dysfunctionally) installed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have this problem as well with an Atom processor.&nbsp; The update is not listed in the 'uninstall an update' list.&nbsp; 3 times I have had to uninstall this driver - makes me a bit wary about Windows 10 update because you don't get&nbsp;to choose.</p>
<p>Go to device manager,&nbsp;right click&nbsp;the Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework driver, leave the participant drivers for the moment.&nbsp; Select uninstall.&nbsp; the trick here is to check the 'uninstall software' box in the next window (the participant drivers
 do not have software attached).&nbsp; Next click the&nbsp;'Action' button on menu bar then 'Scan for hardware changes'.&nbsp; Do the Display Participant driver next then the rest of the Participant drivers.</p>
<p>The trouble with this way is&nbsp;Windows Update keeps listing the update even when the update is hidden.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 5 black screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface pro 5 I had an issue that resorted to me having to restore a previous version of Windows 10. Whilst doing this my PC crashed, I turned it off and back on again and now it loads up and I just get the cursor on a black screen.&nbsp;I can move the
 cursor, pressing windows+P will give me monitor options but that's it so the issue is obviously software related. I have tried several different solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting the PC</p>
<p>two-button reset</p>
<p>Unplugging any external hardware and doing both of the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support told me to create a USB back-up drive (the instructions were: look on Google for how to create a back-up drive :/). But I can't create a back-up drive as I can't use the screen to get anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to get to the UEFI screen but don't know what to do from there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pulling my hair out here. Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            How to use mono audio in Movie Maker&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have several movies I want to edit using Movie Maker. Just some simple editing. But thing is the original movies have a ~90kbps 11kHz 1 channel mono audio. So whenever I edit a movie I end up with distorted audio and a much bigger file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to create a profile that allows this kind of audio format? At least mono? I looked into the wlvs files that contains the profiles but I didn't find much...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Startup BSoD, with the message &#34;This application has failed to start because CSRSRV.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem&#34;</h2>
                    <p><u>Original Title : Why can't I change the Administrator's password through BIOS?</u><br />
<br />
I have a Dell Inspiron 1520 which is having the Blue screen everytime I try to start it up, it also says "<em>This application has failed to start because CSRSRV.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix tis problem".</em></p>
<p>I have tried to restore it to it's factory settings using directions i found on this website and have been successful up to the point where I need to choose between repairing&nbsp;1: C or&nbsp;2: F then enter the Administrator's password. I have tried what I thought
 was my password and everthing else it would have been but still it says that password is invalid. I then researched how to change that password through BIOS, I am able to open up the BIOS settings and am(seemingly) able to change it, but then everytime I get
 back to that same place in the repair/restore the password is again invalid.</p>
<p>What can I do? How can I get around this?</p>

            You can follow the idea cited in your manual from forum contributor Daavee (that is where I got my other information too) or you can see if you can fix what you have.<br />
<br />
Since the csrsrv.dll file is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection cares about (and should never be missing), there should be a backup copy on your system here:<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32\dllcache</b><br />
<br />
or depending on how you installed Service Pack 3, you might find a copy here:<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386</b><br />
<br />
Of course you are going to have to boot on something to replace the file and you could create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required) and that
<i>might </i>work depending on several factors or you can make a bootable Hiren's Boot CD.<br />
<br />
A Hiren's boot CD doesn't care that your system has SATA drives and doesn't care if your system has some Administrator password that you may have forgotten or can't get past - it deals with all that handily.&nbsp; You can boot Hiren's from a CD or, if your system
 is capable, from a USB thumb drive and I have instructions for both methods if you need them.<br />
<br />
Once booted on Hiren;s you can see if you can just replace the missing file by copying one from the above locations and pasting it here where it belongs:<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32</b><br />
<br />
It could be that you will not find a backup copy of the missing file on your system and if that is the case, from a working system you can download one from my
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SkyDrive</a> (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files), copy it to a USB thumb drive and
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sneakernet</a></i> it (that means carry it over by hand and sneakers) to the afflicted system and copy it onto the afflicted system.<br />
<br />
To make a Hiren's boot CD, do this:<br />
<br />
<br />
I am going to recommend you use Hiren's boot CD (it will also go on a USB drive).
<br />
<br />
This is good for you because it has many more tools on it that on the XP Recovery Console CD, does not care about your Administrator passwords and you will not have to futz around in your BIOS if any afflicted system has SATA drives - Hiren's can deal with
 that.<br />
<br />
You will have a whole bunch of cool tools that you don't have in the XP Recovery Console...&nbsp; a registry editor, password resetter, and a desktop that looks like Windows XP so you will feel comfortable maneuvering.<br />
<br />
From a working system, first download Hiren's Boot CD from here (it is a substantial download but worth it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (look near the bottom of the page).<br />
<br />
Unzip the Hiren's to some folder where you can find it.&nbsp; There is a <b>Hiren's.BootCD.15.1.iso</b> in there that you are going to need next.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it.&nbsp; The BurnToCD.cmd will use the extracted BurnCDCC.exe file to burn the .ISO file to a blank CD using your existing CD burner.&nbsp; You can also use your own CD burning software
 as<br />
long as your software is capable of creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file.&nbsp; Most modern CD burning programs can create bootable CDs from an .ISO image.&nbsp; Creating a bootable CD from an ISO image is not the same as just burning the file to a CD.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and <b>easy </b>CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar or any other "extras".<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp; These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system and try again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the <b>Mini XP</b> option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are
 already used to using.<br />
<br />
Using the Mini XP, you can access the Internet, maneuver around your system, search for files, copy files, replace files, run various scans for malicious software, edit text files, etc.).<br />
<br />
After replacing the missing file, restart your system and remove the Hiren's CD.<br />
<br />
Note that using Hiren's you could also copy/backup your important data to an external drive if you want.<br />

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for approaching Microsoft Community for assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I understand that you receive error “The remote procedure call failed and did not execute” on windows 7 Computer. I would definitely help you in fixing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps to resolve the RPC problem </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1 : Start the RPC service </strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Press Windows key + X and select Command Prompt .</li><li>In the Command prompt window Type net start RpcSs and hit enter.</li><li>Type exit to close the command prompt.</li><li>&nbsp; Restart the computer and check the result.</li></ol>
<div><strong>Step 2: Check the registry entry for the service</strong><strong><br />
</strong>&nbsp;a. Start the computer using Windows DVD to boot to Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) and select command prompt.<br />
&nbsp;b. On the command prompt, type regedit.exe and hit enter.<br />
&nbsp;c. Look for the following entries:<br />
&nbsp;i. Entry for Remote Procedure Call (RPC):<br />
&nbsp;Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RpcSs<br />
&nbsp;ii. Entry for Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator:<br />
&nbsp;Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RpcLocator</div>
<div>Important: <br />
Set REG_DWORD value to 2 for automatic start on RpcSs<br />
&nbsp;Set REG_DWORD value to 3 for manual start on RPCLocator</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Very important: Modifying the registry incorrectly will cause serious damage to the computer. Backup the registry before you make any changes.</strong></p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Mouse cursor moves by istelf - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Mouse cursor moves by istelf</h2>
                    <p>I have seen a few topics on this but the suggested fixes did not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Whilst typing the mouse cursor decides to move and I end up typing in a random place or overwriting existing content.</p>
<p>I do use a docking station with my surface but this happens both whilst docked and undocked. &nbsp;I have tried removing the keyboard, re-calibrating the screen and removing the pen from the side of the surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am about to run another check for updates and then check the firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had similar problems? &nbsp;And if so a solution?<br />
</p>

<p>I have not done the last 2 as this is a business machine and is being used by my CEO.</p>
<p>I have applied the latest Windows 10 anniversary updates and this has not changed anything. &nbsp;My CEO has reached the point that he would just like to return the device from a new one or a refund. &nbsp;He does not have the time to keep messing about with it anymore.
 &nbsp;Can you please advise how I can go about getting the device replaced or a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I have found disabling the touch screen will improve cursor performance.&nbsp; But of course you lose the touchy coolness of&nbsp;a Surface.&nbsp; I personally&nbsp;prefer functional over cool, though.
