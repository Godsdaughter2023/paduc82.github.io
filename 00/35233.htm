            What is the make and model of your smartphone?
<br />Which version of Android is installed?
<br />
<br />Try below steps and see if the issue still persists:
<br />
<br />Go to your Phone settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.
<br />
<br />Look for Skype and then select Force Stop &gt; Clear cache &gt; Clear Data &gt; Uninstall.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling, kindly do a reboot on your device.
<br />
<br />Once it pop-up, please install Skype using Google Play Store.
<br />
<br />After installing Skype, please do another restart before signing back in. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Go to APK site, APKMirror <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.apkmirror.com/</a>, and downloaded and installed and voila! the problem was fixed. It installed Skype for Android 8.25.0.5, which actually I prefer to the previous version I had.
<br />
<br />Don't know if this would be an approved solution for Microsoft, (I did do malware/virus scans on the file and the site appears to be reputable), but it worked for me.
<br />
<br />Thought you might want to know, it could be an option for people like me, since their device is not rooted, who can only disable but not uninstall and reinstall Skype for Android.
<br />
<br />Actually, this is effectively a reinstall in all but name, but for it to work, you do have to enable "unknown sources" in the security options on Android.

            <p>While there are no pre-loaded games, Microsoft offers few free games that can be downloaded from the Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download games like JetPack Joyride, Solitaire, Cut The Rope, Adera, Pinball, Mahjong, and&nbsp;TapTiles. These are full games available for free.

    <title>Windows 8.1 Industry Pro on an Embedded PC with Compact Flash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pavel sovi‰çka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Industry Pro on an Embedded PC with Compact Flash</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install Windows 8.1 Industry Pro. I have choosen this OS because its the newest Embedded OS I have access via my University Dreamspark account that meats my requirements. I have excluded Windows 10 IoT Core for its limited abilities and probable
 lack of compatibility. The computer I have is a ECW218B-945GSE embedded computer sporting a mighty Intel Atom N270 single core running at 1.6 GHz with 1 GB of RAM. The main storage of this system is a Compact Flash drive, which I have swapped from the original
 512 MB one to a 32 GB Sandisk drive. It also has two SATA ports and a 2.5inch bay for an HDD or SSD. While it can run the W8.1 system (with minor audio driver issues) on the HDD and SSD, due to the passive cooling and little internal volume the disk overheats.
 Therefore I wanted to install the W8.1 Industry Pro on the Compact Flash and here is my problem. Windows installer simply ignores the Compact Flash as it is listed as a removable media eventhough it is listed in BIOS as an IDE drive. However the drive is active
 and found by the installer, because when I select "Load driver" I can see it and browse through it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried several things. I know Windows XP runs flawlessly , but I want something newer. Both Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 8.1 Industry Pro ignore the Compact Flash. i have tried providing newest available drivers from Intel during instalation
 with no luck. I have tried to make a Bit copy of the HDD with the system running on this PC, while having the computer dissasembled and running the HDD externaly so it wouldnt overheat. It did not boot once I have finished the transfer. WinToUSB application
 recognizes Comapct Flash isnt a USB flash drive so it refuses to make a Windows Portable on it. WinToHDD recognizes its not a fixed drive and again, denial of install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Realising I have exhausted my options I have contacted Microsoft Czech support, but was turned down as it is not possible. Two times I contacted english support. The Indian guy that responded (this was through a MS page and I checked the web certificate,
 not a scam, I hope) that I need to talk to Pro support. However DreamSpark does not have a Pro support code. A call was arranged twice, but it never happened. So my last attempt is here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest it turned from a simple project of selecting a good OS to a fight with MS. I still refuse to accept, that MS has made an Embedded OS which does not support an Embedded storage drive. Also it is a mystery why old Windows XP runs without any concern,
 while anything morem odern simply refuses to use the Compact Flash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any advice or guides that could help me with my problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Tordillo,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The above issue might have occurred due to the following reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Corrupted system drive.</span></li><li><span>Missing or corrupted system files &amp; folders.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>When you say ‚Äúin fact a can create other numbers but not that one‚Äù, are you referring to the folder name or number you are trying to create?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if similar issue persists on creating a folder in other system drives?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Running <strong>SFC scan</strong> and
<strong>DISM scan</strong> on the PC will help in checking and replacing the corrupted or missing system files and folders on the PC which might be causing the above issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Open an <strong>Administrator command prompt
</strong>window by</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></li><li><span>Check if it says <strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the
<strong>CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3: </span></strong><span>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, switch to other system drive, create a new folder and check if similar issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Write to us with the status of the error code you receive on creating a folder in the system on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If disk management is unable to format your Micro SD try to do it in the command window. To do so</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the windows start orb and type in the search box <strong>cmd</strong></li><li>It will open a black window. In there type <strong>diskpart</strong> </li><li>Then type <strong>list disk</strong> </li><li>After that you see a list of disk connected to your machine. Select your micro SD card. For e.g is your hard disk is in no. 1 and microSD card in no 2 then type<strong>select disk 2</strong>
</li><li>After that you will see written <strong>disk 2 is now selected</strong> </li><li>Then type <strong>clean</strong> </li><li><strong>create partition primary</strong> </li><li><strong>format fs=fat 32 quick</strong> </li><li><strong>exit</strong> </li></ul>
<p>See if your microSD has been formatted.</p>
<p>If no then try to remove the SD card from your mobile phone (If you are doing so) and try to plug it in a micro SD adaptor and try to format it from there. Perhaps it is your phone that is preventing the operation.</p>
<p>Else if you are already using a micro SD adaptor to do so, then verify if it is not locked (little with key found on the side of the adaptor) or try to try it with a new adaptor.</p>
<p>Hope this will resolve your problem,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Andrew.</p>

<h2>            Windows contacts not syncing with outlook account</h2>
                    <p>I created an Outlook account for work. Windows prompted me to sync to the mail app. I did. I proceeded to enter all new business contacts into the People App. I would like to share all contacts with my boss, but I don't want to add his account as that would
 allow me access to his emails.</p>
<p>I logged into outlook to try and export from there, but only the mail and calendar apps were synced, not people contacts...please help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not connected to a domain</p>
<p>I am using Windows 10</p>
<p>I am using Microsoft Exchange</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-posted this question, because I haven't received a solution yet, REALLY hoping someone can guide me in the right direction...</p>

<p>Hi There, I ended up contacting Microsoft live chat and the problem was that I added contacts as a "Microsoft account" rather than "Outlook". So I went in and changed all of them..which took me 2 days :/</p>
<p>Just a bit of feedback...perhaps when opening the People App from the onset, it takes you to the "Showing some accounts" screen, and then some sort of indication next to the Microsoft account that if selected they will no have syncing ability...? As it is,
 the People App opens to a contact screen and has the + button, so the tendency is to just start adding names....there is a heading at the top that tells you the type of contact it will be, but if there's no mention that there are other options available, the
 normal response is to just proceed; completely unaware of the error you're making.....</p>
<p>Anyway, that' s my 2 cents :)</p>
<p>Thanks for your response, at least I can get back to more productive tasks now!</p>

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Please try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try re-registering Store and clearing cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-register-store-app-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-reg...</a>

<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall or a VPN.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.

            <p>Thanks Arun for taking the time to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the suggestion you offered but see the same sympton in the new account as I do in my account which is there is no option to setup Fingerprint, as before Device Manager reports there are no issues with the fingerprint reader and the driver is working
 and up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am back to where I started I am afraid, any further suggestion anyone as doubt I will be the only one.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem on HP laptop. </p>
<p>At the sign in page it does show that it is detecting the fingerprint reader then it ends up saying reader not detected. In the device manager it shows its working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too like this feature and am considering a rollback to windows 7 home premium if no remedy should come about soon, although I am liking so many features of 10 I want my bio-metric sign in back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely hoping MS and or Validity Sensors can fix this soon.<br />

            <p>I need to post full details elsewhere but rollback did not go 100%. The actual rollback was very quick and straightaway fingerprint worked which was good to see. What did work where Metro apps such as Mail and calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So so ended up undertaking a "reset" and a fresh install of Windows 8 which took a few hours which could have done without. Interestingly couple of Metro apps are no longer available for download when I tried it from the Store Deezer and Netflix. They still
 work on my other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will be keeping an eye here to see if anyone finds a solution.</p>

<h2>            Searching a PDF with Edge</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and PDFs automatically open in Edge. &nbsp;Is there a way to search the whole document, not just a page, for specific text? &nbsp;If not, then how do I open the PDF with something else so I can search THE WHOLE DOCUMENT, not page by page, one page
 at a time? &nbsp;And even then it's not finding the specific text when I search a specific page. &nbsp;This isn't useful for me at all for work.

<h2>            Put a password on router so the network is secured. But we can&#39;t get internet access unless it&#39;s unsecured.</h2>
                    Put a password on router so the network is secured. But when I type in the security key "unable to connect to network" or whatever comes up. If I'm lucky I'll get internet access, but others wont. Other times the network will go down to the bottom of the
 list and have an x and say something like "the information entered does not match the network settings." I'm not sure what to do, only time everyone in my house gets connection is when it's unsecured. any ideas ? We have Windows 7 stupid starter. The information
 in properties in the network internet connection is the same on both laptops and the password is the same as the one entered on the router.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try changing the SSID maybe there are other routers around them that have the same name.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to Change the Name of a Wireless Network</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you originally set up your wireless network, you likely gave it a name. If you didn't, it probably defaulted to the brand
 name of your wireless router. You don't have to be stuck with the name you originally gave it or the default name. You can change the name of a wireless network quite easily.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Look in your router's instruction manual to find its internal IP address.
 The IP address is a series of numbers, broken up by periods. For example, a common IP address is 192.168.0.1.</span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Open an Internet browser window, such as Firefox or Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Type the router's IP address into the address bar and click, "Enter." This
 will open a web page with your router's control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Enter your user information if required. The username will often default
 to "Admin" and then enter the personal password you set up when you originally created your wireless network.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Access the "Wireless" link on the page.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Enter your new wireless network name in the field labeled "Wireless Network
 Name." This field is also commonly labeled as "SSID" which stands for "Service Set Identifier." Your new wireless network name will be saved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Change the default SSID</span></b></p>
<p><span>Routers and access points use a wireless network name known as a service set identifier (SSID). Most manufacturers use the same SSID for all of their routers
 and access points. We recommend that you change the default SSID to keep your wireless network from overlapping with other wireless networks that might be using the default SSID. It makes it easier for you to identify which wireless network is yours, if there's
 more than one nearby, because the SSID is typically shown in the list of available networks. Check the information that came with your device for instructions about how to change the default SSID.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are trying to use WPA or WPA2, please ensure that both your network adapter and wireless router support this protocol. If you are having issues
 detecting your wireless network when using WPA or WPA2, try configuring your router to use WEP instead and see if you can connect.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Please note that the change between WEP/WPA/WPA2 will need to be made on all your computer and wireless router.</span></p>
<p><span>b. If you are only able to connect using WEP, then your networking hardware may need a firmware upgrade. &nbsp;If you are not comfortable doing this yourself,
 please call your hardware/router manufacturer for help in doing this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you</span></p>

            We've tried to change the SSID but that doesn't help. When we put a password on through the router IP address we cannot connect. Yesterday I tried setting up the router on my laptop and did that and it was ok, matched everything from the web based router
 settings with that and the other laptop. Still nothing unable to connect.&nbsp;<br />
How do I find out if it suppots WPA?&nbsp;

<h2>            svchost.exe&#40;netsvcs&#41; consuming 25&#37; of CPU and running non-stop on my Windows 7 laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have clean installed Windowss 7 and used the regular update process to update and installed 151 important updates &amp; ignored all the optional updates and everything seemed to be normal.
</p>
<p>After a day or so, suddenly i see there is a process running continuously and consuming 25% CPU and found the culprit to be svchost.exe(netsvcs). Even after selecting not to check for updates, this problem persists and couldn't solve this issue after many
 attempts.</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 and what to know, if there is any solution to this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Lately, this is a common problem that happens to a lot of people.&nbsp; This may not be the problem in your computer, but it is likely.&nbsp; Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start globe</li><li>Type <strong>serv </strong>into the text box that pops up</li><li>Click on Services</li><li>Find Windows Update in the alphabetic list in that window</li><li>Right-click on Windows Update and choose Stop</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In a minute or so, you should see that load disappear</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that works, then the problem is Windows Update.&nbsp; Start it and change its setting to NEVER, then restart your computer.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If you follow the advice from Canadian Tech and set Updates to NEVER and restart your system do you still have the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not want to follow the advice in the other replies to disable important Windows Services and there is no memory leak in the svchost Process. &nbsp;If there was they would all be afflicted and every system in the world would be having the same problems
 (and they're not).</p>

            I do not want to settle for a temporary solution.<br />
Earler, i have opted not to install KB3172605 and went for the time consuming option (searched &amp; installed 151 updates).<br />
If KB3172605 will solve this high CPU consumption problem, then i can install it.&nbsp;<br />
But i also want to know whether there will be any issues as i have already installed all the important updates(151 updates).&nbsp;

            I want to know, if there is a permanent solution to this issue. This is a problem being faced by many Windows 7 users, so will Microsoft going to release any update to solve this issue any time soon.

            <p>The "permanent solution" is to set Windows Update settings to NEVER&gt;&gt;&gt;.....&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as I said before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That means from that point onward you take responsibility and control of Windows Update.&nbsp; That means you do it when want to and under your control.</p>

            <p>It has already been established that by following the other discussions Windows Update can be made to behave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are only choosing to follow parts of the advice Windows Update will probably continue to misbehave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you install KB3172605 and then see if you still have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, you don't really <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">have</span></em> to set Windows Update to NEVER to solve the problem but that is the recommended setting so you can check for updates yourself on your own terms and install only the
 updates YOU want which might not be all the updates Microsoft thinks you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do want to investigate it further you do not need the instructions from TechNet (involving Process Explorer) to figure out the problematic Service - everything you need is in Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to do that from another topic:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>You don't need Process Explorer to see what Services are running and taking the most CPU under a svchost (if that is what you are saying).&nbsp; Everything you need is in Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see the svchost Process running in Task Manger remember that what it is doing is "<strong>hosting</strong>" important Windows
<strong>Services</strong> underneath it.&nbsp; That is why it is called svchost - it is hosting services.&nbsp; That is what is says in the description column in Task Manager:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d5e96e4-12d9-40d1-b700-c2b9386ebe01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d5e96e4-12d9-40d1-b700-c2b9386ebe01" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What you want to see in Task Manger with the biggest number in the CPU column is System Idle Process which is the amount of "free time" your CPU has - the more the better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be one Windows Service running under a svchost Processes or there might be many Windows Services running under each svchost Process that you see in Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is normal to see several to many svchost Process running at the same time since there are sometimes lots of Windows Services that are running on your system.&nbsp; Normally the svchost Processes consume very little system resources (CPU and RAM) but sometimes
 one of them may appear to be running amok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often the problem has something to do with Windows Update and some of the "solutions" you might read about involve disabling all or parts of Windows Update and that may make the symptom of the problem go away but does not actually fix the problem.&nbsp; It is
 much better to actually fix the problem than it is to just fix the symptom of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also read about a "memory leak" in svchost.exe but there is no memory leak in svchost.exe.&nbsp; That idea comes from folks that don't know how to troubleshoot a svchost process that is running amok.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there was a memory leak in svchost.exe than ALL the svchost processes would be running amok (and they're not).&nbsp; If there was a memory leak in svchost.exe every system is the world would be having this problem (and they're not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is always something going wrong with some Windows Service that is being hosted by the svchost Process.&nbsp; There is no memory leak in svchost.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Problem with Windows Update has been plaguing systems for months and one of the symptoms of the problem is a svchost Process that is running amok using too much CPU and RAM, causing systems to overheat, cooling fans spinning out of control, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not already done so you should start by applying one of these two discussions to your system to be sure that a known problem with Windows Update has been fixed
<strong>(do this first)</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two discussions that should help:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-7-update-problems-read-this-first/28147a5f-b0b0-480b-bed9-834a2da7a375">Windows update problems?&nbsp;&nbsp; Read this first.</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and/or</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-7-update-solution/f39a65fa-9d10-42e7-9bc0-7f5096b36d0c">Windows 7 Update Solution</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If after applying those known solutions to Windows update you still have a svchost Process that is running amok here is how you can figure out which Windows Service is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see the svchost that is running amok notice the Process ID (PID) which in this case the PID is 1088 (I choose check for updates to show some activity of 14% CPU), then right click the Process and choose
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd4ebdd8-3ac3-47d9-a9a0-f7e346150d08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd4ebdd8-3ac3-47d9-a9a0-f7e346150d08" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the PID column header to sort the Services by PID and in this example all of the Windows Services running under PID 1088 would be highlighted already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there is our friend Windows Update Service (wuauserv) running under PID 1088 and that could be normal but you can't see the CPU usage of these Services:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5570e398-38e8-474a-820b-f333e7ee91c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5570e398-38e8-474a-820b-f333e7ee91c1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From there you can't see from there which service is using all the CPU or how much CPU any of the Services are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next click the Performance Tab and then Resource Monitor (may have to minimize Task Manager to see Resource Monitor):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85dd3ea1-ab4b-4594-bfec-488554923f05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85dd3ea1-ab4b-4594-bfec-488554923f05" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Resource Monitor click the Services tab (sort by PID again if needed) and scroll to PID 1088 and you can see all the Services under PID 1088 and also how much CPU they are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85e72aaa-768f-4ef6-afb5-4608cadd4a11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85e72aaa-768f-4ef6-afb5-4608cadd4a11" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this example the Windows Update Service (wuauserv) is bouncing around looking for updates using 13-16% of CPU but on a Windows Update afflicted system it would probably be using more (and BITS would be there too).&nbsp; As you can see the rest of the Services
 running under that svchost Process PID 1088 are using zero CPU:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4593b12-3cd5-4441-999c-d126e1323318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4593b12-3cd5-4441-999c-d126e1323318" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So you don't <em>really </em>need Process Monitor (unless you are going to explain how to use it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example from today where Windows update is set to Check for Updates, Windows Update Service and BITs are still enabled and running but not using any CPU - because I followed the procedure to fix Windows Update:</p>
<p>

    <title>How do I give control of pointer settings to ELAN instead of Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sweet_t_art  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I give control of pointer settings to ELAN instead of Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>PLEASE READ ENTIRE POST BEFORE REPLYING! I upgraded to Windows 10 and ever since, I have not been able to use the special features of my touchpad. To me, a computer is 100% worthless if I can't use the scrolling feature of the touchpad. I have reinstalled
 the ELAN drivers a hundred times. Please don't suggest I try that or something extremely elementary without reading my entire post first. Thanks! I think that Windows 10 is overriding the settings for the ELAN software. Again, I have reinstalled all software,
 all drivers, restarted... I have been working on this for almost two weeks and am ready to just throw Windows 10 out the window. So, my question is: How do I tell Windows to stop overriding my ELAN software or how can I turn off the pointer device settings
 in Windows so that my manufacturer software can control it instead? I have a yellow triangle in the device icon in the task bar. Please see the picture. Everything is greyed out in the Elan tab of mouse properties (pictured). I have finally gotten the ELAN
 software to actually open but again, the settings will not take effect. Please help! If you don't have a proper answer and you reply, anyway, it marks this as answered int he Microsoft community so that no one else will click on this to help me. PLEASE only
 reply if you have an answer. Thanks so much!</p>

            Thank you for your reply but this is the same cookie cutter reply I keep getting every time I ask this question and you all keep saying to let you know if I need further assistance and I do. I do need further assistance but no one will further assist me.
 I have performed these actions. I have taken these steps. The ELAN software is working properly as it did before the upgrade to 10. Now, Windows 10 is hijacking the pointer settings. How do I disable the service for the pointer settings in Windows 10 so that
 the ELAN software can be in control again? Why won't anyone answer my question???

<h2>            My HP Laptop is near impossible to work on, with freezing and being so slow</h2>
                    My HP Laptop is near impossible to work on, with freezing and being so slow.&nbsp; I have had it a little over a year, and actually sent it back once, because of a missing module or something.&nbsp; They sent it back and it is still very incredibly slow and locks
 up.&nbsp; Sometimes even Chrome cannot run.&nbsp; Just accessing a document is a such a painstaking slow process that I have to give up.&nbsp; This has been an issue since the first day out of the box.&nbsp; Could it just be a slow cheap computer for people that don't really
 need to get work done?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Processor&nbsp;is AMD A10-9600P RADEON R5, 10 COMPUTE CORES 4C+6G, 2400 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)&nbsp; &nbsp; Memory usage and Disk Usage always show near 100% most of the time in Task Manager under processes.&nbsp; I have owned
 computers since 1995 and this is the first time I have ever owned such a lemon.&nbsp; Can anything be done about it?

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The past 2 days my skype has just been randomly closing. Frequently while I am trying to interact with Skype but often sometimes when I am not in the app, it will just close.</p>

<h2>            Searching for Network Printers window freezes.</h2>
                    I have an airport express that is connected to both my son's laptop and mine.&nbsp; He was able to find and use the wireless network to print correctly.&nbsp; However, when I click add printer and choose the option of using one on a wireless network, the "Searching
 for Network Printers" window appears but it doesn't do anything.&nbsp; The green bar doesn't move and the button that says "stop searching" isn't clickable.&nbsp; I have to always force quit it with task manager otherwise it would just stay there frozen.&nbsp; Is there something
 I&nbsp;am doing wrong?

            <p>The solution was trivial for me.&nbsp; Go to Devices and Printers in the Control Panel, and select Add a printer.&nbsp; Intuition says click "Add a network, wireless, or Bluetooth printer" since that is precisely what I am trying to do.&nbsp; But the correct choice (for
 me, anyway) is "Add a local printer".&nbsp; The "Use an existing port should be the default". In the drop-down list you should see your printer's internal IP address with the TCP/IP selection.&nbsp; Choose that, then go through the printer selection process.</p>
<p>Your printer's internal IP address&nbsp;will only show up if you have already gone through the USB connection discovery process.&nbsp; it worked for me after hours of trying.&nbsp; I wish you well.</p>
