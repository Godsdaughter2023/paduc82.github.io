<h2>            Upload Studio clips wont upload to OneDrive</h2>
                    I have been trying for the past four days and my clip hasn't been uploaded to OneDrive but it will upload to my clips on the Xbox One however this is the weird part my upload doesn't even reach 100% yet it will upload to my clips but not OneDrive so I
 can put it on my Youtube channel. My internet bandwidth for uploading is 0.3mbs but it would still upload clips when I first got my Xbox One. Any help would be appreciated!

<h2>            Mapped drive becomes Read Only after restarting computer</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 Professional on a Server 2003 domain. I can map a drive and successfully share documents and I have it set to remember my credentials.
<br />
<br />
However once I lock the computer or restart it all the documents are read only.&nbsp; This problem only occurs on the two Windows 7 machines I have on the network.&nbsp; All other computers are XP or Mac and they reconnect with full permissions enabled on the documents.&nbsp;
 All computers log in with the same username and password, so it's not that the user account has incorrect permissions.&nbsp; It is definitely a Windows 7 specific problem.<br />
<br />

<p>Sometimes it doesn't, it *seems* it had to do with the time that's elapsed between log-off and log-on.</p>

            <p>You don't say what application you are using for drawing. OneNote handles palm rejection fairly well (in the MS-Office OneNote 2013 advanced options settings tab there is some options to control how the pen works).&nbsp;However, in&nbsp;&nbsp;other applications (including
 the other MS-Office Applications) the palm rejection only kicks in after it has recognised the pen near the surface of the screen (after which as long as the screen/digitiser is seeing the pen it should ignore your hand) takes some getting used to!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following forum discussion gives some more useful info (though describing the
Wacom digitizer on the SP2 as far as I'm aware it's still relevant to the N-Trig digitizer used on the SP3:</p>

                    My HDMI TV that I use as a default display device isn't detected by Windows anymore, and after some search, I found out that the system has deleted it. How can I install its drivers and configure it now that it is no longer detectable ?

<p>Thank you for the quick reply, well the problem occured when both of TV and PC were unplugged from the extension cord, and I already did update my Nvidia GT 1030's drivers. I'm using now another monitor, connected via a VGA to HDMI adapter. Again, I still
 need to re-add my TV as a display device. </p>
<p>**Update: I managed to get it to work again just by unplugging HDMI cable and plugging again and turning TV and PC on and off several times. But for me it isn't a real problem solver, since this happens two to three times a week, so this thread is still
 open to any answer.</p>

<h2>            Unable to start COM&#43; Application Service</h2>
                    
<p>I keep getting a message every hour in event log: <br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
<strong>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID
<br />
{0C0A3666-30C9-11D0-8F20-00805F2CD064} to the user E1705LAPTOP\Walt SID (S-1-5-21-2145378865-116294500-417182649-1006) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.<br />
</strong><br />
I've checked Component Services and discovered that the COM+ Application Service is set to Manual and not started. I tried to start it but it gave me an error message that it timed out trying to start (after only a second or two) and so I can't start it (Error
 1053). I've tried to start it from Services as well (COM+ System Applications) and get the same error message. I've rebooted the machine and tried again with the same results. I'm sure this is the source of the error message, but I have no idea how to get
 the service to start and could find nothing in the knowledge base (most articles apply to Server 2008 and the command line codes they use don't work in Vista). Does anyone know why this service won't start or how to get it to start?</span></p>

Hi,<br />
<br />
I also faced the same issue and found out the workaround.<br />
Workaround was to go to services and set the COM services to 'automatic' <br />
and under the 'Logon' tab, set them to logon locally. I also had to do the <br />
same for RCP and RCP Locator. Then I set them all to automatic and rebooted <br />
the computer. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.

            I'm afraid to try this solution with RCP and RCP Locator because if it doesn't work (or if I start having other problems - problems that don't just show up in event viewer but actually interfere with how I'm working) I don't know the Network Services password
 to reset it back to where it was before.&nbsp; I tried it with just COM+ and that didn't work (and now I can't reset it back to the same user it was before ( Local Service) because again I don't know the password). When I try to use my password it takes it (applies)
 and I get a different error when trying to start it - something about permissions (error 1297) which I assume means I used the wrong password (though it could easily be something else - I don't know). When I set it to Local System account I get the same old
 1053 timeout error (though that doesn't mean the problem is exactly the same as it was before because it's a different logon now). If I could figure out the passwords for Network Services and Local Services I would try this solution in full, but until then
 I'd rather face the error than take the risk of messing something up that I can't fix (I really don't know what RCP and RCP Locator do - it could be critical and I think it involves internet access - which would hose me completely).<br />
<br />
When you did this, it didn't affect you in any way (other than to delete the error message)? I find that hard to believe because logging in as a different user should have a profound effect on it - it should get the call from the Network Services controller
 and find it has no authority and fail to activate due to permission problems. That's what I'm afraid would happen (and I don't think even a system repair would fix the problem because it would keep this new setting - not revert to the original setting). I'm
 not ready to have to do a clean install and reload all my software, reset all my settings, and restore all my files from backup. That would take hours if not days (and I'd never get it back to where it was because some software I downloaded and didn't save
 and so would have to remember what it was to download it again (assuming it's even available any more)).<br />
<br />
Do you have a solution that just affects the COM+ Application service - maybe a registry edit or something? Does anyone have another solution that doesn't involve changing the logon properties of RCP and RCP Locator (or know how to get or change the passwords
 for Local Services and Network Services)?<br />
<br />
To be truthful, I;m not evsn sure i want to start the COM+ Application Service because I'm not trying to start anything that isn't starting and I don't know what it's trying to do. Perhaps it's a hacker trying to get into my system and this is blocking the
 hacker - or maybe it's a virus trying to do something I'd rather not occur.&nbsp; Still, I'd like the error message to go away. Is there any way to tell what's causing it to try to activate?

            Hi, Anul. &nbsp;Well, the site is called hillbilly-music.com, and I am clicking on a particular sub-department called "Jukebox," as a way to play some "hillbilly," or very old-time country/folk, music. &nbsp;Yesterday it was opening to a small screen that had, for
 example, a forward arrow to, I presume, play music. &nbsp;But when I clicked on it, I only got a message "Subtitles on," but no music. &nbsp;When I read the "Help" questions on this player, it said if you couldn't play music, "Probably MPlayer couldn't play the file.
 &nbsp;Open the mplayer log &nbsp;(Options-&gt;View logs-&gt;MPlayer), you'll probably find an error message in the latest lines. &nbsp;On Windows is quite common that some MPlayer builds fail because they have been compiled with no support for some feature that SMPlayer tries
 to use. &nbsp;The error message could give you a clue. &nbsp;If it complains about cache, try disabling the cache in Preferences-&gt;Performance. &nbsp;If it complains about fontconfig try to use a ttf font instead of a system font." &nbsp;But I didn't know how to do the first procedure
 it mentions, hence my question on Microsoft Community.
<div><br />
<div>Today, I am doing worse. &nbsp;When I open "Jukebox," my whole screen fills with black, except in the top left corner the phrase "SMplayer." &nbsp;I see no option to take any action.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just at this moment I am quite interested in hearing this music for pleasure/recreation. &nbsp;Appreciate any assistance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In general my browser is Internet Explorer, although I sometimes use Chrome.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No, in general, I very happily watch many kinds of videos on many sites.</div>

<div>Oh, what is a "Windows Update"? &nbsp;Can I perform it, and how? &nbsp;It seems to me at times the laptop I am on performs automatic updates, is this what you are referring to? &nbsp;For instance it will say "Do not turn off machine, installing update 1 of 11......."</div>

            <p>No, it's not a problem.&nbsp; Memory is meant to be used.&nbsp; If it's sitting around idle then it's not doing anything and you want it to do something.&nbsp; There's just no point having memory sitting around doing nothing.&nbsp; You bought it so tha it could be used, right?&nbsp;
 Unless you have system slowdowns then don't worry about it and allow Windows to manage memory as it sees fit.</p>

<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Problem Printing to Network printer from some machines - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem Printing to Network printer from some machines</h2>
                    
<p>I have two PCs running Windows 7 on a simple network. A network printer (Samsung 3050) is also attached. One PC can print, the other cannot.</p>
<p>Both PCs can ping the printer and open its http control page. The printer is detected as a network device on both PCs, showing up on the network map. During printer installation, the printer appears as an available network printer. On the successful PC,
 the port settings are auto detected and the wizard moves on to printer driver selection. On the PC which fails, the "Additional Port Information Required" dialogue page is shown and the port info has to be selected manually.</p>
<p>On the PC which fails, print jobs simply wait in the print queue indefinitely.</p>
<p>The print spooler and RPC services all look OK and firewalls on both PCs are identical.</p>
<p>I guess some service is missing or is being blocked from auto detecting the port protocol?</p>
<p>Any help gratefully received</p>

                    <p>Dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very frustrated. I recently (one week) bought a Dell XPS 13 9630 - i7 7500U 7th - RAM16GB - SSD 512GB and since yesterday I am getting blue screens (BSOD) all the time, one after another, continuously. Sometimes I can't even login, after the password
 my Win10 crashes showing "IRQL_UNEXPECTED_VALUE".&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>ZigZag3143,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help! I was suspecting that GAS Tecnologia would be the trouble maker. I will contact the developer of GAS because this is a must-have security .exe which provides access to an account I have in a company. Without this sofware
 my access is denied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also having dirty shutdowns (suddenly blackouts, not BSOD) in my other Samsung Ultrabook and maybe this GAS Tecnologia is causing this! Thank you very much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also upload my Samsung's minidump files to have specialist comments.</p>

            <p>Dear ZigZag, thank you very much again for your help. My laptop is not going BSOD anymore. The "Banco do Brasil e Itau warsaw" program provided by "GAS TECNOLOGIA" is crashing the windows for sure. I removed it from both of my laptops and they running perfect
 now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all brazilians who are experiencing the same problem, remove the Gas tecnologia softwares from your PC and you'll not enter in blue screen or dirty shutdowns (suddenly shutdowns without notice).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gas Tecnologia sucks.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 loses album artist information when using .wav from WHS </h2>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>There is a taggable Wav format. I have read about Broadcast Wav files. They are 32-bit. I have also read about 64-bit Wav files. From what I read there is a limit for the size of 32-bit Wav files, and 64-bit Wav files go past that limit. Most people don't
 need this now. But as a Music producer, I can see how I would need it before you. Look up a program called Reason by Propellerhead software:
<a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/</a>. I'v read it in their help file, you can email support and they will help you find what you need. I have also read about it and been told
 a bit on other internet forums for producers. I do not own Reason, I use other software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Broadcast Wav: It is apparently slightly different than regular Wav files. It also does not have as wide of support. Some programs or systems apparently do not read the id3 tagging, have trouble with the id3 tagging or have trouble with this format. So until
 this&nbsp;Wav id3 tagging is&nbsp;common and Wav files FINALLY get their tagging permanently, then what is out right now is all that is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WMA-lossless, Wav and mp3 320kbps, etc do have a sound difference. Do the listening for yourself on your equipment with the SAME hardware and the SAME programs ripping your test files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other way I tested is: I make music. So I ripped Wav, WMA-lossless and a lossless type, mp3 320kbps and a mp3 256kbps. I put all of them into the music program I have seperated, but on the same timeline. I muted everything I did not listen to. I spent
 a while checking them. There were noticable differences, and some not so much. I DID notice a difference from WMA and WAV. It was slight, and a few times noticable. Most people can't tell the difference, and a WMA at home or in a club compared to a Wav isn't
 going to be a huge difference, especially when a Dj or you can adjust lows, mids and highs a little bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not test AAC lossless files. My program is older and does not support them. AAC would be close to WMA though. Give or take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wav is champion and always wins. I wish it had tagging. :-).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Media Player has a certain set of algorithms. And a person CANNOT customize the ripping. Some ripping programs ALLOW you to customize the way it is ripped. But you can run into some problems. Eg: Some equalizer or compression settings are great for
 90% of&nbsp;an album, but most songs are recorded differently or edited and mixed down differently. So they are not always leveled across the album and there can be fluctations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I myself would enjoy customized rips for the best quality and even be able to MAXIMIZE the lossless or compressed (eg: mp3) formats and make them sound the best possible. But it takes too much time, and most people do not have this time or need this. Those
 people do it as a profession, are HARDCORE audiophiles or are archiving sound for a much higher purpose, :-P.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know what WMP's algorithms are for ripping. Or iTunes, or WinAmps, etc. This relates to being able to make customized rips. These algorithms affect your copying, archiving and transfering. This is another reason why each program is slightly different,
 even when they are using the same open or not open sourced coding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I'v learned. This is the best I got.</p>

            You aren't addressing anyone from Microsoft here.&nbsp; This is a peer-to-peer help community for people having issues with Microsoft products.&nbsp; It seems that if you have an accountant, that would be a good resource for advice on personal finance software.&nbsp;
 You are unlikely to get any recommendations here.

 Why you stopped years ago I'll never know. What I DON'T want is software where you have to fill out "checks". Can you PLEASE find out who your "Money" people recommend. Thank you very much. Very important to me and my accountant. The price is not an issue.
 I'll never understand why you closed Money and didn't recommend a replacement. THANK YOU!</span></p>

<h3> williamtolrud  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw</h2>
                    Microsoft Jigsaw is the only xbox Microsoft game that hangs up all the time.&nbsp; This is very annoying while playing the daily challenges where you are being timed, because the time apparently uses the computer clock, when it hangs for 4 seconds for example
 it takes 4 seconds off the clock when the game comes back, I have also noticed that this game uses the "runtime broker" more than the other xbox games.&nbsp; This does not happen only in the daily challenges but also during playing with my collections.&nbsp; What is
 the solution to this????

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have used the Windows App Troubleshooter and it has come up clean with no issues.&nbsp; I have not made any changes to my PC, this issue has been with the app for a while it just seems that it is getting worse.&nbsp; I have observed while play Microsoft Jigsaw that
 the 'runtime broker' will use between 15 to 20% of the CPU.&nbsp; Plus it seem at the same time the ADs in the game freeze.&nbsp; As I said this is only in Microsoft Jigsaw, none of the other Microsoft games that I play do this. I play Microsoft Solitaire, Microsoft
 Sudoku and Microsoft Mahjong and these games do not exhibit the problems with Microsoft Jigsaw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I performed a reinstall, Microsoft Jigsaw still exhibits the same behavior.&nbsp; The biggest problem is that the game freezes anytime there is a call for an ad.&nbsp; During this call the game will freeze and then the timing for the game continues even during the
 freeze, so if the&nbsp;game is frozen for 4 seconds, 4 seconds is taken off the timer, and if this happens more than 6 times you have at least 24 seconds taken off you time to complete a puzzle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I have found the same thing, and uninstall and reinstall does not help.&nbsp; The NFL ad and subsequent blank ad space is the worst offender.&nbsp; It has been getting worse with the game hanging for a minute at a time and frequently just crashing.&nbsp; One would hope
 MS could get this to play better on its own operating system!&nbsp; I too have wondered if this is a torture device to get us to pay to disable the ads.

<p>It would seem to me that this would be team effort. The problem appears to be with ads. So, somebody is not doing the sharing of time during the game. I will try xbox team to see if they can be a team and work with you on this problem</p>

<p>Here is my latest idea: it is obvious that Microsoft doesn't care about it's users or even it's image, but I'm sure they care about their bottom line, or the department manager promotion chances. So, if someone knows the email address of the advertising
 or marketing of NBA, many of us can send them emails that Microsoft Jigsaw freezes just after their ad appears, and that reflects badly on the NBA, because it frustrates the users and some even believe that it's the NBA's fault. Maybe the NBA will withdraw
 the ad, and that will definitely attract the attention of Microsoft's department manager and they will do something about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, anyone who knows who to contact in the NBA, please answer this post with the email. Many gamers will thank you.</p>

<p>It's me again.</p>
<p>Last night Jigsaw started working without hanging up. I hope it's not a one day wonder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there was no new update or restart requirement in the last few days, a reasonable assumption is that Microsoft fixed the problem on their end. I think that my pervious post about "ransom viruses" spooked their lawyers and they pushed the technical
 people to fix it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Multiple Monitors - Only One Displays Programs</h2>
                    Hi! I am having an issue with multiple monitors on Windows 10. I hooked up a second monitor and set it up, and everything works fine so far. However, whenever I use a program or app, it comes up on the first monitor! For example, if I click on Google Chrome
 in the taskbar of the second monitor, it comes up on the first one! Everything else on the second monitor works fine, like the display, taskbar, and background image. I have already gone into display settings and changed everything, but it still doesn't work.
 The first monitor is hooked up to my PC with an HDMI cable, and the second is through a DVI cable. Any suggestions?

            Hi OOFIRE<br /><br />I am an Independent Advisor here to help<br /><br />Have you tried setting the 2nd monitor as the primary display if you wish for your Windows to open there?

<p>Hi OoFire,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app opening on the main screen is by design, it opens where you last closed it, so if you want it opening on the 2nd screen, move it to the 2nd screen, close it and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving can be done by dragging the app with the mouse or using your Windows-key with left or right arrow on the keyboard</p>
<p>

<p>It sounds like you are extending the display and not mirroring it correct?<br />
<br />
If so, new windows will always open the primary display initially. However you should be able to drag those windows to the display where you wish them to be after they are open</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Then the next time that you open that same program&nbsp; it should appear on the display where it was last open</p>
<p><br />
I am sorry to see that you rated my help negatively. Please let me know if I can help in any other way&nbsp;</p>

<p>Open display settings and identify the monitors . Then rearrange the numbers to mirror them on desk. Then you can define which is main screen or undo sharing screen.</p>

            <p>There is no in place upgrade path from from Windows 7 64 bit to 32 bit. This means you will need to backup whatever personal files you have accumulated since you started using your Windows 7 64 bit PC to an external hard disk or burn them to a blank DVD.
 You cannot use Windows Easy Transfer program when migrating from 64 to 32 bit, <a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
it is not backward compatible</a> with the older architecture. This means, you will need to copy and paste files into a folder on an external hard disk or thumb drive. You need to gather all those application and driver installation disks and prepare to reinstall
 all of them. You can learn more in our Notebooks.com article about how to reinstall Windows
<strong>here </strong></p>
<p><em>Obtaining 32 bit Installation media</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If your computer came with Windows 7 64 bit preinstalled, then you will need to contact the manufacturer of the computer about obtaining a alternate recovery Windows 7 32 bit disk set to reinstall Windows 7 on your computer. The manufacturer might charge
 a small shipping and handling fee. </li><li>Some manufacturers will include the ability to choose either 32 or 64 bit Windows 7 at installation time. This will require that you boot into the Recovery Environment, most manufacturers require that you press the F11 Function Key when you start your computer.
 Please consult the documentation that came with your computer about how to reinstall Windows 7.
</li><li>If you bought a retail box license (upgrade or full version) then you should have both 32 and 64 bit DVDs included in the box.
</li><li>If purchased a digital download of Windows 7 from the Microsoft Store, then you will need to go to the Microsoft Store website (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com</a>), log in with your store account, select Download Options
 and select Windows 7 32 bit and proceed to download. </li><li>If you have an Anytime Upgrade license, you will need first reinstall the base Windows 7 32 bit license, activate it then do the Anytime Upgrade to the particular edition and then reactivate again.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Starting the Installation</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d511%26amp%3bh%3d369" /></a></p>
<p>Boot to the Windows 7 64 bit desktop, insert your Windows 7 32 bit DVD, click <strong>
Run setup.exe </strong>when the Auto Play dialog appears. <em>If you want, you can also boot from the Windows 7 32 bit DVD and also do a custom install. Its just that, it’s a bit more elegant when you simply boot to the desktop and start the installation from
 there. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d386%26amp%3bh%3d290" /></a></p>
<p>Click Yes when the User Account Control window appears</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d505%26amp%3bh%3d360" /></a></p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d504%26amp%3bh%3d350" /></a></p>
<p>Unlike the Windows 7 64 bit disk, you can start the installation from within Windows 7 64 bit because the Setup program in Windows 7 32 bit is a full 32 bit application.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d499%26amp%3bh%3d349" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-6_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d498%26amp%3bh%3d348" /></a></p>
<p>When the setup menu appears, select the custom (advanced) option, select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 32 bit. Click Next.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-6a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-6a_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d498%26amp%3bh%3d365" /></a></p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use
 your previous version of Windows. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. It is still recommended you do a manual backup, because you might explicitly format the drive during setup which will delete all information on the drive. Click
<strong>OK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-7_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d491%26amp%3bh%3d347" /></a></p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-8_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d491%26amp%3bh%3d351" /></a></p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers. Persons running Windows Vista 64 bit, can also use this method when contemplating whether they should upgrade to Windows 7 32 or 64 bit. If you decide to go the other way around by migrating from Windows 7 32 bit to 64 bit, the same principles apply
 with some exceptions. You can use Windows Easy Transfer to backup your personal files and settings and you will need to boot from the Windows 7 64 bit DVD to start the installation.</p>

<p>When working with laptops there is ONLY one way for the battery to work correctly, when you use your battery, you need to use it until&nbsp;it dies, charge, use it till it dies, charge, use it till it dies, etc.</p>
<p>Doing this will actually prolong the 3 1/2 hour battery life.</p>
<p>Although, like any battery after charging it for the gazillionth time, it tends to only last 30 minutes, yes.</p>
<p>So it may be, in fact, time for a new battery.</p>

<p>Actually that's not true any more. With the older Ni-MH batteries, that was the general thought. But with the newer Li-Ion, deep discharge cycles can actually shorten their life.</p>

I really don't know what Apple is using in their iPods (I've never owned one), but all the batteries here are either Li-Ion or Li-Poly:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ipodbatterydepot.com/index.asp?en=google&amp;pl=&amp;no=3&amp;n=specificmatch&amp;at=3.5-ipodbattery&amp;ad=1.6&amp;gclid=CIDJq4mv46ICFRcNDQodVnZn1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ipodbatterydepot.com/index.asp?en=google&amp;pl=&amp;no=3&amp;n=specificmatch&amp;at=3.5-ipodbattery&amp;ad=1.6&amp;gclid=CIDJq4mv46ICFRcNDQodVnZn1g</a></p>
<p>And here's the difference between those two:</p>

<p>And here's one of many articles on recalibrating and initially charging a new battery. Notice it (like a number of other articles) does recommend deep-draining the battery 3 times when new, and then every few months to reclaibrate it, but not every time:</p>

<p>That said, I <strong>wish</strong> I could get 3.5 hours out of my Gateway M6850-FX. I've managed at times to eke 2 hours out of it, but that's the absolute best I've been able to leave it unplugged :-)</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Did you try flushing the dns and resetting the TCP/IP stack in command prompt? Worth a try.
<br />
<br />Click on Start &gt; Type CMD.EXE and run as admin
<br />
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />ipconfig /flushdns
<br />netsh winsock reset catalog
<br />netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log
<br />netsh int ipv6 reset reset.log
<br />netsh winsock reset
<br />netsh winhttp reset proxy
<br />ipconfig /release
<br />ipconfig /renew
<br />
<br />reboot and see if that help.

            Hello. You probably want to contact your ISP for this issue as well. Try this fix however which will give you a  new IP address: 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key and R
<br />
<br />The run box will pop up, in here type cmd
<br />
<br />The cmd (command) box will pop up, in here type ipconfig /release
<br />
<br />Once this has run, type ipconfig /renew
<br />
<br />Once this has finished it should have assigned a new IP address
<br />
<br />

<h3> thehorns_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t print from Word in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>We upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1. When we did, we lost all ability to print from our Canon Imageclass MF4150. We had problems upgrading the driver to a Win10 version. Canon support was helpful, but in the end it failed. We had problems deleting the old
 driver. even with support's help it was unresolved...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer was old and needed a new toner cartridge, so we decided to just start fresh with a new Brother MFC-L2700DW. We installed the driver plug-and-play and shazam, we have a doorstop. It won't print a test page. It won't print from Word. When you ask
 it to print a test page, an error message says that the print queue is full. After going around with Brother support for 3 hours (most on hold), all they have to offer is that it's a problem with the computer. Contact Microsoft...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else encountered a full print queue error on a NEW printer install? Brother is no help at all. The printer is being returned...</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
By battery pack, I'm assuming you mean the power supply of the console. If that's the case please follow the instructions listed below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Try plugging your console’s power supply into a different electrical outlet. Do not use a surge protector.<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>If the power supply light is solid red or flashing orange, unplug the power supply and let it cool for 30 minutes. Then, plug the power supply back into the outlet.<br />
&nbsp; </li></ol>
<p>If your power supply light is still flashing orange, solid red, or unlit, your power supply needs to be replaced. You can&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/en-us/pages/consolemanager.aspx?useraction=requestarepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Order a replacement Xbox 360
 power supply</a></strong>&nbsp;from our Xbox Online Service Center. Console registration is required to replace the power supply under warranty (the power supply warranty is the same as your console warranty).</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;I searched the forum and the internet without success. I am hoping that someone can help me fix this error.</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;the upsidedown&nbsp;yellow triangle with an exclamation point showing in Device Manager for the PS/2 Mouse.&nbsp; I am not using a PS/2 Mouse, I am using a USB Mouse.&nbsp; I have tried to&nbsp;update the driver software and it says it is up to date, I have tried to
 disable and tried to uninstall it&nbsp;by right clicking on the PS/2 Mouse link and also by going into the properties section, but that has not worked.&nbsp; I even tried plugging our old mouse into the&nbsp;port and that did not help either. I have Windows 7 and am using
 an ACER Aspire X3910 computer.&nbsp; Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for your response.&nbsp; The USB mouse is recognized by&nbsp;the system and is&nbsp;working fine and I apologize for the confusion, I had intended to actually put that, but forgot.&nbsp;&nbsp;The toolbar on the bottom of the screen on my computer has a red X with
 my network internet access icon, but&nbsp;there is not internet connection issue and the actual issue&nbsp;is the PS/2 Mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue with the PS/2 Mouse was discovered by my Norton diagnostic program, which I ran because of the&nbsp;red X issue mentioned above,&nbsp;&nbsp;it
 came back with an inoperable hardware notice.&nbsp; The information in Device Manager says: This device is not present, is not working properly, or does not have all its drivers installed. (Code 24).&nbsp; In the properties of the PS/2 mouse under resources there are
 2 I/O Ranges with red circles with the line through the middle.&nbsp; For troubleshooting,&nbsp;&nbsp;I have followed the directions from Norton Diagnostic&nbsp;to fix it, &nbsp;along with the microsoft troubleshooter and mr fix it both of which says there is no problem and&nbsp;I also
 did the software update it said everything was up to date.&nbsp; As for any for any changes made to the computer, a while back I had to do a complete system restore, but once finished everything was fine and no PS/2 mouse issues or anything, this problem&nbsp;just started.&nbsp;
 I hope this information is helpful and again I apologize for any confusion.</p>
<p>Thank you for&nbsp;your assistance, I know I will always find help&nbsp;here.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your continued assistance. I am not having any problems accessing the internet at all and the USB Mouse I am using works with no problem.&nbsp; It is just trying to get rid of the PS/2 Mouse error, I just can't seem to make it go away.&nbsp; The Device
 Manager is saying the the Microsoft PS/2 Mouse This device is not present, is not working properly, or does not have all its drivers installed. (Code 24).</p>
<p>I have tried to update the Driver Software, it says it is up to date, I have tried disabling it and uninstalling it (it being the Microsoft PS/2 Mouse) the error just keeps reappearing.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have never used a&nbsp;PS/2 mouse with this computer ever, only the USB
 Mouse.&nbsp; I do apologize for any confusion, I am not good with the terminology. I really appreciate your patience and assistance. I know it will get resolved.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi and thank you for your response and I apologize for the delay in responding I&nbsp;caught some sort of bug that is going around and have not been on the computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have tried both disable and uninstall to remove the device in device manager, but it did not work.&nbsp; For whatever reason it is recognizing something that is not there and does not exist (in fact has never existed on this computer).&nbsp; I am sure there is a
 way to remove it once and for all, I just don't know what that is.&nbsp; I would really hate to have to do the system restore again, hopefully that won't be needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for continued assistance, I know it will get solved eventually.</p>
