<h2>            I received a call from someone claiming to be Microsoft.</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Phone call re hacking problem </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dad received a call yesterday from a man with an Indian accent stating that he was from Microsoft and calling to warn me that 60% of microsoft users computers were being hacked. He said it was just a courtesy call. It took me a while to understand what
 he was talking about and he was getting frustrated with me. He didn't ask for anything - not access to the computer or money for anti virus software. I was confused as although my dad has a computer it is not connected to the internet.&nbsp;When I told him this&nbsp;he
 abruptly ended the phone call. This&nbsp;happened in the UK. Just thought I'd post in case anyone encounters something similar. After reading other posts on here&nbsp;I presume&nbsp;it was a scam and&nbsp;a follow up call from them may have been the next step. Hope this warns
 people. &nbsp;</p>

Yes it is a SCAM!<br />

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors existed on your<br />
computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or worse to steal your identity.
<br />
<br />
Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make unsolicited<br />
phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

<h2>            Samsung SMT-H3362 power command doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work on set-up</h2>
                    
<p>My console can "talk" to my Samsung Smart TV just fine (mute &amp; power) but when it comes to setting up the Samsung STB is says it detects a signal but it is just a black screen. Also while setting it up the STB the power command does not work. My model number
 is not listed either from the list. My cable provider is Brighthouse Networks (Time Warner). This is really frustrating considering I haven't been able to get the full experience of my console.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            removing foreign languages from files</h2>
                    <p>Can I remove other language files from my system from those files that contain them.</p>
<p>There seems to be quite a few of these files / updates / drivers etc that contain numerous copies of&nbsp; the same information just in other languages that Im sure would free up quite a bit of space.</p>
<p>If so is there a way of removing all from that folder and only keeping the english ones without having to check each off individually and maybe adjusting a setting for future use to just install the english versions. (I assume that this info does exist somewhere
 altho&nbsp;I dont recall ever&nbsp;havent run across it - hence my asking)</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<h2>            monitor blacks out after the windows xp screen__</h2>
                    
<p>My xp computer starts up and gets past the windows xp screen.&nbsp; Then it goes to a black screen and stays there. What can I do?</p>
<p>I know the machine is on because I can start it in safe mode. I have scanned for viruses and found none.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reseated the video card, swapped monitors. Problem still exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I backed up my data then I have used&nbsp;my windows xp cd to fix mbr but no difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have this problem with a different computer connected to this monitor.</p>
<p>Help!!!</p>

<p><span>Hi Abbeda,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you boot into safe mode the display card drivers are not loaded on the computer, there is a possibility that the display
 card driver is corrupt.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you boot the computer into<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enable VGA video

 Enable Low-resolution video (640*480) option, and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: In Low-resolution
 Mode, your system display and Desktop will look and perform differently than in Normal Mode. This is only temporary.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Haris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned this caused due to permission related issues, I suggest you to try the following steps to take ownership of a drive or a folder and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><span>Taking ownership of a folder or drive from explorer:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the file or folder or drive on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer.<br />
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on file or folder and select “Properties” from Context Menu.<br />
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on "Security" tab.<br />
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “Advanced” button.<br />
5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click on "Owner" tab in Advanced Security Settings for User windows.<br />
6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Edit Button and select user from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list.<br />
7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on other users or groups. Enter name of user/group and click ok.<br />
8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select User/group and click apply and ok. Check “Replace owner on subcontainers and objects” if you have files and folder within selected folder.<br />
9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed.<br />
10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Owner name must have changed.<br />
11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click Ok to exist from Properties windows.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have taken the ownership of file or folder or drive next part comes is granting permissions to that file/folder or object.<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> elias mlayah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unhandled Exception has occured in your application - String was not recognized as a valid date Time</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a small software to generate key cards for an electronic locking system.</p>
<p>I'm connected to a server machine (running with windows 10) where I can access the database.</p>
<p>From the reception computer (running with windows 10) when I run the software and when I select Check-in I have always the following message :</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Unhandled Exception has occurred in your application</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you click Continue ............</strong></p>
<p><strong>String was not recognized as a valid Date Time&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that I have the same software installed on the server machine and it works without any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me?</p>

<h2>            Cortana Connected Home with SmartThings</h2>
                    <p>I have my sensors named a certain way in SmartThings, and would really like Cortana's integration with it to be better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish there was a way to "map" my existing devices on SmartThings to names Cortana can recognize. I don't want to rename my devices on SmartThings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, the only control in SmartThings is to enable/disable "Allow Microsoft to control your devices"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Cortana, all I can do is Connect/Disconnect SmartThings.</p>

<p>I have this setup as well. The only devices I have setup in SmartThings are lights. Cortana does recognize the devices by their name in SmartThings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I just learned from a similar post is that the room names in SmartThings do not currently work. However if you name your devices with the room name as a prefix, it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have 'Table Lamp' and 'Floor Lamp' setup as devices in SmartThings. I added both devices to a room named 'Living Room'. I can say 'Hey Cortana, turn on the table lamp' or 'Hey Cortana, turn on the floor lamp' and that works. I cannot say 'Hey
 Cortana, turn on the Living Room lights'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They way to get this working is to forget about the room grouping. Simply name your lamps 'Living Room Table Lamp' and 'Living Room Floor Lamp'. Cortana will recognize that both devices include 'Living Room' as part of the device name. Now I can say' Hey
 Cortana, turn on the living room lights' and it works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

Yes, I discovered the same thing. I name every device beginning with the name of the room. I'm using a SmartThings, Insteon, and a Hue hub and Cortana controls individual devices and hold rooms without any problems.

<p>I agree. I can only use the exact device name within SmartThings for&nbsp;Cortana. However,&nbsp;I setup a Google Dot for my daughter and the google app interacts with Samsung's SmartThings too. Google's app imports all the devices from SmartThings and allows you
 to add them to certain rooms in the app itself. So I can say, "Turn On Bose In the Living Room", where the device name is Bose in the SmartThings App associated to the Living Room in the Google Dot App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana needs to have an extended app as an "in-between" to associate devices to rooms outside of another Hub application.&nbsp; -- Just my opinion.

</p><p>That's exactly my setup. It is the only thing on the hub at the moment so I thought I just needed to learn how to address it differently.&nbsp; Have you found any formal statement on this?</p>

<p>This was working for me up until two weeks ago . All of my kitchen lights are prefixed with kitchen in the name. (I made that change based on this post ).</p>
<p>Know if only recognizes one of the devices. I know have to do each of the three groups individually. Even though i have 3 lights on a chandelier named kitchen table 1,2,3 and i can say "Turn off table lights" and all three will turn off.</p>

<h2>            HP Beats Audio Control Panel-IDT sound -- 64-bit Windows 10 Home upgrade</h2>
                    I just upgraded from 64-bit Win 8.1 to Win 10. Although I got IDT sound on my PC and it is &nbsp;playing perfectly, I can't get
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">HP Beats Audio Control Panel</span> to work. It loads up; however, Beats' sound effects, in the control panel under the l<strong>istening experience</strong> tab (to use the equalizer universally, and test the speakers...
 etc.), do not work nor affect the the sound at all since the upgrade.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried uninstalling the driver, restarting PC, installing the latest driver, restarting but no avail. I also went to HP support, but they don't have any updates for the control panel, Any Idea on how to get it working again?<br />
<br />
Thank you.

            Thank you for your reply. I tried compatibility mode, but it still did not work. I even tried tried re-installing the original IDT driver that came with PC, from the HP website. However, It produced an error with the licensing since the OS was already
 different. As far as HP, they're just directing customers to Win 10 update. They do not seem to even be working on fix, which makes me wonder about their new products that already have Win 10 installed. Hopefully, the problem will be fixed with the next Win
 10 anniversary update., although I doubt that the problem is with the OS. &nbsp;I think HP should make an effort to provide an update for their software.

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post here, as I am facing the very exact problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some search in Google, and it seems that the OS indeed is the problem here, as W10 might be refusing to get Registry entries overrated by the IDT program, so Windows keep his audio config rather than allow the Beats program do his magic with
 out audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly for us, the costumers, nor HP neither Microsoft will provide a fix for this rather than suggest to get another computer or to contact another company...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, I will keep searching on the web, as this problem seems to be common.</p>

            <p>Hi, Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a way around it if you haven't performed a Win 10 clean-install. Don't download the original audio driver for your PC/laptop from the HP website--during installment, it may detect Win 10 and give you an error message regarding OS compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>HAVE NOT</strong></span> performed a clean-install of Win 10, follow the following instructions:-</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Create a Restore Poin</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">t</span> just in case something goes wrong.</li><li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Unplug</strong></span> any audio devices connected to your system.</li><li>Uninstall and delete the current audio driver via Windows Device Manager (not at the Audio inputs &amp; outputs at the top of the menu, but down at Sound, Video, and game controllers. Make sure you only right-click on the Audio driver and nothing else, and
 then, Uninstall.)</li><li>In Control Panel to uninstall programs, check if your audio driver is listed there, and uninstall it as well.</li><li>If you know where the audio driver folder was installed, delete the folder <strong>
IDT </strong>(check under the Windows OS directory--Program Files and/or&nbsp; Program Files (x86).</li><li>Now, make sure you <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">disconnect your system from the internet</span></strong>. Restart your system and give it enough time to boot-up completely
</li><li>Click on File Explorer, on the left, scroll down to OS (C: ) and click on it.</li><li>On the right, look for a folder called <strong>SWSETUP</strong>. That is where your original HP software drivers and updates are installed. Open the folder by double-clicking it.</li><li>Look for folder <strong>DRV </strong>and open it. Look for folder <strong>IDT
</strong>and open it, then open the folder <strong>IDTHDAudio</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Again, make sure that you unplugged your speakers and/or headphones and mics
<strong>src</strong>.</li><li>Now Double-click the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">file</span> <strong>
IDTSetup.exe </strong>to install the original audio driver. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Do not</strong></span> rush with restarting the system to give the drive enough time to initialize the ports.
<p>Now Beats audio should work as before; however, each time you change the equalizer settings, you have to close any media players running and restart them again to get the desired sound. Also, on the left side in Beats Audio where it says Music, Movie etc..
 (depending on your driver), those setting will work up to a certain Audio Sample Rate. They may not work at higher sample rates. For microphones, If you set up the sample rate too high, you may not be able to actually record sound even though windows sound
 meters will show that mic is receiving sound--the recordings will be muted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you out. <br />

            I have also tried everything possible as quinko has done and nothing. since the win 10 upgrade ive also lost my surround sound. win 8 worked perfect with beats audio and my 5 speaker system. now I have only 2 speakers witch is a problem for me because
 I do lots of recording on my pc. I'm a musician. id like to add also no one told me that when I down loaded win 10, I would loose the use of my recovery disks that I just bought from HP . so I could go back to win 8 .and now I'm stuck with useless disks. HP
 seems to have no concern for fixing beats&nbsp; audio or its customers , so this is the first and last hp pc ill ever buy.

            <p>Sorry to hear that it did not work for you. <strong>Regarding IDT sound</strong>, There are two more steps you can try:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Make sure to close all media players/recorders that you may have running, and go to the sound properties from the system tray,&nbsp; under the "advanced" tab of your both your "Playback devices"/speaker, and "Recording devices"/stereo mix or mic, and make
 sure to set sample rate to 24 bit, 48000 Hz.&nbsp; Do not click on "Test" in the properties window and do not launch any audio/video apps. Restart your system. If that doesn't work, try a lower sample rate setting.<br />
<br />
2. If the above did not work for all your speakers, then you may have to install windows Generic sound driver. To do so, you need to first disconnect from the internet. Second, completely uninstall and remove the IDT driver from your system (Instructions 1
 through 6 only, in my reply to CesarMontes).&nbsp; While still being disconnected from the internet, restart your system and wait for it to completely finish rebooting Windows 10 before connecting to the internet. Now, you should be on Windows 10 generic audio
 driver, and hopefully all your speakers will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Win 10 generic audio driver does not support Stereo Mix.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Regarding your HP Recovery DVD, </strong>You can still use them to go back to Windows 8, but first, you must go to your system bios, and change the order of the boot devices by selecting the DVD/disk drive as your primary/first device to boot your
 system and <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">saving</span></strong> your new settings.&nbsp; Now, put your HP system disk in your drive, restart your system while pressing and holding ESC or F10 depending on your system until the pop up window appears,
 and select&nbsp; boot manager or recovery to boot your system from the DVD.<br />
<br />
Note: Your DVD may boot your system to Win 8, and you may want to upgrade it to Win 8.1 via Windows store app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope something of what I wrote above will work out for you.</p>

            Probably I found the way to solve the problem, The IDT app is not working because windows is using the common audio driver, so you can install manually the driver by looking into c:\programs\IDT\ for the correct driver.<br />
I didn't reboot but now I can see that windows recognize IDT driver.<br />
For the question about HP install file, I think it is related to the security system of the new windows 10, which blocks not recognized authors and certificates. Microsoft hast to fix it, because if we put the cursor on the file it shows an authorized author,
 in this case "Hewlett Packard".<br />

<h2>            Win7 laptop won&#39;t recognize 2GB camera SD card. Pls help.</h2>
                    I recently switched to a new computer with Win7 (bc my old computer died) and I can't get it to read my 2GB SD memory card from my camera. I don't know the brand of the card but it worked fine on my old Vista computer. Or maybe this is a computer issue
 and not a Windows issue???

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. What exactly happens when you try to connect that SD card? Do you get any error message?<br />
2. Are you able to use any other SD cards on the computer?<br />
3. Are you using the card reader to read that SD card?<br />
4. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Check if your SD card is getting detected on device manager.</p>
<p>To open device manager:<br />
a.&nbsp;Click on start button, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.<br />
b.&nbsp;Search for the name of the device</p>
<p>If the device is not getting detected in device manager, then check if it is hidden device.<br />
a.&nbsp;Click show hidden devices under View<br />
b.&nbsp;Expand all the nods under device manager<br />
c.&nbsp;There would be many grayed out entries in device manager uninstall all the grayed out entries under all the nods and then restart the computer and plug the external device to the computer and check if it works</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check if the SD card is getting detected in disk management.<br />
a.&nbsp;Click on start button, type diskmgmt.msc and press enter.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Check if that card gets detected on some other windows 7 computer.</p>

            <p>I did everything, and there were no grays under any of the nods in the device manager. There is ONE thing that appears to be out of place. Under "Other Devices" There's a nod with "Unknown device" I clicked it and when I tried to update my driver, it popped
 up a box proclaiming that nothing was detected.</p>

<h2>            &#91;WINDOWS 7,8&#93;&#91;SLEEP&#47;WAKE&#47;BATTERY DRAIN ISSUES&#93;POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS - LAPTOP AND TABLET USERS</h2>
                    After a mind-blowing amount of forum posts I've read regarding windows 7 and 8 sleep/wake/battery drain power issues, I decided to write this so maybe it'll help someone troubleshoot their tablet/laptop. Moderators/MS people - read GENERAL REMARKS section,
 you'll find it a very constructive albeit bitter feedback on windows 7 and 8 power issues. Users - straight off to TROUBLESHOOTING section lower on.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>GENERAL REMARKS - WINDOWS 7 AND 8 POWER MANAGEMENT, SLEEP PREVENTION REQUESTS, ISOLATING FAULTY DRIVERS/APPS/SERVICES&nbsp;
</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Funny thing is - such issues may not be any OEM/driver vendor fault at all. I'd say it's rather irrational how windows in organized here as a tablet or even a laptop OS in general . When I push the sleep button, it means that I intend the device to sleep
 - it's unacceptable that after a few hours of "sleep" I find my tablet, supposedly "sleeping" with a 0% on the unreplacable battery, which by now is physically damaged due to prolonged exposure to low charge.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because some people have thought that maybe we should prevent the device from sleeping when there's an audio stream open, a remote client, whatever. Well, maybe it's good for a desktop pc that has grid power, but on a battery powered device like a laptop
 or tablet, A LOT of people bump into really infuriating issues of sleep/wake/battery drain - and from what I see on various forums (tabletpcreview, lenovo and samsung support, technet, ms answers), it's really, really bad.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I push the power button, the device has to sleep. Period. Allowing "devices" or drivers to prevent the tablet from sleeping when I clearly want it to sleep is insane and causes tremendous power issues on mobile device. You should pop a monit every
 dang time a driver/service/whatever wants to be able to prevent sleep, and ask ME for permission to allow this thing to drain my battery. If not - FORCE sleep.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What am I supposed to tell to quite a lot of people who ask me about impressions on using a windows 8 tablet? It's nice, but the driver situation sucks big time.. pass on it. And the OS itself, even though has a nice touch overlay, is just a desktop OS
 pretending to work nice on a battery powered device. It's not. It turns out that mobile power mangement is a big time failure.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This issues have been going on since windows 7 on laptops. And now it's windows 8 tablets, just this time you wreck your battery, you can't replace it and all the money you splashed on an expensive windows 8 tablet goes to trash. I'll be just honest. Samsung
 support is completely incompetent on such issues. I also messaged Lenovo support and I hope they will take this more seriously. However, it's not just one driver, one problem. It's a much more general case, it's how the OS is organized and how it deals with
 sleep preventing requests from various sources. This sleep/wake/battery drain is like number 1 problem category with windows 8 tablets I see so far. Microsoft needs to make changes in the OS or the OEMs will be under a spanking shower from the consumers for
 a long, long time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MS has software design guidelines concerning power management, but relying on hudreds of companies to provide intelligently written software is like praying for a miracle. Won't happen. MS should be smarter than just putting up a webpage saying: 1) write
 smart software 2) if you don't, we don't care, not our fault anyway.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There should be an OS mechanism to prevent such battery drain, manage sleep prevention rights and request, monitor battery power usage per app, service, single driver - so as to allow the user to find the power problem cause, isolate the messed up driver/service/app/whatever
 and shut it down/disable it. On a tablet PC, battery life is vital, so it would be better to ask me, as a user, every time, do I want to allow this service or that device/driver to prevent the computer from sleep. Windows 8 manages this behind my back, and
 then it shows me an infuriating surprise of completely drained and physically damaged irreplacable battery. Like it's the user's job to figure which one of a hundred drivers and programs I need to work could cause problem - prior to actually installing it.
 Just set up some ground rules and force all those sloppy partners to comply.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And there was not a single word in the manual of my windows 8 tablet, on all the things I wrote down below, that affect battery life, that can completely mess the user experience and physically damage the battery - even though this is OS-design-as-bug
 that has been going for years now, since windows 7 at least.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You know, it's like windows computers run just fine - unless you actualy use them. Take it out of a box, runs pretty, install some stuff you need for work, tweak some settings and you're in a mess, bro. Truth is - power settings, sleep settings are a brothel
 and MS should finally set some ground rules here. Not just guidelines. Ground f.....g rules.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There's a thing with IE10 addons - if they impact startup time of the browser too much, a monit appears, "this addon slows down the browser, do you want to shut it down?" And usually, h..l yes I want. Some of these install in a sneaky way, even without
 asking me for permission. Such things happen. So it's intelligent software design from the IE10 team to let me, as a user, know about this and enable me to easily fix this.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MS is playing dumb, pretending it's not their problem, but the truth is, if windows is to work on a tablet like it should, sleep preventing mechanism must be managed in a more strict way. Not only each time an app/service/drives that is not vital asks
 for a permission to run in the background, ask me. Ask me till I'm fed up with answering, then ask me if you're not to ask me ever again. Example - how the h..l I'm supposed to know that enabling public folders can prevent sleep? And it can (srvnet issue,
 described lower on). Or windows media player sharing. Or it can be crappy drivers from a subcontractor, how am I supposed to find and isolate these? There's a "Network and Sharing Center", there should be "Battery Juice and Sleep Control Center" in the control
 panel. I'm serious.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MS has time to write some stupid finger painting apps ("Fresh Paint") but it doesn't have time to seriously and responsibly address issues with battery and sleep that are going on for years now. So now MS partners are selling +700$ tablets that can't even
 sleep. It's the sloppy driver producer fault? Nope. It's the OEM fault? Nope. It's MS fault? Nope. It's just a brothel, that's all. But of all these MS is in the most capable position to fix this by setting ground rules on power management and forcing them
 down partners' throats.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You know, people read reviews these days. I knew about a bunch of issues with mine ativ 500T before I bought it, but I wanted it nevertheless cause I decided that with such issues I can live. I have serious doubts that I'd have bought it if I knew about
 the power/sleep issues. Spending three days troubleshooting power management? Yeah, nice commercial.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now please pass this on to some software designer, and if he says that such control mechanisms and this whole battery juice monitoring and control center are unnecessary or "we don't have time to do this" - do me a favour, punch this guy in the face. Best
 regards from a user perespective.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I hope everyone who has the same problem as I, will find something here that can possibly help and that will make your device usable.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>TROUBLESHOOTING - GENERAL - TABLETS AND LAPTOPS, WINDOWS 7 AND 8&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Quite possibly you have a driver or service that prevents the device from sleeping.
<b>Nice explanation here with possible solution (example)</b> - <a href="http://www.jasonhartman.net/2012/06/windows-7-wont-go-to-sleep-mode-audio.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.jasonhartman.net/2012/06/windows-7-wont-go-to-sleep-mode-audio.html&nbsp;</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Run command prompt on admin priviliges - start menu or screen, cmd, run as admin. In cmd, powercfg /energy - this will write you a html file to windows/system32 with report on power issues - cut this file, paste somewhere else (you can have problems opening
 it from windows/system32) - look for any red highlighted error sections there, those prevent sleep.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On ativ 500T and Vivo Tab, be sure to disconnect the keyboard dock before running cmd, powercfg /energy.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Possible solutions here - you can bump on "srvnet" (remote clients and windows media player sharing) - try going to Network and Sharing Center in control panel and disabling any sharing in advanced options (left menu). Also, services.msc, here disable
 windows media player sharing service.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, in my case it was Intel SST Audio Device/Realtek I2S (these two are interconnected somehow) - it means an audio stream is open/not closed properly. Example - google voice addon in chrome can prevent your pc from sleeping - but it could be anything,
 adobe flash content in the browser, app - like Steam, or an alternative virtual keyboard for example - TouchPal for windows 8 is fine though, checked this one, it's all clear. More - VLC, file sharing apps...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For this Intel SST audio device, simple workaround is to shut down volume to zero% - more sophisticated solution here -
<a href="http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-slate-tablets/Poor-Connected-Standby-Battery-Life-on-TPT2/m-p/1105755#M23740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-slate-tablets/Poor-Connected-Standby-Battery-Life-on-TPT2/m-p/1105755#M23740&nbsp;
</a></div>
<div>Also, in control panel, device manager, in properties window of any device, make sure there is no device that there is allowed to prevent the computer from sleeping. Example: device manager, sound,video and game controllers, Realtek I2S, right click, properties,
 power management, "allow computer to turn off this device to save power" (YES), "allow this device to wake computer" (NO).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>For a list of devices that can prevent sleep:&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>cmd, powercfg /devicequery wake_armed</div>
<div><b>Even if you have no devices that can prevent sleep, you can still get sleep prevention requests!&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>For a list of requests for preventing sleep:&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>cmd, powercfg -requests&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><b>For a list of wake timers (those can automatically wake your computer too):&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>cmd, powercfg -waketimers</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><b>For information on last wake and it's causes (if the cause info is available):&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>cmd, powercfg -lastwake</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>And again, report on power management with possible culprits highlighted in red:&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>cmd, powercfg /energy&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>To override sleep prevention requests (case sensitive) - example on the 'srvnet':</b></div>
<div>cmd,&nbsp;<strong>"powercfg -requestsoverride driver \FileSystem\srvnet system" - might not stay after reboot.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Btw</strong>, <b>powercfg command line options</b> -&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc748940(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc748940(v=ws.10).aspx</a></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>To sum up - possible culprits and solutions:&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>- audio device - in my case, shutting down the volume to zero% removes the sleep prevention hook and allows the tablet to sleep&nbsp;
</div>
<div>- srvnet - windows media player sharing, remote desktop, public folders - disable all these + windows media player sharing service in services.msc. Also, being member of a network homegroup can be an issue.</div>
<div>- adobe flash content in the browser - close the tab, preferably with the browser itself&nbsp;</div>
<div>- google voice addon in the browser&nbsp;</div>
<div>- disable google chat on iGoogle - remove it from iGoogle (if iGoogle even still exists? I'm basing this on an old blog post)&nbsp;</div>
<div>- basically, could be anything - infuriating, huh? And this is exactly what I mean by unintelligent (euphemism) operating system design.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>TROUBLESHOOTING - TASK SCHEDULER, UPDATES, ANTIVIRUS SCANS ETC</b></div>
<div><b>If you have huge battery juice loses during the night, on sleep or "connected standby"</b> (using "" cause it's just marketing BS not working as it should) -
<b>it's possible you have a scheduled task in the Task Scheduler </b>- a task that kicks in an then repeats regularly the whole night - and possibly one that was auto-added by some program without you even knowing it's there....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Open Task Scheduler and look at the list. It could be google update (got chrome?) that kicks in at 01:00 at night and then repeats every hour even if you're on battery, and EVEN IF YOU'RE SHUTDOWN. Could be scheduled antivirus scan (say, MS security essentials
 - here, you may have to disable scanner completely) or sth else.

<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>In the particular case of the new windows 8 tablets based on intel clovertrail SOC - quite oftentimes sleep/wake/battery drain issues are related to faulty (crappy) drivers. For the rollbacks suggested, I provide skydrive links lower on for the older,
 suposedly better versions.&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div>- bluetooth - on ativ 500T - solution is to rollback from 12.0.0.3600 to 12.0.0.2200 - a long but valuable discussion here -

</div>
<div>- sd card - on ativ 500T - "solution" is to not use sd card...&nbsp;</div>
<div>- intel graphics drivers ("Internal VGA Intel") - on Ativ500T, Vivo Tab TF810 - solution is to rollback from 9.14.3.1128 to 9.14.3.1087 - the referenced discussion on bluetooth also has intel graphics driver talk on page 2.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- in case of TPT2, somehow it's often not drivers, but rather that old thing with sleep prevention management in windows - so basically the stuff from TROUBLESHOOTING - GENERAL section - and TPT2 people, you might want to have a look at this discussion

</div>
<div><b>A suggestion that will possibly save your tablet's battery from irreversible physical damade due to crappy OS sleep/wake/juice management&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>Go to control panel, power options, whatever plan you're using - change plan settings, change advanced power settings, here - in batery, low battery level 20%, low battery action - hibernate, critical battery level 15%, critical battery action - shutdown.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You should not allow you battery to be either completel discharged or completely charged, it causes physical damage to the electrodes of li-ion/li-poly (the same thing) batteries. Just stay somewhere in between and do not allow the charge to go very low
 or very high, and it will hold bigger capacity for longer time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is in case you think you solved sleep/wake/power drain issues, but your tablet can still wake at night all by itself cause of some app/driver/service/whatever, and it will pop in and out of sleep the whole night, doing some stupid tasks, consuming
 battery power so as to give you a morning surprise of 1% on the battery and believe me, you don't want to see this happen to you.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>FURTHER SUGGESTIONS ON DIAGNOSING POWER DRAIN ISSUES</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Task manager CPU stats. Wipe these stats, reboot the computer, not use it but let is go right into connected standby, leave it for a few hours and see what's showing in task manager or even better - sysinternals process explorer (task manager on steroids).
 It can be not very conclusive though. The problem with this, this method can be only partially efficient at finding issues caused not by apps/services, but rather by drivers.</li><li>Event Viewer - any power/wireless connectivity/cpu related logs from the period your device was in connected standby. Just filter by source and time.</li><li>DISABLING SERVICES - IMPORTANT - sometimes, even if you disable a service in services.msc (task manager 'services' tab&gt;open services), it can REMAIN active. Google Update is an example. I disabled its activation tasks in Task Scheduler, disabled it in services.msc
 AND STILL there's one thing you need to do - run&gt;msconfig, here 'services' tab, filter by all non-microsoft and preferably disable most non-microsoft here. There's also googleupdate here... On my Smart PC 500T I left Intel thermal framework, SamsungConfiguration,
 SW-Update and TabletServiceISD.</li><li>I also suggest, if you can, disable wireless connectivity for sleeping. If it's an issue with the wireless driver it might not solve your problem, but it might decrease it (and the broadcomm wireless driver found on clovertrail devices apparently is the
 cause of many connected standby issues..).</li></ul>

</p><p>I'd like to bump this thread too. Every single windows 8.1 device I've used has this battery drain and I've spoken to various people and they said they've noticed it but as they charge their devices a lot they can deal with it. I, on the other hand do work
 then put my laptop into sleep mode overnight as these atoms aren't the quickest from a cold boot. Overnight on my Asus X205 which has either a 34 or 38Whr battery, it&nbsp;goes from about 90% to 10% overnight. That is a monumental amount of battery drain and waste
 of electricity especially when in use that laptop has a 10-11 hour battery life! I've only used Windows 8.1 tablets and laptops with Atom Z-Series&nbsp;processors so haven't a clue how the others are.
</p>
<p>I got round it by disabling ConnectedStandby in the registry and now my W8.1 laptop sleeps like windows 7 laptops did. However on a Z3735G tablet, it takes too long to wake from sleep and defeats the point of having a tablet so I just returned it.</p>
<p>It's great for your relatives that it seems to work for but unfortunately too many people are having this problem and Microsoft are not willing to help at all.</p>

            <p>I'm not an Apple fanboy, very far from it, but my MacBook pro goes to sleep and resumes right where I left off with no delay and maybe 2% battery loss overnight.</p>
<p>Win8.1 is fantastic on my custom built pc and kudos to Microsoft for managing to make a full desktop OS work on these very low powered devices, it's remarkable how they did it. It's just this battery loss that lets it down big time and makes it unusable
 for me unless disabling Connected Standby.</p>

            Hello, just to share my experience.&nbsp;I own <span>
ASUS VivoTab Note 8 (M80TA). Works in Standby </span>mostly <span>
as it should but sometimes battery&nbsp;gets completely&nbsp;drained out from almost full state only by being in Standby. Disabling Windows Automatic Update&nbsp;helped and also setting Realtek I2S properties in power management, "allow this device to wake computer" to (NO).&nbsp;Another
 workaround&nbsp;is to use the Flight mode with&nbsp;disabled Wi-Fi connection. But the best is to use Hibernation when I want to be sure to save the battery, which of course&nbsp;will disable notifications, messengers, etc...&nbsp;Another issue is playing music with display-off
 that gets device into sleep after the currently played&nbsp;song finishes from the playlist.&nbsp;Hope to get this solved soon. Bye &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

            <p>My Nextbook 10.1 Tablet with windows 8.1 would not wake up this morning, even after plugging in the charger. I found how to do it in another thread. Holding the Power Button and the Volume Button for about 5 seconds did the job. I was concerned that the
 battery was totally dead.</p>
<p>I had left the tablet alone for about 10 days due to never ending frustration with the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several suggestions in the 1st post in this thread. Is there a concise list of the modifications I need to make to prevent the devices desire to destroy itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Holding the power button down for 10 seconds causes a "Hard Shutdown" according to the manual.</p>
<p>Is that all that is needed to prevent power drain while it is turned off?</p>

            Hello Bob-M2, if you do not plan to use your tablet for a longer period than a few days I suggest you do a shutdown. Still a monthly recharge is needed for the battery to be fit. Regards, Sven

            After a few months and MS updates I found out battery life in stand by mode greatly improved on my tablet. Still it's not possible to listen to music with the screen-off.

    <title>Win 10 recovery drive fails on 32 GB flash drive--are unneeded files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmhtc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 recovery drive fails on 32 GB flash drive--are unneeded files being copied&#63;</h2>
                    <p>trying to do a recovery drive.&nbsp; Following all the instructions, including using a flash drive that's at least 32 GB.&nbsp; The system churns for 20 - 30 minutes or so and then fails with the message that there's not enough space on the USB flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the flash drive it's got less than 1GB left on it after the failed attempt to create the recovery drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried this three times and got the same result each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there some files that I should remove from my system before creating the recovery drive?&nbsp; 32GB seems an outlandish amount of space to require!</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I recently did a system refresh wiping out everything on the drive and then reloading my software and files.&nbsp; Don't know if that's relevant or not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern and will assist you to resolve this issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the methods given below and then try to create recovery partitions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Perform Clean Boot. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. Check this issue in clean boot state.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press<strong> Windows key + X key.</strong> And select<strong> Run.</strong></span></span></li><li><span>Type msconfig in the&nbsp;Run box and hit Enter.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Services</strong> tab of the <strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then tap or click <strong>
Disable all</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the <strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong>Open Task Manager</strong>. </span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Close Task Manager.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the <strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong>OK</strong>, and then restart the computer. </span></li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer
 to Normal startup mode.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Refer the article and check if helps: </strong></span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-recovery-drive-for-reinstalling/58df9c7d-84de-4652-9952-8bac34abc6c5"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How

            <p>Hi Arun and thank very much for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both methods and neither one solved the problem.&nbsp; I've attached an image of the message I get when the recovery drive creation fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 32GB USB drive is almost full after the failure, which seems odd.&nbsp; Why would the recovery drive need anything close to 32GB?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else you can suggest?&nbsp; </p>

    <title>How to cancel Windows 10 upgrade after installation failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaylenastasi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to cancel Windows 10 upgrade after installation failure</h2>
                    <p>I've waited for my free Windows 10 upgrade (currently running Windows 8.1 with no problems). It finally came through, and about 10% through the second (black-background) reboot the computer just went black -- did not restart, just completely black-screened
 and shut down. I wound up having to restart, and it immediately went into "Restoring previous version of Windows" mode. It then black-screened again, and on the second attempt to restart, Windows 8.1 restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently laid up with a broken back and don't have the ability to deal with computer issues right now (I'm not even supposed to be sitting upright for more than ten minutes at a time) so wish to completely cancel my Windows 10 upgrade. I have already
 clicked the "agreement", though and no longer see a "cancel upgrade" link anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have "hidden" the update to Windows 10 in Windows Updates, but want to eliminate it completely, and also remove all of the temporary set-up files from my PC. I'll be buying a new computer in the spring, most likely, anyway, so will just get Windows 10
 then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide SIMPLE steps to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Permanently cancel any upgrade reservation to Windows 10</p>
<p>2. Permanently remove the update from Windows Updates so it leaves my 8.1 alone</p>
<p>3. Permanently and cleanly remove all temporary update files from my computer to restore the space they are hogging up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. I hope you can reply quickly with steps that won't have me tied to the computer for hours, so my doctors don't yell at me. ::smile::</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Gayle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What you need to do here first of all is to change the way you receive updates. With Automatic Updates enabled, the operating system will reinstall the nagware prompt which is KB3035583 after you uninstall it which will be a step we'll take in a minute.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So proceed as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click the Action Center icon on the taskbar and go to "Windows Update".</li><li>In the left hand menu, click "Change settings".</li><li>Change it from Automatic Updates to "<em>Download updates but let me choose whether to install them</em>".</li><li>Click "Save Changes" and then click "Control Panel Home".&nbsp;</li><li>Go to "Programs and Features" and click the link to "View installed updates".</li><li>Copy/paste KB3035583 into the Search field top right and when it appears below, right click it and select "Uninstall".This is a large installation so uninstalling it can take several minutes.<br />
</li><li>Reboot next and then go back to Windows Update again. </li><li>Since you now have different WU settings, click the link if there's any which are awaiting your approval which will take you to the menu where you can decide what to install.</li><li>If you see KB3035583 in the list, right click it and select "<strong>Hide update</strong>". The box you normally have to checkmark to select an update will turn grey and when you exit WU, those files will be sent to the repository called "Restore hidden
 updates".You can restore any updates which have been hidden in there at any time by clicking the link, making your selection and then selecting "Restore".</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The next step is to make a registry change which will prevent Windows 10 from downloading and installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hit Windows key + R to launch the Run command, type: <strong>regedit </strong>
and click OK. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE --&gt; SOFTWARE --&gt; Microsoft --&gt; Windows --&gt; &nbsp; CurrentVersion --&gt; WindowsUpdate --&gt; Auto Update --&gt; OSUpgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click the OSUpgrade key (which looks like a folder) and then in the right hand pane you should be able to see four values called respectively:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">AllowOSUpgrade</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">KickoffDownload </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">KickoffSource </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">OSUpgradeInteractive </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Some or all of these will have a value of 1. You need to change those to a <strong>
0</strong> like you see in the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/245c89f7-7124-470a-bf91-529226075833" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>To change a registry value, right click it and go to <strong>Modify</strong>. In the
<strong>Value field</strong> at the bottom, change the figure 1 into a <strong>0</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click OK and Windows will add the 0x00000000 (0) itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it's already a 0 then you don't have to touch it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, you need to create a value. To do that, right click a blank part of the right hand pane and choose New --&gt; DWORD with the name
<strong>DisableOSUpgrade</strong>.&nbsp; Windows will add REG_ to the beginning of DWORD after you create it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you inadvertently lose the highlight when you create the new value, right click it and select Rename.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next, right click your new value and go to Modify. Change the 0 into a<strong> 1</strong> in the Value field. Click OK to confirm and exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Reboot and then go to Windows Updates. You will now be able to install 8.1 updates without being nagged by Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I posted the same instructions in the following thread and as you can see from the responses, it clearly works:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/windows-10-upgrade-cannot-be-removed-from-windows/4854a84d-a8a8-47da-a936-bd5d08138bfb">

    <title>Backward Compatibility issue with BioShock Infinite&#58; The Complete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yzhang34  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backward Compatibility issue with BioShock Infinite&#58; The Complete Edition</h2>
                    <p>I'm so happy that Bioshock Infinite finally gets a BC, but there is one problem. What I have is the Bioshock: Infinite - the Complete Edition. It comes with two discs: the 1st with the main game, and the 2nd with bonus content including all DLCs. I can install the main game on my Xbox One, but I cannot install the DLCs from the bonus content disc. Could somebody help me with this issue? I really like the DLCs.</p>
