<h2>            Banned For No Reason From Sending Messages To People Not In My Friends List</h2>
                    <p>Why have I&nbsp;been banned from sending messages to people that are not in my friends list? Every time I&nbsp;tried sending a message I&nbsp;keep on getting a red message that says something like "You cannot send messages to this user due to your behaviour." What behaviour? I&nbsp;haven't done anything wrong. I&nbsp;tried under my old and disused account and the same happened from there. I&nbsp;created a sample account to try from fresh and the same happened there. It's as if I'm blocked through my IP address. I&nbsp;want to know what this behaviour garbage is all about because as I&nbsp;said, I&nbsp;haven't done anything wrong. I&nbsp;want this block removed. </p>

            <p>Hey there,&nbsp;OrcaAmity!</p><p><br /></p><p>The link that bowski provided does only that, verifies the account on Skype's end. After doing that, it's still not letting you send messages to people not on your friends list? To confirm, you&nbsp;<strong>are</strong> able to send messages to users who are on your friends list? Is this happening on the Xbox app, the website, the console, or all of them?</p><p><br /></p><p>This is a very odd situation. Let me know the clarifications above, and we'll see what our next steps are. :) I look forward to working with you!</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

<h2>            Google Chrome Unable to access the Network</h2>
                    <p>Hey there, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me with the problem I'm having with Google Chrome. For some unknown reason when its always been working perfectly fine ever since I installed it (ages ago) and I use it every day, the message came
 up...(see bottom of message)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I went to the firewall and removed it from allowed programs on the firewall and then readded it again. This didn't work so I uninstalled Chrome and reinstalled and repeated this 3 times and it STILL won't connect even though its on the allowed programs
 on the firewall. I don't have much IT knowledge so I have done all I can now and need some professional help!! Thank you lovely people in advance if you can shine some light on this :] Siobhan</p>

<span>The Best Solution I have Found Online..&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Search for Command Prompt&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Right Click and " Run as Administrator"&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>and then in command prompt type " netsh winsock reset" {Note: without this"}&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>and then restart your computer.......Now finally my Google chrome works in Windows 10</span>

<p>Thank you again for answering my questions. This is my first computer and I am like a kid with a new toy I want to learn a lot of new things about how computers operate and things I can do with a computer. Until now I used the computer at the library and
 really only was able to browse the internet. I am sure I will have many more questions in the future. Microsoft community is awesome. As far as the issue we where talking about I have Microsoft Securities Essentials it was installed when I bought my computer.
 I do believe now that there are a lot of bogus programs out there. I would go so far as to say they are scams. I have run a check of my computer using MSE and it comes up with 0 issues detected. I find it hard to believe that MSE is such an inferior program
 that it would not detect some issues that were there when programs like optimizer pro and my clean pc are telling me I have hundreds or thousands of issues&nbsp;that need to be fixed.</p>

<p>These "optimizer" and "My Clean PC" are known for making bogus claims and for exaggerating issues that are not important. They expect naive people such as yourself to fall for this and pay them money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download free anti-malware programs such as Malwarebytes. You need to add this to your MSE so complement it</p>

                    <p>My version is: Skype 7.40.0.103.&nbsp; When I type in the instant message, make a typo, and hit up arrow on the keyboard to edit the last message I entered, I can't select it and start typing.&nbsp; I don't want to use the mouse to do the select part, I want to just
 use the keyboard.&nbsp; I do not see any hotkeys listed that do this, and I see in the online Help that it is supposed to work this way (the same way it has worked for years).&nbsp; Is anyone else experiencing this?</p>

    <title>Where is the clipboard on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anhlyss1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the clipboard on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I copied and pasted a receipt from a warranty website, into Microsoft Paint, so I could view it easily.&nbsp; After I entered all the information needed into the Warranty Claim, and closed paint, the receipt mysteriously disappeared from my account.&nbsp; Now they
 want a copy, but I can't find the physical receipt (which is why I looked on the website in the first place).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured I could just go into the clipboard, and find the image, but I can't find the clipboard in Windows 10.&nbsp; A quick search online tells me that this is no longer a feature of Windows???&nbsp; Why the heck not??? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any way I can recover this image?</p>

            Launch Microsoft Paint

<br />You should see the file you recently edited in the 'Recent pictures' list

<br />What don't understand though, how were you expecting to edit the receipt in Paint and paste it back into the website?

<br />Why didn't you save changes before exiting Paint?

<p>The first thing I checked was 'recent pictures' but this was empty, even though I have been using it often. If it had been there, there would have been no issue, and I would not have posted a question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't save my changes, because I didn't make any.&nbsp; I pasted it into paint because the online copy was rotated and was too small to read the print.&nbsp; So I turned it the right way, and enlarged it Paint so I could read the information easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't pasting anything back into the website.&nbsp; I just wanted to be able to read the information I needed to put into the form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The receipt has since disappeared from the website because the customer service person I was on the phone with decided to update my contact info, and managed to overwrite my entire account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway.&nbsp; It isn't an issue anymore, because I was able to find the original receipt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this doesn't change the fact that removing the clipboard feature from Windows was a stupid idea.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur due to corrupt network settings. It could be a corrupt DNS or a TCP/IP settings that is slowing down the download speed. Sometimes, it’s also important to make sure that the network driver installed on the computer are also the updated
 ones as compared to the driver available at computer’s manufacturer website for the specific version of Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned that you face the same issue while switching with the connections (LAN to wireless or vice versa). So, let’s try resetting the network setting and check if it helps. Follow the methods mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>TCP/IP defines how your computer communicates with the network or other computers within the network.
<span>TCP/IP defines how your computer communicates with other computers.</span></p>
<p>Refer to the link to reset the TCP/IP settings:</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned under section “<strong>Windows 8.1</strong>”</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357/en-us</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may run fixit first and check if it helps. If not, you can follow the steps mentioned under section “L<strong>et me fix it myself</strong>”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot the computer and verify the results. If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s run the network troubleshooter and check if it finds and fixes issues with the network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network adapter troubleshooter will check for connection issues within the access points, router, cable or modem. Refer to the article and follow the steps to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to update the driver for the network adapter, download and install the latest wireless driver from the Lenovo’s website for Windows 8.1. You have mentioned that you have uninstalled and reinstall the driver for the network adapter. If you haven’t
 tried downloading the latest driver, here’s the link to download the latest network driver for this model for Windows 8.1:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/in/hi/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-edge-laptops/thinkpad-edge-e545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/in/hi/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-edge-laptops/thinkpad-edge-e545</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose Windows 8.1 (32or 64 bit) from the drop down menu and then download the required network driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For reference:</strong></p>
<p>You may also try assigning the DNS manually. Refer to the link and follow the suggestions

    <title>Transferring Xbox Live account to new microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarakin02  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Xbox Live account to new microsoft account</h2>
                    
<p>I have an old Gamertag and Xbox Live account linked to an email that I haven't used in years. I would like to move that Gamertag along with my digital game purchases to my new Microsoft account that is linked to my current email.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I no longer have an Xbox but would like to use the windows 10 store for now in case I end up buying an Xbox One someday.</p>

<p>The only tutorials for transferring an account I could find were very old and seemed to require logging into an Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Is there a way to just do this on my PC with the Xbox App for Windows 10?</p>

<p>When I tried to sign in with my current microsoft account it automatically created a generic Gamertag which I'm hoping won't lock me out of moving my old one over.</p>

                    My computer crashed. How can I get a copy of my Vista operating software to reinstall? I bought a mac and parallels software, and I need to install my Vista software be able to use it (it was preloaded on my pc that crashed).

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here are the various ways to reinstall Vista back on&nbsp;to your "crashed" Computer.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you wish to install it anywhere else, as it it is a preinstalled OS, it is tied to the original "crashed" Computer it came installed on.</p>
<p>An OEM License is non-transferable</p>
<p>And installing it on a Virtual Machine requires a new License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no Windows Vista download available from Microsoft.</p>
<p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall Vista back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Do a Clean Install and Setup with a Full Version of Vista"</b></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117366-clean-install-full-version-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117366-clean-install-full-version-vista.html</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Activate Vista Normally and by Phone Activation"</b></span></p>

    <title>Windows Explorer.exe &#40;Product&#47;File Version 6.1.7601.17567 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rdougshelton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer.exe &#40;Product&#47;File Version 6.1.7601.17567 dated 11&#47;9&#47;2011&#41; Hangs on a regular &#40;once every couple days&#41; basis</h2>
                    <div>I forget the exact wording of the error msg, but Windows essentially tells me Windows Explorer ihas been suspended and ask if I want to Kill it or try to resolve it. &nbsp;Killing it isn't a viable option, and to date I haven't seen it figure out how to **resolve**
 it on its own (I've waited overnight in one case, and the next morning it was still churning away)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1 with all the latest updates applied, on a more-than-adequately powered ([ntel I7] 1 yr-old HP laptop. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When this issue happens, my CPU use does **Not** go **above** 35% &nbsp;- in fact it is usually lower - and my memory use is at about 20% &nbsp;[I have 16GB memory, and running on an SDD]. &nbsp;So it really does **not** appear like I'm running out of any **physical**
 resources.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>WHAT I'VE DONE SO FAR:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(1) Run every existing MS Fix-It I could find [even if it looked like it did **not** have anything to do with Explorer]</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(2) Run SFC /scannow. &nbsp;Now - the results of that run **did** report back that there were **some** issues it could **not** resolve. &nbsp;Can't recall the log to look into to see the results but not sure how that'd help anyway, since last time I dug deep into
 such logs some 2+ years ago, most of the info on the problems in the log was relatively Incomprehensible - didn't help me solve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(3) Run every virus and malware scanner under the sun. &nbsp;I'M CLEAN.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(4) Tried to do an "In-Place" Windows upgrade from my Win 7 64-bit SP1 Install Disk. &nbsp;However, even though I do have a Windows 7 SP1 install disk, I got an error msg back telling me that the version of Windows on my machine is later than the version I
 was trying to do the in-place upgrade on. &nbsp;I am guessing that is simply because I've applied the latest upgrades (even tho those upgrades did **not** take me to another SP level, like "SP2", for instance, if such a thing exists].</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>HOWEVER: I still do Not want to abandon this path (i.e., Trying #4), IIF - anyone can tell me if there is a way to created an Install disk [**not** a Rescue disk] with the latest upgrades for Windows 7, either from my existing install on my HP Laptop,
 or somehow upgrade the Install disk itself, perhaps by transferring it to my laptop as a disk image and then picking up upgrades off MS Windows sites and applying the upgrades to that image and re-writing the image back to a clean DVD. &nbsp;I know that some years
 ago there **used** to be a way to do this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any other suggestions, folks?</div>

            <p>Hello all. &nbsp;My windows Explorer gives me the busy / hourglass about half the time when I right click on any file or folder in the main working Pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not "crash" and give me an error to post. &nbsp;I can right click on the explorer bar on the taskbar and the click to open another one which will work as long as I drag and drop. &nbsp;If I right click, this new window will freeze and my mouse will
 show "busy" whenever I am over that window. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate. &nbsp;I just accomplished this feat again and there is nothing showing in the event viewer. &nbsp;My normal solution is to either end process on explorer and start a new process in the task manager - explorer.exe, but that
 usually only closes the broken windows without fixing the problem. &nbsp;The only real fix is a reboot until it happens again which could either be immediately or whenever in the next day or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First Question: &nbsp;</p>
<p>If explorer.exe is not actually crashing with an appcrash or an app hang, etc, how can I figure out what is causing it to simply halt?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next - Where do I go from there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe boot does nothing different.</p>
<p>Thanks all,</p>

    <title>Device and Product Identifications Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Device and Product Identifications Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Device ID and Product ID of my HP all-in-one desktop with Windows 10 Home, Version 1803 have changed after a system recovery. Both IDs stand under System - Device specifications.<br />
The recovery was performed via F11 key-HP Recovery Manager. </p>
<p>The computer came with Windows 10 preinstalled and Recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it normal for the IDs to change through a system recovery? Or, has any error occurred?<br />
Please help clarify. <br />
Thanks</p>

            Hi BT
<br />
<br />Yes, that is normal, the Device ID and Product ID are randomly generated strings, and if your used the HP factory reset option, that would have generated 2 new strings.
<br />
<br />This however, should not affect your system in any way, neither should it affect your Windows licence or activation . . .
<br />
<br />Are you having difficulty activating Windows after that reset?

<p>Hi DaveM121,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for the answer which has clarified my concern about the ID changes.<br />
<br />
I did not have to activate Windows after the recovery.<br />
Other than not being able to run Intel graphics control panel (issue started after the system recovery and persists despite update to DCH driver), Windows 10 runs well.</p>

<div>That is most likely a hardware problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;A good starting point would be to connect an external monitor and see if it shows the same problem.&nbsp; This will narrow whether the issue is in the laptop video hardware or the LCD hardware (cable or

<h3> jasonmf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Forgets Dual Display Settings</h2>
                    <p>I have dual monitors and every time I restart my system, Windows forgets which monitor is the main screen, the screen order and the resolution of the main display. I have tried new drivers and have even installed a new video card yet the problem persists.&nbsp;
 Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't current have and multi-monitor 3rd part software installed, though I did at one point.</p>

<h3> paulgibbs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remember window positions</h2>
                    Okay so I'm really going back in time, I seem to remember on window 3... something that you could tell it to remember a window position so it opened in the same place each time.<br />
<br />
I use a widescreen monitor and have several apps open at the same time.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to "tell" an app to open at a certain position on screen. i.e I like my calculator to be bottom right corner, but it always opens up top left.<br />
<br />
Cheers

<p><span>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does this happen with all of your applications, or just calculator?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows stores the location where you close your application and opens it the next time in that location. However, there could be third party
 software that may be interfering with this process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try performing a clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Perform a clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> If the computer is connected to a network,
 network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing
 this may make the computer unusable. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or
 for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. </span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> Following this step lets Microsoft services
 continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility
 together with existing restore points.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
 Service list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform a clean boot by repeating step 1.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click the Startup tab, and then click to select half of the check boxes in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<strong><span>Startup Item</span></strong> list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<strong><span>Startup Item</span></strong> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <strong><span>Startup Item</span></strong> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that
 is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem
 can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or
 click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span><span>Collapse this imageExpand this

<h2>            No sound on an i-Mac runing Windows 10 cirrus logic sound chip</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am trying to help my old friend get the sound to work on his i-Mac. He installed Windows 10 on his i-Mac using bootcamp as instructed by Apple. The sound is fine when in Apple mode, but when booted up in Windows 10, all seems to be fine except that there
 is no sound from the internal speakers. The i-Mac uses a cirrus sound chip, we can't find a Windows driver for it anywhere on line. Windows says that the sound is working correctly, but still no sound! We have tried all the usual checks, but still no sound.
 We are running out of ideas of what to do next or where to turn for help. Can you help us?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi Colin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to contact the Boot camp support and check where you might get the better help&nbsp;as you are facing issue&nbsp;after installing it from the&nbsp;Boot camp and Windows says the Sound is fine and also the internal speaker on Apple mode is working better.</p>

<div>Hi&nbsp;Sachin Venkatesh</div>
<div>Thank you for answering so quickly, but unfortunately, I have to tell you that I have already spoken to Apple support and they said that as there are no issues with the sound or operation of the computer, in apple
 mode and that the partitioning of the hard disk and installation of Windows 10 through bootcamp was fine, that the problem was most definitely with the Microsoft Windows 10 software. They suggested that I contact Microsoft for the answer and having already
 updated my Windows 7 laptop to Windows 10, with initial sound problems, which I eventually overcame, by replacing the sound drivers, I am inclined to believe them, that the problem does in fact lie with Windows 10 and it's inability to drive the ciruss logic
 chip on the i-Mac motherboard.</div>
<div>If only it was a p.c. I would try installing a cheap sound card, together with it's software driver and expect that Windows 10 to be able to produce sound.</div>
<div>So I am still looking hopefully to the Microsoft community for the answer.
<div>Regards</div>

            <p>Thank you for your suggestions, but I think that we have tried all of the above already, with no solution.</p>
<p>I have nevertheless forwarded your suggestions on to my friend to check and possibly retry them. As you will see from my earlier question, the i-Mac does not have a removable sound card, but does have, what we believe is a Cirrus Logic sound chip on it's
 motherboard.</p>
<p>Since posting my original question we have been able to locate and download a CirrusAudioVista64 sound driver, but have not so far been able to get Windows 10 to admit to it's existence on the hard drive, even&nbsp; when we delete the sound drivers that Windows
 10 wants to use, it just re-loads them on the next boot-up. The Cirrus sound driver came as an .exe file and reports that it has been successfully installed. Still no sound!</p>

            <p>Hi Jayant</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid that I don't understand how creating a new user account on my p.c. and asking the same questions here, about this issue again, can provide a solution to the "no sound problem" that I have tried to explain here.</p>
<p>I had expected to find a good understanding of the Windows operating system here and guidance that would have allowed my friend and I to solve this problem on his computer. I find it difficult to believe that this particular malfunction is so unusual, that
 nobody else has experienced it, after installing Windows 10.&nbsp; I may be wrong, but it seems to me that if we could locate and install a suitable sound driver for the Cirrus Logic chip, (that we are told is on the motherboard), then there would be sound.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I don't understand why Windows 10 re-installs two sound drivers, that we had previously deleted, because they did not seem able to drive the on-board sound chip.</p>
<p>At the moment it looks like the Apple operating system can cause that sound chip to work as intended, but that the Microsoft operating system can't!</p>
<p>Most frustrating.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Colin</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue occurs due to driver conflict or incompatible drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would still suggest contacting Bootcamp support and ask for drivers compatible with Windows 10. Similar issues have been resolved with the installation of compatible drivers, as you did by replacing the sound driver earlier on your PC.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let us know once you install the drivers. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

            <p>Hi Sahil</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at all my previous postings concerning this problem, you will see that Both I and my friend who's Mac it is, that has the sound problem, have already contacted apple.com/support/bootcamp/ on two separate occasions and we were both politely informed
 that as the sound was not a problem, when running in Apple mode, that it was a Microsoft problem and that it was Microsoft that should provide the suitable drivers for use with Windows 10. I will be hopefully visiting my friend in the near future, to try yet
 again to get Windows 10 to to produce sound from his Mac.</p>
<p>If I should be successful, I will post the answer here.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Colin</p>

            <p>I am also facing the same issue with no sound on windows 10 on my imac. Used to work fine with XP I ran for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading this post I was wondering, Colin if you did find a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at you tube video's, many articles but still cannot find a resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a common problem even if you are running windows 10 a PC??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution at hand technicians at Microsoft can provide please????</p>

<p><span>Hey kashkit,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the problem is not only confined to one particular game website, it’s possible that there is an interference from firewall.<span>&nbsp;</span>Many
 antivirus software come bundled with firewall as well. As such, it’s a good try to disable any security software installed on the computer to test if any of the software is preventing you from getting through those websites.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise the other option is to put your computer in clean boot state. That way all the third party software gets disabled wherein you can perform
 the elimination test to determine the culprit application </span></p>

<h2>            How to redownload purchased music&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I own two Windows 8 devices; one tablet and one desktop computer. I've purchased some music from the Xbox Music Store using the tablet. The purchased music doesn't automatically appear in "my music" on the desktop computer and I cannot find any way of redownloading
 the purchased music.</p>
<p>Obviously I could just copy the MP3-files from the tablet to the desktop computer (which I have done) but I would still like to know how i redownload purchased music, in case I somehow lose my MP3s.</p>
<p>Is it possible to redownload purchased music? If yes, how?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I live in a region (Sweden) where Zune Music marketplace was unavailable which means the Zune client doesn't show the Music marketplace or the option to restore previously purchased Music. So I guess I'm out of luck for the time being...</p>

<h3> marshaw62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PC Mobile Hotspot Connectivity Issue</h2>
                    <p>I would like for my PC to share its internet connection with my other devices. I have tried two options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Envy 15 running Windows 10. My internet comes from a wifi router to my PC through a USB network adapter using ac and others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have enabled Mobile Hotspot on my PC, and I have enabled internet sharing. The hotpost will not stay enabled, but while is is active, the hotspot appears in available networks on both my iPhone and my Android tablet, but will not connect.&nbsp; iPhone message
 states "No Internet Connection" and tablet does not give an error message, but just gives up after trying for a minute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hotspot appears in my Network and Sharing Center on my PC, but states "No Network Access".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I have also tried to accomplish internet sharing to my other devices from my PC using Connectify-me, Maryfi, and MyPublicWiFi -- unable to establish an internet connection with any of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also attempted to use both above methods at the same time. Nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions appreciated.</p>

<p>In my case, the internet sharing was incorrectly linked with my Wi-Fi adapter instead of the hotspot adapter. Here's how I fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Mobile hotspot settings (Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot)</li><li><span>Turn on mobile hotspot</span></li><li>Under "Related Settings", click&nbsp;<span>Change adapter options</span></li><li>Take note of which adapter is connected to the internet and which adapter is your mobile hotspot (typically named "Local Area Connection* [#]")</li><li>Right click the adapter that is connected to the internet and click&nbsp;<span>Properties</span></li><li>Go to the&nbsp;<span>Sharing</span>&nbsp;tab</li><li><span>Uncheck</span>&nbsp;"Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". If it is already unchecked, skip this step.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<span>OK</span></li><li>Again, open&nbsp;<span>Properties</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Sharing</span>&nbsp;for the same adapter.</li><li><span>Check</span>&nbsp;"Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection"<br />
(If you get a popup that says "Internet Connection Sharing is currently enabled...", click OK.)</li><li>Under "Home networking connection:",&nbsp;<span>select the mobile hotspot adapter</span></li><li>Click&nbsp;<span>OK</span></li></ol>
