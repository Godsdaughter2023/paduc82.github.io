<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A microphone is a sound receiver device that can record sounds and convert it to an audio file. Before you can make it work properly,
 you need to update or install its driver. There’s an alternate way to do it besides from the
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. You can install it through a <strong>Microphone Setup Wizard</strong>.

    <title>Nvidia gtx 460 driver failed but recovered problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nvidia gtx 460 driver failed but recovered problem</h2>
                    <p>Sent the card back for the second time in under a year. I don't think it's the card anymore. This is a totally new unit. Fresh istall, you name it. Tried the clean boot thing all that. It still happens but only on desktop or IE. In game it's fine other than
 the occasional crash of bf2. Running Windows 7 x64 Ultimate. Bunch of other hardware that probably doesn't matter at this point. Basic stuff, q6600, 8gb ram,750w psu, etc. I build Pc's eveyday so I'm no stranger to problems. But 2 cards in a year? Even nvidia
 is thinking I'm full of it. There's a problem in the OS, gotta be. But where? All looks ok. Done extensive diagnostic on this twice now, getting old. The 1st card ran great for almost a year, then boom this stuff. Second one ,ok for a month or so then same
 thing. Doesn't happen in game, mainly on desktop or IE. Not while in full screen either, making it tougher to figure out. Now bf2 does crash from time to time but that seems un solveable after sp1. Pc specs are way above requirements for this OS. All parts
 are from this year. The cpu is the oldest being a q6600. Power supply is a 750w 4 12v rail.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the make and model of the Motherboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like heat, or a driver, or possibly a loose or slightly corroded video card connection, or even other hardware.<br />
<br />
Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps. Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean the video card contacts
 with a soft pencil eraser. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case).
<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help of a the Motherboard Support or Nvidia Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also check in with Nvidia Support, their drivers, and their forums.<br />
<br />

<p>You can either create your son a new account, so he is able to use it freely with his own Microsoft account and password, but he'll have to start all over for the save games etc. Or move this xbox live account to a different Microsoft Account, that will disconnect this xbox live account from your Microsoft account (and password) and connect it to a different Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If I understand the issue correctly those are basically the options.</p>
<p>See this link for information about the switching of a Xbox Live account to a different Microsoft account: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account</a><br />Be aware that a switch can only be done when a xbox live account has been on a console for at least 30 days and not downloaded in the meanwhile on any other console</p>

<p>With the recent addition of the two-factor verification you can actually get different apsswords for every service using your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>To activate this, you need to do the following:</p>
<p>1. Go to <a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/</a></p>
<p>2. Click on "Security Info" under "Overview"</p>
<p>3. Setup your two-factor authentication by just following the site's instructions (it will guide you through)</p>
<p>4. Once it's setup, click on “Create a new app password” under “App passwords”
</p>
<p>5. Enter your app password in the password field </p>
<p>6. Use your new app apssword to login to XBox LIVE!</p>
<p>It's that easy. Hope you manage to figure it out!</p>

    <title>LCD broken, connect to external monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kuitara  say:</h3>
<h2>            LCD broken, connect to external monitor</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have an HP Pavilion dv9000 running Windows Vista (Home Basic 32bit). My laptop was dropped and the LCD is now cracked. The 1/4 of the upper left screen is the only part I can see. I drag all dialog boxes to that corner to work. I can't see the toolbar or
 anything on the right side of the screen on the laptop (including minimize or close out shortcuts). I believe that my hard drive and files are intact. I ran chkdsk and it was fine. I was able to play a movie and I can see most dialog boxes. I attempted to
 connect to an external monitor. It worked for 5 minutes and then it ran Windows Update. After the update, the external monitor did not work. I ran through all the display options and tried different settings but it didn't work. The monitor was chosen as connected
 and when I unplugged it I can hear the "device disconnected" sound/ping but the monitor would display "no signal". So, I did a system restore to before the update and it didn't work either. Unfortunately, I can't see enough of the laptop screen to fully troubleshoot
 the issue. Is there a way to connect to this external display even if my LCD screen is shot? I need to work around the fact that I can't really see what is going on.
<br />
<br />
Any help would be truly appreciated (as always). Thanks,<br />
Kathleen

<h2>            Windows unable to print to network server &#40;bizhub c350&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I work on a network with about 20 users, and several network printers. Recently, we purchased a new computer for one user with Windows 7 professional on it. Everything seemed fine until I tried to connect to a specific network printer. The printer is a Konica
 Minolta bizhub c350 ... a MFP that serves as a photocopier and network printer.</p>
<p>I can see the printer on the network, and can ping by IP. ( the printer has a static IP), and other computers ( a mix of vista and XP) can print to the it perfectly.</p>
<p>I have tried browsing for the printer, and can see it, but cannot connect to print.</p>
<p>File and print sharing is enabled on the computer and they are in the same workgroup and subnet. When I install the printer ( add printer, network printer, add a printer by IP,) it seems to install but nothing will print ... not even a test page, or a simple
 notepad document. I even tried removing the device and installing as a local printer, but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>Please help! Is there something I am missing here? Something new within Windows 7 that I need to change?</p>

                    <p>Yesterday purchased a surface pro 2017. At first the surface app worked fine, now it cannot communicate with pen, as in the screenshot:

            Hi, I ended up following suggestions on a similar question. &nbsp;First tried troubleshooting - no errors found, then, downloaded Windows 10 upgrade assistant. &nbsp;I think that when I ran that, it totally reinstalled Windows 10. &nbsp;I now have Windows 10 Home Version
 1703 loaded.

Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I installed windows server 2012 R2 on a server with IIS, SQL, TFS and some other Microsoft products. After finished installation, I ran windows update which asked for restart to continue installation.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
After restart, update continues till 9% then it stops for ever!!!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I failed to start it also with safe mode or last good know configuration mode!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I don't have a recovery image CD for my installation.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
What should I do? how can I either fix the issue or cancel the installation?</p>

<p>Hi<strong> atlanta09,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting on Microsoft Answers!<br />
</strong><br />
To resolve this issue, follow these steps: <br />
1.&nbsp;Make sure that you are using Windows Media Center on a computer that is running Windows 7.
<br />
2.&nbsp;In Windows Media Center, click Download now in Windows Media Center to download the latest Netflix in Windows Media Center installation package. To do this, follow these steps:
<br />
a.&nbsp;In Windows Media Center, click Tasks, click Settings, click General, and then click Automatic Download Options.
<br />
b.&nbsp;Click Download Now. If Windows Media Center prompts you to set up an Internet connection, complete the steps that are listed on the screen. Then, when you are returned to the Automatic Download Options page, click Download Now again.
<br />
c.&nbsp;In the Start Download dialog box, click OK. The download process may take several minutes to finish.
<br />
d.&nbsp;When the download is completed, restart Windows Media Center. Then, the Netflix option on the left side of Movie Library in the Movies row is displayed.<br />
3.&nbsp;If the Netflix option in step 2d is not displayed, make sure that your Regional and Language Options settings are set to United States. To do this, follow these steps:
<br />
&nbsp;.&nbsp;Click Start and then click Control Panel. <br />
a.&nbsp;Click Clock, Language, and Region. <br />
b.&nbsp;Click Regional and Language. <br />
c.&nbsp;On the Formats tab, make sure that English (United States) is selected in the Format box.
<br />
d.&nbsp;On the Location tab, make sure that United States is selected in the Current location box.
<br />
e.&nbsp;On the Administrative tab, click Copy settings. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
f.&nbsp;In the Welcome screen and new user accounts settings dialog box, make sure that at least the Welcome screen and system accounts check box is selected, and then click OK.
<br />
g.&nbsp;Restart the computer, and then repeat step 2 to download the latest Netflix in Windows Media Center installation package.<br />
4.&nbsp;If the previous steps do not resolve the issue, try the following steps: <br />
&nbsp;.&nbsp;Exit Windows Media Center. <br />
a.&nbsp;Open an administrator command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the administrator password or provide confirmation.<br />
b.&nbsp;Type the following commands at the command prompt, and then press ENTER after each command:
<br />
cd /d %WINDIR%\ehome</p>
<p>start /wait mcupdate -uf<br />
c.&nbsp;Type exit, and then press ENTER to exit the Command Prompt window. <br />
d.&nbsp;Restart Windows Media Center. The Netflix option should be displayed on the left side of Movie Library on the Movies row.
<br />
5.&nbsp;Restart Windows Media Center. The Netflix option should be displayed on the left side of Movie Library on the Movies row.
<br />
6.&nbsp;If the previous steps do not resolve the issue, the issue may be caused by some unsupported third-party Windows Media Center menu editing utilities.

    <title>updates vs optional update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            updates vs optional update</h2>
                    <div>I have been asked by my business to explain the difference between required update and optional update in the opinion of Microsoft. As I am using WSUS behind SCCM 2012 this is not well defined.</div>

<div>I am looking for what people consider an optional update verses a required update.</div>
<div>In WSUS we have:-</div>

<div>Critical Updates</div>
<div>Definition Updates</div>
<div>Feature Packs</div>
<div>Security Update - Severity None</div>
<div>Security Update - Severity Important</div>
<div>Security Update - Severity Moderate</div>
<div>Security Update - Severity Critical</div>
<div>Service Packs</div>
<div>Tools</div>
<div>Update Rollups</div>
<div>Updates</div>

<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Ken</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 usb charging port issue with external drives</h2>
                    <p>
Hi,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I bought at the beginning of the year an ACER VN7-592G under Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I'm very happy with my purchase and the laptop is working perfectly except for a "little" annoyance :</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
when I connect an external drive to the usb charging port, I cannot eject it. The drive is recognized and working perfectly. The problem is that it's considered as an internal drive, not an external one and that's the reason I do not have the eject option.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Generally, I use that port for my external optical drive or for an MTP device but&nbsp;if I could access all my ports completely it would be perfect. I have different external drives and the problem is the same for all.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I tried to update drivers, I looked at the bios options but could not find anything relevant. Is it a normal behavior under Windows 10 (the fact that the usb charging port is seen as internal) ? If it's a normal behavior, is it safe to unplug it because it's
 really annoying to restart the computer just for that.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also check the safely remove icon at the bottom left of the Taskbar. If it's not showing try to click the "<strong>^</strong>" icon. you should have this,</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f8b95af-d860-4668-a5f9-947ee18a3bd9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f8b95af-d860-4668-a5f9-947ee18a3bd9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, regarding to your questions if it's safe to just unplug the external devices/USB, the answer is yes. It is safe to just unplug it and it will not going to affect or harm your external devices/USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive is considered as internal so there is no Safely Remove option. Is there a Windows reason for that behavior ? Is it due to the way the port is connected to the motherboard ? Something else ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Has this been confirmed about multiplayer anywhere or no? I've seen a few post about it, but didnt know if that was a rumour or not.&nbsp; Of course i'm not referring to the obvious MS live cost.</p>

<p>I certainly hope not. We already pay for xbox live. They could kind of do it like EA does it and have the code for new games in the box and if you buy it used you have to pay a small one time fee to get multiplayer.</p>

<p>i would gladly pay for dedicated servers alone. knowing the developers they wouldnt do it, let alone constant support for their game, it would be a waste of money, and apparently they've been trying to push this idea into the games since cod 4.</p>

                    <p>I have a&nbsp;very frustrating problem I've seen discussed before, but there was not a useful answer posted.&nbsp; My Windows 7 Repair disk, will not recognize the USB attached hard drive where&nbsp;chose to store my image during the create image process. I tried saving
 the image (9.81GB) to DVDs, but after feeding in 8 blank DVDs I gave up. Windows suggested the image would be only 12GB so I tried saving the image to multiple DVDs, but no luck.
</p>
<p>I have an Acer Aspire One Netbook (AOD257-1679) with no optical drive built in. My BIOS has the facility to boot from USB devices like a USB DVD, or a USB Hard Drive. When I boot from the USB DVD, the repair disk loads and seems to function normally. However,
 when I try to point where the saved image is, no luck. Is there a way to incorporate a generic USB driver when I make the Windows 7 Repair disk? The external USB drive is fine when I boot Windows 7 normally. Since the repair disk boots from a USB DVD, why
 canm't it see a USD hard drive? Both are enabled in the BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Windows 7&nbsp;preclude laptops and netbooks from the repair from image process?&nbsp; Unlike a desktop, there is only room for 1 hard drive in my netbook, and I have already mentioned that Windows 7 can be installed from a USB DVD, and the Repair disk boots
 normally&nbsp; from a USB DVD. Why does the repair disk not see my USB hard drive? I do not want to go through a fresh install, that is why I made an image in the first place.</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;incredibly frustrating.</p>

            <p>About the Recovery Disk - I only read the first page of that link to make sure it was describing Recovery Disks decently.&nbsp; I had not seen that they wanted money or I'd have suggested another one that would have been for a full installation ISO image download
 for nothing [rather a big download though].&nbsp; I don't have the link to hand and I seem to be too late anway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit - Found it</p>

<p>[the Win7x64 Home Premium download is 3.1GB so I've never done it personally but have seen it recommended by other people in the Answers Forum so I think it works]</p>

            <p>perfectly. I did try 2 image restorations first, and although they appeared to fuction normally, and after setting the partition as active, they would not boot for some reason. I did get one error message I was expecting. I forget the exact error, but it
 had to do with the size of my volume. I was warned on another forum that I may encounter this error if my volume was not&nbsp; small enough using shrink. I think I was at 107 GB for the 120 GB drive. This maybe too close.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, creating/restoring&nbsp;an image was only a best effort, and not exactly what I wanted anyway. I wanted to do a baseline installation, free of all junk. I've installed operating systems on many desktops, and I've always preferred a native
 install plus drivers, to reverse engineering a retail install loaded with junk. When I compare the registry file in a fresh install vs a reverse engineered install, the fresh install is infinitelt cleaner.</p>
<p>This whole process was facilitated by the lack of an installation disc. With your help, I was able to use a downloaded ISO with the eicfg removal tool mod. At no time was I trying to get around any licensing activation. I am thrilled with the rsults. The
 SSD is positively fantastic!</p>
<p>I just don't understand why Acer and Asus don't offer a Windows installation disc. Both companies do on their desktop models. What turned out to be a real surprise was the quality and useability of the Drivers and Applications Disc Acer e-Recovery can create.
 I'll ammend my instructions for another couple of forums to include taking a driver inventor first, before swapping out the drives. There are a lot of great tools that can do this in one or two clicks, including a complete list of the installed programs. I
 had one tinyissue when installing the drivers on the fresh install. Acer did not put dates on the drivers, and the WAN driver had 3 to choose from. The revision numbers were only partly helpful. Turns out to use WAN, which I am doing now, you need parts of
 the Intel WAN driver and the Atheros WAN driver. I found this out after the fact when I remembered I created an installed&nbsp;drivers list using AIDA64 Extreme.</p>
<p>Thaks again. I am going to mark this as solved.</p>
