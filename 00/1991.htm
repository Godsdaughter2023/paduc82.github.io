</p><p>I'm sorry I can't be much of help about the account recovery form, but only you can help yourself to recover your account. Here are the 5 tips I can tell you on how to better pass your chance in recovering your email&gt;<br />
<br />
</p>
</span>
<p>
<div>
<p>
<em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2.&nbsp;Also, much better if you can&nbsp;do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</span></em></p>
<p>
</span></p>
<p>
<em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.</span></em></p>
<p>
<em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></em></p>
<p>
<em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that&nbsp;you know apply to your account.</span></em></p>
<p>
</span></p>
<p>
<em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. If you use&nbsp;Outlook.com or Hotmail.com to send emails, you can fill out the email section of the form.</span></em></p>

<p>2. formatting the memory card</p>
<p>3. flashing the phone.</p>
<p>4. cleaning with an air jet</p>
<p>&nbsp;but the problem persists.</p>
<p>the flash thingy makes me nervous when Im on my phone in public.. the flash makes them think of me like Iam taking their photos or something. :(</p>
<p>I can get to a nokia care but its faroff from here. So, any other help will be deeply appreciated. :)</p>

    <title>Cannot view Favorites, feeds &#38; history thru Star icon or Alt C - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael n james  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot view Favorites, feeds &#38; history thru Star icon or Alt C</h2>
                    I have upon opening Explorer 11 found I cannot view the drop box/list of my favorites, feeds &amp;history through the Star icon&nbsp;nor thru the use of Alt + C. I still do have the Menu bar option for Favorites. When I place the cursor over the Star icon and click
 it stays lit up but no drop box. I have tried turning Explorer 11 on and off through the Windows Selection route but this has had no effect. Prior to today I have not had this problem and cannot identify any changes I have made which would have caused this
 glitch. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Kem,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying. I apologise for my own delay in answering your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried performing a clean boot, but it had no effect. The described problem remained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no applications, changes that I have recently made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only other trouble-shooting was that which I have already described.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue persists after performing the above steps, let's further isolate the issue by starting Internet Explorer in No add-ons mode. To do this, press W<strong>indows key + X &gt;Command Prompt (Admin)
</strong>and type the following and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>“%ProgramFiles%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe” -extoff</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After done, check if the issue persist. If not, an add-on may be causing the issue so try to disable and enable each add-on to identify which is causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            address bar under on screen keyboard</h2>
                    <p>When I use IE10 on Windows 8 RT, then the address bar disappears under the on screen keyboard making it impossible to view the url which is being typed!&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I make the IE10 address bar stay above the on screen keyboard?</p>

<p>The version of IE 10 is: 10.0.9200.16466</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and thanks for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on the description it looks like you are facing an issue with address bar on Internet Explorer, it would be great if
 you can reply to this question in order to assist you further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you referring to Internet Explorer 10 in Desktop view or Windows 8 User Interface view?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you're looking for your Address bar, open Internet Explorer and swipe down from the top (or right-click). The Address bar
 appears at the bottom of your screen and the Tabs bar appears at the top.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
We would be more than happy to help you further if the above steps did not resolve the issue.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Vijin,</p>
<p>thank you for replying.</p>
<p>I'm using the modern IE app, and I'm fully aware of how to show the addressbar.</p>
<p>It's when the addressbar is shown I touch the addressbar and then the keyboard appears on top of the addressbar, effectively hiding the addressbar and my input.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

            <p>Found the solution. Uninstall update KB2796096 and Problem is solved.</p>
<p>ist some Flash update for IE10 which seems to introduce the Problem....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can do so by going to control Panel &gt;&gt; Windows updates &gt;&gt; on top there is a link that takes you to the uninstall Options for updates...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    Hi, Hotmail settings are in English. I live in Spain. Hotmail autocorrects such that if i type in an english word hotmail will change this into a similar spanish word. also i get a red squiggly line under every english word i type (unless of course the
 word is for example Madrid which hotmail recognises as a spanish word. How can i turn this off? thanks

            Using which browser? The latest versions of most browsers have spelling check built in, so you'd have to check your browser settings.

            I have been using IE9. so i tried google chrome and i still get exactly the same thing. for example,in the sentence i am now writing every word is underlined with a squiggly red line. (except the word red which means net in spanish and is therefore recognised
 ) i think that this is due to a windows update as this has only started quite recently.&nbsp;

            <p>IE9 doesn't have a built-in spell check, so Outlook will use its own. This will presumably use the language specified at the foot of the page when viewing your inbox:</p>
<p><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsbm6za.bn1.livefilestore.com%2fy2p1QrGVqBXisGVh5SM2WlgVCLPZAw5zK1r4cINwDFkYNF2jCMNWx6Ot54k4jcs5Q8Eikcptu2pqRgq0-H3S1qENPkRt231eEBi4e_q1DyqW4w%2fPeople-footer.png%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p><br />
Clicking on the language specifier will enable you to change it. Is yours showing an English variant?

 when this was installed. as i said before every word i type is underscored with a red squiggle line. if this is connected with windows any idea how i change that?

Which OS? If it's W7 and you're up to date at Windows Update, you should have IE10 by now. The default spell check language is specified at
<em>Manage add-ons </em>in the IE settings (Alt+T A)<em>.<br />
<br />
</em>What is the input language shown at Control Panel &gt; <em>Region and Language &gt; Keyboards and languages &gt; Change keyboards</em>?
<br />
<br />
Sorry, I can't help with Chrome.<br />

            Hi again, i have looked at the change keyboard option and i havent changed it because i want to retain the spanish keyboard - my keyboard has the "ñ" and the "ç" for example - I dont know what you see for these symbols but the ñ is the letter in españa
 for example it doesnt exist in english. before the most recent windows update (from about a month ago) i had a spanish keyboard and i did not get this autocorrect. Are you saying that to return my system to how it was before i need to change my keyboard settings?
 You ask me about my browser - because this issue happens in both IE and chrome i assume the issue has nothing to do with my browser. i have just gone into keyboards and languages and changed the format option this has had no noticeable effect. basically im
 saying i have changed none of my settings but windows has decided to do it for me. im just looking at the list of programs that have been installed and can see on the fifteenth of august this year i had 3 updates from Microsoft : Microsoft office powerpoint
 viewer 2007 (spanish), paquete de compatibilidad para 2007 office system, and microsoft office professional edition 2003. i am guessing the issue is connected with this. thanks look forward to your reply

<br />
Aha! <br />
<br />
It's a common misconception that changing the input language requires a change of keyboard layout, caused not least by that
<em>Change keyboards </em>tab and the options on it. Of course, some input languages will require a different keyboard layout to be of any use - Hebrew or Japanese, say. But there's nothing to stop you using a Spanish keyboard even though the input language
 is English. <br />
<br />
When you install a&nbsp;different language on the <em>Change keyboards </em>tab, you have the option to specify the keyboard layout to be used with that language. There is of course a default, but you don't have to accept it. In your case, you should
<em>Remove</em> <strong>English (United Kingdom)</strong>, then <em>Add </em>it back again, but this time select +
<em>Keyboard &gt; Show more &gt; Spanish </em>(or <em>Spanish Variation</em>, depending on whether you like to have ç next to ñ or north-east of it. Use the
<em>Preview </em>button to see the difference). <br />
<br />
You can then select English (UK) as your input language on the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-vista/the-language-bar-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Language Bar</a>, but your keyboard will still&nbsp;have the Spanish layout. With any luck, your spelling checkers will now realize that you're typing in English and act accordingly.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 black screen. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasshermer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 black screen.</h2>
                    <p>Funny.&nbsp; The screen went black while I was trying to read the Q&amp;A provided.&nbsp; Screen goes black.&nbsp; Wiggle the mouse and it comes back.&nbsp; Tried the online fixes available from Microsoft and I still have the problem.&nbsp; I'm 74 and a retired Quality Manager for a
 defense contractor.&nbsp; Since quality is defined as "conformance to requirements" and there couldn't possibly be a requirement buried in the specs for Windows 10 to create a black screen to dissatisfy the customer every two minutes, you guys need to fix the product.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
 not&nbsp;an Windows 10 update that searches out and repairs the issue?&nbsp; Or, if someone in the discussion group can explain how to fix the issue in terms an old guy can understand, I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>BTW, I had a telephone conversation with a Microsoft guy who offered to take control of my computer and fix the problem for $250.00.&nbsp; That doesn't sound like a "free" version of Windows.</p>

<h2>            Send Email to Multiple Office 365 Groups</h2>
                    I need to send a single email to multiple Office 365 Groups. &nbsp;Many contacts belong to multiple groups. &nbsp;If I add multiple groups to the email, will a recipient receive multiple emails if he is belongs to more than one group? &nbsp;Can a new contact group be

            <p><span>Hi Jrhooper,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The recipient will receive multiple emails if he belongs to more than one group because every group will deliver emails sent to it to all members. That’s how Office 365 group works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding “<em>Can a new contact group be created from existing contact groups to avoid having to add individual contacts</em></span>”, the answer is yes. And the steps below are the best practice:</p>
<p><span>1. Create a new Office 365 group.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the <strong>Add members</strong> button and then type the existing group’s name or email address in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click it when there is a search result matches it and then click <strong>
Save</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Feel free to let us know if anything is misunderstood or you need further assistance about this.</span></p>

<p>For apparently no reason at all my umages and videos disappeared from my gallery. New photos and videos weren't showing up there. After reading your post I took a picture and added it to the print basket. Now I've done this all of my images and vidoes have
 come back (including the ones that I took that weren't being saved)</p>

<p>You could try make a soft reset of your phone by pressing the following keys:<br />
<br />
<strong>*#7780#</strong><br />
<br />
If this doesn´t work out try a hard reset, which deletes all data on the phone and restores factory settings:<br />
<br />
<strong>*#7370#</strong></p>

<p>Maybe this´ll help you two...let us know if it did! :)</p>

<p>Well, i have the same problem, tried the soft reset, hard reset. Reinstalled the phone and updated to V31.0.017 again. Nothing seems to work. It saves fine on the memory card. But theres no way in hell to get the pics and video's into the gallery. Seems
 like the only solution to this is to downgrade again to V30.0.15 when i didnt have these problems ? Ive searched and googled quite a lot. Seems like more people are having the same problem, but noone has a solution yet..</p>

<p>Did you try a hard reset (the three key reset)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard reset (the three key code/reset). Turn off the phone. Press and hold three keys together, the green/talk key, the * key and the number '3'.Then, turn on the phone and don't let the three keys before you see the nokia hands logo/nokia boot up screen.<br />
For some other models (like 5800XM and N97) hard reset need different keys/buttons. The green/talk key, the red key and the camera key/button. The process is the same.</p>

<p>Hello Phonehacker,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your effort. I just tried the 3-key hard reset as u suggested. But still no luck. It didn't work. It still doesn't save onto the gallery or reads the pictures/videos that are on my memory card. I'll have to keep looking/googling for
 now for someone to come up with an answer. (if someone does, ill be sure to post) If you have any more suggestions i'd like to hear them though!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Ok i've finally got my solution. Yesterday i copied all important files to my (computer's )hard drive and then performed a format of the mem card, using the format funtion on the phone itselve. (It then puts in the standard system maps that are used for
 saving private settings and also pictures, video's etc.) After that i started putting all my pics and videos back in the right maps on the mem card and now i've got it all working again. It saves the new media files when i take my photo's and video's and it
 reads the old ones too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem solved! I can die a happy man now...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thnx again, i hope this helps the others too</p>

<h3> kblinhou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shift-tab not working reliably in Excel 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone else experiencing problems with the shift-tab function in Excel randomly turning itself off? I've been filling out grading spreadsheets, 110 of the same thing over and over. About half the time usually when I've entered a formula incorrectly or
 done something else that excel doesn't like, I find that it disables the shift-tab from there on out, all spreadsheets. Quitting and restarting usually fixes it, but not always. Working on a Mac 10.11.2 (El Capitan) with version 15.17 (151206) of Excel para
 Mac (set to LATAM Spanish).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used Excel for probably 20 years, I'm not a newbie, but I wonder if there is a new setting I'm missing?</p>

            Hello. File transfer between PC and device is still possible under Windows 8. You can't sync Outlook information, however. I am understanding that you want to transfer the Pocket Excel file to your PC? Do you have Windows Mobile Device Center installed
 in Win 8? Please check on the PDA a setting at Start&gt;settings&gt;connections&gt;USB to PC. Please uncheck an option "enable advanced network functionality". If you don't have this option, please post back what options you do have.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Only system files are "hidden". The Pocket Excel file is a data file and should not be hidden.&nbsp;</div>

            Hello. Oh, so the file is not on the PDA. If you synced files in the past, the pocket excel file would be in the My Documents folder on the PC in a subfolder with the name of your device that you gave it. It may be an older version if file syncing stopped
 with the PDA. &nbsp;Alternatively, you can do a file search on your PCs and look for "*.pxl" (without quotes). The file extension .pxl is for pocket excel files and the asterisk will find all .pxl files on your PC hard drive. Once you find the file you want, you
 can copy to your SD card using a card reader and then place the card in your device to open. Why do you have no files on your PDA? Did you have to hard reset it back to factory conditions?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>As far as retiring the PPC, if you are familiar with how it works and it does what you want it to do, I would continue to use it. If it breaks, it will force you to move on and learn a new operating system. There are still many features that Windows Mobile
 has that other mobile operating systems still can't do.&nbsp;</div>

            Hello. If I understand correctly, you saved the pocket excel files as regular (.xls) files on the PDA? Then you should search for *.xls files on your computer and PDA. The reset you did should not remove any files from the PDA.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The .xlsx file extension is for Office 2007 and above. You probably can't natively save the file as .xlsx on your PDA unless you have Windows Mobile 6.1 or higher. It sounds as though your PDA is older than that, though. You can convert the .xls file to
 .xlsx on your PC with the correct version of Office. But right now I think you are just trying to find the file.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
<div>Reg.reg is a Windows registry file that you probably made when you backed up the registry. You don't want that.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Well, I don't think your PDA is broken, it is just the syncing configuration is messed up. It can happen with Windows Updates, firewall/AV updates, etc. The easiest way to fix it is to backup the critical info on the device and hard reset it back to factory
 conditions. Then start over with a fresh partnership and the syncing should function again.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            OneNote Android Crashes at Launch - Droid Maxx</h2>
                    <p>OneNote Android has started to crash when I launch it on my Motorola Droid Maxx. I have been using it successfully and now it crashes. I have tried clearing the memory and cache (from the App Menu) as well as de-installing and re-installing a dozen times.
 I've rebooted the phone multiple times, too. As soon as I launch the program I get the following message "Unfortunately, OneNote has stopped". Sometime I get a choice to click OK or Report, other times I just get an OK prompt. In either case, OneNote then
 crashes. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I use OneNote for Windows every day and my data is behaving on my computers normally so I don't believe that there is any data corruption.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would like to avoid completely wiping my smartphone and reinstalling all the software from scratch as I don't want to lose all of my customizations and settings. While I could&nbsp;restore from a backup I would restore any problem that is now affecting OneNote.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your help is appreciated. Thank you. </p>

            I solved the problem by uninstalling MS Office for Android, then uninstalling One Note for Android, then reinstalling them in the same order that they were deleted. The problem has reoccurred one time which I resolved in the same fashion.

<h2>            SharePoint Online - Content and Structure &#34;Move&#34; not working anymore</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>as of apr 11, 2016, we cannot perform content and structure "move" on any of our tenants (even using ootb site collections / sites). along with this, we are also encountering an issue with the "page elements" style not appearing anymore.</p>
<p>i suspect this is all related to the latest sharepoint version deployed, 16.0.0.5131.</p>
<p>here is a screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c942450d-4fdf-443c-8f98-9f03415adc80" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc942450d-4fdf-443c-8f98-9f03415adc80" /></a><br />

<p>I've seen the same thing - A page actually did move but it was incomplete and I got the same error. Experience indicates this results from yet another untested and unnecessary update. Msft should provide the update details so we can all undo it.

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>I can't seem to find your private message. Also, unfortunately, I'm not an Administrator of our Company's and Client's tenant.</p>
<p>I got the error by trying to migrate "Pages" library from 1 site to another. They are both OOTB. Can I know if that works for you?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Lean,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I can reproduce the issue based on your description. (move the pages in a Pages library to another)</p>
<p>Given this situation, I'd like to confirm if you can perform the same steps before. Also, let us know if you got the same error moving other contents (libraries, sites, pages, etc).</p>
<p>In addition, I've sent you the PM again:<br />

You can involve your IT admin in your company if it is convenient. Thanks for your efforts.</p>

<p>Yes, we have been able to do it before. We were even using Custom Content Type.

<p>I experienced the same issue with just using 2 Lists OOTB, with just Item Content Type and trying to move from 1 to the other.</p>
<p>Thanks for the PM, I received it, will provide you details.</p>

            If you move the active cell to anywhere in the group you want to collapse you can use the Alt shortcuts for the Office ribbon.&nbsp; Pressing Alt+A+H activates the Hide Detail button in the Outline group on the Data ribbon to collapse the group and Alt+A+J
 activates the Show Detail button to expand it again.

<p>Facebook stopped supporting their app on WP8.x devices one year ago - you can ask them why, nothing to do with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your alternatives are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If your Lumia 635 is with 1GB RAM you can update it to Windows 10 Mobile following the procedure here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10599/windows-10-mobile-how-to-get" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10599/windows-10-mobile-how-to-get</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If your Lumia 635 is with 512MB RAM you cannot update it to W10M, so:</p>
<p>

<h2>            Autocorrect&#47;Autoformat in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I don't have automatic capitalization when I write messages in my Outlook/Office 365.&nbsp; I believe I use Outlook on the web, not desktop.&nbsp; Earlier versions of Outlook had a File tab which took you to Menu where you could then make changes to text formatting.&nbsp;
 I read that there is no file tab on the more recent versions.&nbsp; What do I do to locate and make changes to autoformat/autocorrect?</p>

<p>Hi Jtoepper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/check-spelling-before-sending-a-message-620b24fc-9cc5-4a2f-a26b-9ff4e02cc193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></span>, there is no built-in
 spellcheck in Outlook Web App. As a workaround, please kindly try using the Chrome's build-in&nbsp;spellcheck&nbsp;feature in Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Languages &gt; Spell check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can enable your PC’s spellcheck function by going to Settings &gt; search for Autocorrect misspelled words and Highlight misspelled words &gt; turn on both of those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, I totally understand it will be more convenience to spellcheck when using Outlook Web App, we highly recommend you to send us your feedback in below link:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Office Installed in German and not English</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I recently upgraded my Word 2007 product to Word 2010 using the tech guarantee microsoft had offered to Office Student version buyers, and selected english as the language I wanted it installed in, and when I opened the setup file, everything was
 written in German.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought everything might install okay, so I went ahead and installed Office anyway, and now I can't change menu language to English...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could anyone help?</p>

<h2>            Build 9926 -- Capturing WIM and applying issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found a very interesting issue. Applying a wim of this build renders the start menu and cortana unusable. I installed a clean install and set up a local account. I did not modify anything but cortana and the start menu was working normally. Using
 Win PE&nbsp;I captured the image. Then I formatted the drive and applied the image from the wim file. Once I did this the start menu and cortana no longer function. Clicking on the start menu does nothing, it does not bring up anything. However, I can right click
 on the start menu to get the contextual items like control panel, system etc. I can click in the Cortana text field but cannot type anything. All other icons on the task bar work as expected. Any ideas how to repair this?</p>
<p>

</p><p>I suggest you to create a new Microsoft user account&nbsp;and check if the issue persist. All apps will sync and work on Microsoft user account. If you are trying with a local account, it will not sync or work. Please find this link below to create a Microsoft
 user account:</p>

            I have first hand experience with this situation and Windows 8 ,8.1 or 10 will 100% not install if your processor doesn't support those 3 standards. I had a Dell Inspiron 1100 that had a Pentium 4 processor and I could not upgrade to Windows 8. The computer
 would run so terrible anyway even if you could upgrade if it maxes out at 1GB of RAM from back in the day I know this from installing Windows 7 Ultimate on the before mentioned computer after I failed to upgrade it to 8. It should remain on Windows XP until
 it finally dies. That or try out a Linux distro they have some that people claim run fantastic on older hardware (I've never experienced Linux personally but they have a small fanatical following that swear by it). If you have any newer machines that has Windows
 8.x pro then try it out in Hyper-V or if you have the extra disk space or an extra disk make yourself a separate partition and hook up the dual boot method. I have already done both and the OS is stable in both a virtual environment and on real hardware (Dell
 Inspiron 1525 from 2007 originally with Vista handles it very well with 4GB of RAM and a core2Duo T8300). If you are looking for an experience that is totally not Windows 8 you will be disappointed also if you are looking for an experience that is totally
 Windows 7 you will get the same results from your en-devour. I will upgrade all my machines if it is free or extremely cheap (no more than 10$)<br />

                    I have run Microsoft's Security Essentials Scan two days in a row and I still can't find out how to remove Trojan:Win32/Dynamer!ac. It is described as a severe threat and suggests remove immediately. After the scan finishes ( about 4-5 hours wasting my
 time) I highlight the name shown in the Detected Items box and click the clean PC button on the screen and the apply action button in the box. But nothing happens. I have downloaded the Microsoft Security Essentials and printed out every page I've been on
 and used prt sc and ctrl V for ones which have no way to print and have read&nbsp;and reread the directions but so far it wont say it is removed and doesn't seem to do anything. I tried to sign in with what I used years ago and it refused to let me use that ID.

<p>Hello Bruce Hagen</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the solution you sent several times but I don't seem to have had any success. I've run the Microsoft Security Essentials and as the scan progresses through the files on my computer I found it very time consuming because of something Microsoft
 put in the security system. &nbsp;At what seems to be very short intervals the screen goes blank and generally there is something about due to not using the it is being shut down. I literally have to sit and watch to prevent this because when this happens the scan
 seems to come to a halt. I have got the scan to finish several times while making notes where I write down the material&nbsp;that appears on the screen.&nbsp;I originally was able to find the name of the problem file which was on the cover sheet you posted.&nbsp; I&nbsp;followed
 the steps here: as best as I could <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://malwaretips.com/blogs/trojan-win32-dynamer-ac-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">https://malwaretips.com/blogs/trojan-win32-dynamer-ac-removal/</span></a></span>&nbsp;and
 found some problems. Evidently this virus has been around for a while since some of the directions seem to be out of date. One of the links has an out of date something which I don't know what to do about. The first time I ran the scan I found the first portion
 of the scan was C:/and the latter portion&nbsp;was D:\preload\Base.win-&gt;(Image 3079)program Files (x86)HP Games\Polar Golfer\golf-wt.exe-&gt; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp; with the file Trojan:Win32/ somewhere near that file name. I have been unable to locate the file within the HP
 Games area because I don't know how to find it. It appears I might have been able to successfully remove the file more than once but it comes right back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it seems the file always&nbsp;comes back to the D: drive is there some way to reduce the amount of time to run the scan since the warning message</p>
<p>"preliminary scan results show that malicious or potentially unwanted software might exist on your system. You can review detected items when the scan is completed."</p>
<p>has always appeared during the scan of&nbsp;the D drive? I have been unable to locate the position of the offending file&nbsp;in the file system as the scan goes past the area too fast. Could the offender be removed manually if the location is known?</p>

<p>Hello Bruce Hagen</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the solution you sent several times but I don't seem to have had any success. I've run the Microsoft Security Essentials and as the scan progresses through the files on my computer I found it very time consuming because of something Microsoft
 put in the security system. &nbsp;At what seems to be very short intervals the screen goes blank and generally there is something about due to not using the it is being shut down. I literally have to sit and watch to prevent this because when this happens the scan
 seems to come to a halt. I have got the scan to finish several times while making notes where I write down the material&nbsp;that appears on the screen.&nbsp;I originally was able to find the name of the problem file which was on the cover sheet you posted.&nbsp; I&nbsp;followed
 the steps here: as best as I could <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://malwaretips.com/blogs/trojan-win32-dynamer-ac-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">https://malwaretips.com/blogs/trojan-win32-dynamer-ac-removal/</span></a></span>&nbsp;and
 found some problems. Evidently this virus has been around for a while since some of the directions seem to be out of date. One of the links has an out of date something which I don't know what to do about. The first time I ran the scan I found the first portion
 of the scan was C:/and the latter portion&nbsp;was D:\preload\Base.win-&gt;(Image 3079)program Files (x86)HP Games\Polar Golfer\golf-wt.exe-&gt; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp; with the file Trojan:Win32/ somewhere near that file name. I have been unable to locate the file within the HP
 Games area because I don't know how to find it. It appears I might have been able to successfully remove the file more than once but it comes right back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it seems the file always&nbsp;comes back to the D: drive is there some way to reduce the amount of time to run the scan since the warning message</p>
<p>"preliminary scan results show that malicious or potentially unwanted software might exist on your system. You can review detected items when the scan is completed."</p>
<p>has always appeared during the scan of&nbsp;the D drive? I have been unable to locate the position of the offending file&nbsp;in the file system as the scan goes past the area too fast. Could the offender be removed manually if the location is known?</p>

<p><span>I need to address this to Bruce Hagen and Le Boule thanking them for replying to my original message. I have followed through on what both told me to do but having
 just run another scan using Microsoft Security Essentials I’m forced to report the same thing I originally came here to inquire about. The scan was completed on 1858857 items and after reading the results it seems the result is telling me the same condition
 exists after running numerous scans using the different links I have available to me.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My problems began when I decided to take Microsoft’s advice found in the explanation on the Microsoft Security Essentials pages after reading the directions provided
 on the Microsoft Safety &amp; Security Center which I’m going to insert here:</span></p>
<p><sub><span>“<em>Because computers can appear to function normally when infected, it's a good idea to run this tool regularly even if your computer

</span></sub></em></p>
<p><em><sub><span>might reduce the effectiveness of your antivirus protection—or eliminate protection completely</span></sub></em><sub><span>.”</span></sub></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have used the MSE on my computer for some time now after having some bad results when using one of the paid antivirus software products. I allowed the antivirus software
 to expire since I felt the Microsoft product was doing a commendable job and it was going to be my protection.
</span></p>
<p><span>The antivirus people were not going to be deterred by the fact I hadn’t paid any attention to their notices that I should send them more money and I began to get several
 times daily pop up screens to remind me they were waiting. The last time I had needed them to help me with a problem it seemed every solution they could recommend had some extra cost associated with it. I finally made a phone call and after waiting for some
 amount of time someone began to talk to me. As usual the solution was to take charge of my computer to remove all the offenders installed software. During this process I was informed I had a computer virus which needed expert removal which necessitated my
 being turned over to a salesperson. I told this person I wouldn’t be using their services any longer and could they remove the software that was constantly reminding me they needed my money. After them being disagreeable I finally just hung up. When I ran
 the Microsoft Scan a short time later I found the virus I’m trying to get rid of now. I’m not saying they installed it but I didn’t have it before that point in time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now I want to point out I’m a published author who has been paid to write and I can read, write, and I do understand the English language. But read the following and
 then go back and read the previous item from Microsoft’s Safety &amp; Security Center I tell me if there isn’t a major contradiction contained in what Microsoft is telling me to do.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><em><span>Get a free safety scan</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>To scan your computer for malicious and unwanted software, see the Microsoft Safety Scanner.
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malware. It works with your existing
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>antivirus software, but is not a replacement for antivirus software</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve done a cut and paste from the above referenced Microsoft documents.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now I want to point out I’m a published author who has been paid to write and I can read, write, and I do understand the English language. In one place I’m told
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>“But If you use Windows, you do not need to pay for antivirus software.“</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And then I also find
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>“It works with your existing antivirus software, but is not a replacement for antivirus software.”
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There appears to be a direct contradiction contained in what Microsoft is telling me to do. And in real life I run the scan hit the button I’m directed to click on
 to the remove the offender and get no result that can be discerned. contradiction contained in what Microsoft is telling me to do. I appreciate the effort by the two people who responded to my request but there are problems in what they have proposed which
 I don’t know how to deal with. The first responder has sent me to a link which has me using Emsisoft Emergency Kit which brings up a pop up saying “The signature of Emsisoft Emergency Kit.exe is corrupt or invalid.” The second responder also sent a link to
 Emisisoft<span>&nbsp; </span>Emergency Kit which worked and I was able to do a scan with it. So now I have used every link I was sent following the directions and the virus is still present according to the free Microsoft Safety Scanner.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One further thing as the Microsoft Security Essentials scan progresses I have made notes as to where it is scanning and the amount of time since the scan began and
 the location being scanned and have these notes showing the location being scanned which always has shown the location of the offender to be in the same place. This location has been D:\preload\base.win-&gt;(Image 3079)Program Files9(x86)HP Games/PolarGolfer/golf-wt.exe-&gt;(EXEmb)
 which is the best I’ve been able to copy it down due to the rapidity of the scan. I do have last night’s scan showing the location of the offending virus between items scanned 1274562 and1274614 which is the closest I’ve been able to do a prt sc and ctrl V
 to a Word Document. That location was as close as I could get (Image 3079) Program Files (x86) HewlettPackard/setup(x86) HPGames Polar Golfer which I don’t think is completely correct. I hope someone can use some of this to locate this virus so it can be removed.

            <p>Hello Jose Antonio Ponton Posada</p>
<p>
</p><p>The threat has the name Trojan:Win32//Dynamer!ac on the scan result sheet. I have run the suggestions from other people on the site but even after going through on every suggestion there are no positive results. On the History page&nbsp;All items detected is
 the only thing selected. the scan was done with Microsoft Security Essentials. The computer is a Hewlett Packard Pavilion dv6y-6123cl laptop. With Windows 7 which I like a lot better than the laest trash from Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the error code is Ox800700df and with that is a note "The file size exceeds the limit allowed and cannot be saved."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each result shows Quarantined&nbsp;&nbsp;for the scan but since the file size is too large the quarantine fails each time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The location is listed under Items and seems to be constant each time as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>D:\preload\base.wim-&gt;(Image 3079)\Program Files(x86)\HP Games\Polar Golfer\golf-WT.exe-&gt;(EXEEmb)-&gt;(EXEEMB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it can't be quarantined and is listed as Severe with remove the software immediately. and it ststes This program is dangerous and executes commands from an attacker.</p>

            <p>Hello Don I see you are the Community Moderator so hopefully you can explain how to use the system. I have tried to respond directly to the answers I've gotten but unfortunately I can't seem to get things to work out as I intended.</p>
<p>I took copious notes but tying the results to what my notes seem to be saying doesn't come easy with the modus operando the forum uses. Is there anyplace that gives n honest answer to using the system in an intuitive manner? I read and reread the answers
 so far but it doesn't seem as if everything has worked out. One of the links I got was either corrupt or invalid and I attempted to explain&nbsp; that but to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to alleviate the problem I have but it looks as if I'm going to have to go to the windows 8 machine I have never actually used because to start with it doesn't have any easy way to shut it off. At this time I'd like to move as far from Microsoft
 as possible. I started with computers when we started the &nbsp;space and nuclear programs and since then Microsoft has been nothing but an expensive mess that doesn't seem be solve able. Its always been hard to work with..

<p>Hi Team,</p>

<p>If we enable mailbox audit on a mailbox and if any of the global administrator deletes that mailbox itself will that event be captured in the&nbsp;audit log?</p>
<p>If yes then how do we track that log?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>hi mitesh,</span></p>
<p><span>after the mailbox audit log feature is enabled, please let your
<strong>administrator</strong> follow the steps below to export the log:</span><br />
<span>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">connect to exchange online using remote powershell</a>.</span><br />
<span>2.&nbsp;grant specific permissions: add the administrator to the following admin roles groups (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a> (eac) &gt;
<strong>permissions</strong> &gt; <strong>admin roles</strong>).</span><br />
<span><strong>recipient management</strong>,
<strong>records management</strong> and <strong>organization management</strong></span><br />
<span>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=5e2998de-1472-4888-9c33-9b4f3ec2892d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5e2998de-1472-4888-9c33-9b4f3ec2892d" /></a></span><br />
<span>3.&nbsp;configure outlook web app to allow xml attachments by running the command below:</span><br />
<span><em>set-owamailboxpolicy -identity owamailboxpolicy-default -allowedfiletypes @{add='.xml'}</em></span><br />
<span>4.&nbsp;in eac, go to <strong>compliance management</strong> &gt;
<strong>auditing</strong>.</span><br />
<span>5.&nbsp;click <strong>export mailbox audit logs</strong>.</span><br />
<span>6.&nbsp;configure the following search criteria for exporting the entries from the mailbox audit log:</span><br />
<span>1)&nbsp;<strong>start and end dates&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> select the date range for the entries to include the exported file.</span><br />
<span>2)&nbsp;<strong>mailboxes to search audit log for&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> select the mailboxes to retrieve audit log entries for.</span><br />
<span>3)&nbsp;<strong>type of non-owner access</strong></span><br />
<span>4)&nbsp;<strong>recipients&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> select the users to send the mailbox audit log to.</span><br />
<span>7.&nbsp;click <strong>export</strong>.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f2c0e76a-ae27-4893-ae94-7e1b94bf61f5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df2c0e76a-ae27-4893-ae94-7e1b94bf61f5" /></a></span><br />
<span>note: microsoft exchange retrieves entries in the mailbox audit log that meet your search criteria, saves them to a file named searchresult.xml, and then attaches the xml file to an email message sent to the recipients
 that you specified.</span></p>
<p><span>if you’ve successfully exported the audit log, you’ll receive a message sent from exchange. in exchange online, it may be a few days before receiving this message. the mailbox audit log (named searchresult.xml)
 will be attached to this message. if you’ve correctly configured outlook web app to allow xml attachments, you can download the attached xml file. more detailed information can be found in
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj150552(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">export mailbox audit logs</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>please feel free to post back if you have any problems when performing the steps.</span></p>
