            Yes, it's completely possible. Once a hacker has gained control of your computer they can do pretty much anything these please, and you will probably be the last one to find out.

<h3> r b brown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t exit screen saver</h2>
                    <p>Since the latest system update a few days ago, I can't exit from screen saver mode in the normal fashion.</p>
<p>Rather than exiting to my desktop when I click the mouse or hit "enter" or any other key board input, I have to hit Cntl-Alt-Delete to get to the task manager, then cancel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen saver settings are unchanged from when it worked before the recent system updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It enters screen saver on schedule, it simply doesn't exit.</p>

<p>I reset the screen saver to use "photos" instead of "photo gallery". Problem solved.</p>
<p>Apparently the updated Windows 10 does not play well with Windows Live Photo Gallery.</p>

<h3> kiki wardhana ajie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 font change into unrecognize font and cannot login into windows</h2>
                    The problem begin after I uninstalling game software. After uninstall process complete, the overall windows and desktop icon become blank. Then I restart the system and in windows login screen appear unrecognize font (seems like ascii characters). Also
 I cannot login using current win password. Its probably caused by font changing of overall system, including input character.

<h2>            How play a .WAV file in Edge&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I receive a Gmail message with an attached .WAV file I cannot play the .WAV file by clicking it in Edge. The only way I can play it is to save the file to my local hard drive and play the saved file. Is there a way to play the .WAV file in the browser?
 Thanks.</p>

<p>You need to enter the code provided with the game and then access the DLC from within the in-game marketplace, and the DLC should be free.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Please note that the most recent pack (Champions Bundle, I think) was not included with the War Games Pass and will require separate payment.</p>

    <title>Onkyo Surround Sound Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluedevil0101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onkyo Surround Sound Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone! Here is my problem. First My setup:</p>
<p>Xbox one is connected to my Onkyo HTS5500 Home Theater system. My Directv DVR box is plugged into the Xbox One as well. They are all connected via HDMI cables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the problems:</p>
<p>A buzz and hum shows up when I select 5.1 and 7.1 uncompressed that is not present on DTS and never existed in my home theater system prior to the introduction of the X1. When I disconnect the X1 and hook up my Blu Ray player and Cable box via HDMI into
 my system I get perfect 5.1 and 7.1. There is no hum at all and everything sounds perfect whether DTS, Dolby, or uncompressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second problem is that every time I select 5.1 and 7.1 uncompressed I get a strange output that equates to stereo plus center channel and subwoofer. The rear speakers and additional 2.0 in the front never have any audio coming out of them whether watching
 a blu ray, streaming 5.1 on amazon instant, playing a game, or watching television from my cable box through xbox one (and yes I have the beta 5.1 turned on).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried calling support three times and talked with a representative on chat and no one has an answer for me. The only answer I was given on the chat was that my Onkyo receiver is incompatible with the Xbox one.... yet it supports every option the Xbox
 1 puts out. Plus I never gave the representative the make or model of my receiver.</p>
<p>So anyone else having similar issues? Anyone have a fix? I am pretty tech savy and honestly have tried every setting and read numerous articles and scoured the web... there seems to be nothing on this issue.</p>

<p>I have the Beta 5.1 turned on under troubleshooting. Still no 5.1. Currently been on hold for 42 mins and they still have no idea at tech support. Looks like I will sadly be returning. My 7 year old devices can handle audio properly. What a shame.</p>

 Returning. Later.</p>

<p>When I watch a blu-ray (Thor), I only here the music, no voices or any other sounds. When I plug my HDMI Cable to my blu-ray player -&gt; everything works fine.</p>

<p>I thought the same thing. But when I leave everything the same. Unplug my xbox one, take the same hdmi and plug it into a bluray player on the same input it sounds flawless. Woke up and still no buzz. Just wondering now if anyone has the issue of 5.1 and
 7.1 not coming out in 5.1 or 7.1?</p>

<p>I have an Onkyo TX-NR727 Receiver, and I'm not having any issues with either buzzing or 5.1 and 7.1 not working. &nbsp;Have you tried using different cables to see if that is the issue? I have my Xbox One and a DirecTV DVR plugged into my Onkyo, as well as a
 PS4.</p>

<h2>            My Logitech USB receiver wont connect my keyboard or mouse, what to do&#63;</h2>
                    As the title says, my USB receiver wont connect to my keyboard or mouse though it says they are connected.<br />
Neither of them work.<br />
Right now I'm using alternative keyboard and mouse and I really want to use my other set.<br />
Help? :(<br />

    <title>Unable to log in to a Microsoft Account on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> obsidian0dragon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to log in to a Microsoft Account on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Lately, I have been experiencing issues logging into my Microsoft Account, ONLY on my Windows 10 computer as every other log in works just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using a Local Account (Due to some very unfortunate Windows Profile Glitches&nbsp;a year ago I had to transfer all my old data [Desktop, Documents, Pictures, etc.] onto a new profile) and wish to change it back to a Microsoft Linked account so I can download
 apps from the Windows Store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my issue is that I receive several errors depending on where I try to log into my account on my PC.</p>
<p>If I try to log into The Xbox App on My PC, I receive this error code:&nbsp;0x80070520.</p>
<p>If I try to Log into the Windows Store, We encountered an error, Please try signing in again later.</p>
<p>If I try to Log in under Settings, It states: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is here already. Another User on this device already uses this Microsoft account, So you can't use it here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Following that Last entry, NONE OF MY OTHER PROFILES ARE SIGNED INTO THIS ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well, If I attempt to create a NEW Profile with my Microsoft account, After I enter my Email, it Flashes that "It Worked" But then returns to a screen that states: We can't add a user to the device right now. It's Probably our fault. Please try again.</p>
<p>As to which I did, And... I think you know where that went...</p>
<p>Following It prompted me to make it a Local account which is not what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried MANY things to fix this, and now it is getting to the point where my research has concluded with nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Editing the registry, (deleting the key for my email)</p>
<p>Editing Local Security Policy</p>
<p>(Both of these methods found within similar Microsoft Support forums)</p>
<p>Deleting This PC off of my Account from a browser on Microsoft.com</p>
<p>Etc....</p>
<p>All I can do now is ask those with more information than me.</p>
<p>Please, PLEASE... Help, Thank you...</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Created a New Local Profile, it allowed me to log into The Windows Store, But still gave me the exact same issue when I tried to associate my Microsoft Account with it.</p>

            Hi Obsidian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You said you have a Local Account?  Are you able to sign into it?  If so can you go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info, and click the link to Change to a Microsoft Account?  Does this work?
<br />
<br />If not go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People to see what other accounts are on the PC?  Which are those?  
<br />
<br />You said you cannot create a new MS account but you can create a Local Account.  In that case go ahead and create a Local Admin account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>.  Is the link now there to Change to a MS Account in Your Info?  
<br />
<br />If all of these fail try running the Microsoft Accounts troubleshooter at <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/microsoft-accounts-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/microsoft-account...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you for your quick and detailed response, And to answer your questions...</p>
<p>I am able to sign into my Local account, However, I just cannot link a Microsoft Account to it, It doesn't allow me as shown in issue 3 of the OP.</p>
<p>And I did proceed to make a new Local account Profile and attempt to link it to my Microsoft Account, However, It still proceeded to give me the exact same response as in my original Profile.</p>
<p>And the Troubleshooter told me to check my internet connection for a Syncing Issue "Cannot Connect to Sync Service", however, I am directly connected to the internet in a Desktop PC build with an Ethernet Port.</p>
<p>And that "Rootcauses found and Created Logs" However once the troubleshooter is closes it results in the same issue once I try to log in again.</p>

            Where in your OP did you specify you'd tried to convert the existing local account to a Microsoft Account?  I have read it 3 times and don't see where you said that.
<br />
<br />But from all you describe is seems you have the frequent problem we deal with here every day in Window 10 which is account corruption.  But since you can't even create a new Account, what I'd do is try the Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't fix it then follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />So you'll have the media to do either or both, I'd create the bootable media now by installing Media Creation tool, open tool and choose Create Installation media, insert 8+gb flash stick to write the media.  
<br />
<br />Then open the media to run Setup to try the Repair Install.   If that fails boot the media to delete all partitions (otherewise it is NOT a Clean Install) down to Unallocated Space, click next to begin install.  Follow the tutorial above and if you do you'll  never have another problem, just like hundreds of thousands of others in Windows 10 and millions did in Windows 7.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You can try to get the Repair Upgrade to run following the additional steps in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> which resolve about 90% of them.
<br />
<br />But it's obvious you're fighting significant enough corruption that I would invest now in the gold standard  Clean Install:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. From what I can tell it seems like you may have purchased GTA premium Online Bundle and did not receive all the content. Have you checked in your
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Order History</a> to make sure the correct version of the game was purchased? You may also want to go to your Games &amp; Apps section then press the menu button on the GTA picture and go to "Manage Game and Add ons" in the ready to install section there you may
 find your missing content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know with a reply</p>

            Yes, I did check the order receipt to make sure. I bought the 150.00 bundle when it was on sale for 80.00 or so and I've checked "manage game and add ons" but it still acts as if I didnt purchase the bundle.

            The "cash" you bought for the game will just show up - it's not a specific DLC to download. Reason behind this is because you can buy them multiple times.&nbsp; Check your cash balance in game, if it hasn't shown up there then it needs investigating. :)

<p>Hello Crow,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our recommendation for missed items in-game is to ensure that the menu for GTA Online is checked where one would find the Criminal Starter Pack in case this is an item that needs to be accessed from the in-game store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After confirmation of the purchase as well, with no reception of the item promised within the purchase may need further assistance from the developer, so
<strong><a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rockstar Support</a></strong> does have an option for submitting requests/inquiries as a way of getting direct assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some options when on the Xbox One console are to <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remove the Profile</a></strong>, or
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Restart the Console</a></strong> to ensure that the items did not sync properly and might appear after following these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give this information a shot, we hope this helps, and wish you the very best!</p>

<p>Since the license is tied to your gamer tag, as well as downloaded to your initial console, try using a different account on the same console.

<p>If this doesn't work, try deleting the game and re-installing it. </p>

<div>it asks for permission and even though the yes key is visible i cannot click it</div>
<div>2-no i was but after typing "net user anmol/active:no" in the command prompt it is hidden as anmol was the administrator account</div>
<div>3-no my pc is stand alone</div>
<div>either u can help me solve the uac problem or help me bring back or unhide the admin account</div>
<div><br />
<div>u can check all that i have done in the question details and for the uac when i decrease its security and click on ok it again asks for permission</div>

            I'm not really sure what you wanted to achieve by re-naming the admin account and then disabling it.
<div>You can only enable a disabled account from another admin account.</div>
<div>If you do not have another admin account active then you are basically stuffed.</div>
<div>Your only option is to re-install Windows.</div>

<h2>            Blue Screen Error - 0x0000008E Issue with disk space</h2>
                    
<p>original title:&nbsp;Continual BSODs possibly linked to Firefox, BCCode 1000008e</p>
<p>Been having the same problem since last November, manageable but more than a bit annoying.&nbsp; Though similar happened a couple of times before November, it's gotten a lot worse since I moved onto a wireless network.&nbsp; The last 'Technical Information' on the
 BSOD ran as follows:</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0x0000008E (0xC0000005, 0x00000000, 0xA17E0A9C, 0x00000000)</p>
<p>The BSOD itself always talks about having adequate disk space (have a third of my hard drive free) and disabling BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing (have never knowingly seen BIOS, never mind disabling parts of it). It mainly crashes when I
 open new tabs on Firefox, particularly at about 10 or more, and especially when running iTunes in the background - system has been known to BSOD at random points too, when logging on and starting again after sleeping. Once saw an error message specifically
 relating to sbhips.exe, but I disabled this (on Sunbelt Firewall) and the problem is continuing.&nbsp; I'm suspicious it has something to do with the drivers on my wireless dongle (Netgear G USB, WG111), but the last time I messed around with these on a Belkin
 wireless adapter the thing broke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea how to put the dump file on here as a quick Google got me up the path of downloading debugging software and I didn't much fancy that.&nbsp; I'll paste the info from the Problem Reports in Control Panel below, but if anyone could advise what other
 info is needed or how to open the dump file, I'd be grateful.</p>

 too fast to copy the message, go to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Advanced / Startup and Recover / and uncheck the box to Automatically Restart.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and
 select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will freeze the program on the bluescreen so you have time to copy the information.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible (if it is
 a driver or device): </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also use Skydrive</span></span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dmp and txt files related to the error which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span>oot into Safe mode with networking and see if
 the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going to start /
 search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click
 on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft
 Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

<h2>            Internet Explorer Update&#63;</h2>
                    Is there going to be an internet explorer update for surface 2?&nbsp; Many websites I go to say that they are no longer supporting the version of internet explorer and I need to upgrade to Edge, Chrome, or Firefox but they are not available in the store.&nbsp; I
 get that Microsoft wouldn't want a competing browser but if they aren't going to update IE then I would like another option.

<p>Microsoft is providing no more support for the Surface RT and Surface 2 tablets.&nbsp; Both are now 'defunct'.&nbsp; Most other apps on the tablet will start to fail as well and the Store will get to the point that it will no longer work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the only thing you can do with it is use the office suite, or use it as a digital picture frame (I have a RT myself).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend to get a Surface Go if you want a low priced model, small form factor, and the operating system can be upgraded to the full version of Windows 10 vice the "S" version it comes with.&nbsp; That way, you can install anything you want on it and
 it will have the "Edge" web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboard is not compatible with the Go from the "RT models" and the office suite is not free on the Go model.</p>

</p><blockquote>Is there going to be an internet explorer update for surface 2? &nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Which OS do you have?&nbsp; W8?&nbsp; That would be IE10 and that would explain your symptom.&nbsp; Then why not upgrade to W8.1 (at least).&nbsp; That would give you IE11 which is what W10 still supports and still works with most sites.&nbsp; Otherwise, can you give an example
 of a site that you are having trouble with?&nbsp; I have a Surface RT and could test a problem site with its IE11.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible explanation for this symptom would be trying to use IE's so-called Compatibility view.&nbsp; That is definitely an obsolete idea.&nbsp; It tries to emulate IE7's IE5 support!&nbsp; Most sites would then tell you to change your browser for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, when you are really stuck for connecting to an obstinate site there is always the IE (Desktop) Developer Tools (F12) for its Emulation tab.&nbsp; There you can pick a User-Agent string that a site may find more to its liking and then provide some level
 of functionality there.&nbsp; Again, if you post a problem URL someone would be able to give you more specific suggestions.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using skype on my windows 10 laptop for almost a year. Recently i have updated the application and it stopped worked. When i try to login it does not give me any response. It just return to the password prompt screen. Tried with different skype
 accounts and didnt work. Even uninstalled the application and started fresh, still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same account is logging in browsers. Currently as a workaround i am using Skype for web plugin. I have seen the same question couple of times and no solution was proposed. Tried to access customer service page,but it is redirecting to community page
 only. Please help in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            LOCKED - What To Do If You&#39;re Locked Out Of Your Live ID Account</h2>
                    
<p>I spent two weeks getting my password reset after I locked myself out for multiple incorrect password attempts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty much everything that could have gone wrong, did.&nbsp; I couldn't remember the answer to my security question, the option to send a password to my cell phone failed and after a week of wrestling with the Live ID support staff, they determined that I hadn't
 given them enough information to prove that I was me and locked my account permanently and stopped responding to my messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called XBOX Live's support hotline once and they said there was nothing they could do, but they did update my credit card information which I thought was kind of odd.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days went by and no reply from the Live ID staff, so I called XBOX again and they gave me the holy grail, an actual telephone number to get in touch with Microsoft :O</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called the number and gave the tech my pin number associated with the issue thread I had started two weeks earlier and he said that he couldn't do anything personally but he'd re-escalate the thread to the Live ID group and they'd email me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two more days go by and then yesterday morning I opened my inbox and found that I'd had my account magically restored!&nbsp; With no further information given by me.&nbsp; So what changed in those two days to make them decide I was actually me, I don't know, but I
 have my account back and thought this might help others since I've seen multiple posts about this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CALL THIS NUMBER IF THEY WONT HELP YOU: 1 800 642 7676</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked for me anyway.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<p>to reset the password on an account you need to contact the windows live team not the xbox live team</p>
<p>noone has access to your password</p>
<p>like the xbox support told you</p>
<p>the windows live team is seperate and can only be reached by forums or the windows live id validation form</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(most likely you weren't passing the validation form)</p>
<p>also with the locked out status you must wait the time period it states&nbsp; depends on how many tries you do</p>

<p>Windows Live support can be altered using that telephone number. &nbsp;You have to start the process online, but if that doesn't work as it didn't for me, call that number and re-open the ticket.</p>

<p>you dont need to reopen the ticket</p>
<p>what you need to do is UPDATE the ticket</p>
<p>there is key things that have to be met before a password reset email can be sent or an windows live id account be reset.</p>
<p>if you forget all the details then there is nothing that can be done as you are required to prove who you are.</p>
<p><a href="https://windowslivehelp.com/PasswordReset.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowslivehelp.com/PasswordReset.aspx</a><br />
will help you but you MUST answer honestly on the windows live id validation form</p>
<p>escalation to ms will not help unless you update the ticket or pass validation of who you are</p>
<p>if you fail validation or get enough but still don't pass validation they will make a private forum for you to update your ticket</p>
<p>including previous history of the account and only info that the original account holder would know</p>
<p><strong>noone can randomly call ms and ask that a password be reset without proving who you are for a windows live id</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;as that is A security issue</p>
<p>this article covers the password reset proccess and how to answer the questions nessarily for a reset</p>

<h2>            Not Possible to Create Ad Hoc Network for Live Music Applications with Open Sound Control &#40;OSC&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased a new machine after my old one began to age and deteriorate to the point of becoming unusable. One feature of my old Windows 8.1 machine I used quite a bit was the creation of an ad hoc network for controlling parameters in Max/MSP (audio
 processing software) with a mobile device through TouchOSC (mobile app for using Open Sound Control to communicate with Max and other software). I used this feature very often, as I am frequently performing in venues where internet connections are either not
 present or unavailable (and ad hoc networks are always more reliable since there will not be Wi-Fi outages or any other interference).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new machine has an Intel Wireless AC 9462 adapter, and I was unable to create a network as I was used to (through command prompt, then netsh wlan commands). After trying all the possible options shown on the web, I made my way to Intel's website, which
 lists my adapter among other newer models, and mentions that these all implement Windows' new WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI), which no longer supports creation of ad hoc networks. It also suggests trying the new Hot Spot feature to share an already established
 internet connection. However, this does not work in my case since the only goal of using ad hoc connections is to get my computer to receive OSC commands from a tablet without needing an internet connection!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For everything I have seen, it is not possible to do this at all; which is somewhat of a huge roadblock to musicians and artists who like to incorporate technology in their work (well, for those of us who are PC/Windows users). I am however wondering if
 this feature will someday be available again, or if I am just going to have to rely on finding some type of external hardware (some USB external adapter or something of the sort). While the new Hot Spot feature seems nice, creating mobile hot spots is not
 the only reason why users make ad hoc connections... </p>

<h2>            I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m afraid of getting banned due to this mistake.</h2>
                    
<p>Sorry if this isn't the right place to put this.<br />
<br />
My original account was banned for marketplace theft. Yeah, I know, extremely stupid and childish.<br />
Well anyway, I was informed that I was allowed get a new membership if &nbsp;my other one was banned,
<br />
But instead of making a brand new account, I was lazy and just decided to make my friends old silver account into a gold one, since he hadn't &nbsp;come over to my house for a long time. I have been using it for about two weeks, and in that little time I have done
 a lot of stuff on it.<br />
<br />
But then I noticed on my achievement list, I had 10G in one of the pirated arcade games.<br />
I then remembered that months earlier my friend and I played that game, when I was on my old account and he was on the account I'm using now, and I panicked.<br />
<br />
So could you spare this account from getting banned please? I was already banned once and I'd hate to get punished twice for the same thing. If I had just started fresh with a new account, you wouldn't care, right? That's sort of what I did. I just forgot that
 my friend was using that account when we played the game.<br />
<br />
My new gamertag is Tidus178. My old gamertag is MaslerenceK<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You should be aware that using someone else's XBL account is against the Terms of Service and that alone would be reason enough to have enforcement action taken against you, especially
 since you openly admit in a public forum that you are using someone else's account. Doesn't matter if you have permission or not.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It isn't up to the general community but if I had to stake a say in the matter I would say ban that account too. It would seem that your friend knew that the game was pirated, if
 he didn't then you did, and that would be good enough a reason. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">No amount of begging or pleading will make the XBL PET not suspend/ban an account. If it has violated the Terms of Service/Code of Conduct it will face enforcement action, no exceptions.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Problem is you didn't start fresh, you basically stole your friends account and used that for your own. I think you should feel the full extent of the Ban Hammer. But that is just
 my opinion. </span></p>

    <title>Windows Media Player stops burning a disc just before it&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rap game teddy roosevelt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player stops burning a disc just before it&#39;s complete.</h2>
                    Yes, so I'm attempting to burn a CD, and whenever I try to do so, it stops right at the end, ejects the disc, and leaves the message:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Windows Media Player encountered an error while burning. Verify that the burner is connected properly and that the disc is clean and not damaged."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried lowering the burn speed (to the lowest possible setting, though it still takes only a minute or so to reach the end of a &gt;1 hour disc), but that didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it helps, I'm running Windows 8 on an Acer Aspire|M. And the CD Drive is within the laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried using iTunes, and that also failed (but at the beginning), with "Unknown error [4310]".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>-T.R.</div>

I want to set the record straight. I do not cheat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 2 games that i refer to are Rise of the tomb raider and Rayman Legends.</p><p>In Rise of the tomb raider the achievements are as follows</p><p>1 - Skillful raider - current TS 1/1/1753 - should be +- 29/2/2016</p><p>2 - Happy camper - current TS 1/1/1753 - should be +-30/3/2016</p><p>3 - Witchcraft for beginners - current TS 1/1/175

            Hey there, it looks as though these Achievements may have been unlocked while the console was offline or not connected to the service. As such the dates look wonky, there won't be anything we can do to change the unlock date on the Achievements. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope you have a great day.

            <p>Hey there,&nbsp;that is just the problem, this console was not offline at the time these achievements popped. It is impossible to even load into endurance mode on Tomb raider if you were&nbsp;not connected to xbox live.&nbsp; Please i need some help, i have been basically labeled as a cheater by having been placed on&nbsp;Non-stat tracking, that goes against ever moral fiber of mine to be labeled as such. As i said to them, how much of a moron would i have been to cheat and put a date of 1753 on these achievements. There has to be something we can do? Could you remove these achievements and i will go and work at getting them again? Delete the whole games if need be and i will go and redo it all again.? Please Sir I&nbsp;beg of you,&nbsp;I&nbsp;need help, don't leave me in the lurch, please. Picture me on my knees, i am that desperate.</p>
