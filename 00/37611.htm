<h2>            &#91;windows10&#93; MSVCR100.dll Missing even after reinstalling Microsoft&#39;s Visual C&#43;&#43; Redistributable Package</h2>
                    <p>Hello MS community,</p>
<p>I have recently updated to windows 10, I am trying to run a certain game and I keep getting "MSVCR100.dll / MSVCP100.dll not found" errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated I have tried to uninstall and reinstall the Microsoft's Visual C++ Redistributable package (both the x86 and x64 programs), I have also tried sfc /scannow option from the CMD (which prints no missing files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a post says I should edit the registries, but said registries do not exist when i enter the regedit tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution to this situation?</p>
<p />

<h2>            How to set send deleting files to recycle bin</h2>
                    <p>Original title ; media player 12 deletes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>File security issue: I don't know whoever allowed wmplayer 12 to permanently delete files from the hard drive when I press delete in the library. Whatever happened to Recycle Bin mode? Apparently, only 'right click' 'remove from list' is safe. Lucky me I
 have a backup. If there's an option to recycle instead of permanently delete, it should be default. I don't remember Windows XP's media player doing this unacceptable cleanup.</p>

Either keyboard can be used (even with Touch!) in conjunction with the Magnifier in Loupe mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Win-+&nbsp; Ctrl-Alt-L&nbsp;&nbsp; (Win-Esc or find the Magnifier control to turn it off.)</p>

<h2>            I rolled back from version 1511 and now Windows Apps are corrupt and won&#39;t update.</h2>
                    <p>A couple of days ago I updated to Windows 10 Pro version 1511 and found that the multi screen with different resolutions didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 1920x1080 as my main screen and a 1440x900 secondary screen for my Skype and system monitoring applications when I'm gaming. All I can do is one screen at a time and I get the correct native resolution otherwise both at the same time will reduces
 the resolution on my main monitor to 1600x900. I have tried multiple drivers and none of them fixed it so I deemed it to we a Windows fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So with this I decided to roll back the update to my restore point but now all of the Windows Apps are corrupt.</p>
<p>- Twitter App</p>
<p>- OneNote App</p>
<p>- Xbox App</p>
<p>- Microsoft Photos App</p>
<p>- Windows Calculator App</p>
<p>- Get Office App</p>
<p>- Films &amp; TV App</p>
<p>- Microsoft .Net Native Framework Package 1.2.23205.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like a fix for this as I use Xbox App to Stream Xbox One a lot.</p>

            Hi HE.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Let it run as long as you can wait, then if necessary power off by pressing and holding the power button.  Wait 30 minutes to cool off then power back on to see if it rolls back.  
<br />
<br />It sounds like the Upgrade is choking on a corrupted install.  Even if it finishes it may not perform well or have problems.  This is because  in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Try updating to 1903 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

<div>i had posted a question about my ext. harddrive, my windows xp media player will recognize new music that i add off of it, but all my computers that have windows 7 wont. then i got thinking when i add the new music on the harddrive to the media playyer
 on xp i go tool bar and click file then click add to library by searching computer and it adds to media player library. but windows seven dont have this option. i did notice if you click file, then manage library, then music it allows me to add my ext. harddrive
 (e drive) to library list. on one computer it loaded new music and videos found on harddrive, on two computers it just found music, then i downloaded a song and a video onto harddrive, plugged into computers and media player said it was updating library ,
 yet it they never found the new files. why did they change? xp was so easy. new is not always better!!!!!</div>

            Hi Bob,<br />
<br />
From the above description, Windows Media Player is not picking the new music on the external hard drive.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to run the following troubleshooters.<br />
<br />
Open the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter<br />
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/open-the-windows-media-player-settings-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/open-the-windows-media-player-settings-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p><br />
Open the Windows Media Player Library troubleshooter<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-windows-media-player-library-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-windows-media-player-library-troubleshooter</a></p>
<br />
<span>Post us the results once you try the above steps.</span><br />

            You need to use a headset with a microphone then if it is picking up background noise.
<br />Some built-in microphones there is no way to prevent that.
<br />I teach virtual classes and have to do this or students will hear a car driving by my window.
<br />You can get some cheap good ones from amazon or best buy.

                    Hi, I find that Photo's automatic enhancement works well for 80%-90% of my pics. Is there any way to automatically enhance all the pics in a folder instead of doing so for each pic separately?&nbsp; &nbsp;

            No, there isn't.&nbsp; But have you blocked updates to Photos?&nbsp; Automatic enhancement was discontinued a while back.&nbsp; The latest version requires you to enter Edit to make general enhancements.&nbsp; It works fine but some don't like the extra steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>What you're looking for is only just now in the early stages of development (see PhotoLemur and Perfectly Clear) but Photos' approach seems OK since you have to compare and potentially adjust each image anyway (plus it's free).&nbsp; The only drawback is that
 you have to keep going back into Edit for each picture, which is not needed for the above apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to post an enhancement request to the Feedback Hub to simplify the task of enhancing each image.&nbsp; If Photos stayed in Edit mode and automatically advanced to the next picture it would be great.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you remember making recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does this happen only when you play video files?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>You may enable Direct3D and check if the issue persists.Run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (Dxdiag.exe). To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>dxdiag</b> in the Start Search box, and then press <b>ENTER</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>Display</b> tab, verify that
<b>DirectDraw Acceleration</b> and <b>Direct3D Acceleration</b> are selected under
<b>DirectX Features.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If either of these lines shows a
<b>Disabled</b> status, click <b>Enable</b> for that line.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If multiple video adapters are installed in your computer, repeat step 2 for each
<b>Display</b> tab in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>If the above step fails update display driver and check if the issue persists. Follow the steps in the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>
<p>If the above step fails restart computer in clean boot and check if the issue persist. F<span>ollow “step 1” in the link to enable to clean boot:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<span>Follow the step 7 from the article to “Reset the computer to start as usual”, after performing the clean boot troubleshooting.</span>

<h2>            Medion with MSI MS-7091 mobo and Windows 7 32-bit Home Premium has problems recognizing RAM</h2>
                    <p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks ago I received a message from an ex-colleague with the question if I could revise her computer: a very old computer from the year 2006 (a Medion (German), MSI MS-7091 mobo, 2x 512 MB DDR SDRAM, 1024 MB nVidia, BIOS-version G) running Windows
 XP, setup as an all multimedia computer with TV-tuner, multichannel sound and everything. Quite a thing for that time...</p>
<p>I told her I would look into it and see what I can do for her and after running the Windows 7 upgrade validation it showed that it probably only needed some extra RAM and I would not be able to find a driver for the USB cardreader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All said and done, I went and checked for information about the mobo. Surprisingly, there's only one document available on the internet and I checked the specifications for the maximum allowed SDRAM on this mobo. Quote from a small manual about the MS-7091:
 "The mainboard provides 4 slots for 184-pin DDR SDRAM DIMM (Double In-Line Memory Module) modules and supports the memory size up to 4GB. ... Each DIMM slot supports up to a maximum size of 1GB."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after finding this information I went on a search of how much Windows 7 32-bit Home Premium would support and I found on several websites that it should support a physical amount of 4GB. Although warned in advance that I might not be able to address
 all that space as a user because of hardware taking up some space in there, I went along and bought four 1GB DDR1 400 MHz SDRAM DIMM modules (400 MHz is the maximum according to the same manual).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, and here comes the trick: after installing the 4GB RAM in its original state (WinXP) it showed only 2GB of memory installed in system properties and through the taskmanager. At first I thought it was a problem with WinXP, but after upgrading to
 Win7 it didn't improve much... A very old program called AIDA32 and a much newer one, Piriform's Speccy, both tell me that all four DIMM slots are occupied with 1GB of SDRAM, but Windows doesn't show this in any way. I tried swapping around the SDRAM modules
 several times and in different order to see if there's anything wrong, but Win7 still came up with exactly no more than 2GB and AIDA32 and Speccy showing a total of 4GB.</p>
<p>My cousin tipped me into upgrading BIOS, because it's probably old. After looking for a flash upgrade I found that the new version (M) wouldn't be much younger and might not give any improvement. I went ahead and flashed the BIOS anyway; if I wouldn't I
 would've never known, but the result was: no setting available for this, so no improvement. After this I also checked the mobo for present jumpers; there were none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, long story and big but short question... Where do I lose these 2GB? Because the hardware says they are present and Windows doesn't recognize them at all. I've already thought about how much the hardware part would take up from this 4GB as "shared RAM",
 but this could never land exactly on 2GB and even though, it should still say in the system properties that 4GB is installed... At least, that's how it works on my Acer Desktop computer from 2010 (it has 6GB physically installed on Win7 x64 of which 1GB is
 shared to VRAM and it still says in system properties that 6GB is installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any good help would be appreciated, thanks in advance! If there are any question or if further information is needed, please let me know.</p>

            <p>Hi Mr. Stuart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>As asked I've run CPU-Z and it came with the possibility to make a report, you can find the report
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5E6QcGgIc8BaUxzMl9SYzZvUWs&amp;authuser=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here in TXT-format</a>. It showed that the actual speed was 199.5 MHz and the maximum speed is 200 MHz, so I guess no problem there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit preliminary, but I also have some info on Memtest86+. I downloaded the last BootCD version (5.01) from memtest.org and its running now. If needed I can leave it running for the next 24 to 30 hours, after that I have to shut it down for personal reasons.</p>
<p>However, when executing Memtest a small concern arose... It shows in the top left corner: "Memory: 2048M, 1667 MB/s" and in the top right corner it says: "Testing: 1024K - 2048M, 2047M of 2048M". Even though CPU-Z showed that all 4 DIMM slots were occupied,
 here we're down to 2GB again. Is this normal?</p>
<p>Furthermore it shows here that RAM is running at 199 MHz, CAS 3-3-3-8 @ 128-bit Mode and it just finished its first pass in just under 20 minutes while I was compiling this message: no errors and still showing only 2048M of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After running Memtest86+ for a little over 31 hours, in which it did 34 passes, it has come to the conclusion there were no errors. A litteral screenshot

            <p>Hi Mr. Stuart,<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your reply.<br />
<br />
I went over the BIOS settings with my cousin, but couldn't find anything to adjust/tweak the RAM, maybe you can have a look if something is wrong. Supposedly you were able to open all the files I hyperlinked in my previous message, so I'm going to do the same
 here, but instead giving separate links I'll give a link to the folder where all the files are, also from previous messages.

<br />
I've taken a whole bunch of pictures, below is a list of BIOS pictures I took. To show the difference one image is from when all 4 GB of RAM is installed, the rest when only 2 GB is installed. On the other pages there's completely no difference between having
 2 or 4GB installed. I also added screenshots of system properties, Performance tab in Taskmanager and Piriform's Speccy about the RAM and Graphics card. Everything in the shared folder is a picture/screenshot unless stated otherwise by use of extension.<br />

            <p>I could not find anything obvious wrong in the BIOS settings. I did notice that Speccy reported 2GB physical memory and also I believe another 2GB virtual memory which is odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also your graphics card has 1GB of memory which automatically takes you down to 3GB usable and other hardware devices will take about another 500MB or more if you have some plug in cards inserted in the rear sockets on the motherboard. This would cause Windows
 to only report 2.5GB of usable memory or less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Memtest should report 4GB of memory</p>
<p>Only thing I can suggest is try removing 2 sticks (slots 2 and 4) with AC power cord unplugged and press the power-on button to discharge the power supply before removing the memory sticks and see if memtest recognizes the remaining two sticks as 2GB of
 memory. Then repeat the process with the memory from slots 1 and 3 removed with 2 and 4 inserted.&nbsp; Check the manual for the combination of slots to be used with only 2 sticks of memory.</p>

            <p>Hi Mr. Stuart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried what you suggested, but in any configuration, it shows only 2048M of RAM. Numbering the RAM modules 1 to 4 to the according slots they're originally in, I did the following:</p>
<p>* I took out RAM in slots 2 and 4 and left 1 and 3 in =&gt; 2048M according to Memtest</p>
<p>* Moved 1 and 3 to 2 and 4 =&gt; 2048M</p>
<p>* Removed 2 and 4 (original 1 and 3) and placed the original 2 and 4 in 1 and 3 =&gt; 2048M</p>
<p>* Placed the original 2 and 4 back in 2 and 4 =&gt; 2048M</p>
<p>* Placed original 1 and 3 back in place (all 4 in the original place) =&gt; 2048M</p>
<p>For every change I cycled the power so it would discharge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried moving the modules around again in a full cycle, so module 1 in DIMM2, module 2 in DIMM3, module 3 in DIMM4 and module 4 in DIMM1 =&gt; 2048M. I did this until all modules had all DIMMs, result for all is 2048M in Memtest. I also tried swapping
 them in couples 1&amp;3 &lt;--&gt; 2&amp;4, also no change. Again everything with the discharging of power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2GB virtual is automatically created by the system (pagefile). The file itself is indeed around 2GB in size, so that could be right. Why do you think that's odd?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS already stated that it would take 544MB of system resources, so in all it would take a little more than 1.5GB of the 4GB present, resulting in 2.4-something GB available for the user. As far as I can see, there's not an excessive amount of devices connected;
 externally only a USB-keyboard and mouse and VGA, internally mostly extra connections from the graphics card and on-board audio to output ports. Next to the graphics card, there's a TV-tuner card in a PCI slot, which also works as an old-fashioned modem. Other
 than these 2, there are no PCI slots in use. For everything else it's all on-board on the mobo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said, could it be that the system uses up so many with hardware resources, that it comes down to 2GB in the end? What does the BIOS mean with this 544MB? And shouldn't it show somewhere that there's 4GB installed?? As mentioned before, I myself have
 an Acer Aspire M7720 with 6GB RAM (3x2GB DDR3 533,3MHz) physically installed, this also shows everywhere (Speccy, System properties and BIOS). In this computer is an ATI Radeon 4800series graphics card present which can take up to 1024MB as well, and it shows
 that I have around 3GB physical RAM available out of 6GB installed, next to an automatically configured pagefile of 6GB. Or is this because of the DDR-type difference?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I'd like to wish you a happy new year! New replies from me won't be in before the 2nd of January.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Clean Install</h2>
                    Hello all,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to a larger SSD on my laptop and when I re-installed Windows 8 I selected Clean Install instead of upgrade. I didn't realize that it was even an issue until I got all of my software re-installed, ITunes music downloaded, and items copied
 back to my desktop from my old SSD when the Activate Windows screen re-surfaced and wouldn't accept my CD Key. Is there a way to just insert my Windows 7 Disk and let Windows 8 know that this is what I had upgraded from or do I need to re-format my drive,
 re-install Win7 then upgrade it to Win8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all for your thoughts!</p>

            For fresh install the following procedure could be adopted to make Windows key work:
<div><br />
<div>
<div>You need to open a run box and type: "Regedit"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then located this key:</div>
<div><br />
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And find the one called "MediaBootInstall".</div>
<div><br />
<div>Double click that and change it from a 1 to a 0.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then open up cmd as an administrator</div>
<div><br />
<div>Type the command "slmgr /rearm"</div>
<div><br />
<div>You will get a restart your computer messge.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Restart</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then when your computer restarts you need to open a run box again and type "slui.exe 3" and it will allow you to enter your product key and activate</div>

            Using the UnxUtils package above, I think I've been able to do what you are trying to do using the following command in a Command Prompt Window:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; gawk &nbsp; "{print $3,\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;J1.\"$1}"&nbsp; filename<br />
<br />
It seems to work if you back-slash escape the quotation marks within the braces.<br />

<h2>            Unable to connect to the internet</h2>
                    <p>I recently moved back to college, and when I did so my Windows 10 desktop will not connect to our internet at school. At home, I could connect no problem, but at school when I try to connect to the network I get a message that says "No Internet, secured".
 When trying to release and renew my ip address I get these error messages respectively: "An error occured while releasing interface WiFi : An address has not yet been associated with the network endpoint." and "An error occurred while renewing interface WiFi
 : unable to contact your DHCP server. Request has timed out." I tried uninstalling and reinstalling my network drivers by going to the devices manager, fining the hardware for my wifi card, and right clicking and uninstalling. I then reinstalled by scanning
 for new hardware, and the device reappears again on my devices manager window. Any ideas on how I can fix this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi...it sounds like you need a 'password'...Ask your school for the network password....if the same pc works @ home then it will be looking for a secure connection which may be blocked untill you un block it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry the system will still remember your home WIFI address.</p>

            Ended up being a proximity issue. I was far enough away from the router that the computer wasn't able to make the initial connection. After moving my computer closer to the router, I was able to make the connection, which held when I moved it back to its
 initial location.

            <p>Hi....How far away?....a good router or hub should give you around 100 feet or more....about the size of an average home....from let's say the basement to the driveway outside backyard?....this would be the responsibility of the service provider to have
 their boxes in proper working order...if not then they should provide a upgraded unit free of charge.</p>
<p>School or public area's though can be restricted with certain limitations.</p>

<p>The only people that handle enforcement actions is the enforcement team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They do not follow these forums and the only way to contact them is through the case review process on their website enforecement.xbox.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enforcement actions are not necessarily for something that you did right at that point in time sometimes it does take time from the time that a report is made for the enforcement team to investigate the report and then put the enforcement action onto your
 account so this is something that could have happened days or even weeks ago there is no statute of limitations on when a report is made and the time that the enforcement team can put an enforcement action on your account.</p>

            Yes i would say that someone might have found that Word offensive and reported you. To make a fun and vibrant Community one must be careful not offending anyone else - how it might ever be.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with the System/Motherboard Maker's Support, their on-line documentation and drivers,<br />
diagnostics,&nbsp;and ask in their forums about any known issues. Update the&nbsp;Bluetooth and WiFi
<br />
drivers. In fact I would update the<strong> BIOS</strong>,<strong> low level chipset
</strong><strong>drivers</strong>, and <strong>all the major on-board<br />
and separate device drivers&nbsp;</strong>(see driver update methods below).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
============================================================<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update all the major drivers as well as<br />
the BIOS and chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

BluetoothView is a small utility that runs in the background, and monitor the activity of
<br />
Bluetooth devices around you. For each detected Bluetooth device, it displays the following
<br />
information: Device Name, Bluetooth Address, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, First
<br />
Detection Time, Last Detection Time, and more. BluetoothView can also notify you when a
<br />
new Bluetooth device is detected, by displaying a balloon in your taskbar or by playing a
<br />
small beep sound. - FREE<br />

<br />
BluetoothCL is a small console application that dumps all current detected bluetooth devices<br />
into the standard output. For each Bluetooth device, the following information is displayed:
<br />
MAC Address, Name, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, and optionally the company
<br />
name of the device (if external file of MAC addresses - oui.txt is provided) - FREE<br />

<br />
BluetoothLogView is a small utility that monitors the activity of Bluetooth devices around
<br />
you,&nbsp; and displays a log of Bluetooth devices on the main window. Every time that a new
<br />
Bluetooth device arrives to your area and when the device leaves your area, a new log line
<br />
is added with the following information: Device Name, Device Address, Event Time, Event
<br />
Type ('Device Arrival' or 'Device Left'), Device Type, and the company that created the device.
<br />
BluetoothLogView also allows you to specify a description for every device (according to its<br />
&nbsp;MAC address) that will appear under the 'Description' column. - FREE<br />

<h2>            Roche or Iorveth&#58; Which did you enjoy more&#63; &#42;Spoilers&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>Just completed my 2nd through the game, first Time I played I picked Iorveth's path without knowing what that would mean<br />
<br />
2nd time round took the story down Roche's path and it felt like the longer, more story driven side to the game for me. It just game it more substance I feel, especially when you get the feeling you are really effecting all of the Kingdom and loved the interaction
 with King Henslet<br />
<br />
While with Iorveth you see more of Saskia and how the Mages plan comes together during Chapter 2, I enjoyed it more when it was more on the Regal side of the story, especially leading into Chapter 3.<br />
<br />
I also played out both choices of choosing either to save Triss during Roche's story choice or to save the child of Foltest, Anais. I enjoyed the story following saving Anais more and the ending it gives was just amazing<br />
<br />
Taking a break fro the game now, next time will be Dark Mode!!!<br />
<br />
So what are your thoughts on which choice you made?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did the opposite of you and feel the opposite of you... kind of strange I think.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>First game went with Roche since I thought that it was better to keep helping the person that helped you escape. I like the story arch and how it felt. I also think Roches path felt longer... (also in Roches path you get a chance to Redo you character abilities)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Second game went Iorveth... I was quite surprised with how much different the game was... even in the final bits of Chapter 1 were vastly different. I liked the whole fighting rebellion feel. The city in chapter 2 was a lot more fun that the military camp
 on Roches side. Saskia was awesome to be fighting with.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Overall though it felt Iorveth was more story driven and Roche had a good mix of story while being a bit more combat orientated

I'm not been able to connect to internet for last 2 days may due to this. &nbsp;Ping is not working but nslookup does. &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5d3d792-ce47-402a-82d7-54c74eb7c038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5d3d792-ce47-402a-82d7-54c74eb7c038" /></a></p>

<p>Following step I tried:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) It all started with not getting internet connected. I tried checking ipconfig. &nbsp;Then finally I realized &nbsp;that ping is not working but nslookup does. So after searching over internet I finally stopped &nbsp;the DNSclient service. &nbsp;And that doesn't &nbsp;help me
 either. &nbsp;I tried all the commands like:- ipconfig/flashdns, ipconfig/registerdns. &nbsp;But those didn't help me either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I checked the event log. &nbsp;I have sql server installed that was not starting and it continuesly throwing error. &nbsp;By searching that error I finally &nbsp;got the main problem behind everything that my pc's full computer name and work group was not available.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I tried the simplest way from the UI to change those from system properties. But then I face this abnormal scenario which are added in the screen shot. &nbsp;Tried so many ways to change the full computer name and workgroup. &nbsp;That did not take effect in the
 system properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) finally I resolved the issue 8 hours back by restore the pc by 2 days earlier restore point. &nbsp;Now my pc is working fine. &nbsp;All the probelms are resolved now. The computer name and work groups are appearing and also internet is working</p>
