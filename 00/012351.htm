<h2>            Cannot update my Nokia Lumia 1520</h2>
                    <p>- I downloaded the app that is supposed to reveal when you are ok for the windows 10 update...the app says my phone is ready, however when I go into setting and into Phone update, no update actually comes up and it says my phone is up to date...but it isn't
 it is still on Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am in Canada so is this the issue?...even though I changed my region to US (which allows me to use Cortana)</p>
<p>- Is there not a way to force the phone to download it?</p>
<p>

            <p>Part of the notification that said you were eligible referred to your mobile carrier. This means your carrier is part of the update process.</p>
<p>They have to do their part now. The update will be available when your carrier releases it to your phone.</p>

            Have you deactivated the Windows Firewall? If not, I think maybe you should do it. There must only be one firewall active, to avoid conflict. This is what I have read about Firewalls.
<strong>If this isn't correct, then correct me...........</strong>

<p>In order to get&nbsp;SEP 12.1.5 to install on Windows 10, install unmanaged client and delete the BASHDefs.zip prior to the installation. I believer the Proactive Threat Protection will become disabled. As of this moment there is no version of SEP that will work
 100% on Windows 10 10049, and this is normal for SEP until a final release is pushed out for Windows 10.</p>

<h3> lindab256  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 won&#39;t install on IPad</h2>
                    I purchased Office 365 through Microsoft. No problem installing on my PC but can't get it installed on my ipad. &nbsp;When I click that I already have a subscription, I get a message stating 'Regrant failed. Please purchase a subscription for this device.'
 I am sure I am using the correct account. Is there a disconnect between Apple and Microsoft? Very frustrating. Please help.

<h2>            Outlook Webmail Delivery Status Notification &#40;Failure&#41;&#8207;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Okay, a recently set up a website for my business and attached some email accounts to it. The business email accounts are hosted though Zoho, while the site is hosted @ GoDaddy. In any case, I was sending test messages to my business
 email accounts from my Outlook Webmail account, and something really weird starts happening:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I get the dreaded delivery status notification from postmaster<span>.</span>hotmail. It reads simply:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">"This is an automatically&nbsp;generated delivery status notification.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Delivery to the following recipients failed.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">&gt;Email</p>
<p class="contentStandard">&gt;Email"</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Looking at the source, it goes a bit deeper:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>Final-Recipient: rfc822;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
Action: failed<br />
Status: 5.1.1<br />

Diagnostic-Code: <span>
smtp</span><span>;</span>550 5.1.1 &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<span>&gt;:</span> Recipient address rejected: User unknown
 in virtual mailbox table</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW, Normally I might get mad at my email provider, or think I set something up wrong. However, I can send emails to those same email addresses from ANY of my other, non-<span>microsoft</span>,
 email accounts (Google, Mail.com, <span>
etc</span>) - and they go through just fine. My form responders send to those addresses as well with no issues. For some reason, it's only Outlook (maybe Hotmail too, I don't have an account to try) that is sending these messages back as undeliverable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TO MAKE MATTERS EVEN MORE INTERESTING: I can send an email from any of those addresses to my outlook account, and it'll show up fine. Sometimes, It'll let me reply to the email and go through successfully - other times when I hit 'reply' it sends another
 postmaster notice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting very weird, and seems to be an issue only with Outlook Webmail. I don't know if others are experiencing the same thing or not when trying to send an email from outlook to my business email addresses, but something is fishy...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think the issue resolved itself with no intervention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had recently (within 4-8 hours of sending the test emails) switched my MX records from Godaddy to Zoho. The other email providers didn't seem to have any issues finding the correct routing mere minutes after the change of the records, but it appears Outlook
 (Hotmail) took several hours to adjust to the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moral of the story: Be patient. Microsofts servers appear to me to be slower at catching changes in MX records than the others I have tried.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Publisher 2010 - Can&#39;t Copy and Paste within Publisher without loosing formatting</h2>
                    I'm using Publisher 2010 and can't copy and paste without loosing the ad formatting i've created. I open the clipboard in both pages but still looses format or changes the text boxes to double space when I created them in single space. How can this problem
 be solved???? How can I set up the text boxes to be single spaced as a default???

<p>This is a huge issue for me!</p>
<p>Not only do I lose all formatting such as bullets, spacing, tabs etc etc but the actual font changes from one document to another.</p>
<p>The above is when copy / paste from one Publisher page to a seperate blank document in another file.</p>
<p>AS WELL</p>
<p>All of the above happens if I am copy / pasting from Word to Publisher text box</p>
<p>AS WELL</p>
<p>If I print out to an .pdf file I loose text which has been squeezed up in text box entry in publisher and the output reverts to a larger font.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not having the ability to import and export in this software or to be able to extract one page in a large document to make secondary documents from excerpts is more than annoying, it makes using this program not such a good idea!</p>

<h2>            Email to text not working</h2>
                    
<p>We have an hvac system that sends email to text alerts through Outlook client to our maintenance employees.&nbsp; It has stopped working.&nbsp; I have tested by sending an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** from both Outlook and the Web Client and neither one goes through.&nbsp;
 Tried different computers, no go.&nbsp; Normal emails work.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I send the email to text from my phone, using the same O365 account, the text goes through just fine.</p>
<p>Anyone have any idea?&nbsp; It seems to have stopped working around August 27th.</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>To better understand the current situation, Iâd like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. Whatâs the meaning of âhvac systemâ and âtext alertsâ? Would you mind clarifying that?</p>
<p>2. Regarding âI have tested by sending an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** from both Outlook and the Web Client and neither one goes throughâ, Iâd like to know whether there are any bounced back error messages when email didnât go through. If yes, would you mind
 sharing it with us via the private message so that we can further analysis it?</p>
<p>3. What do you mean by saying âNormal emails workâ? What are the differences between âNormal emailsâ and âemail to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***â?</p>
<p>4. About âIf I send email to text from my phoneâ, what does the âtextâ you mentioned refer to?</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the information above. Please follow the steps below to respond to it:</p>
<p>1. Please go to your details section on the right side of the community site. </p>
<p>2. Click Private messages. </p>

<p>1) HVAC - Heating, ventilation and air condition server. &nbsp;Controls everything related to heating and cooling. &nbsp;Sends warnings out when there is an issue. &nbsp;Uses the Outlook program to send an email to AT&amp;Ts email to text service address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>2) There are no bounce back messages. &nbsp;Nothing to indicate an issue.</p>
<p>3) If I send an email to myself from the server using my "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" it goes through. &nbsp;An email to "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" doesn't work from the server or my desktop computer, but works fine from my phone using the same email account.</p>
<p>4) Text meaning the phone receives it as a text message even though the HVAC server sent it as an email.</p>
<p>The address "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" takes the email and sends it out to the phone number in the address as a text message.</p>
<p>All of our email is hosted on O365. &nbsp;I'm just trying to figure out why it works going through my phone, but not when sending from my desktop computer using both the Outlook program and the web client.</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed information. Please provide us with the following information for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>â¢&nbsp;Do you mean that are you&nbsp;using HVAC system to send email through SMTP? <br />
â¢&nbsp;Which method are you using <em>SMTP client submission</em> or <em>Direct send</em> or
<em>SMTP relay</em>?<br />
â¢&nbsp;Regarding â<em>HVAC Sends warnings out when there is an issue.&nbsp; Uses the Outlook program to send an email to AT&amp;Ts email to text service address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>â, could you please provide us with the detailed information about the settings?<br />
â¢&nbsp;Please make sure that your network firewall or Internet Service Provider (IDP) might be blocking port.<br />
â¢&nbsp;Are you using licensed Office 365 mailbox to send email from?<br />
â¢&nbsp;Have you configured Internet Information Server (IIS) for relay with Office 365?
<br />
â¢&nbsp;Which kind of environment do you set up? Is it Hybrid or DirSync deployment?</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Shyamal</p>

            <p>I assume that your table starts in cell A1 on sheet "Sheet1".&nbsp; I also assume you have a list of unique Vendor names on another sheet, in Column A, starting in Row 2.&nbsp; Enter the following formula in cell B1 and drag down for as many Vendor names as you have
 on the second sheet.&nbsp; I assumed you have 1000 rows of data on "Sheet1".&nbsp; I also assumed that your dates go from Column B to Column E.&nbsp; Adjust those assumptions to your needs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMIF(Sheet1!$A$2:$A$1000,$A2,OFFSET(Sheet1!$B$2:$B$1000,0,MATCH($G$2,Sheet1!$B$1:$E$1,0)-1))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>where:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheet1!$A$2:$A$1000 is your list of Vendors on "Sheet1"</p>
<p>$A2 is the particular vendor you are trying to add to the report</p>
<p>$G$2 holds the specific Date that you want for the report</p>

<h2>            How to initiate a call using Skype</h2>
                    This may sound stupid, but how do I initiate a call using Skype? I can find nothing on the site page which says anything like: "make a call" or "call someone" I have to make an important call tomorrow and don't know how to do it. If I'm unable to make
 the call, I lose the project. Help! Thanks Derek

<h2>            Primary email on calendar</h2>
                    <p>For over 15 years, I have had two email addresses, both with a 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; Never used outlook.&nbsp; Used the calendar on one of them.&nbsp; Items on that calendar appear also on my iphone.&nbsp; Or, I should say, used to appear.&nbsp; Recently, I added a new email address.&nbsp; It was set up in a business
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; I haven't used it yet.&nbsp; Our business is a franchise, so most email/calendar is through a corporate supported gmail account.&nbsp; I wanted to set up an msn email address because it is so much easier than gmail to
 manage and use contacts, especially grouping them for email blast.&nbsp; Now, back to my problem.&nbsp; I haven't used to new email address yet, other than to add some contact names.&nbsp; But when I go to my calendar, after signing on to my original email address, all the
 entries are gone.&nbsp; They are still on my iPhone, but not when I access them from my computer.&nbsp; If I add entries to the calendar, they don't get picked up by the iPhone's calendar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I checked the settings and see that the new email address is attached to the calendar.&nbsp; I have no idea why, but I know I didn't do it.&nbsp; It must have happeded automically when I set up the new email address.&nbsp; I can't change it.&nbsp; Of the three email addresses,
 this is the one that I use 99% - I don't want to have to switch back and forth between email addresses so I can manage the calendar and have it synced to the phone.&nbsp; Wonder what will happen if I delete the new email address.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway to make my original email address used by the calendar?</p>

</p><p>So here I go again.&nbsp; Trying to change things on my phone and in my MSN mail accounts to see if I can get those contacts back.&nbsp; And I&nbsp;know it happened today - I now get texts with no sender ID showing - from a person who texted yesterday with their name showing
 on the text.&nbsp; Likewise, my kid called me yesterday, and not only did his name show, it used his unique ring tone.&nbsp; He just called, no name, no ringtone - just a from an out of state number showed.&nbsp;

            <p>Maybe the problem is my iPhone.&nbsp; It did have an OS update early this morning.&nbsp; When I connect it to my computer, the iTunes won't sync.&nbsp; I also tried to restore it from a backup kept on my computer.&nbsp; Both resulted in failure because the phone suddenly wasn't
 connected anymore.&nbsp; Even though it remained connected via bus.&nbsp; The phone showed that it was restoring, as did the computer.&nbsp; Then, boom, the backup could not be completed because the phone was disconnected.&nbsp; And the phone then turned itself off and back on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must be time to get a new phone.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Hyperlinks from Access to Sharepoint Online not working.</h2>
                    <p>When I try and follow a hyperlink from a field in an Access database to a document held in SharePoint Online, I get the following message:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Unable to open <em>url</em> .&nbsp; Cannot download the information you requested.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I am trying to move from a desktop PC&nbsp;to a SurfaceBook.&nbsp; I used to witness this problem on the desktop, but could always clear it by logging on to the SharePoint site, using IE.&nbsp; This doesn't work on the SurfaceBook.&nbsp; The problem does not occur if the url
 is to a public web page, so I believe it to be something to do with security/permissions.&nbsp; I have also tried going to the raw url, rather than the one I usually create by using OneDrive for Business &gt; Copy Link&nbsp;from the Explorer context menu&nbsp;(has ?web=1 appended).&nbsp;
 I have gone back to check whether the desktop had started to present this problem, but everything is working OK there.</p>

            <p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you confirm on how are you trying to access the file from a SharePoint site? A screenshot of the issue as well as the steps you did on how you encounter it, will help us to further
 troubleshoot your case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you copying the link provided using Get Link feature on OneDrive for Business online site? Select the file on your site, and then click on Share. Select the option Get a Link and then
 you will have an option on how you want the user who has the link can access it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-files-or-folders-in-Office-365-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for more details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, confirm whether the user is in the Shared with option. As this will determine if the user has an access on the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>I should first emphasise that on another machine, everything worked as it should.</p>
<p>I have a Microsoft Access database and on a number of tables there is a hyperlink field. &nbsp;My usual method for entering the hyperlink is to find the file in Windows Explorer, right click on it and select OneDrive for Business &gt; Copy Link. &nbsp;Then I right click
 the field in Microsoft Access, select Hyperlink &gt; Edit Hyperlink and paste in the Address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried your suggested approach. &nbsp;The links work, but I have hundreds of records with hyperlinks (generated as above) which have suddenly stopped working for me, and the process for generating one of these links is quite time-consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I export a table to an Excel spreadsheet my old hyperlinks work OK from there, so how do you explain the difference between Access and Excel? Indeed, the hyperlinks will work in any other situation, such as pasted into a Word file, or a browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following has been appended in an edit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my original post, I described how I would sometimes log onto SharePoint Online to get the links to work and that this did not appear to have worked with the new machine. &nbsp;Today, after testing and getting the same result as above, I took the additional
 step of navigating to the site (we have more than one) where the linked files are actually held and now, not only do the links work, but they continue to work, even after a restart, or after signing out of the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that I have "taught" Access that I have permission to access the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be interesting to know whether anyone understands what is going on here, because if Access needs this information, there ought to be a more straightforward way of inputting it.</p>

<p>You stated that you right click on the file from Windows Explorer, then select OneDrive for Business and then copy link. Can you provide a screenshot of this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case sensitive data are used on the hyperlinks, you can then attach the screenshots thru private message. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the detailed
 steps with screenshot on how you encounter the issue, and can be accessed via this link:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the confirmation that the issue is solved. As for your concern regarding the links, the user that will access the link, should have access to view/edit the file. As the user, will be prompted for a credentials when the link is used on a browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you encounter an issue with SharePoint/Office application, you are always welcome to post your questions here with the detailed description of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>I have an issue similar</span> to the one presented by Charles. I get the same message when I try to open a sharepoint online url in ms-access.
The problem does not occur if the url is to a public web page</span>. The hyperlinks also work in any other situation. It is not a problem of permissions, since I can open the files if I paste the hyperlink to the browser.</p>

<p>Your problem sounds exactly the same as mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just carried out an experiment as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close ms-access.</li><li>Log onto the Sharepoint site using Google Chrome.</li><li>Open ms-access and test link from a table.</li><li>Result - "Unable to open ..."</li><li>Close ms-access</li><li>Access the Sharepoint site using Internet Explorer.</li><li>Open ms-access and test link from a table.</li><li>Result - link works</li><li>Close ms-access</li><li>Sign out of Sharepoint site using Internet Explorer</li><li>Open ms-access and test link from a table</li><li>Result - "unable to open ..."</li></ol>
<p>I can only conclude that Internet Explorer updates something which ms-access uses to determine whether you are signed in. &nbsp;However, note that at point 6 I did not sign in - Internet Explorer remembered that I had signed in, but apparently could not "tell
 ms-access" until I had actually accessed the site. &nbsp;Possibly ms-access has to obtain a token, or something.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for your time. Unfortunately, I have set the default browser for Chrome, explorer and edge and it failed with all of them. Although the text of the link is correct and I had logged in ms-access and in the browser before trying
 the link, I have never managed to make the link work in ms-access.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Already on a Bad Start</h2>
                    


I am a hardcore windows user who is very frustrated by the Microsoft tinkering with windows to make it better! 


My question is who are they making it better for? Certainly not for me who has used window since the days of 3.11 and certainly not for my users. 


It would take a very long time for me to list all the ways that Microsoft has gone wrong and how they could do better.  



Here is one problem that should have been resolved before anyone even herd of Windows 10 but some how Microsoft seem to have the issue worse. 



As a hardcore windows user I took the leap to try Windows 10. So I installed it on several devices, a laptop, desktop and of course the Surface Pro 2. 



Windows 10, by that I mean Microsoft has taken it upon them self's to set my network mode to Public for every wireless network I connect to which is not the end of the world if there was an easy way to change to Private Network. 



If they cant address such a basic thing then I think windows is really DEAD.

            I installed on my&nbsp; Lenovo Idea Center B520 with I7 @3.4 Mhz., 16 Gigs of ram, Touch Screen and 2 tetra byte HD. It has been stable, everything works as it should, all my Corel Graphics software works, games work. The only thing I had to give up was Norton
 360 virus software. It updates regularly and seems to be somewhat faster all around. I guess I am in a minority with successful install and running. Only thing that I am wearing out the windows key. You have to realize it is unfinished and Micro Soft told
 you that before you installed it.

<p>Just a general comment since I have a pretty solid W10 on a notebook.&nbsp; I see a ton of posts on the interface and many users are already using 3rd party start menus such as Classic Shell.&nbsp; I for one use Start8 from Stardock and have used since W8, W8.1 and
 now W10.&nbsp; I just find it so damn easy to use for "me" and my users who would not be coming to me if they could make sense of W8 and now W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current plan is to go to final W10 immediately upon release and just continue with Start8 (or similar).</p>

            <p>For the home user, there's no problem using classicshell or start8, but for enterprise, adding a third party UI control is not something you take lightly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me the concern is that Microsoft is perfectly capable of implementing a decent start menu, but they choose not to, BY DESIGN. &nbsp;It could easily have been implemented in Windows 8.1, or Microsoft could produce a genuine Microsoft UI package for optional
 installation for those who want a start menu. &nbsp;Their refusal to do so is not a good sign.</p>

            Well now that Windows 10 is finally out! I can't understand all the reviews trying to push Windows 10 like it is this big savior for people that hated Windows 8/8.1! And their reasoning as to why it is such a big savior, is because they claim Windows 10
 has a start menu! It is amazing how reviews and media now treat people as stupid! First of all anyone that hated Windows 8 is going to hate Windows 10 worse! Because first of all, There is no start menu in Windows 10 at all! It is only a miniature version
 of Windows metro that people hated in Windows 8/8.1! And on top of their being no start menu, You can no longer pick and choose what updates you want! And you can't turn updates off! This will be a huge problem for many users when they are forced to receive
 a update that has a huge conflict with their hardware! That was the whole point of being able to pick and choose what updates you wanted before! Because time and time again: Microsoft has released updates that cause problems with some people

            <p>As a temporary solution, open the clipboard and paste from it. Home tab &gt; click the down arrow by Clipboard. Now you can see all the items you have copied and choose the one you want to paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the clipboard open before you copy you will also see if the content that you intend to copy is actually copied. Sometimes I have noticed that I try to copy something and it simply does not work for some unknown reason. This
<em>might</em> be what is happening with you.</p>

<p>I have wrote here: I did perform a clean install (from scratch) of the Build 14328 (I have convert install.esd to ISO).</p>
<p>The "right-click problem" is existing just after the installation on the fresh installed system without any kind of the third-party applications or any kind of browser history.<br />
I have also deleted the Microsoft Edge (all its folders) and reinstall it without my Favorites&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Nothing happen.<br />
Every time when I try to use the right click to open the link in another tab, or paste and copy the text, or save the pictures, Microsoft Edge crashed immediately without any kind of error messages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But when we found the very serious bug, which makes the system nearly unusable (how it is possible to use the browser without the right click ability?), nobody from MS is interested about the details.</p>

            <p>Hi Rachael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you post/ upload a&nbsp;Power Point&nbsp;in yammer,&nbsp;it would&nbsp;open the file in Online version. When you use the default template, the online version will open it as is, since&nbsp;the configuration of it is known/ set. However, when you use any custom template, that
 size/ configuration may not be available on the online version. As you must be aware, that the Office online version&nbsp;has certain limitations and does not function as&nbsp;the full fledged Office client version.
</p>
<p>Hence, the custom size that you are using and trying to upload, would not open in the desired size in Office online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to revert if you have any queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Problems downloading Windows 10 on Windows 7 Pro netbook</h2>
                    <p>Have been trying for 2 days to download Windows 10 on my netbook.&nbsp; For almost 24 hours I got the logo going around and around and around for the "preparation time" and got no further.&nbsp; I checked and I have 1.66 gigahertz of processor speed, 2 gigabytes of
 Ram.&nbsp; From what I have read I should not be having a problem and the download should not be taking this long.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Do you have enough free space, 20-30GB, in the partition where you are going to install Windows 10?

<h2>            Windows 10 Insider 10240 to 10532 fails 0xc000000f</h2>
                    <p>I am running&nbsp;IP since inception on a dual boot setup. My 'live' partition was Win8.1 pro and is now Win 10 pro - running fine with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 'test' IP&nbsp;partition is on the same HDD and was fine right up to 10240.&nbsp; It activated correctly but then failed to pull any new versions despite showing correctly as fast ring.&nbsp; After trying various suggestions from the community posts, I ran an in-place
 re-upgrade using the download media. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming the&nbsp;hardware is fine, as otherwise my live partition would not work, which it does.</p>
<p>The test partition has over 41Gb available, so I am assuming it is not a space issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Good News:&nbsp; the upgrade kept my settings and the 10532 update suddenly appeared</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bad News: Everything else</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the 10532 upgrade I get 0xc000000f on the boot menu and need to roll back to 10240, which it does but</li><li>10240 is no longer activated "Windows can't activate at this time. Try activating again later..." and error&nbsp;0x8007007B</li><li>The Inside Hub app no longer works </li></ul>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Any suggestions for troubleshooting the startup problem which is generating the 0xc000000f on10532 (but not there if I roll back to 10240)</li><li>If I cannot fix the exiting setup (preferred) can I use the Win 10 media disk to run a clean install and if so will it activate or do I need to do go back to an older OS.</li><li>If I go back to an older OS, can I use the current Win 10 media, or do I need to allow the older OS to be upgraded by MS first&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<div style="margin-left: 60px">
<p>i.e. As my 'work' partition is activated on the same hardware, but different partition is this sufficient to activate the rebuilt 'test' partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>On further examination, the new (10532) System32 folder&nbsp;is missing almost all its files - &nbsp;so I am rolling back to 10240 again.&nbsp; How can I check for / remove any broken update files before re-attempting the update?</p>

            <p>If you can just format the Insider partition and clean install Windows 10 Pro official media to that partition without using any product key, it should auto-activate.&nbsp; Boot with Windows 10 install media to do this and choose Custom to select that partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can join that install to Insiders program and Fast Ring to get build 10532.&nbsp; This is how mine is setup.&nbsp; I also made an ISO for 10532 using it's ESD file from the Windows Update install and clean installed that to a partition.</p>
