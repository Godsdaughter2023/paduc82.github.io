</p><p>
</p><blockquote><em>This indicates that an attempt to reset the display driver and recover from a timeout failed.
</em></blockquote>
So, let me now explain what VIDEO_TDR_ERROR means. First off, TDR is an acronym for
<em><strong>'Timeout Detection and Recovery'</strong></em>. Timeout Detection and Recovery was introduced in Vista and carried over to Windows 7. Rather than putting exactly what Timeout Detection and Recovery does exactly, I'll just directly quote the MSDN
 article!<br />
<br />
<blockquote><strong>Timeout detection:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The GPU scheduler, which is part of the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<em>Dxgkrnl.sys</em>), detects that the GPU is taking more than the permitted amount of time to execute a particular task. The GPU scheduler then tries
 to preempt this particular task. The preempt operation has a "wait" timeout, which is the actual TDR timeout. This step is thus the timeout detection phase of the process. The default timeout period in Windows Vista and later operating systems is 2 seconds.
 If the GPU cannot complete or preempt the current task within the TDR timeout period, the operating system diagnoses that the GPU is frozen.
</em><br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>To prevent timeout detection from occurring, hardware vendors should ensure that graphics operations (that is, DMA buffer completion) take no more than 2 seconds in end-user scenarios such as productivity and game play.
</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Preparation for recovery:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The operating system's GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559815%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout</strong></a> function to inform the driver that the operating system detected a timeout. The driver must then reinitialize itself and reset the GPU. In addition, the driver must stop accessing memory and should not access hardware.
 The operating system and the driver collect hardware and other state information that could be useful for post-mortem diagnosis.&nbsp;
</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Desktop recovery:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>The operating system resets the appropriate state of the graphics stack. The video memory manager, which is also part of
<em>Dxgkrnl.sys</em>, purges all allocations from video memory. The display miniport driver resets the GPU hardware state. The graphics stack takes the final actions and restores the desktop to the responsive state. As previously mentioned, some legacy DirectX
 applications might render just black at the end of this recovery, which requires the end user to restart these applications. Well-written DirectX 9Ex and DirectX 10 and later applications that handle Device Remove technology continue to work correctly. An
 application must release and then recreate its Direct3D device and all of the device's objects. For more information about how DirectX applications recover, see the Windows SDK.
</em></blockquote>

</a></blockquote>
<br />
With this being said, if Timeout Detection and Recovery fails to recover the display driver, it will then shoot the 0x116 bugcheck. There are many different things that can cause a 0x116, which I will explain below:<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented
 with the latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>nVidia Streaming Kernel service is loaded which is very troublesome on 8.1. Please uninstall/disable this service ASAP!</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Unstable overclock (CPU, GPU, etc). Revert all and any overclocks to stock settings.
<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Bad sector in memory resulting in corrupt data being communicated between the GPU and the system (video memory otherwise known as vRAM or physical memory otherwise known as RAM).<br />
<br />
<strong>GPU testing:</strong> Furmark, run for ~15 minutes and watch temperatures to ensure there's no overheating and watch for artifacts.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAM testing:</strong> Memtest (RUN FOR NO LESS THAN ~8 PASSES) - Refer to the below:<br />
<br />
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Memtest:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />

<br />
<strong>Which should I download?</strong><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
Do note that some older generation motherboards do not support USB-based booting, therefore your only option is CD (or Floppy if you really wanted to).
<br />
<br />
<strong>How Memtest works:</strong><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<strong>3.</strong> Corrupt hard drive or Windows install / OS install resulting in corruption to the registry or page file.<br />
<br />
<strong>HDD diagnostics: </strong>Seatools - Refer to the below:<br />

<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<strong>To reset your page file, follow the instructions below:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>a )</strong> Go to Start...Run...and type in "sysdm.cpl" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
- Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
- Then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
<strong>b )</strong> In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
<strong>c )</strong> Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
<strong>d ) </strong>Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step<br />
<br />
<strong>b ).</strong> Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
<strong>e )</strong> Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
<strong>Run System File Checker:</strong><br />
<br />
SFC.EXE /SCANNOW<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the search box, right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as adminstrator"<br />
<br />
In the black window that opens, type "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Let the program run and post back what it says when it's done.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
- Overheating of the CPU or GPU and or other components can cause 0x116 bugchecks. Monitor your temperatures and ensure the system is cooled adequately.<br />
<br />
- GPU failure- Heat, power issue (PSU issue), faulty vRAM, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Incompatible drivers of any sort <br />
<br />
- Messy / corrupt registry<br />
<br />
- Corrupt Direct X - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113</a><br />
<br />
- Corrupt system files (run System File Checker as advised above)<br />
<br />
- Buggy and or corrupt 3rd party drivers. If you suspect a 3rd party driver being the issue, enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

<p>I set my updates on let me choose, not automatic. I get promped and install updates which show in history but do not show in installed updates on control panel. I have a windows 7 professional desktop dell. Microsoft Is forcing the hidden update for the
 free windows 10 and I must hide it over and over again. The hidden update is not fully described now and identified. You have to read on the associated paragraph to find out it is actually windows 10. This is horrible and I think it has something to do with
 me not getting my updates in the control panel but just showing in history. isn't it true that your updates aren't effective unless they show as installed and not just in history?</p>

            <p><strong><em><span>Update:&nbsp; I am not certain, but I believe Microsoft has stopped trying to force feed KB3035583.&nbsp; It is the update that enables that Win10 monster.&nbsp; Up till September Patch Tuesday,
 it would re-install it as many times as it could no matter what you did.&nbsp;&nbsp; If my observation is correct and remains so, then you may re-consider putting WU on NEVER, but be very watchful</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have advised my clients to do what I have dreaded doing for years -- turn off Automatic Windows Update.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is compounded by an incessant drive by Microsoft to install Windows 10 on your computer without your permission.&nbsp; They keep re-installing KB3035583 (that is the enabler) on your
 computer, even if you uninstall it.&nbsp; The result is the huge download and then constant nags without an apparent way to say no.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So I have advised my clients to shut down WU.&nbsp; Once a month on the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then to reject specific updates like KB3035583.&nbsp;
 Then update.&nbsp; WU remains on NEVER. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some may scoff at this idea.&nbsp; Well they are incorrect.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp;
 The difference is that now you take on the responsibility of updating.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some may believe that Microsoft would not do such a stupid thing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You must read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true</a>
 Woody calls the Windows 10 download “crapware.”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 file.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer by now anyway.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><em><span>Update:&nbsp; I am not certain, but I believe Microsoft has stopped trying to force feed KB3035583.&nbsp; It is the update that enables that Win10 monster.&nbsp; Up till September Patch Tuesday, it would re-install it as many times as it could no matter
 what you did.&nbsp;&nbsp; If my observation is correct and remains so, then you may re-consider putting WU on NEVER, but be very watchful</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have advised my clients to do what I have dreaded doing for years -- turn off Automatic Windows Update.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The problem is compounded by an incessant drive by Microsoft to install Windows 10 on your computer without your permission.&nbsp; They keep re-installing KB3035583 (that is the enabler) on your computer, even if you uninstall it.&nbsp; The result is the huge
 download and then constant nags without an apparent way to say no.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I have advised my clients to shut down WU.&nbsp; Once a month on the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then to reject specific updates like KB3035583.&nbsp; Then update.&nbsp; WU remains on NEVER.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some may scoff at this idea.&nbsp; Well they are incorrect.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take on the responsibility
 of updating.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some may believe that Microsoft would not do such a stupid thing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You must read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true</a>
 Woody calls the Windows 10 download “crapware.”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 file.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer by now anyway.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are using windows 7, and have <strong><span>not</span></strong> installed win10 and do not want it, here is a procedure that I have used many times and it works.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

<p>This morning my husband had an important update which he had previously hidden, it was KB3035583! He hid it again. It didn't let him know what it was without reading into the details. It acts like it is an important update. I am trying to save this post
 so that I know how to do everything you are instructing me to do. I don't understand it all. So my hiding the updates isn't really helping me? Also, I guess since my updates are showing in history but not on the control panel I am not really getting any more
 updates, it that correct? I will change my settings as I had to do same for the laptop. Thank You so much!

            <p>This situation that Microsoft is causing to say the least unfortunate.&nbsp; To say the most, well, it could be .......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is determined to "upgrade" your computers to Windows 10, and really does not care if you want it or not.&nbsp; Microsoft sees this as a very powerful corporate force.&nbsp; The CEO-stated corporate&nbsp;objective is to convert 1 billion PCs to Windows 10 within
 2 years.&nbsp; if you do the math, that means yours and mine too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, you are going to have to do <em><strong>all </strong></em>that I have advised above.&nbsp; Not just parts, but all.&nbsp; You must do it all it once, not over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me be very, very clear.&nbsp; I do NOT advocate <em><strong>not </strong></em>doing Windows Updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I advocate is that you take complete control over what updates are installed in your computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you leave your Windows update setting at any setting other than NEVER, you are essentially doing what Microsoft wants by letting them choose what changes to make to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice well, that I did not say what <em><strong>updates </strong></em>to make to your computer, but what
<em><strong>changes </strong></em>to make to your computer.&nbsp; Windows 10 offers no such option to its users.&nbsp; That is where they want you to be.&nbsp; As Microsoft sees it, Windows is a continuously evolving thing that they choose how to change when and how they
 choose.&nbsp; Microsoft does not see this as an optional process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you feel strongly about wanting to keep your Windows 7 computer doing what it does, and want control over how it may change in the future, you are going to have to take this control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What shows up in windows update history is what was installed and when.</p>
<p>What shows up in Installed Windows Updates is what is currently installed.</p>
<p>If you remove an update, it will show in history, but not in installed updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also means you are going to have to become knowledgeable about what updates are good and what are bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend you read Woody Leonhard and note the updates that he talks about.</p>
<p>I recommend you rarely install "optional" updates, unless they very specifically apply to your computer and you can tell you actually need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the list of updates that I routinely remove if they somehow get installed on one of my clients' computers:</p>
<span>
<p>KB3035583</p>
<p>KB2952664</p>
<p>KB2976978</p>
<p>KB3075249</p>
<p>KB3080149</p>
<p>KB3022345</p>
<p>KB3068708</p>
</span>
<p>If you read enough and dig deeply enough, you will find that these particular updates to nothing for your computer's better running or security, but set them up to be changed as and when Microsoft chooses to do so.</p>

            <p>It matters not if it is force fed, if you set Windows Update to Never, because you only need uncheck it, and proceed with the other updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is rather pointless to do Windows Updates except once a month on the 2nd Tuesday.&nbsp; That is what I recommend.&nbsp; Then, you only need uncheck it once a month.</p>

<h2>            A guy booted me out of Xbox Live.</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing Halo 4, with my friend. My friend went outside to smoke a cigarette. While he was gone this other person joined and asked if i was steve. I jokingly said yes. Immediately after he said there is no way that you are steve because you IP address
 doesnt match his. Then he kept saying that he was going to kick me offline. I told him that there was no way, and that i had heard that 100's of times before, because little kids always say that. After that he kicked me out of the Xbox Live party. I joined
 again and told him that kicking me out of the Xbox Live party wasnt the same as kicking me offline. After i said that he kicked me offline for about 2 minutes and ever since that my internet has been very laggy. I want this guy banned because a mutal friend
 of ours said that he had done it many times before, and that i am not his first victim. Also what he did is illegal, and i am afraid that he saw my personal information. Can you please help me.</p>

<p>All complaints are reviewed by the Enforcement Team though of course they do have to do a detailed investigation first, if people report accurately people's activities that infringe the TOS then action will be taken where necessary.</p>
<p>I'm willing to bet they're just bluffing and spewing hot-air though: the technical knowledge of such people tends to be limited at being able to spell "IP".</p>
<p>If you feel your account has been compromised then you should contact Xbox Support as soon as you can.</p>

<p>FYI MS does not have any control over DDoS attacks as the person that bumps you offline is bumping your ENTIRE net off not just live. &nbsp;all you can do is report the users that are doing the bumping then either reset your connection to the net (unplug modem
 and router wait a few min then plug them back in) or contact your ISP. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            WinXP32, SP3 Unknown Device</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Windows XP 32, SP3 and all updates on a computer with dual 8-core Sandy Bridge processors and have the following "Unknown Device"s listed in Device Manger.&nbsp; Device ID ACPI\ACPI0004\CPUSCK0 and ACPI\ACPI0004\CPUSCK1.&nbsp; Has anyone ever seen
 this before and know how to get fix them or just get rid of them.&nbsp; I would use registry to simply disable them if I could.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, XP DOES see all 32 processors...16 + the 16 HT cores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            I have had this problem for over a week and after nearly throwing the computer out I googled the problem where I found a suggestion to look at a video, this advised to check the sounds for Skype and if it showed all sounds to change it to mute all sounds,
 I did this and it worked.&nbsp; Hope this is of use to you.

<p>I have been having this problem and was reaching the end of my patience whebn I decided to google the problem, found a message posted late last year with a link to a video which suggested the following<br />
</p>
<p>On Skype site click on Tools </p>
<p>The click on Options</p>
<p>then click on Sounds make sure to the far right it says Mute All Sounds </p>
<p>
</p><p>know this sounds strange but when I changed mine to this it corrected everything and skype is now working as it should&nbsp; for some unknown reason this little square had changed to all sounds or something similar and one would assume mute would cut everything
 out but quite the opposite.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope this works for you.</p>

<h2>            Stuck at Level 43</h2>
                    
<p>Just finished the game last night and was looking forward to going after the 1000/1000.</p>

<p>I was running around tying up some lose ends when I noticed that my EXP bar was stuck at the end of the meter and I should've leveled up. &nbsp;A quick B button revealed that, in fact, I had not leveled up and SKILLS still appeared on the menu instead of LEVEL
 UP.</p>

<p>I really don't care as I just have a few more quests to finish up, but I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced this. &nbsp;I Googled it and came up empty.</p>

<p>I'd like to get to level 50! &nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Deldete old files, make a new game or just delete old files if you have many saves, and see if that helps. The gmae is never over only the main quest is finished but the game goes on. Some have leveled up to what 110 - 150 or more. &nbsp;Maybe the PC version

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">[/quote]<br />
<br />
The max level on both is 81 and a half. Any higher than that and the game is modded.</span></strong></p>

<p>Good point about making sure you have actually reached or passed the level up point as opposed to being just shy. &nbsp;Also, there have been times when I was eligible for level up, but my actual level up was delayed until after I completed some combat or task
 that I was immersed in. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Make sure you are not trying to level up skills that are already at 100. &nbsp;They won't count towards your overall level. &nbsp;Example, if you have 100 for Alchemy, making more potions will not help improve your overall skill. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Adrian J 1981 said, once you reach 100 in a skill, you can no longer receive XP for it. And If you cannot level up while in combat then something is wrong with your game. You are suppose to be able to level up in a combat situation, they make a point
 about it. If you level up while in combat and your about to die or something, level up and everything (health, stamina, magicka) are all restored. I just reached level 60 which was a pain because I had to use different abilities that I've never used before.
 Thought having enchanting up to 100 is very useful! Also, my level up bar ALWAYS stops right at the line of ranking up. I think its designed that way.</p>

</p><p>One of my USB ports mysteriously stops working.&nbsp; It moves around from one port to another and usually manifests itself when I move the computer from one location to another.&nbsp; &nbsp;I disabled the 'allow the computer to turn off this device' for all USBs and rebooted,

            Hi Bergaz.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>.  If the SFC cannot repair broken files in 3 attempts, check the image file integrity using DISM from Step 10 of this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> Recent Windows Updates are causing device problems in Windows 10, including USB flash and external drives.  You should be able to access and back up your files on another PC.  Then here are some things to try:
<br />
<br />You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 and Windows 7 &#40;image transfer from current PC&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg maxey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and Windows 7 &#40;image transfer from current PC&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am considering getting a new PC with Windows 10 installed.&nbsp; My only reason for doing this at this point is to have access to&nbsp;Office 2019.</p>
<p>My current PC uses Windows 7 and on it I have instaled&nbsp;applications from Office 2003 to Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have watched a YouTube video which indicates it is pretty straight forward to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 1) Partition the hard drive</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2) Install Windows 7 on the new partition</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3) When the PC is started Windows presents an option dialog to choose which operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My current PC is highly customized and I would really, really like to avoid having to start from scratch and reinstall all of the applications.&nbsp; My question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Can I create a partition and then "restore" Windows 7 from and image of my current C:\ drive.&nbsp; After this action would Windows still present the dialog to choose which OS to boot or are there other steps I would have to take to achieve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Greg... dual boot in my opinion is messy.
<br />What i would recommend is creating a backup image of your Windows 7 machine then with Windows 10 use Hyper-V and create a virtual machine using your image.
<br />This is what i did years ago when Windows 10 came out.
<br />But first you need to make sure your hardware is compatible with Hyper-V.
<br />See link for requirements.
<br />

            Hi,
<br />You need to clone disk not just creating partition. If cloning will be done correctly you'll have exactly the same PC state.
<br />But please check before do something:
<br />a) does your Windows 7 license allow transfer to another hardware - OEM or preinstalled system does not allow to do this, and 
<br />b) will Windows 7 work on new hardware - there can be a problems with drivers.

<h3> robertvphelps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 start up failure</h2>
                    <p>When I start my computer it loads as it should until it presents a window, windows not loading which offers &nbsp;"see advanced repair or Restart my computer"</p>
<p>see advance repair takes you to several other choices, and restart my computer does exactly with it says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, even though I have disabled the need for a password, it forces me to enter a password with each startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shutdown does not shut down the computer completely, even thought I have disabled sleep. One click of the mouse and the computer restarts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help appreciated. Before I reverse and go back to Win 7.</p>

<p>I have spent over an hour trying to find a download for this program.&nbsp; I have found several equivalent programs and when I go on Microsoft and find their program, it shows several downloads. All of the downloads are other programs and have nothing to do
 with snipping tool. I found hundreds of articles on how to use the program but no actual dl program. &nbsp;It is obvious that I don't have the skills to find and dl a simple program and withdrawal my question from the community.</p>

<p>You're making life difficult for yourself. Asking Google about snippingtool would have saved you most of this wasted hour! Here is what you need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click an empty area on your desktop, then left-click <em>New</em>, then
<em>Shortcut</em>.</li><li>Type <em>snippingtool</em> and press Enter twice.</li><li>Drag the new icon onto the task bar, then delete the original.</li></ol>
<p>When the irritating message appears, do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <em>Snippingtool</em> on the task bar, then click <em>New</em>.</li><li>Draw a frame around the error message.</li><li>Click <em>File / Save</em> to save the snapshot to your desktop.</li><li>Open a reply in this thread.</li><li>Click the mountain symbol in the symbol bar above your message.</li><li>Upload the snapshot you saved on the desktop.</li></ol>
<p>If you find this too hard then you should ask a friend to help you or give me remote access to your machine.</p>

<h2>            BF3 Armored Kill Download Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, new to the forum. Got a quick (hopefully easily answerable) question. I've downloaded Armored Kill for BF3 multiple times, but it doesn't seem to be taking. I mean, it downloads...but I'm not certain that it's working. I deleted it from my hard
 drive and downloaded it again, but nothing is changing. I still get the little icon beside it that indicates I haven't downloaded it yet (see picture). Any thoughts? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If it's showing up in the consoles hard drive (Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Hard Drive &gt; Games and Apps &gt; Battlefield 3) then that means you've downloaded it correctly.<br />
<br />
You can easily check if the map pack is working by simply trying to go into a server that's running AK maps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Armored Kill Map List:</strong><br />
<br />
Alborz Mountains<br />
Armored Shield<br />
Bandar Desert<br />
Death Valley<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
If it lets you in the server to play then everything's working as it should be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I purchased the premium edition of the game. I did figure out what the problem was tho and I feel fairly stupid...haha. As it would turn out, everything is working properly. It seems, though, that the filters for multiplayer were set to only show the basic
 maps...not any of the expansions. Not sure why it was like that. The problem has been resolved tho. Thanks for all the replies.</p>

 it? &nbsp;Also, what exactly is backed up? &nbsp;I have two accounts, one gold and one not gold, both accounts have multiple characters in their game save data for BL:THC, and the games in BL:THC also have data (*** Rank etc) saved at the account level (it applies to
 all that account's characters).</p>

<p>Cloud is an online storage that can be accessed using Xbox Live Gold for Xbox 360 consoles and Internet connection if Xbox One. Basically, if you have cloud, your game saves get stored to your console's local storage and the cloud. Let's say for example
 you performed a factory defaults for your Xbox One or format of hard drive for your Xbox 360, your save games from the local storages would get deleted but since you have cloud storage, your save games can be retrieved. This is why cloud can be considered
 as your back up.</p>

<p>Is it accessed from the XBox One dashboard or from within games? &nbsp;Does it back up only the game save data, or does it copy the entire user profile, which would include Achievements?</p>

<p>It cannot be accessed manually. Our Xbox Live Profiles are also saved to cloud which is why whenever we sign-in our accounts to a different console, it's always updated. Achievements sync to our Xbox Live Profiles so I'm pretty sure they are at some point
 included in cloud as well. Once you saved a game progress, it would automatically go to your local storage in the console and cloud, if you're connected to the Internet. To be able to retrieve your game progress, you will just need to launch your game again
 as your updated game save would automatically sync to your game.</p>

<p>So then... it wouldn't have helped in my situation at all. &nbsp;Since only some data was lost, and it continued to be lost when I signed out and back in, then the corrupted side (cloud or local xbox drive) synced to the other so both were missing the BAR/GK/skins.</p>
<p>Does that sound accurate?</p>
<p>In this case what I needed would have been a historical snapshot.</p>

<p>Remember that cloud and local storages save game progress even the current levels of your game if it's a campaign. However, in case we are referring to levels or digital contents/add on of a specific game that are missing then you will still need to contact
 the game developer.</p>

<p>I started with them. &nbsp;After we recovered what we could, they suggested I look into the XBL Cloud Save. &nbsp;Seems though that the cloud save can't be used to help with this particular issue where only some of the game-related data goes missing from a gamer profile.
 &nbsp;Shame. &nbsp;I might play around with backing up my profile on USB at regular intervals.</p>

<p>If your cloud couldn't give you the information or save progress that you need then this only means that you have failed to properly save your game progress. It cannot be the fault of the cloud. Cloud needs you to save your stuff to it so it can give you
 back what you need.</p>

<p>You missed the point entirely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Xbox Life Cloud Save continued syncing with my local Xbox One hard drive every time I started the game. &nbsp;The complete safe was never lost, otherwise the sync would have restored it.</p>
<p>When part of my information disappeared, the sync still happened, but treated the new version -- with the missing data -- as official, and overwrite the other save (that was not missing anything) with the one that was.</p>
<p>Cloud save worked to back up my save, but could not recognize that my save had mysteriously lost some data.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to verify in my computer and found that there is no file by name<span>mfc45.dll. you
 may try to clean it using AGV and check if it helps.</span>You may contact AVG support to check if they can help you fix the file.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, to make sure y</span><span>ou may run an online virus scan to verify
 if your computer is infected and remove the infected items. Access the link below to run an online virus scan.</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Wedge Keyboard and MMKC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kkorotev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wedge Keyboard and MMKC</h2>
                    <p>I am on my 3rd Bluetooth USB dongle.&nbsp; So far, all have detected my Microsoft Wedge keyboard without complaint.&nbsp; However; Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center only sees my Microsoft mouse.&nbsp; I desperately want to program macros into my Wedge keyboard, but MMKC
 must see it first, right?</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 64 bit and have updated all drivers as well as I can (It's all brand new, anyway).&nbsp; I tried uninstalling MMKC and installing Intellitype Pro.&nbsp; Under the keyboard tab I SAW the "Enable Macros" check box, but it was grayed out/inactive.</p>
<p>If this is a known issue, would a MICROSOFT Bluetooth dongle work and where do I get one (none found in an internet search)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Account de-sync from Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ohnx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account de-sync from Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>After changing my primary email for my Microsoft account (and removing the old one), I noticed that on one of my PC's, the account email did not end up updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the purposes of this question, let's say that my old email was "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", and my new email is "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This one PC still displays "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" instead of "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". It no longer displays my name as well; the account name is just the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, it appears as if the password is no longer syncing; password changes I make on my Microsoft account no longer sync to this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first attempt to resolve the problem was to add the email "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" back to my Microsoft account and attempt signing in. The password did not synchronize, and neither did the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I tried to convert the account to a local account, thinking that I could convert it back later. However, I get an unhelpful error message and an error code 0x80004005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I tried to add my Microsoft account's new email "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" to the other people listing in Settings. The account is successfully added, but I cannot sign in - the password is said to be incorrect despite it being correct. I can even reset the
 password, but regardless of what password I type, I am told that the password is incorrect. I tried old passwords as well, and none work.<br />
</p>
<p>Finally, I tried updating my Windows version, since I hoped that a reconfiguration would encourage Windows to synchronize again. Unfortunately, this didn't change anything. I tried all of the previous steps again, and again nothing changed. I am now stumped
 and have turned to this forum to ask for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, the rest of the system works fine - OneDrive, Office, and the Windows store are all syncing to my Microsoft account and display my correct new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>
