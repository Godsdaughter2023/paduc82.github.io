<h2>            problem popup</h2>
                    Whenever windows is started or wakes up, a message appears that states "the last usb device you connected malfunctioned and windows does not recognize &nbsp;it". &nbsp;The problem is that I have not recently plugged in a usb device and all that are plugged in work
 fine.

<h2>            Surface recovery image but cant download</h2>
                    <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>I have an old surface pro 3, its in a constant blue screen reboot cycle and doesnt&nbsp;result to the usual volume up and power resets. neither does it respond to a shift f8 or f8 safe boot request and I&nbsp;now want to use a recovery image onto it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that on the MS website it gives me a link to download the image but there is no way to click the link or the image, the website keeps suggesting that I get the image from the surface itself however this isnt possible.</p>
<p><br />
Where on earth can you get this recovery image?</p>

            Lee,
<br />Only Microsoft can supply the Surface recovery image. Can you try a different browser? The full instructions are below. (Can you tell me where you are geographically as there has been an increase in folks outside the US reporting they can't download). I was told last week that if you are unable to download, if you contact Support, they should be able to send you an image on USB (and if they charge you for out of warranty support to talk to them, you are supposed to tell them that you can't download a needed recovery image and that you were told they would refund the charge to speak to support). 
<br />
<br />OK, please try different browsers and here are the steps:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacereco...</a> and download a recovery image for your Surface. You can register the device of just enter the serial number to get the download.
<br />
<br />You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-
<br />
<br />To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:
<br />Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).
<br />Step 2: 	Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.
<br />Step 3:	Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.
<br />Step 4: 	When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.
<br />Step 5:	When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.
<br />Step 6: 	Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.
<br />	If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.
<br />Step 7: 	Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.
<br />Step 8:	Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.
<br />Step 9: 	Choose Just remove my files.
<br />Step 10:	Select Reset.
<br />	Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. If it was of assistance, please DO mark as Answer.

<h2>            Surface Book 2 one battery drains while the other does not</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem on my 15" Surface Book 2 when I am not on the AC adapter. Battery 1 shows that is is at 100% and 'not charging', while battery 2 drains like normal. Once battery 2 gets down to 0% the computer turns off and never drains battery 1 at
 all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the technical support line and the guy ran the diagnostic tool and uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers for the batteries. It worked for a little while showing that both batteries were draining as normal, but once I attached the AC adapter to
 charge, the same problem came back once I disconnect from the AC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any sort of fix for this? I tried searching but could not find any solutions,&nbsp; but maybe I did not do a good enough search.</p>

            My 13" SB2 does the same thing. Charges normally but when disconnected from power the clipboard battery (2) drains completely before the base battery even begins charging. Have searched but found no answers.

<h2>            how do i COMPLETELY stop my computer from updating&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>it seems that i am CONSTANTLY being FORCED by microsoft to "update" my computer at their leisure. i never asked for their "updates", i tried turning off all things associated with their "updates", BUT THEY STILL KEEP COMING!&nbsp; I DONT WANT THEM, I DONT NEED
 THEM! </p>
<p>
</p><p>they say its for MY security? yeah, thats what ALL dictators say before they commit a mass genocide! i dont need microsoft snooping around in my comupter, because thats all their updates seem to be doing, is allowing them to forcibly access my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if anyone knows of a program to block out microsoft from accessing my computer and forcing "updates" on me, then please share them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>microsoft saying they wont FORCE a new OS on people apparently doesnt include said operating system to be forcibly changed by them at any time, even if it means screwing up whatever you are doing at the time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>there needs to be some kind of action taken against microsoft about this, because it feels like i dont own my computer, but that microsoft does! i cant turn off "windows update medic service". the FACT that microsoft has a so called "service" like this,
 is enough of an example of how many people dont want their system "updated"!</p>
<p>
</p><p>it wouldnt surprise me if this was taken down because they dont want people to understand that this is worse than apple bricking devices because of a replacement part. if i dont have control over my device being "updated" then it is not my device, but the
 one who is updating it. that is not what i agreed to when i purchased this computer (not leased, but purchased!), so it is in violation of a purchase agreement and microsoft should be facing a class action lawsuit over this! but because they said they wouldnt
 do one forcible "update" they are getting away with this! </p>
<p>
</p><p>can anything be done about this?</p>

 to slow down my system.

<p>been there, done that, MULTIPLE times now. but microsoft has a service called windows update medic service (which says access denied everytime i try to disable that. and im supposed to OWN my computer?) that re enables windows update everytime they want
 to shove one of their updates down my throat.</p>
<p>

            I think you did not do it right. If you did (disable updates), updates cannot be downloaded and installed. It will not work, that is how it works. What updates are they? You can download the hide and unhide troubleshooter to hide them.

<p>trust me, attempting to disable windows update in services does nothing anymore. their windows update medic service explicitly says its there to enable remediation and protection of windows update components. basically saying, you can turn it off, but we
 (microsoft) can turn it back on whenever we feel like.</p>

<p>This has been explained here hundreds of times but I don't mind explaining it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10&nbsp;is unlike previous versions of Windows. In previous versions, you received a baseline version of Windows that was updated over time to fix bugs and improve security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no baseline version of Windows 10. Instead, Windows 10 is a continually evolving operating system that consists of regular updates that will continue indefinitely. The updates
<em>are</em> Windows 10, so Microsoft tries to ensure that every Windows 10 computer gets updated. That's why it's practically impossible to stop receiving updates without seriously breaking Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft explained this while Windows 10 was being developed and it was widely discussed in the media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regular updates are particularly rough on two types of user:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- people who continue to use hardware that is no longer supported by the manufacturer; and</p>
<p>2- people who, for whatever reason, aren't proficient at using a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft didn't invent the idea of regular updates. Other companies, like Google, had the idea first and with Windows 10 Microsoft has finally come on board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is the most secure version of Windows. Hackers make a living from people who use outdated software. For people in your situation, here's the best advice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- If the manufacturers of your hardware support the hardware on Windows 10, stay with Windows 10. Even if you're like me, who has no interest in virtually every new 'innovation' in Windows 10 and never uses them,&nbsp; it's worthwhile to stick with Windows 10
 for the improved security alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Do a clean install. Upgrading a computer drags along all the mistakes, problems and inefficiencies of the past, while a clean install gives you a fresh start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- Invest the time to learn how to use a computer correctly and wisely. Knowledge is the number one defense against problems.&nbsp;I had to start at the Dick and Jane level - you're probably more advanced - but I'm glad I did because it has paid off nicely.</p>

<p>Your impression does not quite agree with my experience. I have seen several fairly recent machines, used for nothing other than MS Office applications, that got badly damaged by automatic updates. Some became unbootable, some kept locking up. Recovery is
 often impossible for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic Updates routinely deactivate System Restore. Why does MS give us this useful tool, then keeps deactivating it?</li><li>If System Restore points are available, they often do not work. I had two of them this morning.</li><li>Image Restore often fails to work too which is probably why it is now a deprecated tool. Apple Mac users stare in wonder, thinking of their Time Machine.</li><li>Undoing an update, if at all availabe, often fails too, going by forum reports.</li></ul>
<p>In view of this poor track record I have now installed Macrium Reflect on all client machines. It updates its system file image once every month. I should not have to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the OP: To disable automatic updates, deactivate these two services, then reboot the machine. Note that you will no longer get any virus pattern file updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Update</li><li>Windows Module Installer</li></ul>

<p>Please understand that I don't mean to argue with you. I'm merely illustrating the points I made earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"<em>I have seen several fairly recent machines, used for nothing other than MS Office applications, that got badly damaged by automatic updates.</em>"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you really in a position to say that no other activity was performed on these machines - literally nothing else - other than signing in and using Microsoft Office applications? I find that difficult.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the above is 100% correct. What makes you so sure that whatever problems were caused by Windows and not Office, which gets updated exactly the same way?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's again say, for the sake of argument, that Office had nothing to do with the machines' problems. Do you know for a fact that the hardware is supported on Windows 10 - did you ask the manufacturers, who decide whether
 to support Windows 10 - or are you presuming that the machines should be supported because they are 'fairly recent?' And did you check to determine that the machines are using Windows 10 drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Beyond all that, how would you account for the fact that so many Windows 10 computers are completely up to date and yet have no problems, including my computers?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"</span><span><em>Recovery is often impossible for these reasons</em>&nbsp;..."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, recovery is&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;possible by booting the computer from a USB drive or a disk. Doing this is a complete end-run around the hard drive, so it does not matter how messed up someone's copy of Windows is.
 Your computer could be totally tied up in knots and completely unbootable - which I have done - and yet be restored&nbsp;to working order in little time - which I have also done.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to have an update deactivate System Restore. What a feature update (translation: new version of Windows) will do, what it's&nbsp;<em>supposed</em> to do, is erase all existing restore points. That's because you&nbsp;<em>don't</em> want to restore a restore
 point made before the update. That would give your computer a toxic mixture of old and new system files, system drivers and registry hives that is almost guaranteed to crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even at it's best, which isn't saying much (in my opinion,) System Restore was not designed to pull a computer out of serious trouble. Only a backup can do that, and System Restore is not a backup nor was it ever claimed to be a backup. Restore points contain
 key system files, system drivers and registry hives that were intended to hopefully restore the Windows UI so that users would have access to Windows' own tools to help them solve a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore is turned off by default in Windows 10 (I believe, correction appreciated) because there's a much better way to pull a computer out of otherwise irretrievable trouble: restore a backup. When System Restore was first introduced with Windows
 ME, home users did not have access to convenient image backup software as we do now. Today there are many excellent third-party image backup applications that make it easy and convenient to backup and restore your entire computer in one shot in just minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft hasn't said in so many words why they deprecated Windows' own System Image Builder with the Fall Creators Update, but I can take a guess: Like many other utilities that have been included in Windows over the years for no extra charge - like Fax
 and Scan, Snipping Tool, Voice Recorder, Wordpad, etc. - System Image Builder was not designed to take the place of a full-out third-party application. Rather, these utilities provide a fundamental level of functionality for users who don't know how to install
 software or are too anxious to try. Considering how much excellent image backup software there is in the third-party space, developed by organizations that specialize in that technology, Microsoft might have said "why try to re-invent the wheel?" Indeed, Microsoft
 explicitly recommended that users install third-party image backup software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, Microsoft stopped developing SIB, and&nbsp;<em>that's</em>&nbsp;why it doesn't work well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, many of the same people who complain endlessly about how terrible Windows is don't backup. They have lots of excuses, even though computer bloggers, teachers, authors and media personalities have been practically begging people for years to backup.
 When you have an image backup you are as close to bullet-proof as you can be with a computer. In just a few minutes you can send your computer back in time to when everything was fine. But people don't do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not claiming that Windows 10 is blameless, not at all. They've got a lot of attitude that needs adjusting. But it's too convenient to blame Microsoft for everything that goes wrong. If you read through the posts in the forum, you'll quickly see that
 many posters are at the bottom of the barrel in computer skills (and in common sense, in some cases.) Other posters don't think its their responsibility to learn how to use a computer. These people make a mess of things and, of course, they blame Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finding a way to stop updates is not the answer to avoiding computer problems (and the attempt will eventually stop working, anyway.) Learning how to use a computer, just like someone learns how to use a dishwasher, a car, a hand drill, etc., is the answer.
 And if someone doesn't believe they should have to do that, at least learn how to backup.</p>

Hi razasum,</p>
<p>We recommend you to open the drive where you've installed Windows, for example C: and try these steps:<br />
a. Open Documents and Settings folder. <br />
b. Open the user folder and locate the Desktop folder.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a specific file or folder, then try searching for it.<br />

<p><strong>Ok, I have been reading around and there are tons of things people have tried to fix these same issues. &nbsp;I will say what is wrong and hope someone has a SPECIFIC fix for my issues. &nbsp;I have an AMD Phenom 9850 Quad core on a Gigabyte MA78LM-S2H Mobo.

 is very slow to access HDD, system crashes and freezes OFTEN, I have been getting "server execution failed" messages from WinMediaPlayer. &nbsp;Ctrl+Alt+delete is slow to respond and will give me the "Logon process was unable to display security and logon options

<p><strong>I get "not responding" when accessing HDD's opening PDF files, vids, whatever. Pretty much whenever I am in a HDD doing something, it will probably "not respond." It also takes a long time to shut down (minutes). &nbsp;What is the overriding common thread
 with these errors. &nbsp;I am exhausted with looking through posts to find what works. &nbsp;PLEASE HELP ME. &nbsp;I have swapped out CPU's, HDD's, Mobo, keyboard, mouse. &nbsp;I have updated the bios and CPU drivers. &nbsp;Out of money on my dream PC.&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>Hi MidoriiCh'saal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's unfortunate to know that the suggestions provided by me to Mr. Ashlee, hasn't helped you to fix the issue. Let's try a few more steps and check.</p>
<p>I suggest you to first completely un-install the game from your computer. Refer to the following link to un-install both Dragon age Origins&nbsp;and Dragon Age 2 games:</p>
<p>Uninstall, change or repair a program</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/uninstall-change-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/uninstall-change-program</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the game in completely un-installed, you may try to install both the games in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check. Refer to the following link on how to install the game in compatibility mode:</p>

<div>Hi, gpres.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That is the dropdown menu that lets you choose WHERE to Save the file you </div>
<div>are downloading.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This box generally defaults to the last previous location where you saved a </div>
<div>downloaded file. But if the destination box is empty, or if you want to </div>
<div>change the destination of the current Save as..., then just type in or </div>
<div>Browse to the folder where you want it to be saved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Many users get lost at this point. That is, their downloaded file gets </div>
<div>"lost" because they do not pay careful attention to the destination folder</div>
<div>in that box. They just hit Enter, the file is saved "somewhere?", and the</div>
<div>Save as... window closes - and the user doesn't know where the file went.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At this point, it might help to cancel the save - or the download if it is </div>
<div>not so big that you can't download it again. Then start the download or </div>
<div>Save again. Win7 should repopulate the destination box, letting you accept </div>
<div>what is there or navigate to a location that you like better. (Or just read </div>
<div>the destination where the current save is headed - and then navigate to that</div>
<div>location to find the file that you already saved there.) If the box is </div>
<div>still empty, just click in it and type in the destination pathname that you </div>
<div>want, like:</div>
<div>E:\Download\Emails\gpres</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>(I long ago made E:\Download my own default and seldom need to change it - </div>
<div>only for a file that I want to go to some special folder.)</div>

<h2>            Toolbars&#47;Toolbar Fonts appear HUGE on certain programs</h2>
                    <p>I just got a brand new Dell XPS13 running Windows 8.1 and it's been a great experience so far, except that when using a 2nd monitor, certain programs magnified on the 2nd screen only. The main laptop screen has no issues. I've only experienced the issue
 with two programs so far: Adobe Reader, and Powerpoint (and now that I'm taking screenshots, the Snipping Tool).

            <p>This is because the pixel dots on one screen are differently spaced. &nbsp;Graphics and fonts on a computer are based on dots (called pixels) and since there's so many more on the ultry-HD screen of the Surface, a 100x100 square picture looks smaller there: it's
 still 100 dots, but they're so much closer together than they appear smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's one thing you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click your wallpaper and choose Screen Resolution</li><li>Make sure all monitors are set to their best native (recommended) resolution.</li><li>Click "make fonts and other items larger or smaller" at the bottom.</li><li>Uncheck the "use one size for all monitors" and drag the slider to the recommended setting.</li><li>Apply the change, and reboot and see how it works for you.</li></ol>
<p><br />
However, it might have trouble keeping your preferred size if you're already logged in when you plugin or unplug the extra screen. &nbsp;That's because it needs to reload all the resources, so you can log off and back on after you plugin/unplug the monitor. &nbsp;But
 if that's too much of a pain, you can try some much better alternatives I explain on a blog post for this topic, here:&nbsp;<a href="http://cmdrkeene.com/dpi-scaling-with-multi-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cmdrkeene.com/dpi-scaling-with-multi-monitor</a></p>

            <p>This solution worked to keep the settings from reverting, but another problem cropped up (not necessarily because of this fix).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I unplug the USB mouse, the touch-pad does not reactivate, even if I reboot.&nbsp; This could be a big problem for me if the USB mouse should break.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remember correctly, in Windows 7 Professional, the Synaptic touch-pad automatically activated if the USB mouse was disconnected.</p>

            I have discovered a new problem with this. Just brought home a brand new HP with Windows 10. I changed the settings on Vertical Scroll but it wouldn't stick. Did this recommended fix, and the check box stays unchecked but still everywhere I go it's ignoring
 that I disabled reverse scrolling. Checked or Unchecked, the scrolling is always reversed. :( Any suggestions now?

<h2>            svchost.exe memory leak and inability to use Windows Update</h2>
                    I'm running Windows XP Professional, Service Pack 3<br />
<br />
I'm having a problem with a memory leak - a svchost.exe process will steadily increase in memory usage, greatly decreasing my performance.&nbsp; It increases as high as over 1,000,000 K if the process is not ended, but ending the process will immediately restore
 computer performance.&nbsp; If this is done, within 10-15 minutes the process will restart and again have excessive memory usage.&nbsp; I've seen a few other posts in the forum about this; they seem to be solved by installing the latest updates to Windows.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
 I am unable to do this.&nbsp; When I attempt to run Windows Update, more recent updates will appear in both the recommended and the optional categories, but when I click to download them, they do not download.&nbsp; A dialog box opens which says that the updates are
 downloading and being installed, but no progress is made.&nbsp; I have allowed this to run for as long as an hour, thinking that the updates might simply take more time to download, but this was to no avail.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t change the Privacy Settings for son&#39;s Minecraft game</h2>
                    <p>I've downloaded Minecraft for Windows 10 for my son's computer. It won't allow him to access multiplayer games. I get the message "You cannot play online multiplayer mode through Xbox Live because how your account is set up. This can be changed in your privacy
 &amp; online safety settings on Xbox.com." </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Xbox.com, click on his profile under Privacy &amp; Online Safety, then go to Xbox One/Windows 10 Online Safety, and try to click Allow on Join mulitplayer games, I constantly get the message "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>He is signed out of Minecraft. I am currently signed in, and it allows to join multiplayer games/servers. But when we log in under his account, I get the first message from my first paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are we doing wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            How to go back to Windows 7 after 30 days of upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title:- Windows 7 wanted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I purchased a Laptop in 2014 with Windows 7 on it, on purpose because it was close to XP and I didn't really like Windows 8.&nbsp; A few months back I got an offer for a free upgrade to Windows 10 and if unsatisfied in 30 days I could revert back to Windows 7.
 I thought I would try it. I didn't really like it much but I was not on my Laptop for about 2 months therefore passing the 30 days trial period and my computer kept Windows 10. I have discovered that Windows 10 doesn't support QuickBooks 2014 and I have been
 told I should upgrade to&nbsp;QuickBooks 2015.&nbsp; Well.... I don't want to upgrade QuickBooks I want a different version of Windows. Is it possible to go back to Windows 7 without it costing an arm and a leg? I don't like Windows 10 at all. It isn't user friendly
 like Windows 7.&nbsp; If something isn't broken, why fix it?&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Computer runs extremely slow when svchost.exe is using a lot of memory</h2>
                    Lately, my computer starts to run very slowly, although I can tell that the hard drive is heavily in use. When I look at the processes that are running in task manager and sort them based on memory usage&lt; the svchost&gt;exe and ccsvchost&gt;exe files are using
 a great deal of memory&gt; Once that usage drops&lt; my computer runs fine&gt; sometimes i have to wait thirty minutes or more before i can use my computer&gt; is there any way to fix this?

<p>This is a trial-and-error situation.&nbsp; Instead of using Task Manager, try using freeware "Process Explorer" instead.&nbsp; Process Explorer is basically a Task Manager on steroids.</p>
<p>Process Explorer: &lt;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a> &gt;</p>
<p>Under Process Explorer, find the copy of svchost that is using the resources and hover your cursor over the offending "svchost" name.&nbsp; That will reveal a list of services that are being controlled by that copy of svchost in a pop-up window.&nbsp; You can then
 open the Services management console and stop or pause these services (the trial-and-error part) until you find the one that is causing you your problems.&nbsp; Then go from there.</p>
<p>Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "services.msc"</p>

    <title>SSD disappeared and laptop acting weird after HDD replacement&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SSD disappeared and laptop acting weird after HDD replacement&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short (can give more details if it helps), started hearing sounds from laptop and correctly guessed hard disk was in danger of failing. Got it to the repair people before it failed, who copied my data to an external, then replaced my 1TB HDD with
 a 500GB HDD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a few more issues, but the simplest to answer would be... is it normal that I'm not seeing the second drive (D:/) that I used to have? Replacing the HDD and therefore reinstalling windows 10 shouldn't have messed with the SSD, right? And I'm guessing
 unless they physically took it out of the laptop (doubtful), it should still be there. However, laptop can't see it in Disk Management. Currently there's:</p>
<ol>
<li>C: - about 465GB</li><li>Disk 0 partition 3 - 100MB</li><li>System reserved - 549MB</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The original specifications say "128GB PCIe SSD" - where did it go?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :(</p>

<p>Hi WannabeTechie2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solid-state drives are listed under BIOS. Can you restart your computer and navigate to your BIOS settings? Please confirm if the SSD is connected but disabled. If yes, try enabling it. Then restart your computer again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not detected yet on your computer (looking in the <strong>This PC</strong> folder), can you shutdown your computer and manage to open your laptop for a physical workaround? If yes, can you check if the cables or the slot that your SSD is connected
 with is properly plugged in or not? Make sure that it was tightly plugged in so the laptop will be able to provide power on your SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you need to go back to the technician for another check up. But this time, make sure that it will be detected on the computer before you leave their store or service center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</span></p>

<p>Hi, thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS couldn't find the SSD so I just opened up the back to see the cables. To my surprise the SSD wasn't there! The new HDD is where the old one was, but the SSD is missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you think of any reason the SSD failed at the same time as the HDD? Or a reason it would have to be removed? I'm trying to keep from accusing them of stealing the drive, but I can't think of any reason the SSD is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Have you already consulted back the actual technician who looked into this before? Have them look further on your computer and let them test a new SSD to confirm if this is isolated only to your SSD or your motherboard has issues when inserted by an SSD.
 Hardware related concerns are best handled by people that can actually see a device that is not working.<br />

<p>There was nothing wrong with the SSD to my knowledge. My HDD had been making noises and was about to fail when I brought the laptop in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it turns out, the SSD hasn't even been in the laptop since I brought it back, which means there's never been a problem with SSD/motherboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm wondering is,<strong> is it possible the HDD failing impacted the SSD and it had to be taken out? Or something that caused the fail of both drives simultaneously?</strong> Otherwise I'm pretty sure they took the drive and thought I wouldn't notice.
 I'm asking so that when I do go in to consult the technician later this week, I don't unfairly accuse them of anything.<br />

<p>The laptop is about 1.5 years old and the HDD had been working just fine up until one night when it started making noises. I brought it into the technician the next morning. No SSD problems by this point. After technician looked and said HDD was failing,
 replaced it, gave me the laptop. When I got home I realized the SSD was not being recognized and discovered it wasn't even in the laptop, physically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm trying to figure out is if the SSD could have had problems at the same time as the HDD, either caused by the same issue or affecting each other. I know the HDD is vulnerable to physical bumps and such that can start errors, but to my knowledge,
 problems with the SSD are (almost?) always in the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The warranty is not available and the motherboard has been fine. The reinstallation of windows was fine after the hard disk was replaced, with the original windows product key safe on the motherboard. The HDD right now works fine, even if it doesn't have
 as much space as I'd like.</p>

<p>What does this even mean? Every time I look at my profile-thing, it says I have the MR-28 as a preferred weapon. I use that gun pretty often, but I have a few other guns that I have more kills with. Why aren't they on there?</p>

<h2>            low memory despite 8GB RAM&#63;</h2>
                    <p>i just bought a new laptop ASUS Zenbook and upgraded from win 8.1 to win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>several times a day i am getting the error message that i am running low on memory and that i should close programs to prevent loss of information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my RAM is 8GB and I'm only using very few programs (outlook, excel, word and skype).</p>
<p>in task manager the system is taking about 3GB and a bit more for the remaining programs.</p>
<p>so in total less then 3,5 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>with more than 4GB remaining RAM it should not be on low memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>could you please advise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you,</p>

            I had the same problem and nothing I read helped me, I got lucky and fixed it myself. To get your&nbsp;laptop off of the signing in/off screen, you press and hold the control + alt + esc buttons. If this works for you, you must reboot or your laptop will not
 work properly. To reboot your laptop, you must turn your laptop off completely for about 10 - 20 minutes. For some laptops, you must take out the battery and then put it back in. I hope this helps you out!
