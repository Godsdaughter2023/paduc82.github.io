            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to run the SFC scan on the Flash Drive on which you have Windows 10 Technical installed. Refer to the Manufacturer's user manual and then set the boot priority to USB Flash drive. Enter the Windows Recovery Environment and then go to Command
 Prompt. Run the command given below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>sfc / SCANNOW /OFFBOOTDIR=d:\ /OFFWINDIR=g:\windows </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Here D is the drive letter of the flash drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status of the issue.</p>

<h2>            Adding Mailtip to On Prem AD Distro</h2>
                    <p>We have on premise Active Directory syncing with O365, and we still have AD distribution groups in use, of course I cannot change settings in the O365 Admin portal, so is there a way to add a Mailtip in AD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have had an issue with users accidentally emailing the company-wide DL (sometimes with sensitive info) due to similiarities with an HR data entry address (since changed the name). Our old Exchange server crashed after migration, so our email is completely
 cloud managed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi loudude11,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>msexchsenderhinttranslations is the attribute which shows in office 365 as “mailtips”. You can go to adsiedit to see if you can see this attribute for DG. If yes, you can set mailtip value to that attribute.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Beautiful 10122 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julianclayton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Beautiful 10122</h2>
                    <p>10122 is working beautifully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update went smoothly and my PC works just fine with only a small number of minor irritations.&nbsp; Since the difficulties I had with the 1074 update I have been much more careful about what software I install - only installing programs I regularly need to
 use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I experimented with 'Tablet Mode' (although I don't use a tablet) and this reinforced my dislike of that format, this may well be due to my using desktop computers for more than 20 years.&nbsp; I can see how portability would be desirable to many people
 but I will never abandon my large screen and full-size keyboard and mouse combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having worked for 6 years in the administration department of a hospital, I can state categorically that tablets (in their current form)&nbsp;will never replace desktop computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, this latest build is very pleasant to use and I am pleased with the direction that Microsoft is going with developing the Windows OS.</p>

    <title>How do I renew university-provided 4-year Office 365 subscription if - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> metaryan25  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I renew university-provided 4-year Office 365 subscription if it has been 4 years and I&#39;m still enrolled&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I received Office 365 for free from my university when I enrolled in September 2013. I deferred for 2 years to serve a religious mission, so I've completed 2 years as of now (August 2017). Since the Office 365 subscriptions for students generally last 4
 years, I received an email today telling me that my subscription would expire in September if I didn't renew.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My question is, since I'm still enrolled at the university, how do I extend the subscription time for Office 365, or how do I renew it for free through my university?</strong> I checked the FAQ for both Office 365 and Office 365 for Education, as
 well as this community, but I couldn't find any satisfactory answers. (Office 365 for Education appears to be for educational staff, and not students.) Is this something I need to ask my university about? Will my Office 365 subscription extend automatically?
 I'd prefer to take care of this before the subscription expires (I don't want to have to deal with disconnecting and reconnecting my OneDrive storage to my laptop if possible), though I realize an option might be to just let the subscription expire then reapply
 for 365 with my university email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p />

            Hi MetaRyan25,<br />
<br />
However, Office 365 University is a four-year subscription for full- and part-time enrolled university and college students, faculty, and staff in accredited institutions.<br />
<br />
Here is reference link for checking eligibility <a href="http://www.office.com/getoffice365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.office.com/getoffice365</a> before renew/purchasing Office 365 University.<br />
<br />
Moreover, if you still enrolled then I would suggest you please contact your University admin to check whether you eligible for free Office through your University,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Your time and understanding will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<h2>            Failure of book icon to remove ads in Edge</h2>
                    At a Win 10 slide presentation at a Windows Store, we were told that clicking the open book icon to the upper right of the screen caused adds to disappear from the right-hand margin. Using outlook.com, not only did that not occur but the book icon remained
 greyed out the entire time.

            When I bring up the Inbox page of outlook.com and click on your message, along with accompanying ads in the right column, the book icon remains greyed out. That seems to contradict your assertion above, although in other cases the greying out ceases as
 you predicted. Does that imply the ad space sold by Microsoft itself is exempted from the rules applied to other ad space vendors?

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I mentioned that main website&nbsp;or&nbsp;home page wont be converted to reading view.</p>
<p>I understand that you want to use the reading view to view/read the emails in your inbox of outlook.com.</p>
<p>However, if you are not able to click on&nbsp;the book icon(greyed out)&nbsp;for a particular page i.e.,&nbsp;email in your outlook.com inbox, then that Outlook.com page cannot be converted (supported) to be viewed in reading view.</p>

            <p>Hi Chewyan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply and sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The product key that is located on the CPU is for your Windows operating System and is not for Office 2010.</p>
<p>Was Office pre-installed on the computer when you bought it?</p>
<p>Which Office 2010 suite is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>Click <font>
Control Panel,</span> open <span style="font-weight: bold">Programs</span> and double click
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the following link which talks about how to find your Office 2010 product key:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/find-your-office-2010-product-key-HA101832538.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/find-your-office-2010-product-key-HA101832538.aspx</font></a></p>

<h2>            e72 mail address autocomplete and space bar fast select</h2>
                    
<p>while sending e mail on e71 there was auto complete function for e mail addresses,&nbsp; for example when you press "a" you can see e mails starting with "a "&nbsp; which you sent before or which is recorded on the phone.</p>
<p>this is a essential feature for me I use it also with outlook, I used it in e71 and all blackberry phones support this feature but I can't use it on e72.</p>
<p>Also on e71 I can select e mails very fast using space bar but on e72 space bar is useless in the e mail menu. this function is also importnt while cleaning spams.</p>

<p>I think there was some support for auto-complete in selected functions in the E72 during the original firmware release (eg. Maps address searching and contacts searching?)&nbsp; but it seems not to be working in later firmware release.&nbsp; I guess it's better to
 use "Contact Us" since Nokia may not be listening or reading this "wish lists" written in this (mostly) user-to-user forum.</p>

            i am waiting comment from nokia because this is nokia forum. There must be difference from random forum you can find in internet. I am a loyal e seri user i had e51 than i purchased e71 those phones were great phones, than i bought e72 which i didn't satisfied
 with both software and quality only major upgrade compared to e71 is free navigation ( which is a great improvment ). if nokia is not caring what we read here i will buy another brand most probably it will be next generation blackbery bold.

<h2>            Blackberry Bold-9700 Challenging N900 &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><font>Hi Guys,</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>I for one very strongly believe for a Audio-Visual product maybe also like a Cellphone the display has to be really good especially if you are also gonna use it as an entertainment device. So on the same lines I was having this discussion
 which later on turned out into an argument with one of my friend.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Now he has a Blackberry-Bold 9700 which has a Transmissive TFT LCD, Which comes with a Light sensing screen and Backlighting. He was saying that the display of Blackberry Bold 9700 is better then that of the N900. Though the pixel ratio of
 the N900(800x480) could be higher than that of the Bold (480x360).&nbsp;He said that please do not boast about the high pixel ratio and the 3.5 inch screen real estate it could be all futile if it is not able to produce that quality pictures, with the Transmissive
 TFT LCD and the Backlighting the display of the BB Bold look a lot richer and lively then the N900. When I looked at it though I kind of felt no the N900 had a better display. But frankly speaking I couldn’t really decide, what he was saying also did make
 sense as the picture in the Bold looked very lively?</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>What do you guys think? Does the Transmissive TFT LCD, Light sensing screen, backlighting makes the Blackberry Bold 9700 have a better display than that of the N900. This despite being a N900 forum I expect unbiased observations from Die-Hard
 Fans of the N900 who also equally appreciate a quality product from a competitor if it truly deserves some admiration and appreciation :smileywink:</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>Just look at the two and make a decision, easy. You keep making these threads, but it isn't the display that makes a phone good or better, the N900 is so far ahead of all phones in so many areas it's laughable, it has capabilities that we've never seen in
 a mobile phone before. The display really isn't the point.</p>

<p><font>But thats precisely the point that I am trying to make how can you guys atleast some of them just look at a device like the N900 as merely a Gadget which keeps talking about being equivalent to a Pocket Computer and for a moment even if it
 is a pocket computer dont u guys ever watch movies on your PC ? dont u guys wish that you enjoy those breath taking pictures on the screen on which you are watching it? Display is such a important part of any device. The picture presenatation does matter.
 I mean how can you guys just look at the N900 for coding something and then using it to see if it is working? For Gods sake it also has a ability to play movies, to display wide screen pictures ever thought&nbsp;or got&nbsp;worried about using it for its this underlying
 ability ? Other then just keep talking about it being open source. What the heck a open source will do if I want to entertain myself watching some cool pictures,videos and visit some interesting web sites on my device(Where my expectation is it should greatly
 please me atleast with its display :smileyhappy: ) Look&nbsp;at everything other than the picture is what a lot of people here are advocating for, and the reason being. wow look at us what a great geeky device we have, called the N900&nbsp;which does have a 3.5 Inch
 screen with wide screen display but please dont talk about how good or bad it is. It just is, thats it ! dont talk further...I find that utterly ridiculous !! Makes no sense to me...</font></p>

<p>We'll talk until we're blue in the face, there's not really much not to say about the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen is very good, sunlight reflective for a start. When the iPhone came out the screen was 'revolutionary', best ever etc, the N900 was probably the best on the market when it was released. A year has gone by, screens have improved again, so what?
 The screen on the N900 is very watchable, i play games, browse the net, watch videos and films on it, and i never think 'damn, this screen sucks'. I have it on 3 out of 5, if i put it on 5 it still amazes me how bright and crisp it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, isn't it better to have a capable phone with a slightly inferior screen, than the best screen in the world but an incapable device? I know which i'd opt for.</p>

<p>this is laughable...cant believe that anyone who understand the visibliiyt rations woule eveer prefer a device to NOT have 2.5 times the pixels and visiblity!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the n900 has 2.5 times the visibility of the bold.&nbsp; the bold has the same resolution the iphoney has had until this year.&nbsp; it only looks vibrant because of the colors and icon-styling.&nbsp; the visibliliyt and clarity is no where near the same.</p>

<p>The screen is very good, sunlight reflective for a start. When the iPhone came out the screen was 'revolutionary', best ever etc, the N900 was probably the best on the market when it was released. A year has gone by, screens have improved again, so what?
 The screen on the N900 is very watchable, i play games, browse the net, watch videos and films on it, and i never think 'damn, this screen sucks'. I have it on 3 out of 5, if i put it on 5 it still amazes me how bright and crisp it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, isn't it better to have a capable phone with a slightly inferior screen, than the best screen in the world but an incapable device? I know which i'd opt for.</p>

<p><font>Then why is it, Forget now after a year, but even a year ago when the N900 was launched. Most of the Tech Sites that covered its review said that Though&nbsp;pictures on the N900 appear sharp, they look dull, not vibrant and
 lively. This is what bothers me...:smileyindifferent:</font></p>

<p>the bold uses more highlight/florecentized brighter&nbsp;colors which are imposed on a solid black background making it "pop"...whereas the n900 is not using, in most cases, highlighted colors, rather, the actual colors.&nbsp; so the icons do not look cheap or over-accented.&nbsp;
 also, most of our backgrounds are not going to be solid black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the older s60 icons used on nokia phones were very much so "brighter" but they looked like cheap cartoonish icons.&nbsp; i prefer the more professional, solid, correct color, rather then the highlighted/florecentized icons that look cheap and IMO, bring down
 the quality of the over-all appearance.</p>

 the case with the previous screens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>has anyone else noticed or tried looking at the the bold screen in both directions with polarized lenses to see if it is the same?</p>

<h2>            sending Group SMS&#47;text messages</h2>
                    How do I send a group SMS/ text message in windows10 mobile? I could do this simply in windows 8.1. This is an essential feature for me as a teacher because i always send announcements to groups of people like students, their parents, or fellow teachers.
 I hope someone could help with this. Thank you very much for any help.

<p>Make sure MMS is enabled in messaging settings</p>
<p>The rest is just like 8.1</p>
<p>Go to messaging, tap the + on bottom, select a contact, tap the + at the end of the To line to add another contact.</p>

            What I did actually was to create again the group. My existing groups from the 8.1 would not work, but when I experimented creating a new "windows" group for texting/message, it worked. Now I can already conveniently sent same message to multiple recipients.
 But I also did your advice. Maybe it also helped. Thanks! :)

            It does not work directly in the messaging app, just like it used to. I have to go to the People's hub and go to Groups and then get in the group and tap Send a message to everyone.

<p>Microsoft Answers sees a lot of reports with broken group messaging in Windows 10 Mobile. I wonder what the cause is. Therefore, please, post as many details as you can, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which network operator do you use, in which country?</li><li>All apps » People » Groups » not ‘GroupMe’ but your ‘Windows’ group » Message: What do you see in the upper right corner: ‘Send on: SIM text’?</li><li>What does it say above the attachment icon: ‘MMS’?</li><li>Has one of your contacts several mobile numbers or is imported from another type of account (not Outlook.com but Google or Apple iCloud or Skype)?</li></ol>
<p>It works here, even with recipients in different networks. And although Microsoft states MMS, the other phones receive SMS.</p>

            Carl, to fix a software bug, several states/phases have to be overcome. The first stage is to report – you did that. The second state, is to understand the report – we did that. The third state is to reproduce that software bug. I failed until now. Therefore,
 there is more which causes your situation. Therefore, please, go through my questions and answer each one individually.

<h3> mariner48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 - &#39;error accessing system registry&#39; when setting up profile</h2>
                    <p>A quick history - just purchased a new Dell laptop running Windows 7 (64-bit).&nbsp; Installed Office Home &amp; Student 2010.&nbsp; Have hosted Exchange service through GoDaddy; attempting to download and install Outlook to set up email account.&nbsp; (No known issues with
 the Exchange service as email is running fine on my old laptop.)&nbsp; Had multiple issues installing Outlook 2010 which I believe were caused by anti-virus software which has since been uninstalled.&nbsp; Help desk at GoDaddy initially suggested using Outlook 2007,
 which I tried, but I was never able to get past the 'You have a previous version of the Microsoft Exchange Messaging Service" error message.</p>
<p>Current status is that all copies of Outlook 2007 have been uninstalled (to the best of my knowledge) along with the anti-virus software.&nbsp; I have successfully downloaded and installed Outlook 2010, and it appears to be working.&nbsp; However, when I attempt to
 set up my user profile through the 'mail' utility from Control Panel, I am having no luck.&nbsp; No profile named 'Outlook' appears (as it typically did in the past), and adding a new user profile brings up the message 'There was an error accessing your system
 registry.'&nbsp; </p>
<p>Any input / suggestions to solve this issue would be GREATLY appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks very much!!</p>

            <p>Well... I have no logical explanation for why this is, but when I went into the Mail applet (to confirm that I could delete profiles) I attempted to add another new one to reconfirm the error message I had been seeing.&nbsp; Lo and behold, the screen asking for
 my name and email address popped up, and I was able to successfully login to my Exchange server and set up Outlook.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I also added a second user account on my laptop, and was able to set up a second Outlook mailbox for that user as well.&nbsp; I also rebooted the computer just to confirm that Outlook would launch and connect successfully, and it has.</p>
<p>The computer has essentially been sitting idle since my initial post on Tuesday, so I have no idea why this issue has apparently resolved itself without any external input... but I am not complaining. :-)</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<h2>            when I &#39;hide invisibles&#39; the page numbers disappear</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Working on Mac 10.11.6 with Word 14.6.7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am formatting a document that requires some headings to be on the same line as the following (Normal) text. I have done this by clicking on the paragraph mark at the end of the heading and then control-shift-h.
 this is one of the options suggested on </span><span>http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/RunInSidehead.htm.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All looks fine until I 'hide invisibles', which closes the line space between the heading and the text. &nbsp;However, the page numbers also become invisible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I printed off a page with invisibles (and page numbers) showing and found to my surprise that the page looked correct, with indented headings and Normal text on the same line—but the page numbers did not print.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have formatted the headings using the appropriate built-in heading styles, and inserted the page numbers using the 'Insert' dialogue on the bar at the top of the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there a way to insert page numbers so that they don't turn invisible, or some other solution to this problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Completely Separate, Independent Email Accounts in Microsoft Outlook 2007</h2>
                    <p><span>I apologise if this has been answered before.
<br />
<br />
On the particular laptop computer I am using, I have Outlook 2007 &amp; Windows 10. I have my main email account setup in Outlook that is the default account and is on Microsoft Exchange.<br />
<br />
I have 3 other email accounts that are POP/SMTP. I have no trouble setting them up but they all go into the same account as my default account mentioned above.<br />
<br />
What I would like to do is to have each account in its own, separate account list, with its own inbox and sent items etc.<br />
<br />
Also, whenever I send an email from any of these separate, email accounts, I would like the email to show up in the sent items folder from the account I sent from.
<br />
<br />
I would also like to send emails from each, separate account separately. They will then go to the correct email address I send to from the chosen account and have the accounts username shown at the top of the email as normal.<br />
<br />
Just to add to this, I do have existing .pst folders for these extra accounts but do not know whether I need to use these or import them with regard to the setup. Perhaps if you can let me know whether I need these or not?<br />
<br />
Hope this makes sense and any help will be appreciated.<br />

Thank you<br />

<p>I have been trying to word my frustrations about OUTLOOK after being forced to ditch WLM and you have exactly the same requirements and problems as I have.</p>
<p>It's so unusable to have my main Email address with behaves normally ,only to have my wife's email address ignored when people receive her mails they appear to come from me. I have one other email address which is totally unusable.</p>
<p>Also since setting up MS Outlook Exchange,(which is recommended and automatic) I have aliases attached to my email addresses which I have done nothing to setup and do not fully understand their functioning conditions.</p>
<p><em>Please can someone have a very simple way recommended to have my three email addresses totally independent that send &amp; receive and show the recipient&nbsp; exactly who it is sent from.</em></p>
<p><strong>Surely&nbsp; its not too much to ask, as my emails&nbsp; functioned perfectly with WLM but this very expensive Outlook (tied to my office 2016 pro plus at£129) is so user unfriendly and complicated to setup!!.</strong></p>

<h2>            Email search and indexing fix &#40;Mac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have an issue where new emails in Office 365 (Mac) aren't indexing and therefore I can't find them when I use the spotlight search. Running the auto search repair seems to resolve this temporarily but can anyone suggest a permanent fix that doesn't
 mean I have to re-index every time I want to be able to search my entire inbox.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Max_PI,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try rebuilding the Spotlight index on your Mac. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>1. Choose Apple menu &gt; System Preferences, then click Spotlight.</p>
<p>2. Click the Privacy tab.</p>
<p>3. Drag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Or click the Add (+) button and select the folder or disk to add.</p>
<p>4. From the same list of locations, select the folder or disk that you just added. Then click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the list.</p>
<p>5. Quit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk.</p>
<p>Note: Depending on your Mac and the contents of its hard disk, re-indexing may take several hours to days. Until this process is finished, Spotlight won’t know the contents of your disks and neither will Outlook. All lists like contacts, events, notes etc.
 are generated by the Spotlight searches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft has a dedicated support channel for Outlook for Mac issues. For getting a better support, it is recommended that you contact Outlook for Mac experts by clicking on<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517"><span>Contact

<p>Hi Barry</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this, but its the search function within Outlook itself I'm having trouble with not the spotlight at the top of the Mac taskbar. Does the fix below still apply? If so, where will I find my outlook email folder to drag into the privacy box?</p>

<p>Hello Max,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. You can refer to the steps above to reset the Spotlight. It doesn’t matter which folder you selected in the steps. You can see that you will need to remove it in Step 4.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you can refer to the step 7 in this article to reindex the Spotlight index.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to SQL Server</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up a new, local PostgreSQL Server on my Mac today, intending to use it to sync data to Excel. The setup wen't well and every tool I tried could connect to the server ... except Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of starting the server and making sure the necessary users exist:</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
I triple checked the password for the "postgres" user, startet Excel and configured everything:<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be43aa75-adbd-421d-8b8f-c70331d93618?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be43aa75-adbd-421d-8b8f-c70331d93618?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Only not to be able to connect to the server. Instead I get an error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15bb8eb6-2f16-4160-a8ca-719984ca9a42?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15bb8eb6-2f16-4160-a8ca-719984ca9a42?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The German part roughly translates to "Error while establishing a connection". Also whenever I try to connect, the posgres-Server logs: "invalid length of startup package" as you can see in the last lines of the first screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated previously, I'm able to connect to the server using any other tool I tried. Also the "Actual Open Source Databases" ODBC driver connection and subsequent connection to Excel works like a charm. However I'm not willing to pay 40$ just to use a functionality
 that is already build in to Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wit's end as I have tried every (for me) conceivable combination of different users, local and not local servers an even an MySQL server that I specifically set up for this purpose. It made made no difference and was still giving the same error.
 Also I literally "googled for hours" but found nothing helpful. It is very much possible that I'm doing something wrong, since I don't really know much about Excel or ODBC drivers. But for me it seems to be a problem with Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luca&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi TheLuca,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, the official Microsoft method for connecting Excel for Mac to a database is to use a few supported drivers. You may use&nbsp;the Actual Technologies driver.</span></p>
<p><span>For your reference:&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/ODBC-drivers-that-are-compatible-with-Excel-for-Mac-9FA6BC7F-D19E-4F7F-9BE4-92E85C77D712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ODBC drivers
 that are compatible with Excel for Mac</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you are experiencing issues when connecting to the PostgreSQL Server, I suggest you post a new thread on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-general/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the
 PostgreSQL Server Community</a>&nbsp;to see if there is a way to workaround the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>As Cliff said, you will need a compatible driver. Actual Technologies has one</p>
<p><a href="http://actualtech.com/compatibles.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://actualtech.com/compatibles.php</a></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have worked with drivers from both companies and highly recommend both companies. Their drivers and customer service are both super.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your screen shot it looks like you might be using the built-in SQL Server driver. I know that the built-in driver works with Microsoft SQL Server, but am not sure that it will work with PostGRE SQL Server. I would think that a special PostGRE driver
 would be required. You could try Actual Technologies driver and use it for free to test. When using the free trial, only the first handful of records are returned, but at least you can test to make sure it works before you buy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surprised that the connection method pop-up is not showing one of the 3 authentication methods. These should be available to you:
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Your server name looks correct. You have the IP address followed by a comma followed by the port number.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try going in without specifying the database name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the server end, the administrator most likely will have to allow your Mac to access the server.</p>

<h2>            Bullet Does Not Appear Every Time I Press Enter</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am creating a simple bulleted list, and usually, you would automatically see a bullet everytime you press enter, if the line above had one as well. However, I am not getting the this new bullet. Rather, the document just resets itself to the settings
 it had before the bullet system. Thus,&nbsp; I would have to click the "bullet-style list" button for every new line to get a bullet. Please answer ASAP!!! Bullets are kinda crucial to a college student who has to take notes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!! :D</p>

            <p>If you have applied numbered headings, numbering may be removed when you press Enter because of the "Style for following paragraph" setting in the Modify Style dialog box for each of the numbered styles. By default, it is set to "Normal" but you should change
 it so that the "Style for following paragraph" is "Heading 1" for the Heading 1 style, "Heading 2" for the Heading 2 style, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To display the Modify Style dialog box for a heading, you can right-click the style name in the Styles pane (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S) and choose Modify. Or you can type in the style name in the Apply Styles pane (Ctrl+Shift+S) and then click the Modify button.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer crashes after download the file</h2>
                    <p>Original title: IE Crashed on me<br />
<br />
I downloaded the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bug occurred I believe because I had the downloads folder open. Once I had seen the file had changed its icon representing it had fully downloaded. I ran the installer. Completed the install.&nbsp; When I returned to the browser the browser had locked up.
 When I did ctrl+alt+del Internet Explorer had stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the browser keep something open to the file that connects it with the browser download and the Run / Open Folder dialogue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would explain the bug. As I gather you assume the person will always run the install from the browser and not go into downloads.</p>

            The following is a function I once wrote for multiple replacements:<br />
<br />
Public Function MultiReplace(varInput, ParamArray varReplacements())<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' call like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' MultiReplace("abcdefghijk","c","V","e","X","j","Y","m","Z")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' to return this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' abVdXfghiYk<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const MESSAGETEXT = "Uneven number of replacements parameters."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim n As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varOutput As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim intParamsCount As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(varInput) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intParamsCount = UBound(varReplacements) + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If intParamsCount Mod 2 = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varOutput = varInput<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For n = 0 To UBound(varReplacements) Step 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varOutput = Replace(varOutput, varReplacements(n), varReplacements(n + 1))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox MESSAGETEXT, vbExclamation, "Invalid Operation"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MultiReplace = varOutput<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
In your case you'd call it along these lines:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ? MultiReplace("ab c#defg hijk"," ","","#","")<br />
<br />
to replace spaces and the hash sign with zero length strings:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abcdefghijk<br />
<br />
or you might want to remove hashes and replace spaces with underscore characters for instance:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ? MultiReplace("ab c#defg hijk"," ","_","#","")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Change view of form and subform</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I have a form (<span style="font-weight: bold">Name : form1</span>) with some control on it that it is bounded to a table
<br />
I have a form (n<span style="font-weight: bold">ame: form2</span>) that has a subform (name: sub1) and a textbox (name : Txt1) where the form is bounded to a table (name: table1)<br />
Questions:<br />
1- how can I change the view of form1 from form view to Datasheet view and Contrariwise.<br />
2-How can I change the view of sub1 on the form2 from Datasheet to form and Contrariwise.<br />

<p><br />
I suppose you ask for code solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Me.CurrentView = 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RunCommand acCmdDatasheetView<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RunCommand acCmdFormView<br />
End If</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me!sub1.SetFocus<br />
RunCommand acCmdSubformDatasheet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an old constant&nbsp;that has the advantage that - despite its name - it toggles between subform views. With the newer acCmdSubformDatasheetView and&nbsp;acCmdSubformFormView you would have to check for the current view again.</p>

            <p>thanks for response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>are you referring to the 'marketplace' icon on phone? if so, that does not work either.</p>
<p>it only shows 'one update' which is htc hub. if i try and update that, it says 'Can't get this information at the moment, Check again in a little while."</p>
<p>
</p><p>i should say this phone was recently subject to a factory reset so it is running OS 7.0.7389.0</p>
<p>i tried to update OS using Zune but it gets stuck on 'checking for updates'</p>
<p>
</p><p>the intention of this phone is simply to use it for games for a 10 year old (temple run etc would be good)</p>

            <p>most of the games (like temple&nbsp;run)&nbsp;will not work on WP7 anyway (only WP8 and newer).</p>
<p>my recommendation is to drop that phone, it isn't worth the trouble.</p>

                    <p>Since updating my PC to windows 10, when I attach a pdf file in outlook, the file is attached as a Microsoft edge document.&nbsp; I have changed my default app for pdf files to adobe acrobat however, the file still shows as a Microsoft edge document when attached
 to an email in outlook.&nbsp; How do I correct this so the file is attached as an adobe acrobat file and shows the adobe icon instead of the edge icon?</p>
