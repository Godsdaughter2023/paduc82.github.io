                    Nervous Cursor: when I type, the cursor will jump all around like a blue **** fly causing me to unscramble the message and re-write it. I have changed my mouse, slowed down the movement of the cursor on the computer program...still persists...is there a
 fix recommended??

            <p>Most of the time when I hear symptoms such as these, the computer turns out to be a laptop computer and the cause of the cursor jumping around is because when you type on a laptop computer your wrists or palm of your hand ends up brushing close to the touchpad,
 causing the cursor to jump around the screen.&nbsp; If you have a laptop but use a mouse, try disabling the touchpad.&nbsp; On some laptop models, this is done by double-tapping a small LED in the upper-left corner of the keypad.&nbsp; Otherwise, check your control panel
 or device manager.</p>

            <p>Possibly because the GT 210 graphics card does not meet the minimum system requirements.</p>
<p>Minimum is GTX 450 and DirectX 11.</p>
<p>The GT 210 is a DX10 capable only, and can run only games that use DX9 or 10.</p>
<br />
<p>The link below has a basic comparison of these two cards, and as you can see the GT 210 as less than</p>
<p>half of the processing capabilities of the GTX 450.</p>
<p>(your card is the newer version with 1GB VRAM, but this extra RAM would be little benefit with a low end</p>
<p>gpu such as this).</p>

<h2>            Game ideas - got any put&#39;em here&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So i was sat here thinking about games that have come out and realising that some of the ideas I had or have seem to have come about already by the big companies
<br />
<br />
I recently got an idea for a kinect game which would involve just yourself...<br />
<br />
I would put the idea up but I don't wanna embarrass myself haha, so I was wondering if anyone else had any game ideas for any type of game or console that you can either think of now or have for a while!<br />
<br />
thought this would be interesting !</p>

<p>I'd like to see another 2D RPG platformer on the modern console. &nbsp;Castlevania is the only one I can think of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They continued it with the DS which was awesome. &nbsp;They also had HoD on 360 which was just a quick multiplayer blast through though. &nbsp;Not as good as SotN, PoaR or OoE.&nbsp; The newest 3D Castlevania on 360 was decent, but I'd rather play SotN or any of the DS'
 Castlevania games all day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope they continue it with 3DS but It would be nice to see sometihng similar on 360.</p>

<p>I would love to see a really big, expansive, open world, western rpg. &nbsp;There would be hundreds of quests, ones that require thinking and strategy, not the simplistic ones like most today. &nbsp;Big bosses that you need to team up with friends to defeat (bosses
 that actually take up the screen and would massacre you normally). &nbsp;More passive skills, that can make you money, make armour, build houses/villages. &nbsp;It could hold up to about 24 people per world, along with enough npc's in the larger villages. &nbsp;Lastly customization,
 so that your skills and look will completely set you apart from others.</p>
<p>Rpgs are my favorite genre so I would love to see something like this come out for the 360.</p>

<p><span><b>My Ideal PvP Game</b></span></p>
Introduction
<p><span>So this is going to be a long spiel about what I wish would be a game. This was mostly inspired by the recent Harry Potter movie because it made me think about how cool an action game would be with just magic; no physical
 medium such as swords and spears, but just magic. Also it occurred to me that you can “balance” games if they use fictitious methods of combat more easily without players questioning the method. Fantasy settings in general are more malleable and are easier
 to work with when it comes to making a player’s experience equal to that of others.</span></p>
<p><span>What I’m aiming for is a game that uses a backwards “S-curve” to determine the strength of abilities and then some multipliers to further player customization and tactics. These points will hopefully be explained well
 later on.</span></p>
<p><span>Please do excuse any poor art; I am making these from Microsoft Paint with a small touch pad. Also I hope that this “copy + pastes” well from Microsoft Word, there’s no way I can write this in that damn forum box.</span></p>
<p><b><span>NOTE that the numbers used here are not final but are being used to aid the explanation of my design. I also noticed while writing this that this idea is geared more towards the PC. Oh well, the PC’s better anyway
 :P. I’m also not the biggest PvP fan so my idea may just flat outright suck.</span></b></p>
The Power Curve
<p>What I believe must be explained first, for the rest of this article to hold together well, is the power curve. What I’m going for is the backwards “S-curve” that changes depending on how the player sees fit.</p>
<p>Here’s a backwards “S-curve”:</p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1125.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fl594%2fgameshoes3003%2fpowercurve1.png" /></span></p>
<p>Yeah, it’s not great but there’s a backwards “S” in there. What this graph is supposed to represent is the dissipation of power of a magical ability over some distance. But here’s where I want things to get interesting.</p>
<p>What if the player could control that S curve? How about for a steeper S curve there can be a high initial power? How about a more linear curve in trade for less power? Power vs. range is the conflict I want players to have in designing
 their character. Do take note that all abilities are technically ranged abilities. Though players may get in close proximity there are no melee attacks.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1125.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fl594%2fgameshoes3003%2fpowercurve2.png" /></span></p>
<p>Here’s a graph with a player choosing very high initial power with the consequence of losing range.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1125.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fl594%2fgameshoes3003%2fpowercurve3.png" /></span></p>
<p>Here’s a graph with a player choosing to linearize the power curve choosing a lesser initial power but having that initial power last over a longer range and also having a high minimum damage (poorly shown in this graph).
</p>
<p>The very first graph would then represent something in between I guess.</p>
Why this matters
<p>These power curves are essentially some kind of multiplier for the abilities that the players use between 0 to 100%. So let’s talk about a player choosing a high initial power curve.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1125.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fl594%2fgameshoes3003%2fpowercurve2.png" /></span><span>&nbsp;</span>(Shown again for those who have already forgotten)</p>
<p>Let’s call the top of that curve 100% and then the bottom of the curve to be 10%. At that very close range, an ability will have full (100%) effect. At the furthest range the ability will only have 10% of the intended power. Now for
 the other curve…</p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1125.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fl594%2fgameshoes3003%2fpowercurve3.png" /></span></p>
<p>Let’s call the top of the curve 60% and the bottom of the curve 50%. At close and somewhat medium range, the ability will have 60% of its power. At long range, the ability will have 50% of its power.</p>
<p>This is where I want that Power vs. Range conflict to happen. Does the player want to maximize the full effects of an ability and get close, or does that player want to keep a distance at the cost of power. Of course there will be
 skills to accompany the style the player wishes to play as.</p>
The Types of Abilities
<p>Now that we’ve discussed what the power curve is, let’s talk about the abilities it will affect. What I currently have in mind are five attribute domains: Power, Defense, Healing, Mobility, and Energy. These attributes can further
 be modified with what I’d like to call “Multipliers”, which will be discussed later, to strengthen and unlock more abilities for that particular domain. Let’s first go over these attributes first.</p>
Power
<p>Oh boy, this one should be pretty easy to figure out. The Power attribute deals directly with all of the offensive abilities. Damaging, some slowing (some will be in defense), snaring (forcibly holding an enemy in place) and other
 offensive buffs are here. So yeah, you attack with these abilities. Damage enemies, slow them so that you can keep them in range, snare them so that they’re forced to stay in range and buff an ally’s ability to deal more damage or extend an effect of it. Use
 these abilities accordingly with others as it would be very difficult taking on an enemy with just your own attacks. Using slows and snares can give opportunities to your allies for more attacks.</p>
Defense
<p>As you can probably already figure, the roles of these attributes are pretty easy to figure out. Damage prevention/reduction (shields/damage mitigation), slows, and forced unit displacement (forcibly moving an enemy) and other defensive
 buffs are here. These abilities prevent damage and therefore it needs a preventionist type of playing. Being able to predict which ally is prone to attack and when is key to fully utilize these skills. Predicting incorrectly however can lead to disastrous
 results. Distance with the power curve will also affect how well a player’s prevention acts succeed. Shield allies who are taking damage to prevent further damage, slow enemies to allow your allies to escape and push away enemies to create some needed distance
 between your team and the enemy. </p>
Healing
<p>Oh where would gaming be without this type of ability? Your classic set of support skills. Unlike Defense abilities however, Healing is a reactionary ability which has its own faults as well. Having to wait for an ally to be attacked
 can be tricky as the attack can happen swiftly across multiple targets and healing is further limited by the range of one player to another and the power curve. Heal allies back to full health and potentially resurrecting them can turn the tides of a battle.
 Also the Healing domain will possess some disables (disables enemies from using their own abilities) in order to buy time for some big heals and possibly prevent further damage.</p>
Mobility
<p>Now this is probably the most important domain out of all of the attributes. Mobility allows those who want to keep a distance from targets; it also allows those who need to get close do so. The player’s ability to use these skills
 will determine who wins and who loses. Mobility provides movement speed increases, blinks (short distance teleporting), and rolls/tumbles. (Note: the difference between a blink and a roll/tumble is that with a roll/tumble, enemies can see exactly where a player
 is going and also some things in the environment can obstruct it. Blinks however are not as predictable and also can bypass small obstacles.) Almost all action games have positioning as its most powerful tactic, this game also follows that trend.
</p>
Energy
<p>Now most games with abilities that are used upon player command generally have the abilities use some kind of resource. We’ll just use the general term, energy. This attribute will affect the Energy regeneration for the most part.
 This attribute is a bit more passive than others but has much potential which will be covered with the Multipliers.</p>
Multipliers
<p>Here’s the part where players get to further customize their play style. This is essentially the “stat point” part of the game where players get to dictate which skills get to be more powerful than others. But here’s how I want it
 done.</p>
<p>I am calling these stat points “Multipliers” for a reason. They literally multiply the attribute they’re placed in. The current system I have in mind is as follows:</p>
How much they modify
<p>There will be a total of 5 multiplier points available to the player. For Power, Defense, Healing, and Mobility, each multiplier point added in will grant a 7% increase on the power curve, and a 5% reduction in energy cost. For Energy,
 each multiplier will grant addition energy regeneration, and a 8% reduction in recharge time.
</p>
<p>For example: let’s say you put one multiplier into Power. Now let’s say you have an ability that deals 100 base damage and it costs 100 energy. Now that ability deals 107 damage and the costs 95 energy with the multiplier.
</p>
<p>Also in conjunction with this, with each multiplier added an upper tier of skills will be unlocked. These upper class skills are more effective than the last or offer a more unique ability.</p>
Stacking multipliers
<p>As you’ve probably guessed, yes, you can stack multipliers into a category more than once. This means that you can put 3 multipliers into Power and 2 in Defense, or something like that. However there is a special deal when you stack
 all 5 multipliers into one category.</p>
<p>At this point if a player has put all of the multipliers into one category, that player is literally attempting to specialize only in that category and will be relying on other allies to fill in the other roles. As a result, there
 will be a 15% boost to the power curve for those abilities however it comes at the cost of a 10% decrease in the power curve for all other abilities aside Energy. This will result in a 50% boost in the power curve and a 25% energy cost reduction with 10% less
 power in the other attributes aside Energy. The decrease of effectiveness of the other categories shouldn’t matter too much however due to the fact that the player should almost be solely using the domain he/she is specializing in since those are all of the
 skills that have been unlocked.</p>
<p>But be careful with this, let’s say a player stacks all of the multipliers in Power. Yes the player is incredibly powerful now but that player is going to suffer from a 10% less effective mobility skill to move around quickly. This
 means that player will need another player to use a skill to boost him/her up. Another situation would be if a player stacks all of the multipliers into Mobility. Now that player can move around very fast, but has weaker attacking power and cannot support
 others as effectively. However just being able to get in and out of fights easily may be more than worth it.
</p>
Stacking multipliers on Energy
<p>Now Energy is the funny category. It is literally the utility attribute where nothing can really go wrong with it. Upon stacking 5 multipliers into Energy, that player will be granted all tier 1 skills for the other categories. This
 means that along with the massively increased energy regeneration and 40% recharge time reduction, the player can use any of the tier 1 skills from the other categories making this player a “man of many hats”. But hold up there, the 10% reduction on the power
 curve still affects this specialization which should balance out the skill spamming from the reduced recharge times.</p>
Play how you want
<p>These multipliers along with the power curve allow players to customize the way they want to play. If players want to get in close quickly and hard they can choose a short ranged power curve with multipliers in Power and Mobility.
 A player wants to be a full support that’s right at the front; that player would choose a short ranged power curve. Perhaps a player wants to be the “man of many hats” with some range; choose a more linear power curve and either stack all multipliers into
 Energy or put one in each category.</p>
Energy regeneration or reduction
<p>A thing that’s brought up with my current system is whether if a player should go for a more powerful skill with a cost reduction or go for more energy regeneration and a recharge time reduction that affects all abilities. Well, that’s
 another choice the player can make. Energy cost reduction often leads to powerful bursts but with a long duration of inactivity to recharge the used energy where as energy regeneration can lead to the use of abilities more often but with short lapses where
 the player must quickly recharge.</p>
Don’t fear ranged players
<p>In a lot of games, ranged players often have a large advantage over those who rely on close proximity. Well, that’s when the power curve balances things out. Mobility skills are also affected by the curve. An example here: a blink
 skill’s base displacement is 10 units. A player using close ranged combat can move those 10 units (100%) whereas a long ranged player can only move 6 units (60%). This makes it where players can close the gap easily. However this is only the case if both players
 are using a basic Mobility skill with no multiplier. If a player starts using a higher tier mobility skill along with the boost to the curve, things start changing. But the ultimate factor lies in how the players choose to move their characters.</p>
Abilities
<p>So each domain will contain abilities for the players to use. Before any multipliers are put in, basic skills will be available to the player (about 15% of the total skills for the domain). Then at tier 1, many more skills will be
 available (total of 40% skills available). Afterwards the available amount of skills will go up in smaller increments or a flat 15%.</p>
<p>The player should have only 10 abilities available in-battle. This will have players think about how to build their character for combat.</p>
<p>I’ve pretty much explained what skills each attribute would have, so I’ll leave it to your imagination of what the skills should be.</p>
Game play
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Make this game have a third person camera.</p>

<p>I would like to see a game combine the Rock Band / GH game play with something like GTA. So the main character is an aspiring musician but is also part of the drug scene. So there is shooting and playing music in the game. I have shared this before and people
 asked what controller the game would use. I have no answer to that lol but hopefully you can somehow have both normal controller and instruments plugged in and signed in. I am sure some game dev could solve that problem. Of course the early GH games allowed
 the use of a standard controller.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 battery and volume icon keep disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rainey99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 battery and volume icon keep disappearing</h2>
                    <p>This started 3 days ago. Every time I turn on my laptop the volume and power icons are gone and they are greyed out. I stop windows explorer and restart it and they appear but it is frustrating to have to do this each time. I have read it may be a corrupt
 profile but I am unsure how to fix.</p>
<p>Any suggestions.</p>
<p>Windows 10 has been a nightmare. New pc with Windows 10 loaded and I have had all kinds of issues and not sure whether to move to another OS system.</p>

            <p>The troubleshooting did not find any issues and neither did the SFC scan. The icons disappear after a few days and if I restart windows explorer they come back for awhile. Not sure what the issue is but I guess this will be my workaround. Windows 10 for
 me as not been a good decision. My next laptop I may just leave windows and move to a mac.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get rid of the TDR error</h2>
                    <p>I've been fighting this for months now. The screen flickers, my CADCAM program crashes, and the event viewer says "Display driver amdkmdap stopped responding and has successfully recovered".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeez, it just did it again as I'm typing this post. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made a registry key TdrDelay and set it to 8, then to 16, then to 32, no help. I've made a registry key TdrLevel and set it to 0 to try to turn it off, no help. I reinstalled Windows (clearing out the hard drive in the process) and made sure the only
 video driver installed was the latest version, no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's not a graphics card thing because from what I've read this is happening on cards from multiple manufacturers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you PLEASE get rid of this thing, the video card works fine, it's Windows that's messing things up because it keeps looking for an error that isn't there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>Besides, why should I do all that? It used to work just fine. Let me guess - Microsoft once again released an 'update' that creates more problems than it solves, right? Haven't they ever heard the old saying "If it ain't broke don't fix it"? If anything
 they should have eliminated TDR checking completely because in reality it serves no useful purpose other than to crash things.

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have had my pc for around 2/3 months now, and just recently i have been getting a BSOD very often; whenever i am playing a steam game on my PC. The error message that comes up is KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE. I have looked in event viewer and in sync
 with the BSOD's are 8 warningsalong the lines of "processor x in group x has reduced processing power and has been like this for 71 seconds".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a link to my three most recent dump files from C:/Windows/minidump --&gt;&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjlixJub_TV7gXVF7Mpbxf4-SPLR</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried most of the things that have come up in other forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it means anything i have an MSI laptop, running Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and major<br />
drivers. That error can also be caused by incompatible 3rd party antivirus<br />
and other startup programs and drivers. Of course there are other possibilities.<br />

<br />
dc1-controller.sys is a Windows component which means something else drove it into<br />
Fault.<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Check with MSI Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their
<br />
forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and the major<br />
on-board and separate device drivers (see driver update methods below). Especially<br />
update the network and video drivers.</p>

<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check with Steam Support and Forums about known issues.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Uninstall Norton/Symantec which has been known to be involved is such issues. Use<br />
Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype<br />
WD and the Windows Firewall offer superior protection and compatibility.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. </strong>Use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
<strong>5.</strong> If needed run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).<br />

&nbsp;<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : <br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set
<br />
VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and<br />
<strong>BIOS and chipset drivers</strong>).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down&nbsp; <br />
the make and complete model&nbsp;of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click&nbsp;UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right&nbsp;Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this
<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard <br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and <br />
then Device&nbsp; Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their
<br />
latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after&nbsp;each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually&nbsp;shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers&nbsp; particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as&nbsp;needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER <br />
- check&nbsp;manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>
</p><p>You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a><br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If Driver Verifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we <br />
can analyze it. </p>

            <p>I have realised that as soon as i connected my headset to the controller, and then to the PC via USB, i started to get these crashes. The reason why the headset is connected to the controller then the pc is because the only way the microphone will work on
 the headset is if it is connected via usb, and connecting the controller was the easiest way to fix this</p>

<h2>            Cannot change permissions when I am the owner of the folder</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to fix some odd permissions issue. &nbsp;A download client of mine keeps saying it cannot write to disk.</p>
<p>When i try and give everyone full control to the folder I get the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>"failed to enumerate objects in the container. Access Denied." &nbsp;This pop up over and over again for each individual file in the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go look at those individual files and I am the Owner of those as well.</p>
<p>I cannot figure out why this is even a thing, and it's extremely frustrating. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jiyaul,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to the Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the description, it appears that you are getting an error message “setting up personalized setting for c\windows\system32\windir\svchost.exe.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I will certainly help you out with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s try these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: <span>I would suggest you to test the issue in Safe Mode.</span></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap <b>Settings</b>, and then tap
<b>Change PC settings</b>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, click
<b>Settings</b>, and then click <b>Change PC settings</b>.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>b. Under <b>PC settings</b>, tap or click <b>General</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>c. Under <b>Advanced startup</b>, tap or click <b>Restart now</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>d. On the<b> Choose an option</b> screen, tap or click <b>Troubleshoot</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>e. Tap or click <b>Startup Settings</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>f. Tap or click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>g. On the <b>Startup Settings</b> screen, choose the startup setting you want (Enable Safe mode).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>h. Sign in to your PC with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For more information on how to boot the computer into safe mode, refer to the following article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b><span>Windows</span></b></span><b><span> Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts <span>Windows</span> with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode then place the computer in clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Clean boot</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the error doesn’t appear in Safe mode, then put the computer into clean boot state and then try to eliminate the error.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;Please note:</span></b><span> After the troubleshooting, make sure to boot your computer to normal mode by following the step 3.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Run System file checker scan.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><br />
Run a system file checker scan and check if that helps. Refer the following steps to run SFC scan.</p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
b) Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.</p>
<p><br />
c) In the command prompt type in the following command: ‘<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Scan the computer using Windows Defender and check.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to scan the system for malware using Windows Defender or Antivirus software installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to scan using Windows Defender:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span>From the start screen, type <b>Defender</b>.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span>Tap or click <b>Defender</b> from the results.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>To the right, change the Scan options to <b>
Full</b>. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Tap or click <b>Scan now. </b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e. </span></span><span>If any infections are found you will be asked to remove or quarantine the item. Follow the instructions on the screen for removing the infected items.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists or you have further questions on Windows, please do not hesitate to let us know. We will be glad to assist you.

<h2>            How to turn off Automatic Updates on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I don't want W10 to do automatic download of updates....then install them when W10 wants to.&nbsp; It causes problems with ongoing work.&nbsp; I was filling in a critical part of a form when my laptop dropped what I was doing to perform an update and then I started
 again and it turned itself off to finish the update and it was for a programme I don't even use!&nbsp; I couldn't figure out why the performance of my laptop had dropped to a trickle...you guessed it .... an update in the background. I want to chose and do not
 have a blasted programme control me.&nbsp; NOT HAPPY with W10 so far!</p>

            <p>Yvonne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If you have the "Pro" version of Windows, then follow the instructions I gave above. That is the best you can do now. It at least allows you to decide when updates are downloaded and installed. If you have the "Home" version, the only&nbsp; thing you can do
 is suspend rebooting until a set time that you can define. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Microsoft has configured Windows 10 to automatically download and install updates. This has angered many people. Microsoft will not change it as they feel that keeping Windows systems up to date prevents bad things from happening to the computers. In theory
 this is fine. In practice, if they send down a bad update, all h*ll will break loose. There are two other problems that go along with this new update policy. If you have installed a problem update, it is almost impossible to get rid of it. If you uninstall
 it, the update will come right back just like Jason in Friday the 13th. You used to be able to uninstall an update and then uncheck or "hide" it so it would not download again, at least until you were satisfied it was fixed. That option has been pretty much
 taken away although they have a tool stashed away somewhere that can do this, but from what I hear it does not always work. The other problem with Microsoft's new policy is that they now download and install device drivers to your system. This can really wreak
 havoc with systems when all of a sudden a device driver is installed and breaks the device. Also with the new Anniversary Update, Microsoft has removed some of the customization capabilities in Group Policy Editor. Who knows how far they will take that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; So that is the quandary. Windows 10 is a nice operating system when they finally get all the bugs out of it. It is (was) free, however you will paying in other ways (such as ads) for not initially paying for the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck in whatever way you decide to go.</p>

<p>Hi Armandoa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are willing to turn off the Automatic Updates on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10</strong> will download and install the updates whenever they’re available and it is recommended to install all the updates. You can prevent the system restarts to install the updates happening at the most inconvenient time by scheduling
 a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer below article and follow the steps given to turn automatic updating on or off on Windows 10.</p>

                    <p>I unpinned my microphone icon from my windows10 taskbar thinking I wouldn't need it. I then discovered it had other purposes but can't find any way to put it back in the taskbar. I presume it must be lurking somewhere on the system.</p>

<h2>            Account Suspension. Double check case review&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My account was suspended for "trying to obtain unauthorized refunds." I have just gotten out of a chat with a support agent. He reviewed my account and informed me that there are no sign of any unauthorized refunds on the account. And he advised me that he left notes on my account stating what may have caused a confusion. My case number is&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. Please double check this. He informed me that he is 100% positive that this suspension was a mistake and will be withdrawn. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My thumbnails for pictures reverted back to icons suddenly</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Okay, so I've been dealing with this for the last three hours and it's driving me buggy. Just, two days ago my pictures in</p>
<p>Windows Explorer reverted back to icons, and I dont want to leave them like this because I deal with lots of pictures and I'd like to be able to see them without opening them. I am really not computer savvy, but I will give what I got.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a Windows 8 on a Toshiba laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've already messed around with the icon sizes (small, medium large, etc) It didn't work.</p>
<p>-This is happening to all of the image files- jpeg, png, gif.. they are either blue mountains, flowers or simple shapes, etc.</p>
<p>-I have already tried going to folder options and dealing with the checkboxes for icons and thumbnails.</p>
<p>-I have also tried going the control panel route. Anything involving appearances and unchecking/checking boxes I have already tried.</p>
<p>-I tried restarting and seeing if that's what it needed to finalize.</p>
<p>-I have downloaded a .reg thing that is supposed to enable the pictures to show.. I dont know it I activated it correctly,</p>
<p>but I've fiddled with it for twenty minutes, and noticed no changes after restarting.</p>
<p>-There is a chance it could be from an update, but I have no idea how to find out- the updates didn't specify appearance&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions I'd like to hear them.. I will also retry anything above I've already done. But please, if you suggest anything, try to be specific the first time.. this really isn't my forte'. Thank you.</p>

            Option One: System Restore <em>(safest, try this first)</em>
<p>If the problem just began recently, you can restore Windows back to an earlier time, called a restore point. This restores backups of your registry and system settings, but doesn’t touch any of your files. It only takes a couple of minutes, and you can undo
 the process or try another date if it doesn’t fix the problem on the first try. When you aren’t sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.&nbsp; This works best if you use it immediately after a problem shows up.&nbsp; Waiting
 more than a week or two means the good backups can be too outdated to use.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+R</strong> to show the Run box, type
<strong>RSTRUI </strong>and click OK.</li><li>Choose a date when the computer was working correctly, and click Next to restore the system files from that date.</li><li>Check to see if the problem is fixed. If not, you can go back to step 1 to either undo the restore process, or try another date.</li></ol>
<div>
<a href="http://cmdrkeene.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/restore.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f08%2frestore.png" height="466" width="580" /></a>
<p>System Restore can undo recent changes to the system, without affecting your personal files.</p>
<p>So whatever may have caused it, this will get it fixed.</p>

    <title>How do I remove the Administrator account on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dasaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove the Administrator account on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Upgraded to windows 10 and it sort of created a duplicate account for an administrator, and now instead of just booting up the laptop, it logs in on default to that new empty administrator account, then i have to manually switch to my own account. The
 same when i try to turn the laptop off or reboot it - every time it says that someone else's using this computer. Hiding the account with the command prompt was of no help.<br />
For i find it extremely annoying , i tried to downgrade back to win 8.1, but the system won't let me do that. it says that before you can switch back you should remove another user's account you've created. But I did not, and I can't remove it obviously. Is
 there any way to fix this?<br />

<p>This shouldn't be hard to fix.&nbsp; Windows is not supposed to automatically login to anything, so&nbsp;can you do this for me to ensure the registry is set as such?</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>First, go to the Run box (press <strong>WindowsLogo + R</strong>) and run the command
<strong>NETPLWIZ</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Make sure the checkbox is turned on, then click Apply.<br />
If it is already on, turn it off and back on, then click Apply.&nbsp; This is in case the registry setting is not reflecting the actual state.<br />

<p>Small steps. Can you check:&nbsp; is this in addition to the normal built-in administrator account (the one with the real username of "administrator")?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check, type <strong>net user</strong> at the command prompt.&nbsp; You'll notice that this will show accounts that the NETPLWIZ dialog does not. For example, my actual Administrator account is disabled (the default), so it doesn't show (and it cannot be deleted,
 but you can disable it to keep it from being available or shown anywhere).&nbsp; (The extra "localadmin" account I have is the admin account I use day-to-day, it's just a normal user account for me).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8c412b2-c57b-461a-8c74-abb5c3949a84" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if the one that you want to remove is "the one true admin", then I would just disable it.&nbsp; If it's not, you can type
<strong>net user <em>username </em>/delete</strong> to remove the account.&nbsp; Note that you'll need to run Cmd prompt as admin, so right-click Start and choose
<strong>Command Prompt Admin</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS. Make double-sure you have a remaining admin account. If you don't, and you delete one or disable it, the only way to fix it is to erase your drive. That's why I have my own account, a "local admin" as a spare, and just leave the built-in one alone and
 disabled (it enables itself in safe mode</p>

            Okay, the black thing lists "my regular account" as an administrator and then "default account" as guest.<br />
The white thing says Administrator account is the built-in administrator account.<br />
I tried to disable it but didn't succeed. By that I mean I was still logged in to that account when starting the computer only to find out that it was blocked.<br />
<br />
Everything worked fine before Windows 10.

<p>we have a general computer in the house. No one owns but everyone. With Windows 7 it was not a problem.</p>
<p>When upgraded to Windows 10 - it did not request a account or password. It was using the same one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we decided to use Netflix app - when asked for an account and password, I gave my own account and password from my personal computer. Well it changed the administrator to my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next - no one could use the computer without my login. I have created a account and set as administrator but it does not work. This account cannot download app, cannot see the external storage. Cannot do anything.</p>
<p>I am going to reinstall Windows 10 as clean installation. This is my next frustration.</p>

            <p>I have almost all these faults (except with Outlook till now). So I decided to go back to Windows 7 but I can't! I have the answer:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;You are created one account (Administrator). Go to Setting&gt;Accounts&gt;Other users to remove these accounts and then try again.</p>
<p>I used both advices of Shawn: <strong>netplwiz</strong> command and <strong>net user
</strong>to check but no Administrator account besides normal built-in my account was found.
</p>
<p>I went to Setting&gt;Accounts but there I found only my account as Administrator and ASP.NET machine account among Other Users.</p>

            I think I have to add that one time I created Administrator account with command<strong> net user administrator /active:yes
</strong>but then I removed it with command <strong>net user administrator /active:no</strong>. Besides after the computer restart there is no admin account seen to choose from. There is only one and only my user account.&nbsp;

    <title>How to prevent hardware windows home button from waking tablet in my - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to prevent hardware windows home button from waking tablet in my bag&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I've got a problem with my tablet waking from sleep when I carry it around in bag.</p>
<p>Samsung Smart PC 500T. There's a hardware power button on the upper rim of the tablet - this one is safe from accidental triggering in my bag. Also there's this hardware&nbsp;windows home button, the one with the new windows logo, this one is located on the front
 of the tablet, right beneath the screen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put my tablet in a protector sleeve (a pouch), put in in my bag, carry it around and experience irritating battery drain because the windows home button triggers my tablet to wake in bag. I've researched the issue of disabling it&nbsp;on the internet and it
 has not yet been answered. Also, I've read one&nbsp;MS employee&nbsp;answer at this forum stating that&nbsp;"the windows home button is an integral part of the windows experience."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please.. Thank you for evangelisation, but seriously, how to disable this home button? It drives me nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for reply.</p>
                </div>

            If there is 3rd party software for this - then this CAN be done.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>There are hacks to the windows registry, which can disable any type of key you can name. Power buttons, volume rockers, keyboard buttons, even external accessories like mouse, whatever. If the system can recognize the button in the first place, this behaviour
 can be overriden. I've even googled upon registry hacks for surface for disabling the power button - thing is, those are very specific solutions and I've got no idea which of the tens of thousands of fields in my windows registry to target.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I stress this - it is a simple registry hack. Just have to know what to tweak.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could you please pass this issue on to a support engineer who is more capable instead of simply bumping over this with a diplomatic 'sorry can't fix this'? Thank you.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The previous version of this post was far more undiplomatic in regards to the quality of the answer given. With all respect - if you know what I mean. It's just that I think since this is neither your fault nor your problem, it would be inappropriate for
 me to **** out at you. Don't know how to fix this, ok, fine. Nobody's super mario. But please, pass it to someone who knows this stuff. You wouldn't want to waste 750$ of your bucks on a tablet that's crappy by design. Feel me, man.

            My Win 8 Tablet has a capacitive touch HOME button below the active tablet screen. &nbsp;When I am using my stylus to make notes and drawings, the HOME button gets touched by the palm or wrist and KaBOOM! &nbsp;No more fun with the stylus until I hit the HOME button
 to get my drawing app back up.
<div><br />
<div>Here's a cool way to fix &nbsp;that HOME button. &nbsp;I cut a 3/4 inch square from my plastic BORDERS discount card, don't need it anymore. Then a 1.5 inch strip of IBM blue masking tape secures the square of plastic over the capacitive button. This effectively
 disables the button.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Problem solved.&nbsp;</div>
<div>While we wait for a software update for Win 8 or an app to become available.</div>

            I've the same issue when I'm using the stylus !<br />
<br />
Why palm rejection does not apply on the home button when we use stylus...<br />
<br />
I think Microsoft have to find a solution.<br />

            I'd just like to say "me too".&nbsp; I have an HP Envy X2.&nbsp; I inadvertently press the Windows button multiple times, every single time I unplug the tablet from the keyboard dock.&nbsp; I have to be careful about how I carry it around to&nbsp;keep from&nbsp;waking it.&nbsp; This&nbsp;ABSOLUTELY
 is something that needs to be fixed WITHOUT a third party software solution.

            I have this trouble, too. Using an Asus Taichi 21 - handwriting on the tablet is all-but-impossible because you accidentally hit the windows/start button all the time! Please give us a way around this!
