<h2>            files from a system reserved drive</h2>
                    I mounted a SATA drive as a USB drive, I see the drive, but there are no visible folders.&nbsp; This drive came from my old laptop which I am unable to boot due to power supply issues.&nbsp; I am looking to donate the laptop after moving personnel files from the
 HW.&nbsp; What is the procedure to read data off of this system reserved drive?

<p><br />
After downloading the correct .iso file use ImgBurn or Gear ISO to create a bootable DVD.</p>

<p><br />
ImgBurn - In addition to supporting the creation of Cds/DVDs from .ISO files, <br />
it supports a wide range of other image file formats, and it's free. <br />
(BIN, CUE, DI, DVD, GI, IMG, MDS, NRG, PDI and ISO)<br />

(The steps are the same for Windows 7 or Windows 8), except you are not creating a Repair disc but a full installation DVD)</p>
<p><br />
Note: Always use high quality DVD+R media and the slowest burn speed (4x or 6x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p><br />
====================== Keyless Install ================================</p>
<p>How to perform a 'Keyless Install' of Windows:</p>
<p><br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD disc you created and start the installation process.</p>
<p><br />
After you enter user name and password you will be asked to: 'Type your Windows product key', do not enter a key.<br />
Also located just below the box where you would enter the key is a box with a check mark to 'Automatically activate Windows when I am online', remove the check mark and click 'Next'.</p>
<p><br />
You will now have a 30 day grace period in which to activate Windows. </p>
<p><br />
During this 30 day grace period you can try resolving your problems.&nbsp; <br />
After you are satisfied all problems have been resovled then activate Windows.</p>
<p><br />
====================== Device Drivers =================================</p>
<p><br />
Go to your computer manufacture's support web site and check for Windows 7 drivers for your specific model number.</p>
<p><br />
If there are Windows 7 drivers, then download to a folder on your hard drive and install all of them, starting with the Motherboard/chipset drivers, SATA, LAN, Audio, USB, Graphics, Webcam, Etc., and so on.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Technika Support and your Computer Maker Support and ask in their forums<br />
(if any) about any known issues. They should also provide connection methods.<br />
<br />
Try this :<br />
<br />
Turn OFF the Bluetooth device.<br />
<br />
On Computer Charms Bar -&gt; Settings -&gt; Change PC Settings -&gt; Devices<br />
<br />
HOLD the Power Button on the device for 8+ seconds until the BLUE light starts to flash.<br />
<br />
Device has entered pairing mode - on computer click "Search for Devices"<br />
<br />
Install or update drivers if needed though Windows 8/8.1 will have many.<br />
<br />
If paired -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Sound - Playback Devices - set as Default if desired.<br />
<br />

Bluetooth devices around you. For each detected Bluetooth device, it displays the following
<br />
information: Device Name, Bluetooth Address, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, First
<br />
Detection Time, Last Detection Time, and more. BluetoothView can also notify you when a
<br />
new Bluetooth device is detected, by displaying a balloon in your taskbar or by playing a
<br />
small beep sound. - FREE<br />

<br />
BluetoothCL is a small console application that dumps all current detected bluetooth devices<br />
into the standard output. For each Bluetooth device, the following information is displayed:
<br />
MAC Address, Name, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, and optionally the company
<br />
name of the device (if external file of MAC addresses - oui.txt is provided) - FREE<br />

<br />
BluetoothLogView is a small utility that monitors the activity of Bluetooth devices around
<br />
you,&nbsp; and displays a log of Bluetooth devices on the main window. Every time that a new
<br />
Bluetooth device arrives to your area and when the device leaves your area, a new log line
<br />
is added with the following information: Device Name, Device Address, Event Time, Event
<br />
Type ('Device Arrival' or 'Device Left'), Device Type, and the company that created the device.

<h2>            My cursor changed to the XP one and won&#39;t change back&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So I was messing with the settings and changed the cursor size to big, which turned it into the XP cursor, which I didn't like. So I tried returning it to normal size. It did, but the cursor remained like the XP one and I can't figure out how to change it
 back.</p>
<p>Can anyone here help me?</p>

            Posting on the forums here will do nothing to address your concern. If you see something that is against the code of conduct then use your console reporting function to report the message, club or activity feed post. If the enforcement team agrees that
 the activity is inappropriate then they will act accordingly.

            It honestly feels like some of you ambassandors dont fully read or care what we have to say, clearly you didnt read that they keep making new accounts and that reporting the profile will result in them making a new one and starting over. Did you attach
 one link for me to actually get somewhere with this ? No. A phone number? No.. Yea it will do somethin.... Like actually be talked about and shed light to a scam that is a serious problem. Maybe you should choose your words wiser because you came off extremly
 rude, nothing will come of me sharing a serious discussion? Try reporting the account which i already stated they keep making more! Seriously? Thats the best you can say. It really is shameful how you answeredit was rude and unhelpful as per

<p>Nothing in my reply to you was offensive. I'm sorry if you felt it was offensive however it was a very matter of fact statement of what you have to do to address the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, it would be easier for us to read your posts if you separate your text into paragraphs instead of making a big wall of text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ambassadors are volunteers who try to help out on the forums based on their experiences. We have no ability to help you out beyond the guidance provided in our posts. We can't contact enforcement or support team members on your behalf.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFAIK, the Enforcement team does NOT read forum postings here so posting about your experience will not help you address your issue which is why I wrote that you should use your console reporting function.</p>

<p>If you want to report a specific message, you can actually report THAT message directly to Enforcement. Go through your message history on your console until you find the offending message. Highlight it and you should see an option to report the message.
 You can also simply report the offending user, and Microsoft will be able to review the messages they sent you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, such messages are annoying, and you absolutely should report them. These do happen in waves every several months, and like before, it will drop before it increases again in a few months and Microsoft stops THAT wave.</p>

<p>I'm sorry but I'm unaware of a phone number that you can use to contact the enforcement team. You could try including your phone number in the details that you report and the enforcement team MAY call you if they need to discuss your issue beyond any evidence
 that is automatically collected by the Xbox systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from being an Xbox Ambassador, I am just a regular Xbox user like you so I won't be able to help you out further even if you were to send me anything privately. I wish you well in trying to resolve your issue however the console report function is
 the only Xbox tool that you can use to effect change if the enforcement team finds inappropriate activity.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You mean to say other Chinese language packs are grayed out or options grayed out?</p>
<p>Is your PC installed with Windows 10 Single language?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, then as a work around suggest you add some other language pack, other than Chinese. Once you done with that, reboot your PC, go back and try to change it to Chinese (traditional, Taiwan) to see if it allows you to do. I appreciate if you could send

    <title>Issues with Word Home and Business 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soaki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Word Home and Business 2016</h2>
                    <p>Some advise please. I recently bought a new laptop and the Office Home and Business 2016. I had someone installed it. Later I used it to work, but when I tried to download files from email attachments or internet, the Microsoft word would not open. The prompt
 windows 'word experiencing an error trying to open the file .. and went on to provide suggestion, which does not apply.</p>
<p>I took my laptop to another IT person, who says that my product key is activated but he can't see where the Office is installed under the programs install or uninstall. I have lost the product key and related email password that this person who installed
 had used.</p>
<p>Should I just reboot and then purchase a new Office 2016 to start all over again?</p>

            Hi Soaki 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general) 
<br />
<br />How to Repair
<br />Windows Key+R &gt;  Type appwiz.cpl and Enter &gt; Click on Microsoft Office &gt; Click on Change on top (you can right click also) &gt; Change &gt; Now, you would get options to repair Office 
<br />
<br />Aside - No need to repurchase. You don't require a product key for MS Office if you have installed and activated it. You require it just once, for the first time installation and activation.
<br />
<br />Once you install MS Office 365 / 2016 through Microsoft site and activate it, a digital signature corresponding to your computer gets stored in Microsoft servers. 
<br />
<br />Now whenever you login to your Microsoft account, it will check whether you are trying to install on the same computer or not. It won't ask for the product key again. 
<br />
<br />Hence, go ahead and reinstall. Follow the Help below to reinstall - 
<br />

    <title>Disk Management console view is not up-to-date - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disk Management console view is not up-to-date</h2>
                    <p>I am having this strange problem. When I open "This PC" desktop app, there are two volumes listed Windows(C:) and RECOVERY(D:), but when I look in-to my computer Disk Management, besides EFI and Windows(C:) there are two RECOVERY partitions, both hidden
 and 100% empty. I know that recovery is fully functional, so it must be that Disk Management is not up-to-date? Please, advise me, what can I try to correct this issue. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Thank you Abdul_Malik for helping me out! Please, tell me, which screenshot you think is right. If the second screenshot (Disk Management) is right, RECOVERY partitions are empty, storage space is 100% free, but if the first screenshot (Devices and Drives)
 is correct, RECOVERY is OK? I am really confused. Can you tell me, please, how to 100% tell (TEST) that RECOVERY is OK and working. I have HP laptop and if I press F11 repeatedly at startup, according to HP instructions, I can definitely enter in-to RECOVERY
 environment. If this is true and RECOVERY is working, then second screenshot (Disk Management) is not showing correct partition values? Or maybe this "100% free space" is showing because RECOVERY partitions are not using NTFS file system, they are probably
 using FAT?</p>

<p>Hi Peaser</p>
<p>If you want the same view applied to all folders, open one folder and set the columns the way you want them to appear.</p>
<p>Leave that folder open and select &nbsp;<strong>Organize/Folder and Search Options/View Tab</strong>. Click the &nbsp;<strong>Apply to Folders</strong>&nbsp; button.</p>

    <title>Moving files to external drive via firewire is so slow, about 200 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bangkokbob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving files to external drive via firewire is so slow, about 200 times slower than Vista</h2>
                    I have 2 1.5Tb external drives connected to firewire, these contain music and video files.<br />
Now I have upgraded to Windows 7 it takes ages to move even small files, I just tried to move one MP3 album and it was over 5 minutes. The first minute was "calculating" the number of files, and transfer speed. When it eventually got going it only managed 192KB/S.<br />
This was almost instant with Vista.<br />
I am due to make back-ups, it used to take about 12-14 hours before, at this rate it'll be next year before they are done.<br />
How can I restore sensible transfer speed?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            <p>I suggest take a look at Windows 7 personalization website, there are several themes there that you could download for Windows 7:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/personalize/themes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/personalize/themes</a></p>
<p>If you didn't find what you want, you could easily create whatever you like and save it as theme.</p>

            This is not an MSE qissue.<br />
<br />
What operating system are you using? <br />
What is the current system protection?<br />
Do you have any error codes when the updates fail?<br />
<br />
Here is something that may help you:<br />

            <p>Sorry, I was away and just got back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some questions that I have asked you to which you have not responded to. So lets start over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your computer when you first got it was Win 8 preinstalled, if yes was it Win 8 or Win 8 Pro, if no, what version of Windows did you have?&nbsp; Was this an upgrade?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You say that the Geek Squad changed the hard drive, what else did they change ex. motherboard?&nbsp; They reinstalled Win 8 on the computer after repair and did they use your install disk to do so?&nbsp; They gave you back the install disk, are you sure it was yours?&nbsp;
 Where did you acquire this disk from originally?&nbsp; What was wrong with the hard drive you had originally?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, when you try to boot from the install disk, it immediately tells you it is not a match or it does so after a certain point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply to all these questions so I may further help you.</p>

<h2>            Feature update to Windows 10, version 1803 - Error 0xc1900204</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for the past few weeks I have been trying to update my PC but it has been stuck in a loop of downloading -&gt; failing to install on reboot -&gt; revert back.&nbsp; &nbsp;The updater can install other updates if it happens to do it first, however the Windows 10 1803
 update is failing every time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen many people with this problem and have tried almost everything I see but with no luck.</p>
<p>Lots of people say updating from an offline ISO file works but im not sure if that will wipe everything or just update windows?&nbsp; Bit afraid to find out the hard way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi MattF03, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Windows10 not compatible with samsung.</h2>
                    <p>I just bought windows10 64 bits and I installed it in my computer from 0 (so I can't downgrade to make it work).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My monitor is a samsung, which I have connected to my computer with an hdmi cable, whenever I enter windows10 the monitor don't recognize the input because it's not compatible ( the messatge it shows in the screen is "mode not compatible") and the only way
 I have to make it work is entering in windows10 secure mode, where it says that the refresh rate is 64hz, and there is no other there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated the drivers of my video card using a tv to see it, but it still only shows 1 option, which is not compatible with my monitor. How can I make it so it shows more that one freqyency so I can change it to one my monitor can work with? I'm really tired
 of this new SO but I'm not going to buy again another windows to install it.</p>

            <p>I enter the secure mode(the only way I have to see windows) and I've tried the compatibility mode on win8,7 and vista, all of them get installed and just after that, a message pops up "operative system not compatible", and I think it reverses the compatibility
 installation, because when I turn down the computer and I get in again the same message shows up with the 3 compatibility modes. Any other idea of what can I do?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My video card is a radeon 7700, and it worked fine with windows vista 32 bits 1 hour before I got the installation of win10 perfectly showed, and about 30 sec of the win10 desktop, until it went to no compatible mode. When I turn on the computer, I can see
 the windows logo until( it looks like) the log in windows comes( I never see it because the tv it switches to no compatible mode).</p>

<h2>            Error code&#58; 0xC004C003</h2>
                    <p>Day 16&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting tiresome. These endless blogs that provide no real answers and no response from Microsoft, despite seemingly 100's (reported which likely means thousands of actual) of failure to activates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted above, this is my error code. The reported key I have is: &nbsp;***** - 3V66T . This reported on a Toshiba Satellite A505 that came with Win 7 pre-installed and that I upgraded to Win 7 Ultimate. I received notification back around August 1st that my
 upgrade was available and so I began this odyssey. My goal was merely to update/grade and not to do a clean install (and therefore, to date, I have to tried that) not seeing the need. I received the above noted error message immediately after the final reboot.
 Somehow - not sure how to this day - I engaged in a chat with a Microsoft Tech. He asked several questions and concluded by saying that since I had followed the proper way to upgrade I was ok. He continued with the now famous "wait 24-48 hours" message. Well
 at this point I'm still waiting TWO WEEKS later. I'm not sure what else to add, if anyone has any questions - drop me a note... Standing by... &nbsp;</p>

            I am in the same situation - upgraded back on the 2nd, and continue to get the same error (same last 4 digits in the key as well) - opened a case after a few days, was told the same 24-48 hours, spoke with chat several times - on Monday of this week they
 checked my old win8&nbsp; key and it was fine, checked the key and product id on my current install of win10 pro and it is the generic numbers they say come up with every blocked activation.&nbsp; Have seen some folks say you can roll back then upgrade again and it
 will work, but when I tried to roll back it said the files it needed were no longer there.&nbsp; I upgraded using the upgrade icon that showed up a while back, so no clean install or anything like that - I don't get it...

            I'm in a similar position.&nbsp; I'm afraid to roll back, figuring something else will go wrong.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp;&nbsp; The replies from MS assume the worst about users -- either that we're dunces who messed something up, or we're using pirated software.&nbsp; Nothing could be

            <p>Very similar situation here -</p>
<p>Toshiba Satellite S55t-A5237 Win 8.1</p>
<p>Win 7 Pro upgrade would not work on my other laptop due to hardware/memory issues (the thing is OLD)<br />
Downloaded 10 Pro upgrade medium and loaded on Toshiba via USB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Loaded fine with the exception of audio driver, I'm sure that can be worked out.</p>
<p>Not activated. Same error code, same reported key ending in 3V66T</p>
<p>Assumed it was an error due to the Pro upgrade</p>
<p>Can't roll it back to old Windows - says files are no longer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried every solution, existing recovery media, reset you name it.</p>
<p>Is the only solution to pony up new $ for a pro upgrade that I've already spent $ on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming by now it's a clean install and the product key is wiped.</p>

            <p>I contacted tech support (the online version) again this weekend and finally got it resolved.&nbsp; In a nutshell, they verified my previous OS was valid (checking the key that I got when I purchased that) then were able to issue a new key for Windows 10, which
 activated it.&nbsp; One thing that was odd - one of the routines they run tries to pull up the key from your previous OS, but mine was coming up blank!&nbsp; I had to provide the one on the card that came with my copy of Win8 Pro, which they were able to verify.&nbsp; I
 wonder if one of the issues is that sometimes when patching from 8 to 8.1 the key gets corrupted, then when you try to upgrade to 10 it doesn't show a valid key, so it shows it as blocked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, while it took a while for them to get things sorted out (around&nbsp;2 hours) they were helpful and got whatever issue I was having resolved, so kudos to them!</p>

<h2>            Joining a blackops 2 online game</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, just chatted to an ambassador and was advised to post here. When I try to play black ops 2 online I struggle to get a game started. I join a lobby in public match and then click find match. It checks for games and finds 40 to 50 but then doesn't analyse
 them and eventually starts a lobby with just me in it. I watch other players join and then usually leave after a few minutes. This is very frustrating as I have played all other games on Xbox live without any issues. Please help. I have only played about.
 4 games since buying the game last Friday.</p>

<p>I would also change your search preference to any when you are about to pick a gamemode; Push X and you'll get that option. This will help you get into any lobby regardless of connection/region/ping.</p>
<p>Let us know if that helps.</p>

<p>What region are you in? Do you have all DLC for the game? Black ops servers are known to only play in your area. If you live in the US for instance if I live in Colorado. Most players you play against will be in the same state. If your in the UK, Asia, or
 any other location it will be the same. You will be playing with people in your same area. Also if you don't have any map packs the game will not allow you to play with someone that does because you cant play the same games as they do. So depending on your
 location you live in the time your playing the game the mode your playing the map packs you have will determine if you can play or not. I have the same issue because I play in Korea so even if it says 25,000 people are playing its a general number and not
 the specific number of players you can join. When you do get in matches request them as friends or access recent players to join matches if you cant find any lobbies.

<h2>            We Will All Go Together quest..</h2>
                    
<p>So I am looking for the 10 'irr. NCR tags' and came across 9 (including the non-hostile NPC in the house) . I have double checked / triple checked the area numerous times and cant seem to find the one NCR trooper that has the last tag.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know where else I can find 1 more of these tags? And if my companion kills one, will the tag still show up?

                    <p>Hi everyone, I recently clean installed the latest version of Ubuntu on my laptop, I run a dual-boot system by the way. Before that, I installed a software Easy BCD to remove the GRUB. It went very well. Then, I removed my Ubuntu partition and merged it
 with the existing Disk C. Afterwards, I installed Ubuntu without creating a new partition, instead I opted for "install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10" and I was able to allocate the partition for Ubuntu. Again, it went well. However, I noticed that my disk D
 went missing when I tried to defrag my disk today. It only shows disk C. Yet, my disk D does still exist as I can use it to access my personal files. What should I do to retrieve my disk D back on the disk defragment menu? Any help or suggestion is appreciated.
 Thanks beforehand. </p>
