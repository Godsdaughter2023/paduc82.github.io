<h2>            Unable to add payment option</h2>
                    When I click on the link to add a payment option to my account, I'm presented with a page that states, "<strong>Enter your payment option info.</strong>" The remainder of the page is blank and there is no place to enter any information. I have used Edge,
 IE &amp; IE in compatibility mode. Any assistance would be appreciated.

<h2>            In Excel 2016 for Mac it is not possible to edit the comments that have been created in certain cells, compared to Excel for Windows 10.</h2>
                    In Excel with Windows (either 7, 8 or 10), it is easy to edit the comments that are inserted in certain cells of a sheet, being able to choose different colors for example to highlight some section that is wanted in the comments. However, in Excel for
 Mac it is not possible to make any modification in the editing of the comments, since if you want to edit the format of the text to select for example the same color change of a section and / or comment of a particular cell, the text format of the sub-menu
 is not active. This problem has been observed since the office 2013 to 2016 for Mac. As an example, if we create a file in Excel-Mac (OSX Sierra) and we take it and open it in Excel with Windows, you can do without problem editing any comment and choose the
 colors (bold or bold, etc.), and when you return to Mac and open the same file, the changes can be verified that the desired edits have been executed in the comments, but on Mac it will still be a problem to do this operation. Any rec

<p>Jim is correct that the options for <strong>Fill</strong> in Comments was removed in Excel 2016 for Mac, but it sounds like your primary issue is with
<strong>Font formatting</strong> in Comments... That's because you seem to be looking in the wrong place :-) What's available in the Ribbon is limited when in a Comment object.</p>

<h2>            Disney Movies Anywhere</h2>
                    I would like to think I'm pretty tech savvy, but I cannot figure out how to view and watch my Disney Movies Anywhere that was just announced for being compatible with Microsoft Movies. So, I have successfully connected my DMA account to Microsoft. Even
 got the free movie. However, I am not seeing anywhere in the app, where to bring up the list of movies, and view them. They are not in my collection screen, and when I go to the movie's page for sale, its still saying its 19.99. I know there is no dedicated
 app for it, so I assume it should just automatically populate somewhere in the app, but I cannot find it. Theres even a giant ad, right on the front page of Microsoft Movies, advertising said feature with the Avengers Age of Ultron, but when you click on that,
 it just brings up a page to buy The Avengers again. Thanks!

            XBox One. Cant figure it out. &nbsp;Its weird because it links you directly to Microsofts site to activate, give you the free movie, and everything. But theres nothing anywhere on in the app to launch a movie.

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Locally, the Windows files are stored in a folder named after the OneNote Notebook that contains those sections.&nbsp; The default location of that file is C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote\16\Backup\&lt;NotebookName&gt;\Sectionname+datestamp&gt;.one</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">On OneDrive, copies of the OneNote Section files cannot be found by browsing OneDrive because they have complex web addresses that don't show up under the user's OneDrive file structure.&nbsp; (One way to find the OneNote Section files
 in OneDrive on the web is to make a change locally within the section you're looking for, then synchronize the notebook, then browse to the OneDrive "recent" link.&nbsp; The web location of the OneNote Section file you're looking for should be at or near the top
 of the list.)</p>

<p>Thanks, Michael Gall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked over each of the three links you posted.&nbsp; I didn't find anything that explains anything about where in Windows and on OneDrive, the default OneNote stores data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for an explanation that correlates the three different data structures, i.e. OneNote, Windows and OneDrive.&nbsp; I assume the same data can be reached using any one of the three organizational structures.&nbsp; But I have not found anything that correlates
 the three.&nbsp; .</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did realize that I should have pointed out in my original post that the default locations I was talking about are for someone using Office 365 installed on Windows 10.&nbsp; From what I read in your links, folks who migrated from earlier OneNote installations
 may have different defaults. </p>

<p>You should believe what is described in <strong>Save &amp; Backup</strong>.&nbsp; The <em>
currentness</em> of these copies depends on your settings concerning Backup. The OneNote sync process happens between Onedrive and the local
<strong>OneNote cache</strong>, <strong>not </strong>between Onedrive and the backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, never store OneNote notebooks explicitely (by using Change Location) in your local Onedrive folder. Store it on any place of your hard drive. The usual place is the Default Notebook Location from
<strong>Save &amp; Backup</strong>.</p>

<p>I will ignore the case of local OneNote notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of OneNote notebooks on Onedrive you have theoretically four places where you can see your notebook(s):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the OneDrive server you see, using your browser to access&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com</a> the master or original of a notebook.<br />
It's by default in the Documents folder. You don't see the sections. The notebook has another format than a copy stored on your computer.</li><li>In the local OneDrive folder you see a link to the notebook, a .url-file. Its purpose is to prevent the direct access to OneNote files on OneDrive (other format !). So in the context of OneNote you should ignore this folder.</li><li>In the local Backup folder, created in the path from Save &amp; Backup options. Created only by (a running) OneNote desktop application (2010, 2013, 2016), not by the Onenote for Windows UWP App from the Windows Store. Its purpose is obvious. The structure
 is "notebook, containing sections".<br />
</li><li>In the local cache folder a copy in a completely different file structure containing all open notebooks. For performance (access without network) and offline use. Not for users. Changes you make in a notebook are at first written to that cache, later to
 the master on OneDrive, if accessable (and to the backup, depending on your settings).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Places 1 and 4 exist for all variants of OneNote on all platforms.</p>

<p>Caution! Very long post incoming.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Local OneNote notebooks</strong></span></p>
<p>This is the „old“ method and format as network or cloud storage was added later (with OneNote 2007 and 2010) but it does still exist in the recent OneNote 2016.<br />
At a given location, by default under the users <em>Document</em> folder (can be set in the OneNote options of OneNote 2010, 2013 and 2016, Office versions only!) each notebook gets a folder with the same name as the notebook. Those folders can have three kinds
 of contents: .ONE files holding the sections of the notebook, folders for section groups (if there are any) and a
<em>open notebook.onetoc2</em> file which is a kind of index for the sorting of the sections in the notebook. If there are section group folders, they also contain .ONE files or more folders (for nested section groups). If any page or section has ever been
 deleted a special section group folder is also created for the recycle bin.<br />
</p>
<p><span>That file and folder structure may also live on a network share</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Cloud stored notebooks</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I am just talking about OneDrive, not OneDrive for business here because that one is slightly different but basically the same.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Even if there is a OneDrive client installed on your PC, you can not just copy or save the above folder and file structure to the local sync folder to create a cloud based notebook. It MAY seem to work at first sight but believe me… it won’t (I could
 list all the symptoms here that you would encounter but I’ll just leave it to that)</span></li><li><span>To create a notebook on OneDrive you HAVE to do it either in the OneNote client program or on the OneDrive- or OneNote-interface with your webbrowser. To move a formerly locally stored notebook to OneDrive DON’T copy any files or folders manually
 to your local OneDrive folder nor upload it to OneDrive using the browser. Won’t work! Use the option to share a notebook to OneDrive in your OneNote program instead.</span></li><li><span>In your local OneDrive folder AND on the web interface of OneDrive existing notebooks are only represented by a small link file. That one can be used for example to rename or delete an notebook. But it does not contain any OneNote data! (in facts
 it’s only a few bytes big).</span></li><li><span>The real OneNote data is hidden on OneDrive. It seems to be also organized in .ONE files (you CAN make them visible if you use your web browser and the OneDrive interface to display files by their size. This is a function you find behind the link
 about your used and remaining OneDrive capacity). But although you can make them visible with some tricks just leave them alone. You can’t do much meaningful things with them.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>The backup folder</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The desktop versions of OneNote for Windows (OneNote 2010, 2013, 2016) do have a basic internal backup function. This will create backups in given (selectable via Options / Save and Backup) intervals or started manually in a folder of your choice (also
 selectable in the options). Only notebooks that are currently open in OneNote (2010, 2013, 2016) are being backed up and only while OneNote is running. By default also only locally stored notebooks are backed up. To include notebooks in the backup that are
 stored on OneDrive (or OneDrive for Business or Sharepoint) you have to check the option “Also backup notebooks stored on Sharepoint”. The backup format is almost the same as the storage format for local notebooks (folders, .ONE-files…) with one exception:
 no index file (.onetoc2) is being created.</span></p>
<p><span>Those backups are not accessed by the sync mechanism, by editing notebooks or by anything else apart from OneNotes restore function in the file menu (again: Only desktop OneNote versions 2010-2016). They are simple copies.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>The local cache</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As Bernd P. already said there is another copy of every OneNote notebook which is currently being opened (loaded into OneNote). It’s format and location varies between the different OneNote versions but ALL versions (including OneNote for Android,
 iOS, Mac…) are using such a copy. It’s the OneNote<em> cache</em>. If you open a notebook a cache folder and files are created for them on your local device in a “hidden” place. All edits that you make to the notebook are applied to that cache copy first.
 The sync mechanism of OneNote (NOT of your One<strong>Drive</strong> app; OneNote is using it’s very own sync!) is then applying the changes to the “real” save location, be it a local folder or a cloud location like OneDrive.</span></p>
<p><span>As soon as you close a notebook (or some other circumstances like resetting the OneNote app on a mobile device) that cache is being deleted and lost … and so are your edits as long as the cache has not been synchronized to OneDrive or the local “real”
 location of the OneDrive files first.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>The most important information (in my opinion):</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Although OneNote is using a kind of file and folder structure and not a real database it’s best to think of a database. Why? Because you would never get the idea to copy, move, backup, rename or otherwise handle database data (like in Evernote or a
 CMS like Wordpress for example) simply by pure file operations. </span></p>
<p><span>In fact OneNote is just “pretending” to work on files like other office programs but things are much more complicated. The reason is that OneNote allows concurrent edits of the same notebook, section, even page by several devices or users at the same
 time without having to lock and unlock files first. This is not possible with any file based program like Word or Excel, right? So the sync mechanism is doing a complicate file splitting and partial locking. I am not quite sure how that works on local notebooks
 as they seem to be standard files inside the windows file system (I think it’s handled by the sync and cache mechanism as cache files are only fragments of data).</span></p>
<p><span>On OneDrive a special sync protocol named Cobalt or MS-FSSHTTP is used which is the same as in Sharepoint. That one is based on splitting actual files in small chunks of data as well. This is one reason why OneNote files are hidden away and you can't
 just move files around or copy them into the local OneDrive folder. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To make the file splitting thing a bit clearer: If it would be that easy that just all section content is stored in a ONE file and that file would be synced to OneDrive using the local OneDrive client and folder like it's done with word files, this
 is what would happen:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Even the smallest change to a notebook page would cause the whole ONE file to be uploaded to OneDrive to replace the old version.</span></li><li><span>As OneNote is saving changes automatically this would happen every few seconds producing an enormous amount of bandwith usage and make things really, really slow.</span></li><li><span>If two persons would edit any page in the the same section roughly at the same time, two different copies of that ONE file would be uploaded causing a synchronisation conflict. Which one is to keep? So for security reasons both copies would be kept
 and one of them renamed, creating lots of duplicate content. By the way... this is one of the effects likely to happen when you try to copy ONE-files to your local OneDrive folder.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>So the sync mechanism has to handle those files completely different, only updating changes INSIDE the files and merging those changes to the version on OneDrive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>End of the longest post I ever made here…..i hope I did not just add to the confusion.</span></p>
<p><span>I already published several articles on topics like backups, file handling and OneNote cloud storage on my blog but unfortunately in German language only.</span></p>

<p>Danke, SWischner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You answered several parts of my question.&nbsp; I'm still struggling to understand some aspects of OneNote desktop data storage.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider a new version of my question:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Suppose a Windows 10 user keeps and manages all data in local OneDrive folders synchronized to OneDrive in the cloud.&nbsp; Then one day he installs Office 365 on his PC.</li><li>Then, without changing any defaults, he uses his new desktop OneNote to create a new Notebook called "Test Notebook."</li><li>Then he creates a Section within Test Notebook called "Test&nbsp; Section".</li><li>Then he instructs OneNote to synch Test Notebook to the cloud.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>What happens to his Windows file structure and to his OneDrive file structure at each of these four steps.&nbsp; (Please feel free to add steps is something important occurs between some of the four steps that were obvious to me.)</p>

<p>From your 1st description I assumed you only had notebooks on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of local notebooks items 1 and 2 are not relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you should at first look for the paths to your notebooks. In OneNote let your mouse hover over a notebook on the left tab. In a small popup window you should see the path to that notebook. If it starts with a drive letter (like "C:") it's a local notebook
 on your computer. If it starts with "https" it's a notebook on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the sections or .one files from the Backup folder you can restore one, some or all of the sections of a notebook. To access them use File, Info, Open Backups.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The standard paths in Options after installation of OneNote 2016 you see here:</p>

<p>Maybe this is where you are wrong:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you think that OneNote creates and stores notebooks locally on your device and then synchronizes them to a version stored in the cloud / on OneDrive. This is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is always only ONE place where a notebook lives. It's EITHER locally (and this is only possible to use and access with an Office OneNote 2016 or earlier) OR on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At time of creation of the notebook you decide the location of that notebook (again only with Office OneNote 2016 as the other versions do only have the cloud option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF that location is OneDrive or OneDrive for business then all OneNote versions (even the mobile ones) can access them after you login with the proper credentials.</p>
<p>When opening a notebook stored on OneDrive, it is in fact downloaded to the local storage of the device, but only as a cache (see my long post above) to give you the chance to work offline when there is temporarily no internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the mistake in your last question is in 1.: "<span>Suppose a Windows 10 user keeps and manages all data in local OneDrive folders synchronized to OneDrive in the cloud. "</span></p>
<p><span>This is not how it works. You don't keep and manage all date in local folders and sync then to the cloud. You either have stored it locally (then no sync with the cloud will occur) OR stored them only in the Cloud.
 In the latter case all your OneNote apps, regardless of version, device and operating systems, can access them.</span></p>
<p><span>This all has NOTHING to do with the backup folder of OneNote 2016!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So....if you already have created notebooks on your local hard drive using OneNote 2016 you won't be able to use them from another device, another OneNote version, not even from teh Windows 10 OneNote app on the same
 PC. You would have to MOVE (not sync) them to OneDrive first. This can only be achieved from within the Onenote 2016 program using the File - Share menu. After the move you would be able to access the notebooks from any device/OneNote version.</span></p>

<br />
Perhaps you didn't understand that the suggestion to run without add-ons was intended as a
<strong>diagnostic</strong> to try to isolate the possible cause of a problem symptom to just the set of all add-ons without having to modify any of them?<br />
<br />
Anyway, now that you know it changes your problem symptom you can stop using that tool and start trying to figure out
<strong>which</strong> add-on(s) are the ones that you want to avoid.&nbsp;&nbsp;To do that you can use the Manage Add-ons tool to disable all add-ons individually and start re-enabling and testing them one by one.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is a more efficient testing technique
 available if you can manage the extra complexity of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-enable an arbitrary half of the disabled set and re-test with that combination.&nbsp; If your problem symptom doesn't reappear with a test that previously reliably would reproduce it it may be safe to
 assume that none of those add-ons was&nbsp;a culprit.&nbsp; Therefore you wouldn't need to test any of them individually.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, then you can divide the remaining half in half and re-enable those and re-test.&nbsp; Eventually a set that you have re-enabled may contain a problem
 add-on, so then presumably your problem symptom would reproduce, so then you have to re-disable half of those and re-test to try to find another large set to eliminate from consideration and leave enabled.&nbsp; If your assumption was that you only had one bad
 add-on to find it would actually be sufficient then to not bother re-testing the other half but I think that I would re-test both just to avoid relying on that assumption of there being only one problem add-on to find.&nbsp; You can keep going like that until you
 have reduced the test sets to one or two and thus quickly isolate a problem add-on.<br />
<br />
Another useful thing to be aware of is that both&nbsp;of the preceding test procedures have an implicit assumption which if&nbsp; false could save you a lot of work.&nbsp;&nbsp; The assumption is that all those add-ons have equal value to you and that you care whether they are
 re-enabled.&nbsp; Often that assumption is indeed false, so in that case you could perhaps leave many of the add-ons disabled and only re-enable for your testing ones that you knew you needed or wanted.&nbsp; E.g. you could always re-enable some only when they are needed
 again and then be much more aware of new problems symptoms and being able to associate them with that change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<h2>            One account on Microsoft Exchange and one on Exchange ActiveSync</h2>
                    <p>Whilst this question has been asked (and answered)&nbsp;in relation to Outlook.com, I am asking in relation to Outlook 2016 (I have an Office 365&nbsp;Home subscription so assume it is Outlook 2016).<br />
<br />
I have two separate e-mail accounts syncing through Outlook, the first (and oldest) works through Exchange ActiveSync and the second (relatively recent, created about eighteen months ago) works through Microsoft Exchange. Why are there two different kinds,
 and what exactly are they.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the latter, has various add ins available to it, eg PayPal, but Exchange ActiveSync does not.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would like the first (my main account) to also work through Microsoft Exchange but cannot work out how to alter it.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Many thanks indeed for your helpful reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read the article "What is a Microsoft Exchange" account and the plot thickens!!!!!&nbsp; Neither account is a work or school account - they are both personal.&nbsp; One is mine, and the other is my father's (he does not have a computer of his own as such&nbsp;so
 we both use&nbsp;share my&nbsp;laptop (although I usually check his e-mail for him as he is 93 and it's quicker for me to do it).&nbsp; He is registered to my Office Home 365 account. He has a separate profile and his own log-in on my laptop, but not on my desktop, which
 is why his account is in "my" copy of Outlook 2016.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that the problem is occurring on the copy of Outlook 2016 on my PC, which is running Windows 7.&nbsp; He uses the online Outlook.com on the laptop and I have not set Outlook 2016 up to receive his e-mail on that machine.<br />
</p>
<p>In answer to your questions, both accounts are Hotmail accounts (both have the suffix "hotmail.com").<br />
<br />
I have not tried to remove the account from Outlook 2016, but will have a go at that later today.</p>

<h2>            IE loads gif graphics pages very slow for my website</h2>
                    Kingdomstoconquer.com<br />
Uses overlayed Z-indexed GIF graphics tiles to make a map.<br />
<br />
Firefox, Chrome, Safari all of these browsers handle perfectly straight and fast.&nbsp; IE 7,8,9 all users who access my website complain that it lags doggedly slow.&nbsp; I downloaded the most recent for XP IE 8 and I too see the incredible lag.&nbsp; I switch to one of
 the other browsers and it loads just fine.&nbsp; I tried the IE steps including disabling all add ons and clearing cache.
<br />
<br />
This is a major problem for me as I want to appeal to IE users and I don't see why this browser cant handle what the others seem to do so easily.&nbsp; I used to use PNGs and worked hard to convert all to GIFs to make IE friendly.&nbsp; Now the lag is just killing it.&nbsp;
 Can someone please tell me what I am missing or what i can stop doing to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks - Honos1<br />

<p>Hi Vijaykumar2901,</p>
<p>In Office 365, if the mailbox was deleted by removing the Exchange Online license, it can be restored within the retention period by reassigning the license to the corresponding user account.</p>
<p>The retention period is 30 days, by default. After 30 days, the mailbox is permanently deleted and is not recoverable if it has not been put on

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of your Printer?
<br />
<br />You need to check if your printer supports double sided printing (Duplex Mode)
<br />
<br />When you click File - Print, then choose Printer Properties ad check to see if there is a Duplex Mode, if there is, then choose that and the printer will automatically print out your document double sided
<br />
<br />If that setting does not exist, choose to print pages 1 and 3, then put that paper back into the printer and print pages 2 and 4. It may take a couple of tries to work out which way to re-insert the pages into the printer . .

            I've seen this once before on my phone.. and a power cycle fixed it..<br />
<br />
However, if it lingers, I wonder if it is a hardware problem or some other freaky bug<br />
<br />
Soooo..<br />
<br />
After you've run the camera app and it has bombed out.. can you open an x terminal and run this command<br />
<br />
dmesg &gt; MyDocs/dmesg.txt<br />
<br />
You'll then find a dmesg.txt file on your phone.. can you reply back here and attach this file as an attachment..<br />

<br />
Just repeat the same thing. You will be fine. You should also read your License Agreement that you did accept when you installed it. You might be surprised. If it is a retail version, it is not tied to the machine.

    <title>COUNTA parameters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richue  say:</h3>
<h2>            COUNTA parameters</h2>
                    <p>I generated a simple formula to show the total number of actions identified in a review report. I used COUNTA to look at cell values in a specified column. I typed "COUNTA(" and selected the range with the mouse, adding a closing bracket. The resultant formula
 looks like this, and produces the desired result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=COUNTA(Table1[Action By])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is more elegant than I have seen before. I would have expected this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=COUNTA(D2:D26)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What might have changed?</p>

            hi Richard. &nbsp;that means that D2:D26 is part of a Table. &nbsp;this is pretty useful on many levels. &nbsp;to confirm it, click on anyway between D2:D26 &amp; you should see an extra tab in your Ribbon on top called Design. &nbsp;that's where you can change some properties
 of the Table. &nbsp;1 useful feature is that you can add data in D27 &amp; your COUNTA would have capture that as well. &nbsp;

Is there a reason? How long is "Temporarily" ?<br />

            If the photos were on a storage card you could use file recovery software to restore the deleted files, but if the photos were stored in main memory on the windows mobile device, then it is as Laura stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Active Sync 4.5</h2>
                    I have Active Sync 4.1.0 installed for my Ipaq. I am planning to purchase a phone that uses Windows Mobile 6.0. Does ActiveSync 4.5 update my current version or is it a separate install? Do I need to uninstall my current version first?

            Windows Mobile 6 does not work with activesync 4.1. You must only install Activesync 4.5. You Ipaq will still work with AS 4.5.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could be due to an update that happened on the app which created some conflict on the system. To isolate the issue, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you currently subscribed to Office 365?</li><li>Were you able to add contacts without any issues before?</li><li>If yes, when did the issue started to occur?</li><li>Aside from those options, are other options working fine?</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>I bought a new computer because my other one crashed.&nbsp; I have Office 2016 Home Version.&nbsp; I purchased Outlook 2016 separately and had no problem entering my contacts.&nbsp; However, I could only use the "save and close" option instead of the "save and new" option"
 which was grayed out.&nbsp; I did not have this problem with Outlook 2010 on my old computer before it crashed. &nbsp; This "save and new" has never worked since I installed in on this new computer about a month ago.</p>
<p>Other than that, everything else seems fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

    <title>It is impossible to recover an account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goodietwoshoes123  say:</h3>
<h2>            It is impossible to recover an account.</h2>
                    This email has just been created for testing purposes. As a righteous owner of this account, I decided to test the recovery options using a form that asks me to enter as much info as I can about account. The account used in this test is obviously the one
 I'm posting with right now.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Despite me JUST creating the account, it was impossible for me to recover it. It asks for information that I didn't set (not even with my legit accounts). Let's take a look at the statistics and questions that I did and didn't answer:<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>These are the ones I got correctly.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>First Name:&nbsp;</li><li>Last Name:</li><li>Birth date:</li><li>Country/region:</li><li>Previous password: (I changed the password so I could use this option)</li></ul>
</div>

<div>I failed to complete the rest, despite me creating the account. Let's take a look why.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Subjects of your recently sent emails (one per text box)</li><li>Names of any folders you've created, other than default folders like Junk, Drafts, or Sent (one per text box)</li><li>Email addresses of contacts you've recently sent emails to (one per text box)</li></ul>
<div>I did not send <b>any </b>emails with this account. This also applies to my
<b>real </b>account. I don't use it to send emails, only receive them and that's how it is for a LOT of people. I didn't create any new folders on either of my accounts. As for the third question, refer to my first remark. A lot of
 people including myself don't use emails to communicate, only register on various websites and forums.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now let's take a look at the end of this, which is just so ridiculous that it made me angry.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Last five digits of your Xbox Live prepaid card number</li><li>Name on credit card</li><li>Last four digits of the credit card number</li><li>Expiration date</li></ul>
</div>



<div>In the beginning, I thought that the recovery process would take the empty fields that I left as correct answers (as I don't own an xbox and I didn't send or create any emails) but no, it completely neglected that. It seems that leaving fields empty even
 though <b>blank </b>is a correct answer doesn't seem acceptable to the process.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Horrible service. Requires you to buy xbox and link your credit card and it doesn't accept "no" as a valid option when recovering. Supposes that everyone uses crappy options such as creating new folders and doesn't accept "none" as the right answer. Dear
 Microsoft, my question to you is quite simple, how can an average user like me recover his account without using all these "special" options that seem to be a requirement?</div>

            Strange. I bought the first release of C7 in 1st week of Nov (in India) and i have updated the firmware and installed tons games and free apps from Ovi Store and never had this problem. Mine version is also 014.002 custom version 00.01. The problem maybe
 in the custom version or if you installed too many apps (not games) or you have too many apps open. Whenever it tends to reboot, please switch off and remove battery for atleast 2 minutes, then restart.
