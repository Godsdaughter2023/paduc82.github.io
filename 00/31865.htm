<h2>            Store &#38; apps wont open on windows 8 after a computer refresh</h2>
                    Hi. i had some problem with my pc so had to refresh it. after refreshing the store &amp; any apps that is now on it &nbsp;wont open. i followed all the solutions like time zone, the command in the command prompt and this microsoft tool for checking the store +
 the windows account. also waited for 70 windows updates after the refresh + tried to disable my anti virus. nothing worked. i have windows 8 pro 64 bit. i use my hotmail account to log in my pc. would like to hear some solution. i wonder after many hours of
 looking for it if it even exists.

<div>Thanks, Ronen</div>

I'm not getting any error message. when I try to open the store it looks like its opening but after 1 sec it makes like a spin and drops me back to the opening screen of the pc. the other apps dont even reply to the mouse click. I'm talking only about the store
 apps. with the regular apps I dont have any problem. I tried the troubleshooter already. the message it gives me is this: 1: some security settings are missing or have been changed. 2: check for missing or corrupt files. and down to that it shows me that those
 problems got fixed and to do a reboot to apply that. but after reboot there isn't any change . when i right click the mouse on an mp3 file to try the "open with" and it gives me the option to look in the store for a default app for that, thats the message
 i get:&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>windows cant locate 'ms-windows-store:Assoc?fileext=mp3'</div>
<div><br />
<div>I dont know if it relates but i have an Eset antivirus that&nbsp;Neutralizing my firewall &amp; the windows defender but I had Eset before all that too and everything was okay.</div>

            <p>Hi Ronen, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reset Store cache and check</b></p>
<p>a. Press <b>Windows logo key + R</b>, from start screen.</p>
<p>b. Type”<b>wsreset.exe</b>” on Run window and press enter</p>
<p>You may also perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
<br />
a. Press “Windows Key + Q” to open Charms Bar.<br />
<br />
b. Type “cmd” without quotes in the search box.<br />
<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select “Run as Administrator”.<br />
<br />
d. Type ‘sfc /scannow’ without quotes and hit enter.<br />
<br />
Note: It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a Nice day! </p>

            Thanks Jessen P 



I've already done the SFC, it didn't help. the wsreset.exe I wasn't be able to do cause yesterday I talked with microsoft support. the guy gave me some things to do which didn't help too. afterwards I talked with the HP support to check if its a missing drivers issue and she told me that only a reformat will solve it. she told me that this refresh thing is not such a good thing to do cause it **** up the system. so now I'm after the reformation and all is good.  


to anybody that may read this I'll say just that: try to avoid a computer refresh in any way you can cause this method sucks.

            it started working but I had to refresh again, but now just downloaded windows 8.1 and now everything is good but on this new windows 8.1, you only rely on windows malware protection, none of the anti viruses work on internet. off they do though

    <title>Sound&#47; Volume mixer moves up and down and the volume mixer also - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sachin_imt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound&#47; Volume mixer moves up and down and the volume mixer also shows that the sound is being played and yet I do not hear anything from my laptop.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have a Toshiba M9 which is running Windows 7 Build 7100. I have High Definition Audio Device as my device driver for the sound (Driver version: 6.1.7100.0). Seems like it is developed by Microsoft itself. I have built in speakers into the laptop.<br />
<br />
The sound was coming find until yesterday (12/5/2009) but suddenly went off. I could not decipher the reason for the sound suddenly stopping. Here is the wierd thing: when I look at the volume mixer, I can see the mixer control moving up and down as the system
 sounds are played or as any sound/ music is played in the laptop. <br />
<br />
However, I cannot hear the sound coming from my laptop. Let me say again that this was working just fine until yesterday without issues and suddenly went off. Everything else seems to be workign fine. Not sure if this is being caused by some critical update
 which came through but I have restored to system to a past date and yet nothing worked.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a clue how to fix this?

<br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers.</span></span></p>
<span><span><span>
<p><span>You may run the Playing Audio troubleshooter in Windows 7 to check for any issues with the volume settings, the sound card, the audio driver or your speakers/headphones.<br />
<br />
To do this, please see the link below: </span></p>

If it doesn't work, then I suggest you to&nbsp;uninstall and reinstall the latest sound driver by visiting the manufacturer website</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Let us know if you have any issues.</span></span></p>

    <title>Is my motherboard, graphics card, or PCI-E slot fried&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crypticold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is my motherboard, graphics card, or PCI-E slot fried&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
I experienced this problem yesterday. I run a Intel Core 2 quad 2.4gig cpu on windows vista 64 bit with 4 GB of ram(see attached truncated dxdiag txt for further information), and a BFG Nvidia Geforce 9800GT graphics card on the ASUS P5N32-E SLI motherboard.
 I have used two displays with this card for about a year with no issues.<br />
<br />
I was browsing the web as normal, when suddenly the entire screen became a monochrome like set up except there were small, separated wavy red lines in regular intervals all over the screens. I rebooted after letting the machine cool for a while and was able
 to have everything come up, unfortunately the next time I tried this the monitor would not even turn on, stating signal not detected.I assumed at this point the graphics card had overheated and fried.</p>
<p><br />
I retrieved an older card I had used in the past, the BFG 6600GT and installed it as a replacement for the 9800GT. Interestingly this one still had a lot of trouble even getting the monitor to come on but I tried multiple times and finally got it to come up.
 Excellent, it wasn't pretty but at least I had access to my old system. It had the basic VGA canned/autoinstall drivers, so I immediately downloaded the latest 6600 drivers from Nvidia, installed them, and rebooted. Upon rebooting and attempting to change
 the resolution, I saw that I could not. I checked the Device Manager and it stated "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)". Further investigation of the personalize -&gt;display settings -&gt; advanced showed that in the adapter
 tab that windows cannot even identify the card, instead listing the chip type, DAC type, adapter string, and bios information as unavailable. I was concerned that the previous nvidia graphics drivers for the 9800GT might be interfering with the new ones, so
 I rebooted, reinstalled the 6600 drivers and selected the extra option in the installshield to remove all previous drivers and setups. I did all that and rebooted with the same results, cant see the adapter and same error message in the device manager.
<br />
<br />
My motherboard is equipped with two PCI-E slots. I tried all of the above first on the same PCI-E slot that I used for the 9800, and then since I thought there might be damage to that slot, repeated this with the second PCI-E slot with the same results.</p>
<p>This is strange as this 6600 card was functioning in another machine as recently as 2 days ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point the problem goes outside of my experience, and I would like to request any help with solving this issue. Is this fixable by buying a new graphics card? Is there damage to my motherboard? What further steps can I take?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>There are several settings in the BIOS itself that need to be correctly set for this to work:&nbsp; That bios has settings both under the advanced tabs and the pci devices (integrated) as well as under the power state mappings section, and if this data is stored
 in the escd area of the rom bios, it needs to be remapped each time it is reset. This is usually done via a set of jumper pins on the motherboard, near the battery, captioned cl_cmos, cmos_reset,&nbsp; etc. This, or removal of the battery itself for 30 seconds
 or more, will return the entire bios state to the defaults, letting new ones such as pci, pci-e, and agp be enumerated and enabled.</p>
<p>I say this, because from the stated refresh rate alone, you are still running the in-house low resolution driver that every safemode version of windows has ever booted on...guaranteed to work with virtually every single possible adapter out there. It is

<p>the variable functionalities the proper driver would allow for. Depending upon whether or not you have the right chipset and graphics drivers installed, then the proper drivers for the add-in card itself, will determine how windows utilizes the card itself,
 and whether you do not have the automatic safemode start specified in the "msconfig.exe" command-line driven utility for startup options. Make sure these boxes aren't marked: Base video, and safe mode. Save any changes, and exit, with restart, if changes were
 made, or continue without restart if changes were not made.</p>

 dx log shown as "generics", i.e the ide controllers, and pci host bridges. The reason it shows up under the second boot means you will not see the results until you boot twice during video&nbsp;driver changes. also note there may be two or even three seperate video
 drivers required for your system to operate. The setup for them can tell if they are relevant for your system, so I always download and install all of those returned by the service.</p>

<p>Hello Terry,</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I attempted all of your changes. I first reset the bios using the jumper then also removed the battery for 30 seconds. No change in the outcomes, still cannot recognize the 6600GT graphics card. I looked as msconfig.exe and base video
 and safe mode start were both already unchecked. <br />
<br />
I also went to the download center and used the automatic scan for updates utility but it had no recommended updates for anything because it said everything was unknown. I am unsure how to procede, what should I do next?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

            After resetting the bios I'm also getting a problem with websites security certificates saying they are out of date- even though I set the system clock back to my local time. The box is saying their security certificates won't be valid until December 11

<p>Hi Crypticold,</p>
<p>You can set the BIOS clock, as well as the Windows time.</p>
<p>I suggest checking your profile for corruption regarding the video card:</p>

<h3> dustin short  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58;  LITEON DVD A DS8ABSH issues &#40;Needs Media Player to recognize disc&#41;</h2>
                    Hopefully this is a quick &amp; easy fix. &nbsp;The DVD drive is virtually ignored (not available in drive list) UNTIL some kind of media program needs it. &nbsp;It's gotten to the point where I have to run Kodi to get Win10 to recognize a disc in the drive, so if I
 have to install something, I pop it in the drive, let it spin up, and then if nothing happens (depending on the software, possibly nothing will happen) I open Kodi. &nbsp;A little flute noise, and voila, I have disc options. &nbsp;Now, that doesn't mean that Win10 is
 going to DO anything with that information. &nbsp;I'd love some assistance with this issue.

<p>Prior to this I was able to go to the network and share files between the two.

What happened in the upgrade?? I understood all programs and access to be the same after update from 7 to 10 ??</p>
<p>Anyone have a clue?</p>

<p>Hi Warp,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are unable to connect Mac-mini on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>This issue might occur if the device settings are incorrect, corrupted or incompatible drivers or due to hardware problems.</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter</strong></p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't connect to a network, there might be a problem with your network adapter, the piece of hardware that makes it possible for your PC to connect to a network.</p>
<p>First, try using the Network Adapter troubleshooter to automatically find and fix some problems. This troubleshooter will disable and re-enable the adapter and try some other common repairs. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>

<p>
</p><p>I recommend you to check whether the Network discovery is enabled in Network and Sharing. Here's how:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good evening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long delay, I was vacationing and just returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since&nbsp;Windows 10 is a new item on my laptop I verified all those steps above.</p>
<p>The settings were already set as you suggested. </p>
<p>I had already tried the troubleshooting steps before and tried again with no luck.<br />
I attribute it to the upgrade. Something was changed detrimental for my Mac access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A day before the upgrade I was able to access my Mac mini through my home network.</p>
<p>Also I was able to use team viewer from my mac mini to access all my windows computers.</p>
<p>Now after the upgrade both my network (from my Macintosh) cannot see </p>
<p>the windows computer(s) Nor can I access any windows machine running windows 10</p>
<p>with teamviewer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am confident was the Windows 10 upgrade has done something</p>
<p>that will not allow communication from&nbsp;or to&nbsp;Mac through network access.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>By the way I tested my&nbsp;Mac (yes the same one)&nbsp;just now on a machine running</strong></p>
<p><strong>windows 7 </strong><strong>and it still works perfectly for both Network access to my Mac
</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND access by </strong><strong>my Mac to my windows 7 machine through Teamviewer.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, this confirms the Win 10 upgrade did something funky since the Mac works
</p>
<p>fine on a comparable computer running Windows7.</p>
<p>The Mac is running Yosemite and I really have not had any other issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something /&nbsp;setting(s)? must have changed. I don't know?</p>
<p>Maybe they were just not designed to talk to one another.</p>
<p>I will look on the Mac support to see if they have any thoughts.</p>
<p>I will post if I can find anything else.</p>
<p>Thank you for your thoughts and support. </p>
<p>Any additional thoughts would be welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 programs not starting up when I launch them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently started having problems launching certain programs on my computer. When I click start, the program will say its booting up but will never actually start. I looked into the task manager and it appears that I can see these programs for a brief
 second before memory is taken away from them until they reach zero and drop off task manager entirely. Is there any solution to this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>(The picture below is a screen shot of my task manager when I start up the program. It always shows the windows error report but nothing ever appears on my screen and it disappears from task manager within a second.)</p>

<p>Hi <span>Ace1960</span>,<br />
<br />
Thank you for calling our attention on this matter.<br />
<br />
<span>If you haven't yet added the email address that keeps on sending you these pornographic emails, please follow the steps below on how to block it:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;In the upper-right corner of the Windows Live Hotmail home page, click <strong>
<span>Options</span></strong>.<br />
2. Choose <strong><span>More options…</span></strong> on the dropdown menu.<br />
3. Under the <strong><span>Junk e-mail</span></strong> option, please click the
<strong><span>Safe and blocked senders</span></strong> link.<br />
4. Click the <strong><span>Blocked senders</span></strong> link.<br />
5. On the box under the <strong><span>Blocked e-mail address or domain</span></strong>:
<strong><em>option, type in the e-mail address or domain of the sender.<br />
</em></strong>6. Click the <strong><span>Add to list</span></strong>&gt;&gt; button.</span><br />
<br />
Note: For the domain, you just have to enter the domain name (ex. *live.com)<br />
<span><br />
There is another option for you to get rid of a particular email address or contact in Windows Live Hotmail and that is by creating an Email Rule.<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>To create new rules, follow these steps:
</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
1. Login to your Hotmail account.<br />
2. Go to <strong><span>Options – More Options</span></strong>.<br />
3. Under <strong><span>Customizing Hotmail</span></strong>, choose
<strong><span>Rules for sorting new messages</span></strong>.
<br />
4. Click <strong><span>New</span></strong>.<br />
</span><span>5. Choose the condition that you want to apply to the rule in<b> Step 1</b>.
<br />
6. Choose the action in <b>Step 2</b> that you want to take on the emails that meet the condition specified in<b> Step 1</b>.<br />
7. Click <b>Save</b>. <br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Important Notes to remember:
<br />
<br />
</span></b><span>-Rules only apply to the future incoming emails delivered to your mailbox.<br />
<b>-</b>Customers can view the rules as per action types – move/delete, mobile alerts, forwarding and flagging.<br />
</span><span>-Rules are sorted in the
<b>order they were entered</b> with the newest rule on the top.<br />
<b>-</b>There is a limit of <b>250</b> rules per account<br />
<b>-</b>By default, rules are applied in the order users entered them – where the most recent rule governs.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>Example: If users create a rule to delete all e-mails from Sender = X then later created a rule to move all e-mails from that same sender to folder Y, the latter will govern.
<br />
<br />
<b>·</b> To edit a rule, click on <b>Edit</b> option next to the rule.<br />
<b>·</b> To delete a rule, click the check box next to the rule and click <b>delete</b>.<br />
<br />

</p><p>Seriously, that sounds unlikely. If you're seeing an error message telling you that a certificate has expired, it's usually the server sending a mail message that's at fault. Post the error message here in its entirety to see if we can spot the problem.
 Meanwhile, check carefully that the time, date (day, month and year) and time zone on your computer are all accurate.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t switch my local user account back to administrator. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pejaye gray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t switch my local user account back to administrator.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I'm having trouble getting my user account back to administrator. I've tried creating a new user account, so i can switch to that one and change my old account back. But the UAC blocks me every time i try to make a change. The family settings are
 missing because of this issue, making it impossible to make a new account. I'm pretty much stumped on how to fix this. If anyone knows of a way to make a new account from my issue, and/or get my original account back to administrator, any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Do you remember the original password that you setup when you got this machine?
<br />And not the Microsoft account password but the computer\local password?
<br />You need that.
<br />If you do not remember that then unfortunately you will have to reset your PC to get admin access back, very sorry.
<br />But it is how the secure your machine by not allowing things to be done or created without that admin access.

            Hi, Please try this, it may work . . .
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart Windows
<br />
<br />On the login Screen at the bottom left, do you see the Built-in Administrator Account?
<br />
<br />If so log into that
<br />
<br />Then click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Click your own account name and click Properties
<br />
<br />On the second dialog, click the Group Membership tab, from there you should be able to set your account as Administrator

            Your problem is the result of running Windows with a single admin account. This is as risky as having a single house key. One little accident can cause a huge problem. System Restore might fix it for you. It this does not work then a different but involved
 solution is required.

<div>
<p>Hi,<br />
I am sorry to answer your mail to later. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have first tried to solve the problem with "Run as administrator". I find out with present Windows 10 (V1809), I can't change the user status after CMD is pop up. Instead, when I type "cmd" in the search window,&nbsp;&nbsp; a new window is pop up. There contains
 information of CMD and several options. Among them, there is "Run as administrator". After I select this option, CMD window is pop up for the administrator.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>After that, I can perform all the operations suggested by you. I have also performed a reboot. After all of these operations, the problem after login is disappeared. That is great.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>But I can't solve the problem with my secondary monitor. There is no signal to the monitor.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have two monitors. Both of them are HP Compaq La2205wg. I have tried both of them. Neither works. I don't think both of them could be broken at the same time.&nbsp; At this time, I used a cable which connected VGA to the monitor and mini DisplayPort to the
 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have also bought a new cable which connects DisplayPort to monitor and HDMI to the laptop. It doesn't work either.&nbsp; In all cases, I have downloaded the driver to the monitor.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I don't know what else I can do. May be you have some new ideas I can try.</div>
<div>
<p>Thank you very much for your help.&nbsp; I am very grateful. </p>

<h2>            Logitech h340 headset does not install correctly. &#34;Unknown device&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 and just connected my brand new Logitech h340 headset to the PC via the USB port. Unfortunately, the device is not recognised and the driver thus do not install automatically, so I cannot use my headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the messages I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Unknown device"</p>
<p>"Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when I try the Windows hardware troubleshooter it tells me that "The best driver software for your device is already installed. Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date."</p>
<p>Device type: Universal Serial Bus controllers<br />
Manufacturer: (Standard USB Host Controller)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reboot, but it&nbsp;still does not work.</p>

            <p>Hello Soraya, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us on Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I can provide you with some suggestions to troubleshoot this issue, I would like to gather the following information from you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer? </li><li>Were any significant changes made to the computer prior to this issue? </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would like to inform you that, "<em>Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)</em>" can occur if the device hardware fails or if the device driver fails.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps provided in the following link: </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725873(v=WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725873(v=WS.10).aspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Also See: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Error codes in Device Manager in Windows</a></strong><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.<br />
<br />
You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click <strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, click <strong>System</strong>, and then&nbsp;click
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. </span></li></ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><span>: If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.
</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>In Device Manager, double click to expand "<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>", right click on the Host Controller, click "<strong>Uninstall</strong>" and click "<strong>OK</strong>".
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>".
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do get back to us and let us know the status of the issue by your next post or in case you need further assistance. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.

    <title>Skype Relay, set up on PC asking me to enter Authentication Code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petecollins_995  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Relay, set up on PC asking me to enter Authentication Code</h2>
                    <p>Thing is, there doesn't appear to be anywhere to enter it. Let me explain what I've done so far. On my phone (Lumia 550, Win10 Mobile Version 1703 Build10.0.15063.414) I have selected Skype as default SMS app and set the 'SMS backup and sync' to Enabled
 in the Skype settings options.&nbsp; I now have the following wording underneath backup and sync which says 'Finish setting up SMS Relay by enabling it in Skype&gt;Settings&gt;SMS'. First problem - there is no option anywhere in there to enable SMS Relay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, abandoning the phone for the moment, I go to my PC (x86, AMD, Win 10 Home 64bit Version 1703 Build 15063.413) to play with the Skype settings on there. Going to Skype&gt;Settings&gt;SMS I toggle the SMS sync option to enabled and get the following message
 'SMS sync is enabled (no phone connected). We were unable to find an SMS-Relay enabled phone.Check that SMS Relay has been enabled on your phone by going to Skype&gt;Settings&gt;SMS&gt;SMS backup and sync'. This is followed by another paragraph which says 'Authentication
 Code **** (<strong>code redacted here for security</strong>) Go to Skype&gt;Settings&gt;SMS&gt;New requests to enter this code and finish setting up SMS Relay'. Problem number two - there is no New Requests option so I can't enter this code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now either I'm very dim or there is something amiss here. I seem to be missing crucial Settings options on either phone or PC and Skype on the desktop doesn't seem to acknowledge the existence of my phone. One would assume that all Windows phones should
 integrate seamlessly with the PC since both are running Windows OS and Skype is now part of Microsoft. Can anyone in this community shed some light as to why it doesn't appear to work for me? Thanks in advance for any assistance.</p>

</p><p><span>Can you please check the version of Skype that you are using? Please open Skype, then click on
<strong>Help</strong> on the menu bar, then click on <strong>About Skype.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the troubleshooting steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(For Windows Desktop)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Make sure that Skype is no longer running. (<strong>Or you may simply press Ctrl Alt Esc, click Skype and then click End Task</strong>)
</span></p>
<p><span>2. On your keyboard, <strong>press the Windows key and R key simultaneously</strong>. Then, the run windows will appear.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>3. </span><span>On the run window, type in <strong>appwiz.cpl</strong> and hit enter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Look for Skype and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Then download the latest version of Skype from the link below: <a href="http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a></span></p>
<p><span>6. Open Skype application and enable or set up the SMS sync option.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jannine</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I now seem to be further along than previously, thank you for your help so far. Just as a heads up, I had to uninstall the previous desktop version by doing it this way instead of your suggested method:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Skype&gt;Uninstall </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype desktop app now looks very different from the one I had before. I've also noticed that all of my SMS messages are showing on the phone now with Skype selected as my SMS messaging app, only a few were visible previously. Also on the phone I can
 see that if I want to send an SMS I now have 2 routing options one of which is Skype. The Skype option is greyed out at present as I haven't yet purchased any credit - will do so when I know it's all working ok.&nbsp; All good so far and makes more sense now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, going back to the phone there still seems to be a problem with the Backup and Sync settings/SMS Relay and seeing the PC as a 'Connected Device'. I have enabled Backup and Sync but am still getting a notification that I must:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>'Finish setting up SMS Relay by enabling it in Skype&gt;Settings&gt;SMS'</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem - there is no option for enabling SMS Relay in either the phone app settings or the desktop app SMS options. So I'm still stuck for a full solution. I'm sure I'm missing something really simple that I've overlooked, any further help will be much
 appreciated,.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best and thanks again</p>
<p>Pete</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I was getting the same cryptic message initially, but once I configured latest version of Skype on the desktop (Win10 machine) - Skype on the phone (in settings-&gt;SMS) showed my desktop as the device requesting access, and provided an option to enter code
 (which was generated by desktop Skype). This completed setup process, and now I can see all phone SMS messages in Skype on desktop.</p>

<h3> jbrookover  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus G73JW Freezes after Windows 8.1 Update - Network Related</h2>
                    <p>Quick background. &nbsp;I had trouble installing the Windows 8.1 update - it continually crashed on installation. &nbsp;I contacted Microsoft Support and they directed me to this site:&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/1e1adbc5-b78e-4b2a-9661-4139d13cc7d3/0xc1900101-0x30018-error-during-update-restore-win8?forum=w8itproinstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/1e1adbc5-b78e-4b2a-9661-4139d13cc7d3/0xc1900101-0x30018-error-during-update-restore-win8?forum=w8itproinstall</a></p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the end, I was able to install Windows 8.1 by disabling all of my onboard devices (audio, networking, etc). &nbsp;When I re-enabled them, I found that the computer would crash anywhere between 0 - 2 minutes after logging in. &nbsp;I assumed a driver issue and,
 in those 2 minutes, was able to update each driver via Device Manager (requiring several reboots).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything worked fine for a few days. &nbsp;Now, the computer has started to freeze again. &nbsp;Disabling the built-in networking solves the problem, but I would obviously like to access the internet. &nbsp;On top of that, it's inconsistent. &nbsp;Once the freezing starts,
 I *must* disable networking via BIOS. &nbsp;But then if I re-enable networking, it doesn't automatically lead to a freeze - I'm writing this post from the troubled computer right now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've confirmed that it's related to the network card because I tried a dozen things, but it kept on freezing. &nbsp;Disabled the network and boom - freezing is gone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know how long I'll have a grace period. &nbsp;If I only need to disable the networking once a week, I can live with that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thoughts? &nbsp;Drivers are updated. &nbsp;The install is as clean as possible since doing the update required me to wipe my system. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm certain that going back to 8.0 will solve the problem, but I like to keep my system current.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be possible that the some third-party program(mainly anti-virus program)&nbsp;is conflicting when connecting to a network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>First, I would suggest you to disable anti-virus program and check the issue.<br />
<font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Important</strong>: Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to
 install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. <br />
If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If that does not help, I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the network drives and check if it helps.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">First, download the latest drivers from manufacturer's website.<br />
</font><font color="#000000"><span><span><font><a href="http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=g73jw&amp;os=30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=g73jw&amp;os=30</a></font></span></span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To uninstall the driver, follow these steps.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font>Press<strong> Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</font>
</p>
<p><span><span><font>b.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font>Search for <strong>
Network adapters </strong>and expand it.</font></p>
<p><span><span><font>c.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font>Right click on the network drivers and select Uninstall it.</font></p>
<p><span><span><font>d.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOw, </span></span></span><font>Install the downloaded drivers restart the computer and check.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insall the driver: I also see that there are no Windows 8 drivers from this PC, so install the network driver in compatiblity mode.</p>

            Hello!
<div><br />
<div>I have no anti-virus software. &nbsp;This is a vanilla install of Windows 8, fully updated, eventually, to 8.1. &nbsp;I have installed some essentials: Steam, Origin, nVidia Experience, Google Drive. &nbsp;If I can't run 8.1 with those, then I don't want it :) &nbsp;That
 being said, I had trouble installing the update in the first place on a vanilla 8.0 install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers. &nbsp;I did not encounter an error for a few days, but then it suddently appeared again - anywhere between 1-3 minutes after boot, the system locks up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I checked the event logs and found "The local adapter does not support Bluetooth Low Energy." &nbsp;This doesn't seem critical, but it's the only thing that consistently appeared before the crash. &nbsp;I have now disabled my Bluetooth adapter from the BIOS. &nbsp;I
 have not experienced a system lock up since I made this change, but it's only been about 30 minutes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Other users with my hardware have indicated that this was an issue with installing (as I had), so I'm hopeful. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_update/windows-81-stuck-on-30-getting-devices-ready/9f64aad0-747a-4b59-899c-6c3fe540ca47">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_update/windows-81-stuck-on-30-getting-devices-ready/9f64aad0-747a-4b59-899c-6c3fe540ca47</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the advice, though welcoming more input.</div>

</blockquote>
Update: &nbsp;I just had a crash. &nbsp;This was with the Bluetooth module disabled. &nbsp;The interesting part about this crash is that I was starting from a sleep/hibernate state - e.g. the last thing I did last night was close the lid on my laptop.
<div><br />
<div>As you can see, though, this is not common. &nbsp;I should post a sign: &nbsp;It has been 13 days since my last system freeze. &nbsp;The symptoms are exactly the same, though: 1-3 minutes after logging in to Windows, everything freezes (fans still run) with no recovery
 possible aside from a hardware reboot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is not directly related to the sleep/hibernate state, though. &nbsp;I rarely take that action and it was not the cause of earlier freezes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have now disabled both the Bluetooth and the Lan modules in the BIOS (as suggested by other forums). &nbsp;We'll see.</div>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had exactly the same problem with my G73JW. It was some time ago and im not 100% sure now but i think it was when i reinstalled the chipset&nbsp;driver that it finally started to work ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you allready have solved the problem, please write about it.</p>
<p>I reinstalled 8.1 yesterday because i missed the speed of it and now im facing the same problem once again. Gonna try my own advice tonight and see if it works.</p>

            <p>Problem seem to be solved!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After trying to disable wifi, update different drivers and so on i finally checked the log to see what caused the problem. It was a Nvidia function "Nvstreamsvc.exe" that caused it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since i disabled that program from the taskmanager everything has worked fine! I havent found out what its good for yet but i havent missed it so... :-)</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you how dont know how to disable NVstreamsvc.exe just google it and youll find the answer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And for those of you having problem with the install of the Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Hit F2 during startup to enter Boot menu. Lock Wifi and USB and then run the installation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Adios!</p>

            <p>One last note...</p>
<p>Disabling NVstream.svc did help for a while but the program was not the real problem, it was just a "trigger" .The real problem is the computers Intel Wifi card which does not work well with Win 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution is simple. Put the computer in airplane mode which will turn the bluetooth off.
</p>
<p>The computer has worked several days without problems since i did that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows 8.1 is really working well now and the computer is very fast. The only other mod ive done with the computer is replacing the harddrive with an SSD and put the main one as a second disc...</p>

<br />
<div>I have not had any crashes since my last post. &nbsp;I had to re-enable my LAN module recently, but I also installed the very outdated chipset drivers from the ASUS website - not the networking drivers, as those were already updated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, for those of you trying to install Windows 8.1, disable Wifi/Bluetooth/LAN in BIOS, download a copy of the Network/Chipset drivers separately, install Windows 8.1, install those drivers, re-enable everything that you need. &nbsp;I'm not using Bluetooth
 anything, so that's still disabled.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I haven't done enough testing to nail down the problem yet - if it ever happens again, I'll re-post here with whatever state my computer was in. &nbsp;Just happy to have a reasonably stable system again.</div>

            I own the Asus G73JW-3DE and recently began having the freezing problems on December 18th. I had been running Windows 8 Professional for almost a year with no major problems. On December 18th, a notification appeared on my screen right after sign-on to
 let me know that the Windows 8.1 update was available in the Windows Store. I had never been prompted before about the Windows 8.1 update before, so I was wondering if some recent Windows update had been installed to encourage me to update (I had the "automatically
 download and install Windows Update" setting turned on). I tried to invoke the Windows Store but it was not working because the WSService was disabled (I think I had manually applied some tweaks to shut off). My Avast! antivirus had updated recently and it
 was now suggesting that I update Adobe AIR and the VLC Media Player, so I did that.
<div><br />
<div>I later had to go out, so I closed the cover on my laptop and left. When I returned home, I flipped the cover back up, but Windows would not resume, so I held down the power button and restarted the laptop. It booted up, but shortly later it froze. I held
 down the power button and restarted again. After a few failed attempts, Windows automatically brought up Recovery mode. The "automatic repair of Windows start up" was unable to fix the problem, so I used the System Restore to undo the latest Windows updates,
 Adobe AIR, VLC Player, and Avast! antivirus program update. The system booted up this time and I figured it was a problem with the antivirus program, so I installed AVG Free antivirus instead. I re-applied Windows updates and noticed that the Windows 8.1 update
 notification appeared again. Well, the freezing problem came back with a vengeance, and I could no longer get Windows to come up, except in Safe Mode. I noticed that the freezing occurred in Safe Mode as well if "With Networking" was enabled and I was using
 WiFi. Networking did work fine if I used the built-in ethernet card instead.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I ran into a strange problem if I pulled out the ethernet cable while I was in Windows. On the next reboot, I would see an error message "PXE-E01: PCI Vendor and Device IDs do not match" and then Windows would not see the ethernet card anymore
 (there would be a driver for some Kernel Debug Networking Controller in Device Manager instead); I was only able to make that go away by rebooting the machine with the ethernet cable plugged in and prevent it from happening again by not removing the cable
 until after Windows had powered down.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I convinced myself that there was a problem with Windows updates, and I just needed to update to Windows 8.1 to get past these problems. However, despite my best efforts, I could not get the Windows WSService to start so I could use the Windows Store to
 update to Windows 8.1. So I spent the next evening running Windows Reset and re-installed Windows 8. After re-installing Windows 8 cleanly (I reformatted the partition) and installing all of the updates (using the built-in Ethernet network card), I was able
 to run the Windows Store and update to Windows 8.1. I had to install an optional Windows update for the wireless ethernet card to get it to working in Windows 8.1, but wireless then worked like a charm. I turned off automatic Windows updates, and then created
 a new Windows Recovery Image and began the arduous task of re-installing my favorite applications.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything had been fine until this evening when I started up my computer and saw a message on the login screen that said I needed to install a Windows update, after that, it froze. I held the power button down and restarted, but it kept freezing during
 the startup process. After going through this annoyance a few more times, Windows went into system recovery mode, and I opted to perform a System Restore to see if an older version of the Windows Visual C++ runtime that was installed this afternoon was causing
 the problem. Shortly after Windows restarted and displayed the "System Restore has restored your machine to a prior state", the system froze! A few more rounds of holding down the power button and restarting and Windows put me back into Recovery Mode. This
 time I went into safe mode and disabled the dynamic tick setting with bcdedit, but I think I had already disabled that setting shortly after I installed Windows 8.1.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Well, the Windows did start up and has not frozen yet. I uninstalled the older Visual C++ runtime and also uninstalled/re-installed Sandboxie (it had been giving me problems since Windows 8.1 reported there would be incompatibility problems with the software).
 Still not confident I had the problem licked, I did a little Google searching and found this thread. Based on my experiences, the WiFi card could indeed be the culprit (it would explain why there are so many freezes at startup with software trying to phone-home
 to check for new updates. I suppose I could try running with the ethernet cable plugged in to see if that helps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is it really necessary to disable internal network cards in BIOS? Let's keep this thread updated as we collectively learn more about this problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, while we're talking about Windows 8.x and the G73JW, I had to disable the internal pointing device in BIOS because the touchpad driver was so buggy and unbearable (the mouse pointer would jerk about, be unresponsive, or sometimes wiggle around
 on its own). Also, the Fresco USB 3.0 port was never reliable for me in Windows 8; my USB 3.0 hard drive would constantly get disconnected, so I had to plug it into the USB 2.0 port instead. Have you folks experienced these issues as well?

            It froze again, but I've been able to regain stability simply by using the built-in Ethernet card. &nbsp;I did not have to turn off internal networking in BIOS. &nbsp;The wireless card truly does seem to be the problem.
<div><br />
<div>I would like to point out that it worked fine in Windows 8 Professional x64 up until this mid-December. &nbsp;After I had reset my system (to reinstall Windows 8) and updated to Windows 8.1 Professional x64, the wireless worked fine for a while with the optional
 Windows update for the Qualcomm wireless ethernet driver. &nbsp;The freezing happens early in the startup process, sometimes as early as the screen with the spinning circle, and sometimes as late as after the Windows desktop/Start screen has come up and then you
 attempt to do something.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My hunch is that Microsoft has changed the way Windows Startup/Initilaization works such that the wireless networking does not get properly initialized -- this would explain why the wireless driver used to work fine without freezing. &nbsp;The wireless driver
 must have been designed to work under certain assumptions that no longer apply anymore. &nbsp;The change in Startup/Initialization for Windows could be due to a security fix or as part of some Windows enhancement (such as to the Windows Store).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Still, if some networking operation needs to happen during Windows startup and initialization and the wireless network driver is not ready or is frozen, why does the whole OS have to freeze up? &nbsp;Why can't Windows detect the unresponsive wireless driver
 and just time-out and report an error? &nbsp;Even if the wireless driver fails to yield control back to the OS, the OS should still be able to override at the kernel level and retake control of the main thread.</div>
<div><br />
<div>While it is possible that the built-in wireless networking card itself may be failing (it is a couple of years old now), but I doubt it because other folks are reporting that the freezing problem began happening around the same time period: between late
 November and early to mid December. &nbsp; It seems too coincidental to me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unless this problem manifests itself on other brands/models of machines and wireless network cards, I fear that a solution will not be coming from Microsoft or Qualcomm, because it will be too esoteric of a problem to devote any time/resources to investigating
 and fixing.</div>

            Out of curiousity, I re-installed the outdated Intel chipset drivers and was able to restart my Windows 8.1 machine without it freezing. &nbsp;However, while checking for Windows Defender updates, it froze again. &nbsp;Perhaps the freezing on wireless problem is
 not relegated to just startup and initialization afterall, as I originally thought. &nbsp;*SHRUG*
<div><br />
<div>By the way, Windows 8.1 is just rife with problems. &nbsp;As of this morning, I am unable to use Windows Update. &nbsp;It fails with the dreaded error "Code 80244FFF". &nbsp;Ugh!</div>
