                    <p>&nbsp;have just moved my files to my school account at @ff.cuni.cz. All got synchreonized but I have 2 issues.</p>
<p>1) Dropdown menu misses the option to share link of a sycnchronized file</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>2) My old OneDrive - personal which I am not using anymore is still fixed everywhere and when clicked it pops up 2 folders, the old one and also the new school onedrive account, see screenschot after I clicked "Onedrive-personal".&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Groovy,<br />
<br />
Firstly please let us know which condition you are experiencing:<br />
a. You've moved your files from your personal OneDrive to OneDrive for Business.<br />
b. You changed the OneDrive for Business sync client (legacy sync client groove.exe &gt; next gen sync client), moved your files to the new local synced folder.<br />
<br />
1) By saying "share link of a sycnchronized file":<br />
1a. There's no such an option when I right click the file in the OneDrive for Business local synced folder (using the next gen sync client), just as your screenshot shows above.
<br />
<br />
1b. If you refer to your personal OneDrive, please note that the two kind of clients are two different products with different sharing mechanism.<br />
</p>
<p>1c. If you refer to your legacy OneDrive for Business local synced folder, this option is available (right click a file &gt; OneDrive for Business &gt; Copy link).<br />
You can submit a <a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
feedback</a> to the related team to retrieve this feature in the next gen sync client, understanding your experience helps us to make our product and service better for you and others.<br />
<br />
2) Please let us know which sync client generated the "old" sync folder. Please note the two kind of OneDrive for Business sync clients can work together.
<br />
2a. If it is the legacy OneDrive for Business sync client (groove.exe), to stop syncing it, right click the sync client icon on the systray, click Stop syncing a folder, then choose the folder/library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2b. If it is generated by the next-gen sync client, you can right click the icon on the systray &gt; Settings &gt; Unlink this PC.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jim</p>

    <title>Sudden Disappearance of all Personal Folders, sub-folders, and ALL - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sudden Disappearance of all Personal Folders, sub-folders, and ALL e-mails contained therein</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp; Serious issue:&nbsp; ALL of the Personal Folders in Outlook, including the "Personal Folder" itself, totally disappeared on June 28, 2016.&nbsp; They have not been found.&nbsp; There are no .pst (or .ost) files on the computer to be found anywhere either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; What is the cause of such a radical thing to happen?, and</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Is there any possible way to Recover those folders and their contents (which was total a couple hundred or more e-mails) ?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Protocol is iMAP.&nbsp; And 5 days before this happened, Outlook had apparently updated itself from 2010 to 2013 (I had not known this had happened).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(An expert technician searched for the missing folders (well really speaking those missing e-mails that were IN those folders &amp; sub-folders), and they seem to be nowhere to be found.&nbsp; RCN could not recover them.&nbsp; Microsoft help technicians could not find
 them through coaching and working with me.&nbsp; This seems to be legally actionable--Microsoft cannot do this to people's information.&nbsp; Over all the years of the existence of computers i have not ever lost files, e-mails, or other information in this way.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
 seem to "self destruct.")&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>WORD TO THE WISE:&nbsp;&nbsp; it seems that the combination of iMap and "microsoft outlook" products leaves information quite vulnerable to random unexplained disappearance of important information.&nbsp; As such, i have been advised to back up the whole computer, and
 bought an external drive (which is like a giant flash-drive) to do so.&nbsp; Back up all your files AND everything in your Outlook, i.e., all your e-mails and folders and subfolders...&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown if lost e-mails that just evaporate in this iMap protocol and in "Outlook"
 thing can be recovered.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over three-plus decades i have not ever lost important files and information in this way.&nbsp; Technology is supposed to be ADVANCING.&nbsp; What is up with this situation?
</p>
<p>
Hard lesson learned with No Warning -&nbsp; am planning to shift back to POP3 protocol when i can take all the steps to be sure to preserve all e-mails and everything in the Calendar.&nbsp; (If you shift back to POP protocol, be SURE to back-up -- make copy of -- your
 entire Outlook Calendar and All your in box and sent box e-mails.)&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&gt; itself from 2010 to 2013 (I had not known this had happened).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As Palcouk said, not likely. Outlook 2013 was the first version of Outlook included in an Office 365 subscription. Office 2010 had no ability to update itself to a later version. Moreover any later version would have to be separately
 licenced. Licenses for Office 2010 did not carry over to later versions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;<span>ALL of the Personal Folders in Outlook, including the "Personal Folder" itself, totally</span></p>
<p><span>&gt; disappeared on June 28, 2016.&nbsp; They have not been found.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Have you enabled looking in hidden files and folders? For Windows 7, Outlook 2010 created its files in a hidden folder in the user's Windows profile and that would have carried over with an upgrade to Windows 10. Look in %AppData%\Microsoft\Outlook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Outlook 2010 used a PST for IMAP folders, but once that account was removed from the profile, the PST would have become useless. However, in Outlook 2010 IMAP data files could not contain non-mail folders like Contacts and Calendar,
 so it used another PST as the default where those folders were kept. I suspect it's still on the hard drive if you upgraded (and not installed Windows 10 from scratch) and created a new mail profile. I think you're not looking in the correct folder for the
 original PST.</span></p>

<p>You have a choice, go back to W8.1 or just stay Preview.&nbsp; Either way, you are going to get a downloaded update.&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't mention how you installed, a sole O/S, VM, dual boot, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may depend on how fast to want to get to W10.&nbsp; Both options will get you there July 29th.&nbsp; Delete Preview and go back to W8.1 and you have 1 year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay on Preview and you still a year or until Beta testing&nbsp; ends.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the choice is yours.&nbsp; Since you are already on W10, why go backwards to come forward to where you are now.&nbsp; You are in a very large group.&nbsp; Almost your choice.&nbsp; The option to Beta test after July 29th is just that, an option.</p>

            I installed it as the sole OS. The reason I'm asking is from what I understand (which could be dead wrong) Insiders get 10 and it stays activated providing you stay in the program. I you clean install and not continue with the program to get new builds,
 it will expire. Although I intend to stay in the program but, I have other machines testing Windows 10 but I'd like one of my machines to not be in the insider program. Just so I have one machine without beta bits. My understanding is this would not be possible.
 I'm so confused!

<p>I don't think you are seeing it right.&nbsp; I too have W10 as a sole o/s.&nbsp; W10 Preview gets to go to W10 Final on July 29th and be activated.&nbsp; This assumes that you have a qualifying W7 or W8.1 license which you state you have.&nbsp; This can be the end of it. You
 now have a genuine W10 license and you don't have a W8.1 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can elect to stay in the Preview program.&nbsp; You would continue to get Builds in the fast ring just for interest.&nbsp; You can clean install as many times as you wish on W10 Final.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On July 29th, I plan to take my W10 to Final.&nbsp; No real reason not too.&nbsp; It has never skipped a beat.&nbsp; It will be a genuine W10 license.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will likely stay on Preview.&nbsp; No reason not too.&nbsp; What would my life be without Preview? &nbsp; I can clean install whenever
 I like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be good to go with whatever works best for you.</p>

<p>Good - let me clarify a bit.&nbsp; Per Gabe , you have&nbsp; a choice on July 29th.&nbsp; You can elect to leave Insider and you are W10 activated.&nbsp; Stay in Insiders and each Build will activate you as you are now.&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point in time, you will leave Insiders and be
 activated the same as you would have been on July.&nbsp; Just know someone will correct me on my use of words.</p>

            See that's how I understood it. You get to continue using Windows 10 if you are in the insider program. Mel's previous post seems to think he doesn't think that's the case. My understanding is you only get 10 if you stay in the insider program or it will
 eventually expire. This makes sense. Everyone in the Insider Preview getting final non beta Windows 10 does not. Well unless you believe in Unicorns. Hopefully come July 29 this is much clearer. If not, I'll wait a day or just go back to 8.1.

</blockquote>
<p>After reading Gabe's release, just don't know how you come to this conclusion.&nbsp; What is the definition of "nuked"?&nbsp;&nbsp; I am running W10 as a sole O/S.&nbsp; I guess one would say that I have "nuked" my good ole W8.1 Pro.&nbsp; The W8.1 Pro o/s is not on my PC but my
 W8.1 Pro Product Key is surely there.&nbsp; I can prove this to myself by using Neosmart.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't endorse Neosmart, it works for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per Gabe, on July 29th I have 2 choices.&nbsp; Leave Insiders and go to W10 Final, if qualified.&nbsp; I can elect to stay on Insiders and continue getting Builds on the slow or fast builds.&nbsp; These builds will get activation from the build just as we get now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Down
 the road when you elect to leave Insiders or Insiders stops, you then activate W10 the same as you would on July 29th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, just don't see big issues here.&nbsp; You can clean install W10 as often as you want too.&nbsp; The key here is that your Product Key was captured when you went to Insiders, just like mine was.

            <p>Here's &nbsp;how I understood Gabe's post. If you want to stay as an insider do nothing - If not, you don't get Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the text:</p>
<p>“I want to opt out of the Windows Insider Program on 7/29.” <strong>If you decide to opt-out of the program and upgrade to the 7/29 build you will be subject to exactly the same terms and conditions that govern the offer* that was extended to all Genuine
 Windows 7 and 8.1 customers. This is not a path to attain a license for Windows XP or Windows Vista systems.</strong> If your system upgraded from a Genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 license it will remain activated, but if not, you will be required to roll
 back to your previous OS version or acquire a new Windows 10 license. If you do not roll back or acquire a new license the build will eventually expire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last part&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If your system upgraded from a Genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 license it will remain activated, but if not, you will be required to roll back to your previous OS version or acquire a new Windows 10 license.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What's with the if??</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my understanding so far is to get 10 and NOT be an insider, it may work without going back to 7/8.1 but if it doesn't reinstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully it gets clearer but wouldn't hold my breath</p>

<h2>            Cannot make calls to Philippines even though I have a subscription</h2>
                    <p>Before this month I had no problems.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have previous subscribed with a lower package and it worked great.<br />
However, this month has been nothing but problems. It doesn't matter if I'm using the Windows App, Windows Desktop version, or Android App 1/500 times I can get a call to go through.<br />
<br />
It'll say it's ringing but there's no dial tone like usual, and then I get a message saying "Subscriber cannot be reached" I have had my spouse get her phone checked out. She's able to recieve phone calls and send phone calls to other local land/cell phones.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I spent $70 this month and it's seriously going down the drain, as we haven't been able to contact eachother. Her dataplan hasn't been working, so we were counting on this to stay connected.<br />
<br />
I somehow managed to get to Skype chat[EDIT: Skype Support/Help Chat, not Skype Chat regular feature], which for some reason I can't get now.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
the Support representative connected to my computer reinstalled skype and also ran some commands that I don't remember.
<br />
<br />
It worked 3 or 4 times, but now it's back to not calling any numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I only have a week left and I still have over 700 minutes out of the 800 I purchased.
<br />
<br />
We are both really distressed as we are dealing with a lot of stress in both of our individual lives, and being unable to contact eachother has made the issue(s) worse<br />
<br />
I am calling from USA trying to call Philippines with 800 Min Mobile and Landline Subscription</span>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

It's been slammed week, so I apologize for not replying soon.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With my health conditions, being disabled and currently unable to keep even a part-time job. The $80 that expires on the 1st with now 761/800 minutes left is not helping with my stress that I need to keep down to keep my conditions in a more manageable state.&nbsp;

I'm having to load additional credit to send her text messages, which from what I heard from her she's not getting them always like before.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>List of Figures - Hyperlink Problem with Destination - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superken67  say:</h3>
<h2>            List of Figures - Hyperlink Problem with Destination</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create my List of Figures with hyperlinks so that when I click on one entry (e.g. Figure 1) in the list, word displays the full image that is attached to the caption for that figure. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;I'm finding that no matter the version of Word
 (for Mac 2003, for Mac 2016, for Windows 2013), the hyperlinks go directly to the caption, meaning the image above gets cut off and I have to scroll up to see the top of it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I make it so that the list of figures is still attached to the captions for their names but is actually a link to the beginning of each image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>It sounds like you are describing a pop-up window with an (enlarged) image that can be seen in many online stores when you click a product description. That isn't supported in Word. In a list of figures, the hyperlinks point to the caption text, not to the
 image.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I figured out how to do it. &nbsp;Word doesn't seem to have this option available. &nbsp;For anyone else interested, it requires Adobe Acrobat Pro to set a "destination." &nbsp;It's a bit difficult to explain, and I'm sure these directions will need to be adapted to different
 versions of the programs and different systems but the basic premise should be the same. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First you should have the hyperlinks option enabled for the List of Figures (and Table of Contents or any other table) in the Word document. &nbsp;To do this, you either toggle the field code of the List of Figures (right-click to find this option) and add
 \h at the end of the code in brackets, or right click to "edit field," which leads to a window with a "Table of Figures" button. &nbsp;Click on that to find a "Use Hyperlinks instead of page numbers" box that you must check. &nbsp;Then update the entire table again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Convert to PDF. &nbsp;Adobe Acrobat Pro (newer versions) offers an option to create PDF from a Word file, but some versions don't work with Word documents. &nbsp;Newer versions of Word also have the option to save as a PDF with options to allow the document to
 be created with bookmarks enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat Pro, go to the List of Figures and check to see if you can click on the entries to go to the caption for the figures. &nbsp;If not, go back and fix the hyperlink option in Word or you'll have to manually add the links in Adobe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Click on a figure in the List of Figures to go to the page with the image. &nbsp;Then scroll up or down to adjust exactly what section of the page you want the link to display. &nbsp;In my case, that means scrolling up to include the full image and centering it
 on the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Once you're happy with the positioning of the page, click on the "Destinations" icon on the left side of Adobe. &nbsp;You may have to right-click and check the Destinations option for the icon to show up. &nbsp;It looks like a white, blue, and red target icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Then click the "Create New Destination" icon, which is the same target icon but with a golden gear/star/shape on top. &nbsp;Give it a name that matches the figure you are linking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Now go back to the List of Figures page and click on the "Tools" button on the Right. &nbsp;Then select "Content," and finally, under "Add or Edit Interactive Object," choose "Link." &nbsp;Now you should be able to select each hyperlink when you hover the pointer
 over an entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Right-click the figure entry for which you just created a destination and select "Properties..." &nbsp;Then click on the "Action" tab to alter the destination of the link. &nbsp;You'll click "edit," then "Use Named Destination." &nbsp;Hit "Browse" and select the destination
 you created with the name of the figure you are linking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. &nbsp;Then press ok for each window until you can test the new hyperlink to make sure it displays the page exactly as you intended. &nbsp;Go back and repeat these steps for all figures you want to relink to a new destination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "set destination" option can also be used for Table of Contents links. &nbsp;Bookmarks work the same and are even easier because you can set their destinations by right-clicking on the individual bookmark and selecting that option. &nbsp;For the problem of the
 hyperlink boxes showing up on Macs having a black outline, you can right click on the link in Adobe, choose "Properties...," then make the box visible and change the color to white (for a normal black text on white paper document).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone!</p>

    <title>Excel userform picture not resized correctly when zoom changed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoffkelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel userform picture not resized correctly when zoom changed</h2>
                    <p>If an Excel VBA userform has a background picture with picturesizemode set to stretch or zoom, and the userform.zoom is changed, the picture is not resized to match the form, but appears to be zoomed twice.</p>
<p>If zoom is say 80, the picture is zoomed to 64% while everything else on the form is zoomed to 80%, so the relative position of controls to the picture is incorrect.
</p>
<p>If you resize the form and set the zoom to match, the picture no longer fits the form.</p>
<p>I want to adjust forms to fit the user's screen size and maintain the same appearance.</p>

            Re:&nbsp; picture on a userform<br />
<br />
In xl2010, I got the same results and...<br />
It appears as if the width/height of a userform picture are read only properties.<br />
So you can't adust the picture size to fit the actual form zoom size.&nbsp; I tried.<br />

            <p>Thanks for confirming my experience. The problem dates back at least to Excel 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run further tests and found that if the picturesizemode is fmPictureSizeModeClip (=0) then the picture zooms correctly, so I will have to resize my background picture in an external program to exactly fit the form in design mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still regard the behaviour of stretch and zoom modes to be a bug.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, under Phone Settings there is an option to disable roaming data. In that case your data connection is turned off when you are in another country.</p>

<h2>            Edit Online Only - Permission Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi, &nbsp;we'd like to set the permissions to a folder to only allow online editing ensuring people don't inadvertently create new versions or lock our files. &nbsp;We followed the steps in this solved question:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/429665</p>
<p>However, although our modified permission appears to prevent downloading and opening in Excel, the "Edit Online" functionality doesn't work either. &nbsp;When multiple people are in the document at once, they don't see each others cursors and their changes are
 sporadically saved, many times an error message appears saying "We could not save your changes". &nbsp;As soon as we revert back to the regular "Contribute" permission, edit online functionality works perfectly, however "Edit In Excel" is re-enabled which is what
 we are trying to avoid.</p>
<p>We're looking for any advice or alternatives to allow editing online while preventing opening and downloading.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>For your scenario, I have done the related test and I could view another user's cursor with the new permission as you mentioned in the thread above and save properly.</p>
<p>To clarify your scenario, could you confirm the following info?<br />
1. Please check if some user edit the Excel file in the client when you get the message "We could not save your changes".
<br />
2.Share a screenshot of the permission level you created. To upload screenshots, you can click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> in the forum and then click the icon of <strong>
Insert/Edit Media</strong>.<br />
3.Change to another network environment to check the outcome.</p>
<p>Please share updates when you have time.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Felix</p>

            <p>hi.</p>
<p>on your questions:</p>
<p>1.) nobody else is editing in the client</p>
<p>2.)see below</p>
<p>3.) the network environment shouldn't be a problem given this issue only occurs on permission change with the network staying consistent.</p>
<p>here is a video with a screen share of a colleague, you will see that we can both see each other's changes, but as soon as a switch to the "edit online only" permission below, we cannot see anybody's changes and he gets the error message about not saving
 changes.</p>

    <title>Unable to close group of folders &#47; mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> econolite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to close group of folders &#47; mailbox</h2>
                    <p>This problem started occurring after we upgraded to Exchange 2010 but not sure if that's the cause:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;view another user's mailbox&nbsp;in Outlook 2010 by using the Account settings area.&nbsp; When done viewing, I&nbsp;removed the additional mailbox but it still remains in the folder list on left side of Outlook.</p>
<p>I tried to right click and select "close folders" but it just gives the message:</p>
<p>"This group of folders is associated with an e-mail account. To remove the account, click the File Tab, and on the Info tab, click Account Settings. Select the e-mail account, and then click Remove."&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have obviously already taken these steps so I am
 now stuck with a bunch of additional mailboxes in my folder list that won't go away.&nbsp;&nbsp; This used to work fine before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

    <title>protecting word document from accidental editing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jsquareg  say:</h3>
<h2>            protecting word document from accidental editing</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Office since, I think Office 97, mostly for Excel and Outlook with very little use of Word.&nbsp; I used Word for a few letters and no report like documents. I am now at Office 365 level and find I now have to write reports or other such documents.&nbsp;
 It is too easy for me to inadvertently&nbsp; make changes to a report I&nbsp; have just written and am viewing it.&nbsp; Is there a way I can prevent me from over typing, deleting or otherwise making changes due to unintended key strokes.&nbsp; Maybe something like make the report
 editable except when I want to deliberately nake a change?&nbsp; (disable editing/enable editing.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for help educating this Word newbie. </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a Nokia 2720 fold. This phone has two displays. One inside, you see it when your fold the phone out. And on on the front. You see it when the phone is closed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question: How do I keep the front display allways on. I want to see the time immediatelly, when I look on the folded phone. At the moment the light fades out after 10 sec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Support?<br />
<br />
This is the Official Nokia discussion sites as you might already know. What you might don't know yet is that these sites are mainly a user to user forum where Nokia users can share their knowledge and help each others with issues.<br />
<br />
There are some emplyees that are around here now and then. They are in green and are here on their spare time. You might get an answer, or you might not. - As I wrote, this is mainly an user to user forum.<br />
<br />
Now, for direct contact with Nokia, click the "contact us" button on the top right of this page. You will probably be able to contact them bay either mail or call.<br />
<br />
On these boards, you will have to wait untill someone decides to reply your thread.<br />
<br />
(I cannot help you with this as I don't have the phone. Bumping your thread is not allowed)</p>

<p>Here's the official Nokia response:</p>
<pre>Keeping the display always turned on will drain the battery thus this option is not available.<br /></pre>
<p>The closest you can get is either by opening and closing the flip, or by pressing the side volume key. Either will display the time for about 10 seconds.</p>

            I guess you have a FILENAME field in the footer. To prevent the field from updating, you can lock it (select the field and press Ctrl+F11). Of course, if it has already updated and you have saved, closed and reopened the file since then, there is nothing
 you can do. The easiest solution will be to delete the field and just type in the original filename and path in the footer.

                    <p>I work at a school and currently have Win 7 Enterprise installed on most of our computers. &nbsp;If I install Win 10 Insider Preview on all of them, will they automatically update to the actual version on July 29? &nbsp;I'd rather not try to get this all done in one

<p>@anne - you do realize that Enterprise does not qualify for W10 RTM free.&nbsp; As of current date, it has been announced that qualifying W7 and W8.1 licenses will get to move from W10 Preview to W10 RTM on July 29th without having to go back to prior license.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Enterprise does not qualify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Testing is now being done on Pro, Enterprise and Home editions of W10.&nbsp; I am testing Enterprise myself.&nbsp; I came over to W10 as a sole O/S from a W8.1 Pro&nbsp; PC with a qualifying license.&nbsp; It is my plan to try to get back to Pro edition on the next Build release
 or I am heading back to W8.1 Pro with a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not see any real releases on or when W10 Enterprise will be released to the market.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are likely using some sort of a bulk license which is not up my alley.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side&nbsp; note.&nbsp; You can elect to&nbsp; do nothing on July 29th and just continue using Insiders.&nbsp; You will still get the W10 RTM build but temporary activation will come from the Build itself.&nbsp; This would let you continue to test W10 Enterprise and get faster
 exposure to future new Builds.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, down the road, Insiders will likely end so you will be back at the table trying to buy W10 Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks, Mel. &nbsp;Based on your info, I would like to install W10 Pro Preview. &nbsp;Do you have a link? &nbsp;I found Home and Enterprise, but not Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the same question applies: &nbsp;If I install W10 Preview today on all of my machines, do I have to install W10 RTM on July 29, or will it automatically update?</p>

<p>Thanks, Mel. &nbsp;Based on your info, I will be going with W10 Pro for now. &nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ok, let me repeat that you must have a qualifying and fully up to date W7 or W8.1 License to qualify for W10 RTM free.&nbsp; Enterprise does not qualify.&nbsp; If qualified, you will get edition for edition - Home gets Home, Pro gets Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an Insider, you were likely running a prior O/S, some Insiders such as new PC builders may not have a prior O/S and they qualify for nothing, just temp access to an O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you joined Insiders, you had to use a MSA.&nbsp; You must use the same MSA when you move from W10 Preview to W10 RTM.&nbsp;&nbsp; As it stands right now, on July 29th, Insiders will receive a download update which will be the RTM build.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you are already running
 W10, you should just move from W10 Preview to W10 RTM without going back to prior O/S.&nbsp; You are already running W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you joined Insiders,&nbsp; your prior O/S Product was captured.&nbsp; So, it is really just the activation of a W10 Product Key and the de-activation of a prior Product Key.&nbsp; Not all that much magic involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have a herd of PC's, the same logic applies.&nbsp; If you have a qualifying W7 or W8.1 license, then the transition should be in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you have any sort of bulk licensing in place, then you would&nbsp; not qualify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the normal Insider PC user has the path on July 29th to move from 1 qualifying license to another license - 1 in, 1 out.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will just be another build except this one is the RTM.&nbsp; You must quit Insiders to do this.&nbsp; If you do nothing on July 29th,
 you will just continue on with Insiders but with the latest build (RTM).&nbsp; However, your W10 will still be a temp Product Key with an expiry date.&nbsp; This just gives more time to look at W10 and gives faster access to new builds.&nbsp; You still have the bridge to
 go from Preview back to RTM, just like you could have done on July 29th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy, let the games continue.</p>

            I have this lingering question. &nbsp;Why will it not make this mysterious DDE connection? &nbsp;I created this data base last year and printed the labels from it just fine. &nbsp;But this year when I get to the part of selecting the MS Excel DDE.xls I get the"could
 not reestablish the DDE connection. " &nbsp;I did go into the excel database and changed the date to 2017. &nbsp;Could that change have something to do with the problem?

            If you only see the Excel data in the first label on the sheet, it is almost certain that you have NOT used the Update Labels facility. &nbsp;You must use that to replicate the arrangement of the merge fields from the first label to each of the other labels
