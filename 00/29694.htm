                    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">windows live family safety</span></strong>...what is it where did it come from and how do I get rid of it?<br />
<br />
This thing has invaded my machine, prevented me from accessing&nbsp;my most used and very general web sites and it is driving me mad.<br />
<br />
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Won't someone please help me get this and any related ____ off my machine?</span></em></strong></p>

When I go to the WL Folder which has magically appeared in my directory I find all kinds of nifty things to do. How did
<em>that</em> happen? Why am I so clueless, out in space, lost in the dark? Did I really do this? Is going to cost me more than my sanity? Most of all, how do I get rid of it and everything associated with it?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;INSTALLATION STOPPED&#33;&#38;quot&#59; - FORZA 5 not co-operating...</h2>
                    
<p>That message gets annoying after a while!... Well I have a new Xbox One console and so far I've downloaded Titanfall and a few demos without any issue. HOWEVER, FORZA 5 is a different story. When I try to download the digital copy it doesn't get past "queued"
 and eventually just says "INSTALLATION STOPPED!" (with error code "0x7008000f"). I have the same deal with the disc copy when it reaches the point where it needs to download the update - "INSTALLATION STOPOPED!". I had a long chat with a guy on Xbox Support
 and I've tried everything from powering off for a few minutes to clearing persistent storage and doing what I was asked to do with the "alternate Mac address" (whatever that is lol.) I was eventually told to contact the Forza 5 people who I haven't managed
 to get through to yet, which sucks. My main reason for buying an Xbox One was to play Forza 5 so if this carries on for much longer I'm reluctantly going to have to put the console on eBay and just stick with my PS4 (which, incidentally has never had any issues.)</p>

<p>Hey there F300Sparta,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about the installation issue you've been experiencing. Let try out some troubleshooting steps to see if we can get things sorted.</p>
<p>I would suggest first installing Forza Motorsport 5 disc offline (Completely disconnected from Xbox Live). To perform this, follow the steps on this troubleshooting
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/game-installation-process-stops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Support article</a>. This way you can install the game first with no new updates from Xbox Live interfering.</p>
<p>After you install the game, connect to Xbox Live again and try downloading the updates.</p>
<p>Try that out and let us know how it goes!</p>

<p>I am having exact same issue, I just bought forza 5 and it got queued once it prompted me for 14 gb update.</p>
<p>Miss Diggz, I tried wha you suggested, I uninstalled game, went offline, re-installed from disc and I was able to play offline, but as soon as I went online and started game, it asked for an update and the update just got queued.</p>
<p>How can I fix this ?</p>

                    <p>Hi All, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to share my experience with this error as so far i haven't seen this version yet.
</p>
<p>Win7 x64 Ultimate upgrading to Win10 x64 Pro using a HP elitebook 2560. </p>
<p>As this was a company laptop I did not have the original Win 7 install media. </p>
<p>
</p><p>During install I encoutered diffuclties with the BIOS password as this was done by my former employer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to bypass those issues and then opted to do a clean installl. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short&nbsp;&gt; I believe that by resetting my BIOS just moments prior to the upgrade the activation is now failing.
</p>
<p>My laptop was fully licensed and shot be activated after upgrade, however this clearly indicates otherwise.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If anybody has any suggestions they would be more than welcome, as I can not revert back to Win 7.</p>

 create one. To create the Windows 8 installation media, refer these links:</p>

            I experienced this issue as well. I found that I can use `CTRL` + `ALT` + `DEL` at the black screen. This allows me to start the Task Manager. Within the Task Manager select New Task (RUN) from the File menu. Type CMD and select the check box to run this
 command as an administrator. Within the command prompt, type `sfc/scannow` and let it scan your system. Once completed, reboot the machine by pressing `CTRL` + `ALT` + `DEL` again and select restart from the Power button on the bottom right.

Interesting!&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you check your Second Screen setting?&nbsp;&nbsp; Win-P.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far this symptom has been seen to be a second screen in Extended mode (so phantom until another monitor is plugged in) inexplicably being where the primary screen was being shown.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
 I have been imagining that everything would be appearing on the phantom (except for the pointer of course) and hence suggesting that people would need to imagine seeing the Second Screen dialog and using their keyboard as if they could see its options changing
 and then use it, e.g. press CursorUp and Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why it's a surprise to learn that the TM will open there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it's paying attention to the position of the pointer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before that others were using their keyboards to navigate around the assumed login screen controls, e.g. using Tab keys (without knowing exactly where they were starting from), finding the Accessibility button to activate Narrator and then letting its comforting
 words&nbsp;guide them through the darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW was the screen really "black" or just "blank"?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction would be whether there is a fringe of light around the edges and a slightly less dark shade of black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

            I get to the login everytime. Once authenticated, instead of metro loading, it goes to the blank screen with the pointer. It is a laptop and never had a monitor plugged in. It seems eeally random as to when it would occur. One out of ten reboots would
 take me to metro. The other times just a blank screen with the pointer.

Thanks for clarifying.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a different symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually it means that explorer.exe has crashed and not restarted or for some reason not started at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in your TM instead of starting cmd.exe try seeing if explore.exe is there and if not starting&nbsp;
 explorer.exe&nbsp; as a simpler workaround.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another potential workaround instead of rebooting would be to logoff and login again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explorer.exe would be restarted that way too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on how frequently this happens and how interested you are in finding out why you could try first using the Event log to see if there are any clues in it about what is happening differently when it fails in comparison to when you have booted normally.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 However, even better would be running ProcMon with its Boot Logging option enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, you would probably want to have two traces, one working normally and one a failure case to have any hope of managing all the data and finding the essential differences
 in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oops.&nbsp; I just&nbsp;reread the OP and&nbsp;Subject and see that it does say "after login" too.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should almost delete my first post.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Good luck</p>

            <p>Here’s how I fixed the blank blue screen problem on a brand new Dell Inspiron 3847 desktop with Windows 8.1 x64 OS.&nbsp; When Windows loaded, sometimes it worked fine and sometimes I got a blank blue screen with just a cursor showing.&nbsp; Seemed like that happened
 most often after a restart or waking up from hibernation.&nbsp; When I had just a blank blue screen with a cursor, I noticed there was still a Windows button in the lower left corner that would show up when my cursor came over it.&nbsp; (This may not be the case for
 those who use a password to log in and go thru the lock screen.)&nbsp; When I clicked on the Windows button, it would take me to a normal looking Start screen.&nbsp; From there I could go to the desktop where there were taskbar icons showing on the bottom left but no
 shortcuts showing on the desktop and no tray icons on the bottom right.&nbsp; If I clicked on any of the taskbar programs, the icon became highlighted and a small image of the open program would show if I pointed to the icon, but nothing had opened on the screen.&nbsp;
 It was like things were happening somewhere, but not on the screen I was looking at.&nbsp; After much starting, restarting, and searching the web, I got an idea of what to do from Robert's reply above. &nbsp;I went back to the Start screen, opened the charms bar, clicked
 on the Settings charm, clicked on “Change PC settings”, clicked on “PC and devices”, and then clicked on “Display”.&nbsp; In the “Multiple displays” option box, the default setting was “Extend these displays”.&nbsp; I changed this to be “Show only on 1”.&nbsp; And voila!&nbsp;
 Going back to the desktop I could now see those programs that were open.&nbsp; And there was no more blank screen after starting up!&nbsp; I guess when I was looking at a blank blue screen or a desktop that didn’t seem to work, I was actually looking at screen #2 of
 some sort of two-screen configuration.&nbsp; It wouldn’t happen every time, but it happened often enough to be a real nuisance.&nbsp; What seemed like a bad driver or a conflict in startup processes turned out to be just an improper default setting for the display.&nbsp;
 Amazing!&nbsp; I’m sure this fix will help someone else out there. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The problem might actually be an addon or other program causing the problem and you should check that<br />
1st.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER has on this<br />
machines including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which causes issues).<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security - Reset all Zones to default level - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
Try IE and/or IE with no Addons<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue. (Toolbars are BHO's)<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />

<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that would be unusual with<br />
Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie (no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner.
<br />
<br />
I would add prevx as well.<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security programs. This is
<br />
a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>It look like it is still not possible to customise permanently the default Explorer view for MTP devices in Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The view is set to "Tiles" by default. This view is king of useless for MTP devices, since picture thumbnail are not shown.</p>
<p>When you switch to Details view the default columns does not make sense: they are set up for a musique player device, which was fine 10 years ago but is no longer relevant today with Android smartphone being the dominant MTP device.</p>
<p>You can not save a customised view as the default for all future MTP devices, the "Apply to Folders" option is grayed out.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Surface Pro 3 High Definition Audio Controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tpalm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Surface Pro 3 High Definition Audio Controller</h2>
                    <p>When connecting the device to a TV through a HDMI Cable, the picture shows but audio comes through my device. In the Device Manager, one of the two High Definitition Audio Controllers does has a yellow warning triangle with a code 10 issue. I have tried
 to disable, uninstall are then reinstall the driver but this does not solve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when going on to the playback devices, the TV or a HDMI output does not show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the instructions relating to going into the UEFI settings to enable the TPM but it was already enabled and made no difference. &nbsp;There is still a yellow triangle by the Audio Controller. &nbsp;I've tried updating the drivers (says newest is already
 installed) and installed all the windows updates that are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really doing my head in - can anyone help?</p>

<h2>            Getting black screen while login into user account</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Black Screen of Death</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the principal user of my desktop computer running Windows 7, and am hence the Administrator. I have set up a separate Regular User ID for my grandson. As of today, when starting my PC I get past the Welcome Screen and select my User as opposed to that
 of my grandson....my screen goes black with just a cursor visible and stays that way. I have select CTRL-ALT-Del and started Task Manager and then tried to RUN explorer.exe but found Task manager crashed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to switch User to my grandson's ID and find that all of his Apps and screen are perfectly visible and run OK. However I cannot run any diagnostics as he does not have Admin Authorisation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my ID to run?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello Alan,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per description you are able to boot to the desktop, however not in your own user account with administrative privileges.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The issue could be due to some third party application conflicting or corruption in user account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to try following steps and check</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Try to login into Safe Mode.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode in your own account and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Click the link and follow the steps “<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong>”
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Refer: How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:<em> </em></span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If issue still persists I would suggest you to again login to safe mode from the other account and then try to create a new user administrator account and check if issue remained same in the new user account too. To create new use account try<span>&nbsp;
</span>method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Create new user account</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Create a user account</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows</span>-7</span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the new user account is functioning properly, then there could be possibility that your account could have gone corrupt. In that case, I would suggest you to transfer the user profile data from the old user account (corrupt account) to the
 new user account (Administrator).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To transfer data from old user account to new user account follow the article given below and go to the section<strong>:

<p>Onde consigo a atualização para o código: 51-C00DF236 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meu X-Box não está na live, será que consigo fazer download através de Pendrive ?</p>

<h2>            backgroundtrasferhost.exe using high network bandwidth</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I currently running windows 10 anniversary update and problem is that the process "backgroundtransferhost.exe " is using high network bandwidth. I have disable all the live tiles on the start menu and also have disabled peer to peer &nbsp;windows update
 mode but it has no effect . I live in area where broadband is not available so I use 3g modem to connect to internet but whenever I connect to internet the above stated process consumes about 100-200 Mb of data , the problem doesn't stop here whenever I reconnect
 to internet (during that day or 6-7 hours time frame) it again consumes same amount of data . So I am unable to connect to internet . please! tell me how to disable "backgroundtranferhost.exe " completely.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Could you also let us know if you are using a wireless or a wired connection? If you are using a wireless connection, please connect using a wired and check if the same issue occurs. Also you may want to run a complete scan using the inbuilt Windows Defender
 to eliminate any suspicion of infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">This service also transfers files in the background using idle network bandwidth. Applications which depend on BITS such as Windows update and MSN Explorer automatically downloads programs and other information while the connection
 is idle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">As a troubleshooting step you may also try the steps listed below and check, but please do remember that disabling this service will lead not being able to install Windows update.&nbsp;Therefore I would suggest you to try this step,
 check and then restart the service again. This is to let us know if indeed this service may be causing the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">You can disable this service by opening TASK MANAGER &gt; SERVICES &gt; OPEN SERVICES (Bottom Left corner) &gt; Find the service from the list - BITS / BACKGROUND INTELLIGENT TRANSFER SERVICE &gt; Right click, STOP &gt; Right click, PROPERTIES

<h2>            Windows explorer sometimes extremely slow, how do you speed it up&#63;</h2>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that NOT always, but now and then, when I especially connect an external hard drive with lots of data, or in fact when I want to open some folder with especially lots of films on existing partitions, that it can take very long before it can open
 the folder or have content fully showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The extreme example is with data DVD, such as in the screenshot I wanted to copy data from, from a public library. The notebook has a lot of trouble trying to fully open such a DVD and the problem is the DVD drive is embarrassingly loud, making sounds for
 ages that make me have to look for some far-flung corner in the building in order not to disturb other folks.<br />
</p>
<p>I have no idea why the DVD player exaggerates this. In the past it did not and run smoothly. Yesterday, I had to give up trying to view, let alone copy content because it showed "not responding", while making a lot of noise, as if one was maliciously trying
 to rotate the disc to and fro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question:</p>
<ul>
<li>generally speaking, what can one do to speed up opening folders, especially with lots of content, whether on partitions or external drives? As said, that does not always happen, but happens now and then<br />
</li><li>is there anything that can be done so the DVD drive quickly reads the content without acting up?</li></ul>
<p>My notebook is a bit old, but not slow as such, 8GB RAM, etc. I use programs like Ccleaner, etc to clean it up everyday and so it's not that it's slow, because it's full of junk. It has all available Windows 10 &amp; other software updates installed. Restarting
 the file explorer process or service via task manager does not hep in such cases.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

            Hi xprt007,
<br />do you have any codec packs installed? They may significantly slowing down folders opening.
<br />DVD drive may read disks quickly if there are no problems with reading: good drive state without degradation or impurities of reading elements and factory made disk (nor writable or rewritable).
<br />There may be different problems causing slow folder access so it is needed to analyze situation.
<br />CCleaner is not safe program and may cause different problems sometimes poorly identified.

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>I will look into this, but I can certainly say a thing or 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have run SFC Scan &amp; DISM a couple of times for unconnected reasons in the recent past, but I have never had both delivering negative results. They always find everything OK, and since the issue esp. with the DVD has gone on for months, the few times I
 have wanted to copy data from a DVD, I can say it will probably make no difference as I do not expect different results or anything corrupted.</li><li>I could run the Windows update troubleshooter, but why? I have no problem with Windows updates at all</li><li>Windows explorer does actually open + the connected folders. it's just that with DVD drive, at least the few times I have used it in the last couple of months, it struggles opening and the problem seems to have got worse from 2 or so months ago when&nbsp; last
 tried to using it. I use file explorer everyday, just that as I said, it can be slow only AT TIMES opening a folder on partition or external drive with lots of data, esp. the folders with films. I just wonder if there's a way to speed it up. If the PC is struggling
 to open a DVD or DVD folder, at that time of course it holds up the PC a bit esp. opening other folders. As soon as I forcibly eject, everything runs normally. So reading DVD seems to create a problem. The problem is not with the diverse data DVD's tried as
 they are all mostly new &amp; OK, not damaged.</li></ul>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>In all these years, I have always installed only <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="K-Lite Codec Pack 14.7.9 beta">
K-Lite Codec Pack</a> from free-codecs.com, which has actually served me well and approved by diverse German IT/Internet/PC magazines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be a problem? I have always used it on diverse gadgets in the last at least 6, 7 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Ccleaner, well I do not actually use it much, and wanted to more or less emphasize the slowness has nothing to do with accumulated junk like temporary files, etc, which I get rid of in an enlightened way, regularly defragment hdd, hardly have anything
 in Task manager =&gt; Startup ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly could be wrong with Ccleaner from **** if I may ask? I refer again to respectable German IT magazines/sites, such as chip.de, pc-welt.de, http://pc-magazin.de/, http://pc-magazin.de/ which recommend it for such tasks like cleaning up
 junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I know, because I have installed/updated it probably hundreds of times for myself &amp; friends, that at least for years, they no longer try to even offer unconnected software during installation. A couple of months ago, it was in the news though,
 possibly after being taken over by another company (possibly Avast?) and they wanted to change some ways in which it operates, which was immediately noted and widely reported this end at least. They either wanted to anonymously send some data or added some
 function they had to withdraw in a subsequent update because readers were alerted.</p>
<p>Would be good to know exactly what the problem with it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

</p><p>This quite sinister ... and I do not know what to think about it. This is the first time I can access this content since my post, before your [<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4bfab9a6-b25c-4e39-93a7-ef1d264db942" title="Igor Leyko">Igor
 Leyko</a>] second response, which I saw, but could not reply to as ALL my content became suddenly inaccessible when I tried to respond to your post.</p>
<p>I was suddenly getting page not found 404 page errors, not only when trying to access that very post but was shocked to find ALL but 2 of my 59 posts in my profile, since 2012 where accessible. I assumed all had been deleted and had given up ever seeing
 it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subsequent attempts to try and post again that and the following days, hoping it was a temporary server error where in vain. If I tried to submit ANYTHING, the submit button immediately got deactivated.<br />
I tried this on different PCs/networks/Chrome instead of Firefox and even a different account I normally do not use,
<strong>including today </strong>to ´make a new post under a different account asking about this strange behavior. The button freezes and the page does nothing more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This below is what I tried to post after having given up after around 4 March ... hoping it would work again under a different account today after had failed about a week ago. May be someone can help me understand this, as the submit button froze again,
 just shown as shown in screenshot below, made a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know yet, whether I can make new posts under this account after they failed since then, but was surprised today "replying" to a foreign post, although off topic worked, which made me try my post and was able to hopefully REPLY, if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was quite surprised to see this very post, after getting page not found errors for ALL my previous post since the last post above:</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I don't think it runs dependant on games, I would assume it counts from a time signed in and a game launched?</p>
<p>I've not been able to test the features myself but here's something that might help if you're having the issue still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Remove the account from the xbox (https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - Clear the cache by performing a powercycle on the console (https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - Add the account back to the Xbox using the first link I provided and see if that helps to clear up the issue.</p>

            I’m pretty sure the reason it doesn’t work in some games like Fifa is because you do not need to sign into them with your account. It only registers when you log in with the account that has scree limits. Unfortunately, some kids know this and that’s what
 they do.

    <title>Can I upgrade OEM win 10 home to Pro and then transfer to a new build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jastgop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I upgrade OEM win 10 home to Pro and then transfer to a new build PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I bought a laptop 5 years ago which came with win 8.1 OEM installed. I did the free upgrade to win 10 home when this came available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have built my own PC with new components, but I'm aware that I can't transfer the win 10 home license as it is OEM and linked to the hardware of the old laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I was wondering, is if I upgrade the win 10 home to win 10 pro via the windows store on my old laptop, will this allow me to then transfer the win 10 pro license to my new build PC, or will this license continue to be linked solely to the existing laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that makes sense.</p>

            Hi, Jastgop,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor and will assist you.
<br />
<br />No,  you will not be able to use the Windows 10 Pro license on other than the original device. It is not transferable to a new pc.

<p>Thanks for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm reading that last paragraph as saying that by upgrading home to pro, I'm effectively converting an oem license to a retail license and can therefore transfer it to another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that sound right?<br />

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />If you plan to purchase an upgrade pack and transfer it to another computer, as a Microsoft MVP I can confirm that it doesn't carry transfer rights. It is bind to the first computer.
<br />
<br />As far as the underlying license is concerned, Microsoft says there are always exceptions. You might even be able to transfer an OEM license to another computer, provided there is no misuse(However, most of the licenses cannot).
<br />
<br />After changing motherboards, see if the activation troubleshooter helps you, if not contact support.

            <p>Hey there Guzman ws34.<br /><br />For rentals you have 14-days to watch the movie, once the movie is started you have 24 hours to watch the movie as many times as you want. Thanks for your understanding and if you have any other Xbox support questions please let us know.</p>
