<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist, it would seem the question is if it's possible to purchase Xbox live gold with a gift card. It is possible to purchase a Xbox Live gold subscription using a gift card.&nbsp;To make the purchase feel free to head
 on over to our <a href="http://microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">website</a> and check out our store.&nbsp;For further assistance I suggest contacting customer support. I hope the information was helpful, please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

            To clarify ... what you'd do is use that gift card on the Microsoft Store website to buy a prepaid Xbox Live Gold membership card. You cannot subscribe to Gold using account funds, however.

<p>Hello PerkyTortoise80,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. In the past, customers were not able to complete a purchase for Xbox Live Gold using the currency on their account. The customer would have to purchase an Xbox Live Gold prepaid code with the currency on
 their account and redeem the code. Recently, this method of&nbsp;purchasing an Xbox Live Gold subscription&nbsp;has been changed. Customers are now able to complete a purchase for Xbox Live Gold by using the currency on their account. We hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Is it possible to have my computer in English and my keyboard layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> naomi791  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to have my computer in English and my keyboard layout in a different language&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently installed Windows 10 on my laptop which has a Swiss French keyboard. I want to have everything on my laptop in English (UK), but to have the keyboard layout in Swiss French. I used to have Windows 7 and it worked with that. But with Windows
 10, when I change the keyboard layout to French default, and restart my computer, everything else (the menu, settings, Office, etc.) also changes to French.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can do now is to have English as the default language, which means that each time I restart my laptop I have to manually change the keyboard language back to French. Is there any way around this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I solved the problem!!</p>
<p>Add a french keyboard to the English language setting by clicking on options, add a keyboard, and then remove the english keyboard.</p>

<h2>            I repeatedly keep getting kicked off&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Just recently Every time I sign into XBL, I am able to stay connect for 2-5 minutes then I get the error "Disconnect from Xbox Live". When I attempt to reconnect it fails, which then tells me to check my connection. After checking my connection (which everything
 connects fine),I am then able to reconnect, but the vicious cycle begins AGAIN!!!</p>
<p>I have already reset my router, modem and Xbox Sytem Cache multiple times and still NO LUCK!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated! THANKS!!!</p>

<p>Try to connect with the Turtle beach headset fully unplugged as they cause a lot of wireless interference due to the fact they broadcast over all 11 wireless channels. &nbsp;The solution if this works is to move the usb reciever as far from your console as you
 can or seperate the reciever and the console with a reflective surface.&nbsp; As for the wired connection the issue may be in the router what router/gateway/modem are you using as I'm not 100% the issue is fully the headset but it could be a factor, my final thought
 here is have you done any port forwarding or DMZ'ed your console?</p>

<p>Before we go ahead and undo your initial set-up, have you tried what <strong>Barb Bowman</strong> suggested you to do? If not, you might want to talk with your School District's IT Department for the Microsoft Office 365 Business account that you're using
 for other options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have talked to them and still want your device to use a personal Microsoft Account, you might also want to take a look at these suggestions before resetting your device:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since you already have created a User Account for your work email that has access to your Microsoft Office 365 Business account, we suggest that you create another User Account that has Administrator privileges as a personal account that you can also use
 to log-in on your device. For the Microsoft Office apps, you can also use your own and install it on the new User Account that you'd be creating.<br />
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Here's how to create a Microsoft Account using a new Outlook.com email address that you can use when you create another User Account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to https://login.live.com and tap or click <strong>Create one!<br />
</strong></li><li>Since you're going to create a new Outlook.com email address, tap or click <strong>
Get a new email address</strong>.</li><li>Fill out the rest of the form, and then tap or click <strong>Create account</strong>.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Once you're done creating your personal Microsoft Account, here's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/security-sign-in-and-accounts/all-about-accounts?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined#HowdoW10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>how to add an account to your Surface</strong></a> and to know more about the account types that you can have on your device.<strong><br />
</strong></li><li>Now that you created a personal Microsoft Account and User Account on your device, for the Microsoft Office applications you may now go ahead and install it on the new User Account<strong>.</strong></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. You may also not add a New User account on your device and just click on
<strong>Switch Users</strong> on the Microsoft Office 365 application that you're using to toggle between your work and personal Microsoft Accounts. However, on your device it'll still use your work email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. If you think having two User Accounts is unsuitable and still want to undo your initial set-up, we recommend that you thoroughly follow the steps in this support article,

<h2>            Get error &#34;Can&#39;t read from the source file or disk&#34; when trying to copy mp3 files from CD to my hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought an audio book which came on 6 separate mp3 CDs.&nbsp; In order to get them onto my phone I want to copy them to my PC and then across to my phone.&nbsp; Out of the 6 CDs, 4 are fine and copy without problem to my hard drive.&nbsp; However, I'm having problems
 with some of the tracks on a couple of the&nbsp;remaining&nbsp;2&nbsp;CDs.&nbsp; When I try to copy the affected tracks&nbsp;the pop-up box showing the progress stays at 0% for between 5 and 10 minutes and then another pop-up box appears which says "Can't read from the source file
 or disk".&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;got a replacement set of discs from the CD manufacturer and the exact same thing happened with exactly the same mp3 tracks (i.e. CDs 1, 3, 4 and 5 are fine, but certain mp3 files on CDs 2 and 6 won't copy and give the same error message as before).&nbsp; I
 contacted the CD manufacturer again and the say there hasn't been any reported problems with these CDs.&nbsp; This is very strange because there is nothing about the affected mp3 tracks which marks them as different to the unaffected tracks.&nbsp; All tracks are&nbsp;between
 1 to&nbsp;3 MB in size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine if the problem was my PC or its operating system (Windows 8.1) I tried the CDs on my neighbour's PC which runs Windows Vista.&nbsp; To my surprise it worked fine on his PC.&nbsp; So, following the instructions that the CD manufacturer's helpline suggested,&nbsp;I&nbsp;used
 his PC to copy the entire contents of the problematic&nbsp;CDs to a blank DVD.&nbsp; I then inserted the DVD copy into my PC and it was able to read the mp3 tracks without any problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it seems that there is nothing wrong with the underlying mp3 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so I am really puzzled!&nbsp; How can my PC read the copied mp3 tracks without any problems, but it is unable to read the same mp3 tracks on the original mp3 CDs produced by the manufacturer?&nbsp; Could it be that the original mp3 CD is not compatible with Windows
 8.1?&nbsp; Or could it be that there is something wrong with my DVD drive (I used the same DVD drive to read both the original mp3 CDs and the DVD copy)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any help you can give.</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.This issue occurs due to specific DVD files which works fine on other computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This can also happen with possible Bad Sectors on HD:<br />
You may possibly have some bad sectors on the hard drive, which is causing the problem. In this case, you should scan the hard drive using a tool like chkdsk. If there are any errors, it will go ahead and fix them.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Another possible reason for the error could be that the file name is something that Windows does not recognize and therefore gives you an error. One example is if the file just ends in a dot, like mytestfile. Try to rename the file and see if that makes any
 difference. <br />
You may have to go into DOS and rename the file there if you are unable to do so in Windows.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would also suggest you to manually try copying each file. This will make sure that most of the files are copied leaving only those files in the corrupt sector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status. We will be glad to assist you further for any issues or queries.</p>

            <p>Hi Sneha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time&nbsp;reply to my post. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the chkdsk utility but it didn't find any errors on my hard drive.&nbsp; Also, the file name isn't causing the problem because my system is able to read the affected files fine from the copied CD/DVD disc that I created on my neighbour's computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of manually copying each file, do you mean using Windows Explorer to copy an individual file from the CD disc to my hard drive?&nbsp; If so, I have already tried that and the same problem occurs.&nbsp; But as I said, there is no problem doing this with the
 'copied' CD/DVD disc that I created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was wondering if there are any reported problems where an mp3 CD sold by a manufacturer is not&nbsp; compatible with Windows 8.1 but is compatible with other operating systems, e.g. Windows Vista?&nbsp; The reason I ask is because it seems strange that my Windows
 8.1 PC is able to read other the other 4 mp3 CDs fine, but is unable to read some of the mp3 files on the remaining 2 mp3 CDs.&nbsp; However, my PC is able to read exactly the same problematic mp3 files from the copied CD/DVD that I created on my neighbour's Windows
 Vista PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, could it be something wrong with my CD/DVD drive?&nbsp; I'm not too&nbsp;convinced that this is the problem because it is able to read the copied discs fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Kevin.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thank you for posting back and I appreciate your response.</p>
<p>The CD might be damaged or dirty. Some drives can handle such CDs better than others, so it is perfectly possible that one drive can still read the CD, while others don't. That is the reason that you were able to read it from windows vista system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try reading it from any other Windows 8 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cant, then it might be the case wherein mp3 is not&nbsp; compatible with Windows 8.1 but is compatible with other operating systems.

    <title>Black screen of DOOM - Store Hang HELP&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhilashmridha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen of DOOM - Store Hang HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soo... today I updated windows to Build 1809 and as usual after the update is completed, I was about to sign in for the first time. I signed in and I was supposed to be greeted by some personalize setting stuff.. but instead BEHOLD the black screen
 of doom. My screen flashed a few times as if it was updating my graphic driver or something and then... the system became unresponsive, I had to press the reset button on my pc. I figured that it was something related to the smart screen so I somehow managed
 to disable it. Finally fixed that, then I went on to install some apps from the Store. It opened up just fine no lag or anything, I searched for the app I needed (So far so good) I clicked it (still fine) then I clicked Install (RIP) again the black screen
 of doom. But the thing is it flashes a few times before it hangs, in that time I can move my mouse so if I manage to close Store or minimize it, the flashing stops I open it again and it again starts. Not just that I decided to ask help on the "Ask Help" app...
 well it was loading (you know the circle of dots) then suddenly the same thing happened. I managed to minimize it the flashes stopped. I opened it again and RIP PC hang. I actually feel like when I open something which needs you to login to your Microsoft
 account this happens... this didn't happen before the update idk what the hell happened. So, I figured that the only option is to ask here. Guys please help (sorry for the stupid jokes :P). Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I did try again with Smart Screen ON.</p>

            Would you like to update to 1809 which fixes many things. (You can always revert back to previous version within 10 days, if you don't like)
<br />
<br />You should upgrade to 1809 manually to have a successful upgrade. To upgrade to 1809, you should do following -
<br />
<br />A. Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Uninstall any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can install it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />You can press Update Now
<br />If update now is not successful, then best method is manual method which is below.
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10

            I am already updated to 1809... just did it recently. Though this problem existed before that but it didn't get fixed either. Whenever a Microsoft account sign up shows up this happens. I guess this issue is not restricted to Store.

<h2>            Problem with Media Player, Itunes, Spotify, etc, playing music files.</h2>
                    Windows Media Player, the new Music App, Spotify... I even downloaded iTunes to try. NOTHING played the music files. Windows Media Player just showed a red "x" next to any file attempted. ITunes, Spotify, and others just never start when you click on play.
 The play starts and stops without any movement of the slider or time. <br />
<br />
The audio did work with some programs. Like Windows Live Movie Maker, when I imported a music file to make a video it plays fine. All the OS sounds worked fine. The internet audio all worked fine. Yet none of the standard music programs would play any files.
 NOTHING seemed to work.<br />
<br />
It was the audio drivers the whole time! I never had any drivers partially work, with some programs and not others, like that before.
<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing this issue?<br />
<br />
Never the less, I was able to re-install the drivers to get it to work.<br />
<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An announcement was made last July 1, 2017, regarding Skype enabled devices or platforms that are no longer supported. Apparently, Windows RT is one of the platforms that are no longer supported. For more information regarding this change, please refer to
 this <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa34763/which-skype-enabled-devices-or-platforms-are-no-longer-supported" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a>. You can still use <strong><a href="http://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Web</a></strong> to access your account. The reason for the change is because Skype has been transitioning from a peer-to-peer architecture
 to a cloud infrastructure. <span>Moving to the cloud ensures that Skype features such as group video calling, audio, and chat are available when you want them. For the complete information regarding the announcement, kindly refer to this
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12381/what-does-it-mean-that-skype-is-moving-from-peer-to-peer-to-the-cloud?q=july+1+no+longer+be+able+to+sign+in+to+these+version+of+skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello Fausto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 may have encountered a system conflict or a power option configuration that caused this. For us to help you with your concern, we'd like to ask a few questions for clarification:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you encounter this issue after updating your Windows 10 1607?</li><li>Aside from the updates, have you made any recent changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of your power option settings?</li><li>Have you encountered a pending update prompt?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, kindly check if <strong>a restart has been scheduled</strong> option is set. Go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update and Security &gt; Windows Update</strong>. Disable that option and restart the computer. We also suggest that

<p>HI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied the fix for power and unfortunately I couldn't take a picture but what it did was to change:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) My power plan to "high performance" </p>
<p>2) Changed the time to go to sleep and showed "time to sleep too long".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a picture of the bottom of the update history so you can see since when this has been happening, a picture of the power options and&nbsp; a picture of the update status so you can see the pending update messages I get every day, it usually says that I
 have to reboot to install the version 1607 but I see new two things today (the "KB2267602," and I think the "Feature Update to Windows 10, version 1709).</p>
<p>

<p>OK, this is what happened after I followed the instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I realized not only the version 1607 was being installed improperly and attempting to reinstall over and over again, this also happened along with the 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I downloaded the "Windows Update Troubleshooter" which supposedly fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) This didn't work because the version 1607 is still not capable to work on my computer (keeps failing), so I had to "hide" the update for 1607 and install the version 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Now the problem is that the version 1709 keeps installing over and over again, I already restarted my computer 3 times today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My final resolution after a month of daily undesired reboots and considering this started happening because of an update that was forced to be installed in my computer is, I'm going to block also the update for version 1709 and every incoming updates because
 the user experience feels not stable and I fear this keeps affecting my progress in other tasks.</p>

<p>Thank you for all the details that you've provided. We understand that the version 1709 update is also offering the update repeatedly like what you described on version 1607. Since you've decided to block the future updates for stability, we do not want

    <title>do these virus scans and defragmentation clash&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            do these virus scans and defragmentation clash&#63;</h2>
                    (This only happened once...quite some time ago so i can't remember the minute details...and i just want to make sure...)<br />
<br />
my friend recommended that i should defragment my computer.<br />
<br />
so for the VERY 1st time, i decided to leave my computer to defragment overnight. at the same time, i decided to run a norton 360 virus scan.<br />
<br />
when i woke up the next day and checked my computer, defragmentation was NOT completed (i'm not sure if it halted or it hasn't finished defragmenting, but i left it to defragment for 10hrs+ and i'm SURE it should've finished defragmenting after 10hrs+) and
 norton 360 virus scan halted at a certain file (i can't remember what file it was).<br />
<br />
does this happen when you run a virus scan and defragment at the same time? or should i be concerned that it is some virus/computer problem?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
In short, what you saw is not a problem. Running both simultaneously should not be a problem as they have differing priority levels (meaning one should not interfere with the other). It is normal to still see some fragmentation after a defrag routine completes,
 as not all files can be moved.<br />
<br />
The only thing I would be concerned with is the file that your Norton software halted on. That normally only happens when it has either detected a possible infected file, or it is looking for confirmation from the user.

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description I understand that you are facing issues with the&nbsp;Bluetooth. I will certainly help you with this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There could be several reasons for causing this issue. Like corrupted drivers, third-party application conflict or incorrect device settings. Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Try to run the </span></strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Hardware troubleshooter</span></strong></a> and check

<p>
</p><p><span>If the above troubleshooter doesn’t help, then try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Try to uninstall the Bluetooth drivers from Device Manager as well as from Control panel.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, follow the steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span>5. Click on <strong><span>show hidden devices</span></strong> under View menu Tab.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Expand all the nods under device manager<strong><span>.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>7. There would be many greyed out entries in device manager.</span></p>
<p><span>8. <strong><span>Right-click</span></strong> on every <strong><span>greyed out entries
</span></strong>under all the nods and then click on <strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>.</span></p>

    <title>USB HDD&#58; IN BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajaysakthivel1  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB HDD&#58;       IN BIOS</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys so today I was reinstalling my operating system in Windows 10, when I went to reinstall windows I had to change the boot order in the bios, I saw an option called 'USB HDD : (NAME OF MY USB), I clicked on it and successfully reinstalled the operating
 system, however, after I removed my USB drive I went back and checked my bios and to my surprise there was an option called' USB HDD:' but there was no name after the columns, I was wondering how this got there, I know hdd stands for hard disk drive but doesn't
 that have to be a physical storage? I had no USB inserted at the time. I was wondering whether this option is normal as it doesn't have any name after it, or it is undercover malware as I have heard of malware persisting on the bios, it was also number 7 in
 the boot order</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated&nbsp; thanks</p>

            Hi AJAY, in modern BIOS (UEFI) it is normal to have USB devices listed, such as USB HDD without  drive being plugged in.
<br />
<br />In older Legacy BIOS, a drive would have to be plugged in for it to be listed in BIOS, but not no londer . . .

<h2>            Skype History Question</h2>
                    <p>A while back I made an account for my phone, I had one for PC already but had an question I just couldn't find an answer for back then.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I talk to a friend of mine fairly often via Skype on desktop, so we have a ton of messages coming through. How long does Skype on mobile hold messages for? I don't want it to take up to much space. If it doesn't store the messages like my PC does, I can
 simply move it over to my phone and ditch the phone only version of it. </p>
<p><br />
If it does store all the messages forever like on Desktop, is there a way to remove them?

                    When playing I get kicked off game randomly, very aggravating. I have already ran trouble shoot for windows to clear up conflicting problems within system. Also checked for any possible virus problems none detected. Windows has a message that it is conflicting
 and has fixed the problems but problem consists.

<h2>            Surface Book 2 13.5-in Battery Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my newly purchased surface book 2 's battery drains out in 3-4 hours. I was not playing games nor heavily using it for movies or 3d modelling. It was just normal light tasks like camera, sketchable and Adobe PDF. This happens even on laptop mode. Since
 I found this looks like a technical problem from the Microsoft, I tried many times to seek help online. Yet I kept receiving error pages when I tried scheduling repairs online. latest error code was this: afDglskCckqm9Bjv.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there is no physical and official stores in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help..!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>
<p>

<p>in 3 hours (did you use the screen disconnected from the keyboard? <br />
And if it´s heavy use like chrome/programs and on high brightness etc, I think it´s not too bad. If you did not use it disconnected from the keyboard, then something might be wrong because it only shows battery 1 (screen) on capacity remaining.&nbsp;<br />

both batteries are hooked&nbsp;up again.&nbsp;<br />
Since there´s 2 batteries and the keyboard base is the biggest one by far, it seems that there´s nothing wrong depending on how you are using it and with what settings

            For the first scenario yes i was using with the screen detached. however i have already switched off the wifi, tuned to suggested brightness, with battery saver on,no chrome, only camera and sketchable and bluetooth. I think this is pretty standard usage.
 Yet if i could not run it for more than three hours, it is very incovenient as a pad.&nbsp;

<p>Ok I see. I don´t have a SB2 so I´m not sure how well it performs with the battery.</p>
<p>However since battery 1 capacity is 18k and battery2 in the keyboard is 6-70k (?) and the total MAX battery time is 17.5 hours (brand new with wifi and automatic brightness, no programs etc), then I don´t think it´s weird when you´re only using battery1
 which is several times weaker and lasts 3 hours with using apps. As I said I´m no expert but it seems okey&nbsp; to me, correct me if I´m wrong :)</p>

<p>I see what you mean. But laptop mode only gives me 5-6 hours. which means there is something wrong with my battery or the battery consumption as it is way below 17 hours.</p>

<p>You might want to revisit where you saw the 17 hour number and see exactly what it says.&nbsp; My non-Surface system uses around 12 % - 15 % per hour (estimation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That number does vary, depending on how you use your system, and you might watch the battery on the taskbar and check what it shows a time left.&nbsp; It does give estimates based on your current activity.</p>

<p>17 hours is in various marketing materials. If you look closely at the itty bitty print the Surface Book 2 was set up in battery saver mode. I noticed this as well when I first got mine but I learned that the out-of-the-box setup isn't exactly battery optimized.
 (1) Start with your power settings (in the task bar on the right) moving the slider to the left buys you time pretty quickly with barely noticeable changes in performance for non-gaming. (2) lower the brightness of the screen. (3) If you have one with the
 discrete GPU check tp see if you are using it for Windows. I only turn it on for games and 3D model programs. It's a pig. (4) Using the WiFi is another battery killer - OneDrive constantly updating takes a big toll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After playing around, I get about 8 hours of normal usage. To get the 17, the screen is just too dim for my old eyes. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>
