<h2>            Upgraded to Visio 2016 - Some Fill Patterns no longer applied in existing drawings</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Visio 2010 to Visio 2016. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open in Visio 2016 a drawing I had created using Visio 2010, some of my custom pattern fills are showing, others are not. &nbsp;When I click on the shapes that are now empty (no pattern fill applied) and use the Fill &gt; Pattern Fill &gt; Pattern dropdown,
 the name of the custom Pattern Fill I had applied when I created the drawing initially does still show as the applied Pattern, but it isn't actually being applied to the shape. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some shapes do have my patterns applied correctly. &nbsp;Whether or not a pattern is being applied seems to be specific to the particular custom pattern - the missing patterns are the same couple of patterns and are always missing, while the patterns that are
 showing correctly are showing on all shapes I had applied them to. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: &nbsp; &nbsp;For each of the Patterns that are not showing up in my drawings, I just went into Drawing Explorer, right-clicked on the Pattern name, then went to Edit Pattern Shape. &nbsp;The Patterns seem to be just as when I created them... &nbsp; the images I used
 to create them are there... &nbsp;everything looks fine. &nbsp; They just won't appear in my drawings when I use them on a Shape. &nbsp; No error messages - the Shapes just remain empty even though the Pattern is applied. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi PhoenixRoger，</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; some of my custom pattern fills are showing, others are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this issue only occur to the particular drawing orginating from Visio 2013?
<br />
How about creating a new drawing with custom pattern fills in Visio 2016? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, please try openning the drawing on another computer to see if the issue persits, which might be helpful to narrow down the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,<br />
Yuki Sun</p>

            <p>Hi Yuki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have another computer with Visio to see if this behavior persists, but will try to find someone with one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, based on your other suggestion, I have discovered additional information....</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Visio 2016, I opened a new blank drawing, created a new rectangle shape, and filled it with one of the custom pattern fills that was not working in my drawings that I had created earlier using Visio 2010. &nbsp;The pattern did fill the shape as it should (although
 the tiled-fills seem to have a different size to the pattern repeating of the tile within the fill). &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Then I went back to one of my drawings created using 2010 and copied one of the shapes that are formatted with a custom pattern but does not appear to have the pattern applied. &nbsp; I then went back to my new 2016 blank drawing and pasted that shape taken from
 the 2010 drawing into the new 2016 drawing. &nbsp; Without doing any formatting at all, the pasted shape appeared to be filled with the custom pattern as it should. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went back to my drawing I had created using 2010 and noticed a very small amount of pattern fill was in one corner of a shape that should be filled entirely with a custom pattern fill. &nbsp; I then copied five shapes that were supposed to be custom pattern
 filled (but didn't seem to be) and placed them on a new blank sheet in the same 2010 drawing they were created in. &nbsp; &nbsp;Here they are: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30ecdd59-227b-4b40-96dd-b2500b94357b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30ecdd59-227b-4b40-96dd-b2500b94357b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then zoomed 4000% into the bottom left corner of one of these shapes. &nbsp; Here is a corner of one of them at 4000% zoom:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de7549cc-05a2-4939-863c-e2f1ae470366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de7549cc-05a2-4939-863c-e2f1ae470366" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, my custom pattern is actually there in a very small area of each of the shapes they should completely fill. &nbsp;(I did not notice this earlier because all of these shapes are positioned on my drawings with other shapes in front of and overlapping
 sections of them. &nbsp;It was only when I moved them into a blank sheet by themselves that I noticed the small fill in the corners).<br />
</p>
<p>I cannot simply copy/paste the total content of all of my sheets created in 2010 into new drawings in 2016 because they are too complicated and become total nonsense when I paste them. &nbsp;I also have many hundreds of drawings created in 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now that I know they are there, I can't figure out how to get my custom patterns to fill the whole area of the shapes they actually are applied to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

    <title>Can&#39;t delete a folder in tasks side bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gberkson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t delete a folder in tasks side bar</h2>
                    When I imported by tasks from Entourage into Outlook, a master folder called To Do List appeared on the left side bar directly under the master folder Tasks which was created by Outlook. Since this To Do List folder is useless, especially when syncing
 to iCal for syncing to my iPhone, I would like to delete. However, it doesn't want to be deleted. If I mark Tasks and check the Edit menu, Delete is active. However, if I choose To Do List and check the Edit menu, Delete is grayed out.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Or do I have everything on the wrong foot: is To Do List the Outlook default and Tasks what was created by the Entourage import?</div>
                </div>

            This could be a symptom of a larger issue that we've seen about importing from Entourage.
<div><br />
<div>In some cases folks have imported settings that are enabled in Entourage but not available at all in Outlook. Since Outlook uses much of the code from Entourage it is honoring these legacy settings.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The To Do folder would be a legacy folder that you can't delete from Entourage.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I suggest you ignore it if it doesn't bother you too much. You can try to rebuild your Outlook database to see if that may correct the issue but I'm not sure it will.&nbsp;Launch Outlook with the
<b>Option</b> key held down. This will launch the Database Utility application. Select the default identity and rebuild it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</div>

            Viber has no plans to release on the 5xx devices. You should contact the development team at Skype to ask them if they are working on it.<br />
<br />
You may want to consider upgrading to a Nokia Lumia WP8 device instead as both are available for those.

    <title>Printing Excel Docs with Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mckenziekuck0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing Excel Docs with Mac</h2>
                    So I have recently acquired a job where I have to use excel on a regular basis. I am not very familiar with excel and I'm not very great on my mac book either so forgive me found sounding a little dumb. Whenever I try to print an excel page I just get
 a spinning wheel and then my excel document closes out stating that there is an error. I was having problems sending excel and word documents for a while until the tech guy at work played with it and now it finally works so I can at least send my documents.
 It is becoming a huge problem not being able to print them though. Just wondering if anyone out there knows why this would be happening. The tech guy at my work isn't familiar with macs so its hard to get to the bottom of this. Any advise would be appreciated!&nbsp;

<p>Hi Mckenziekuck0,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To investigate this issue, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Do other Office applications have the same issue when printing? Is the issue related to all worksheets no matter they are stored in local or cloud?
</p>
<p>2. Do other non-Office applications have the same issue? Make sure the issue is only related to Office apps.
</p>
<p>3. When you print a file, select to print as PDF. See if the issue occurs without printing with printer.
</p>
<p>4. If it's convenient, connect your Mac to another printer. Check the outcome.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
        </p>

    <title>N82 with many problems, but can not update firmware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jertberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            N82 with many problems, but can not update firmware</h2>
                    I live in Madagascar and just bought a N82 from a store here. Once I got it home I was going to ungrade the phones firmware (right now it is V 10.0.046 01-04-08 RM-313 Nokia N82 (07.02)) and the product code is 0522378. First I can not find the product
 code on any for the list of product codes for a N82.<br />
List of problems:<br />
-waln scanning is off and will not come on.<br />
-Map will not come (it will flash w's on the globe and then say "connection failed")<br />
-I can not restore factory settings because the passward is not 12345<br />
-My menu is not like other N82 menus. some things are missing (ex. in the tools I have no connectivity setting) I think that is one.<br />
-In games I only have "puzzle" and "magicsushi" no N-gage<br />
-Camara quality seems very low<br />
-when I hook up the usb it says "usb charger connected" and it really charges the phone (suprising to me because all the post I have see says it will not charge from the usb.<br />
after it says "usb charger connected" it gives a menu "Mass storage, webcam, or COM port" nothing about Nokia Nseries PC Suite. Nokia Nseries PC Suite will not find my phone in any of the 3 settings. Nokia Nseries PC Suite will see it in bluetooth only. but
 in bluetooth I can not upgrade firmware.<br />
I would love to upgrade the firmware. BUT how can I if the USB is not working. How can you check to see which s40 or s60 software is on. I know that it should be s60. But I have heard that the usb charger only worked with a few s40 phones? But why does it work
 with mine? Why are the menus different? Were is my product code from? I have loaded and reloaded Nokia Nseries PC Suite many times still same problem. Have used both XP and vista (but know XP is better)<br />
I have tried the hard reset with Green key+*+3+power and it does not work.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Man of Many problems<br />

            The phone is certainly a fake. It is not made by nokia, does not contain nokia parts and does not have a nokia operating system.<br />
<br />
No current nokia's give the option "webcam" or "COM port" when you connect them by USB.<br />
<br />
You need to return it to the retailer and get a refund.

            Jertberg, why are you asking me why i think the phone is a fake/clone at everythingn82, i told you here as well as there.<br />
<br />
I'd stop wasting time posting here and there and i'd get to the shop that sold you it and get your money back.

            I managed to brick my device with an hour of owning it.. switched it into dev mode in which case it warned me it would reboot... it crashed, tried to reboot and never started again..<br />
<br />
fffff...<br />
they've not made the firmware version's available for download (like they did for the N900) because there are like 100 variants and the files are HUGE (1.4gb + 1.1gb for a single phone restore!)<br />
<br />
I'm going to work on my USB flasher toolkit that people here have used.. You'd be able to flash either by booting your machine from a USB memory stick, or from using vmware-player (which is free to download)<br />
<br />
This is how I repaired my device.<br />
<br />
(on a side note, I think my device is actually defective, it reboots almost consistently and all the stock nokia apps crash regularly, can't even open contacts consistently anymore :( ) so in your case, it might be worth a trip to nokia.. your device may actually
 be faulty<br />

            Your phone clearly has serious issues and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets replaced cpitchford.<br />
<br />
Btw, my phone does not vibrate 3 times when powerbutton is depressed for 8 seconds, but it turns off and acts normally otherwise.<br />
<br />
Does anyone actually get the 3 quick buzzes doing the 8 second press?

<p>seems like I have found mates here..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dead Device: Well, I just left it to Nokia, they said it requires high level repair and returned me today after 2 days telling that SW is updated. But another f ing problem has come, in Nokia Care it didn't detected my Sim, Nokia Care people used their sim
 and that worked, I bought a new replacement sim card and inserted and it worked for few hours. Now phone says... No Sim Card. I have 5 holidays ahead and everything is closed here in middle east. You can imagine my anger!! I am actually **bleep** off and thinking
 to sue them on the first working day next week if they are not returning my money or replacing the device. Consumer courts here are pretty good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flasher:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flashier is not an easy part for people like me, I tried doing it but since the actual N9 flasher is not availble, I couldn't do it. Other methods are bit tricky for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vibration/Battery LED issue:</p>
<p>Yes, this problem is with me, If i press my botton for 8s, it doesn't vibrate 3 times but turns off. Another issue you may have noticed, the charging light doesn't blink and doesn't lit up after fully charge, I have to check it throught settings if my battery
 is charged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What bother me a lot, I bought 64GB Black Version on the first day of release by paying CASH, even they were not accepting the credit card... i choosed it over Glaxy, iPhone etc. but extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia shouldn't have released a device which is faulty, or at least fixed it for us. The people who used to come and see my N9, now come to laugh at me!!!</p>

            Not every N9 is faulty and Nokia does however not have any much higher rates generally than others. People has issues with their device no matter what make/brand it is.<br />
<br />
However, I don't think a reflash of the device would work, but you never know. I guess it's a bigger chance that there is something wrong with the hardware of your device, unfortunately.

<p>Probalby you are right but disappointment comes with every new faulty device, regardless how much I was previously happy with Nokia.</p>

<p>I miss my N8 which I had gifted to my younger brother... earlier I had iPhone which I gifted to someone else too. After N8, I was extremely impressed with Nokia and became loyal customer and yes,&nbsp;I was thinking to buy Lumia 800 too.</p>

            Fender is right.. I think we're s.o.o.l here :(<br />
<br />
Unless I can get mine serviced here, I have to send it abroad.. and that's a proper pain in the..<br />
<br />
If they return it having "flashed the software" I'm going to be nothing short of angry..<br />
<br />
Nokia are notorious when it comes to intermittent error. They simply do not investigate the problem.. If it is anything like the N900 it'll go:<br />
<br />
1) reflashed firmware, returned to owner<br />
2) reflashed firmware, returned to owner<br />
3) beyond economic repair, returned to owner<br />
<br />
They did that for many users who had owned their phones for days..<br />
<br />
Which product code is your phone? Does it end in 1V4 (you can find it by pulling out the sim tray and reading it from the white stick on the back of the tray) It seems Austrian 64GB devices are having problems..<br />
<br />
The problem I'm facing is waiting for PR1.1 for a fix.. the N900 was horrifically unreliable for many users until the first firmware update.. There was a software fix that worked around the problem, but it was ultimately fixed in the next version.. and this
 type of stuff is pretty much the same..<br />
<br />
its interesting, but at the same time, tricky

            I have no problem understanding that you're disappointed and frustrated due to this happening. Of course this shouldn't happen and it's never fun for the person who experience this.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this will always happen for someone, but the majority gets working devices.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't give up yet and get a new one. I totally love this device. It's a fresh breath in todays cellphone market.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do mate, I hope you get satisfied!<br />
<br />
I remember I had a similar experience when getting the N95 8 gb. What a disappointment when sending it back for replacement. Well, the shop actually had to have it inspected at a repair shop. I ended up waiting 2 months for it... Worst case kind of. After that
 I have gone straigt to the care point my self to fix it, if not I ask for a report on the device state and bring it back to the shop demanding a new one.

            Hi Afi1392,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you cannot open a file received in outlook, which is stored in OneDrive for Business. I would like to suggest you check the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Let others send&nbsp; emails with other files stored in local drive and check if you can open it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Let others send&nbsp; emails with other files stored in OneDrive for Business and check if the issue persists.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Besides, please provide the information below:<br />
1. Where does the sender store the file attached in emails? Local drive or OneDrive for Business?<br />
2. Does the issue occur to one specific file or all files attached in emails?<br />
3. Detailed steps and related screenshots about how you open the file "showing 1drv.ms" and any error message you encounter.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your conversation history is saved on the cloud for the last 30 days which you can access across supported platforms whenever you sign in to Skype. Any history that is more than 30 days would be saved on your device's local drive according to your history
 settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Skype for Windows desktop, you may check <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA392/how-do-i-manage-my-conversation-history-in-skype-for-windows-desktop?q=conversation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>
 on how you can manage your conversation history, however, this does not apply to Skype for Android since the Android Skype app does not have native history settings which you can set unlike Skype for Windows desktop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Danida,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. Unfortunately, you haven't addressed my question at all. I told you that the conversations were old so the cloud answer is totally irrelevant. My question is where do I find my conversation history on my PC using Vista? There are
 many answers regarding later OS but not Vista. I have read how to find the main.db folder containing the conversation history but on Vista there is a db-journal file which my computer can't open. Further advice tells me to download FreeFile Viewer which I
 did but this didn't help either. I need to know how to open the conversation history on Vista OS and really, why would you wipe all our conversation history? These conversations are really important, such as in this case with all the messages from my late
 friend gone.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The conversation history the application saves on your local hard drive depends on the
<strong>history settings </strong>you set on the application. Your settings should be configured to save your history to forever<em> (before and not after the update) .
</em>The conversation histories are saved on the main database file which is located inside the folder named after your Skype Name. If your file extensions are&nbsp;hidden, you might see&nbsp;this file as&nbsp;<strong>main
</strong>only.&nbsp;You would need a decoder to extract the files inside the database file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access your main.db file on Skype for Windows desktop: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Launch the Run dialog box by pressing Windows + R keys at the same time. </li><li>On the Run dialog box, type in %appdata%\Skype </li><li>Look for the folder named after your Skype Name. </li><li>Locate main.db or main</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We do not remove conversation histories unless users deleted them. In cases wherein users have deleted the messages, the entire message history would be deleted from the device also.
</p>

<p>Not sure if you're a robot or a human but you haven't replied to my response and you just keep sending the same response. My question again is that the file of the conversation history is a db journal file on a Vista OS. AGAIN, I can't open the folder and
 have installed FreeFile viewer to open it which also doesn't work. My question is how to open the db journal file?</p>

<p>Hi Tica,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s great to know that you have chosen Windows 8 and welcome to Microsoft Windows 8 Family!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that you are unable to load certain websites with video contents and also you get the error message that youtube.com is not responding when you
 try to connect to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me in understanding this issue in detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly happens when you try to load these websites? Are you getting any specific error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does this happen with both the desktop and modern user interface versions of Internet Explorer 10?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does the Internet Explorer hangs or freezes when you try loading these websites?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you try any troubleshooting steps for this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no need of installing or updating the flash player for Internet Explorer 10, as it has the built-in Adobe Flash Player and is designed to provide an add-on
 free experience, to play HTML5 and many Adobe Flash Player videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Get rid of extra template tabs in new document dialogue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Get rid of extra template tabs in new document dialogue</h2>
                    I figured out how to use the New Document or Template button to get the old style new document dialogue. But when I open it there are a bunch of extra tabs with useless microsoft templates. These folder are not in the templates folder in appdata. They
 seem to becoming from&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates\1033 but I can't seem to delete them. Is there any way to get rid of this stuff. &nbsp;Thanks.

            If you really don't want to see them, you could create your own dialog box using a UserForm. &nbsp;However, I don't consider that it is worth the effort.

<h2>            Can&#39;t use account on iPhone</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I have researched other posts and tried every suggestion in a vain attempt to get my mail on my iPhone without having to login every time using Safari.&nbsp; I believe that there is a problem with my e-mail account.&nbsp; Would you be so kind as to verify that
 my account, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is available for use on my iPhone 4S.<br />
<br />
It does not recognize my user password on the iPhone, but it works every time on Safari and on my laptop.&nbsp; Could it be that there is some sort of security code that needs to be reset?&nbsp; Thanks for your reply.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. I understand that you are unable to access your account on iPhone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please confirm the troubleshooting steps you already did? Have you&nbsp;enabled the two-step verification on your account? If yes, you will need to have an app password to access your account when using a mail app from your mobile device.</p>
<p><br />
In order to rectify this issue, please create a new app password for your account. For more information, you can refer to this article:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

We look forward to your reply. </p>

    <title>Hyperlinks do not open in outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> computerjohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlinks do not open in outlook</h2>
                    
<p>For those of you who have had problems with hyperlinks opening in Outlook 2007 or 2010, I think I have found out what has caused this problem. Recently one of my family members downloaded Google Chrome, for whatever reason. I noticed it was on my computer
 and decided I did not want the program, so I uninstalled it. As soon as I did, my outlook, word, etc., ceased working with hyperlinks. I reinstalled it again, and low and behold, the hyperlinks started working again. You don't have to leave Google Chrome as
 your default browser, but once loaded, it has to remain on your computer. Apparently, even if you unistall it, it leaves something in your registry that turns off the capability of using hyperlinks?</p>
<p>If anyone else has had problems with this issue and has found another way to fix it aside from the ones already posted, I would appreciate it very much if you would share your procedures with me. I have uninstalled "EVERY" Microsoft Update pertaining to
 Office thinking it was part of one of them. This did not help. I have also tried the .dll registering method and it did not work either.</p>
<p>All I can offer for a temp solution is what I stated above about Google Chrome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OldSailor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is caused by problems in Windows [Control panel, Internet options] and merely comes to light when a hyperlink is clicked in an Office application.&nbsp; The root cause of the fault is&nbsp;a Registry error regarding the handling of .html files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft KB on the subject is at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hyperlinks are not working in Outlook KB310049</a>.&nbsp; You can use </p>
<ul>
<li>method 2 [resetting IE in order to alter Registry settings through the UI] </li></ul>
<p>or </p>
<ul>
<li>method 3 [editing the Registry directly in order to achieve the same result].&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you use method 3 then note that there is a stupid typo in it, the Registry key you need to check is actually&nbsp;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.html&nbsp;&nbsp;[i.e. there is no space in the middle of it]</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, you might find that installing Chrome achieved the reset for you so there might not be any faults left to correct.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 hybrid with users already in Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hello guys,<br />
<br />
We are facing a bit of a turmoil in our migration to Office 365 plan. May you please take a look and advice?<br />
<br />
Our situation is the following:<br />
1. We have an onpremise Exchange 2010 with all the actual users;<br />
2. We have a Office 365 subscription, where most of the active users (with mailboxes in Exchange 2010) are created with the same SMTP address that is used with Exchnage 2010;<br />
3. All domain names added to Exchnage 2010 are added to O365 subscription;<br />
4. Current O365 users login and use Office 365 suite, Onedrive, Skype for Business and SharePoint. They also use the O365 mails for internal communication. Obviously, O365 are not routable to the Internet (Users cannot recieve mails on this mail from external
 domains, but users can send mails that get marked as Spam).<br />
<br />
We are currently planning to perform a hybrid setup. Migrate to Exchnage 2013 and then intergate with Exchnage Online using Azure AD Connect and SSO.
<br />
Problems we have identified are:<br />
1. When we setup the Office 365, can we merge the on-premise and o365 mailboxes?<br />
2. If it is not possible to merge mailboxes and we delete the mailboxes in Office 365 (not users)?<br />
3. We want to preserve the users - basically for their Onedrive and Sharepoint rights, but we would like to migrate the mailboxes from our on-premise Exchnage 2010. What are our options here?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />
<br />
Regards</p>

<p>1) Define merge? Do you have users with mailboxes both in O365 and on-prem? This is not a supported configuration, and no, there isn't any merge mechanism for such scenario.</p>
<p>2) Possible, but not immediately. After you remove the Exchange Online license for those users, their mailboxes will be deprovisioned, eventually. But you have to wait 30 days or so. Immediate results are only possible if you remove the user object, which
 will raise issues with SPO/ODFB. </p>
<p>3) See above. "Best" option is to use a 3rd party tool or do a PST export/import. Or wait.

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>1. To define merge - I mean to get mails from both mailboxes in the O365 one. Yes, users have mailboxes both on-premise and in O365;</p>
<p>2. I guessed so;</p>
<p>3. Wait, for what and how long :)</p>

<p>Hi doki4,</p>
<p>There’s no official-supported way to do the mailbox merge. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>As to the current situation, I understand that you need to keep the Office 365 cloud user accounts because of SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business data. But they definitely cannot have Exchange Online mailboxes if you’re going to set up an Exchange
 hybrid deployment.</p>
<p>I agree with Vasil that you need to use some migration tool or exporting PST files to keep the Exchange Online mailbox data, and then remove the Exchange Online licenses for all your Office 365 users. Then, you can perform an
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2641663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SMTP match</a> to link these Office 365 users with the on-premises AD users (as long as they have the same SMTP address). Once the users have the status of “<strong>Synced with on-premises AD</strong>” on the
 Office 365 admin portal, you can then set up your hybrid deployment.</p>
<p>And about "wait", I suppose what Vasil meant is to wait for the unlicensed mailboxes to be completely gone.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Just one more question.</p>
<p>If I remove the license, should I wait for 30 days before performing the SMTP match or can I do it straight away?</p>
<p>As alternative, I was thinking of exporting on premise mailboxes, importing them in O365 and then performing the hybrid with the users having their mailbox disconnected on premise.</p>
<p>Additionally, is it possible to overcome this problems with a cutover migration to O365?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi doki4,</p>
<p>You don’t need to wait for 30 days. Once the licenses are removed, you can then perform the SMTP match. It’s just that the online mailbox data will be kept for those 30 days, which should not affect the SMTP match.</p>
<p>For a cutover migration, the fact that a user cannot have both an on-premises mailbox and a cloud mailbox is still the same. And cutover migration cannot work with Directory Sync definitely.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

 It doesn’t happen often but it does occur.&nbsp; I’ve got 19 updates that need installing on this one and after reading about your issues I’m a bit nervous about pushing the install button.</span></p>

<span>You ran Hitman Pro so you either have a license for it or are using the 30 day trial.&nbsp; If you have not done so let’s try Hitman Pro Kickstart &nbsp;which should

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another alternative would be the Kaspersky Rescue Disk:
</span><span>You'll need to burn a CD (or put it on a flash drive) using a different computer and change the boot sequence on your computer to run the scan - instructions are included with
 the link:</span></p>

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If HPK and the Kaspersky Rescue Disk do not remove malware (such as ZeroAccess or a rootkit ) that has fouled up the system then you’re probably dealing with a badly corrupted (not necessarily
 malware related) operating system</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If it were my computer I’d grab my trusty external hard drive, be sure I had everything backed up to the drive that I needed to keep and I would reformat/reinstall the operating system or do a
 restore to factory settings if that’s an option.&nbsp; And I’m sure you know that despite a favorable report from SFC you could be looking at replacing a failing HD…..but I’d try to reformat/reinstall or restore to factory settings before replacing a hard drive.</span></p>

<h2>            Visio 2010 - Multi-page flow chart saves as a single page PDF. How do I save it as a multi-page PDF&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a five page flow chart in Visio, the page breaks show this. It also prints off as a five page document when in Visio. But when I save it as a PDF it only saves it as a one page document. How do I convert it to PDF so that it appears as a five page
 doc like it does in Visio?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Bugs in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cdakl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bugs in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Well, I've decided to list (probably just to make myself feel better) and the bugs/'enhancements' in Outlook 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As background, I purchased a new laptop and (gullible as I guess I am) decided to purchase the Outlook 2016 thinking it must be a improvement over Outlook 2010 (which I can't move to my new laptop because it was also purchased with that laptop and Microsoft
 won't honor that key!!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after mumbling, seriously considering divorcing Microsoft and eventually deciding it wasn't worth the alternative (renting 365!?), so here's my current list:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* when pasting an web address into any Outlook screen (contact, email, whatever...), the cursor does not end up at the end of the copied link (duh!), it ends up in the middle somewhere so when you push enter to 'underline' it, it splits the address. What
 is up with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>* when trying to migrate email, from 2010 to 2016, it randomly decides to not move subdirectories (and contents)... I'm still finding missing directories/email. Luckily, my old computer is still functioning so I can email those lost emails to my new computer.
 (Guess I'm glad after all that I couldn't move Outlook/Office 2010 from that old computer....) What a pain!</p>
<p>
</p><p>* you've heard this one before, but the 2016 version won't allow abeyance for follow up; have to create a meeting to get that functionality (can only mark with a flag!? What use is that?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>* after you open an email, read/forward or whatever, if you try and move it, 2016 decides it doesn't like the original and you get an error "This option can't be performed because the message has been changed." Have to close it, open it &amp; then move it. Have
 NOT changed anything is the original, but something in the 'background' doesn't get 'cleaned up' by Outlook so it throws an error rather than cleaning it up. Sloppy programming!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>* went thru the whole 'taking forever to sync' function headache, so I won't repeat here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I've missed something along the way as I didn't think to keep track of all the issues, but to put it lightly, this does NOT influence me to jump into anything with Microsoft, much less recommend this product!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows when/if any of these issues might be fixed, or better yet, where I could purchase a legal copy of Office 2010, please let me know! Also, at this point, if I find a way to purchase Office 2010, is it possible to 'downgrade' Office 2016 to
 Office 2010?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all and have a great weekend!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>1) paste - cannot reproduce your issue</p>
<p>2) It depends on the type of mail account used on the old PC and the type used on the new as to how any data migration proceeds. (Or how you actually migrate old mail/data)</p>
<p>3) Depends on the type of mail account</p>
<p>4) Again, the type of mail account is relevant</p>
<p>I would guess you are using an IMAP mail account, which doesn't have some of the functionality you would have had in a pop mail account</p>

<p>Mail accounts&nbsp; are the same setup/type between old and new; difference is the old is Outlook 2010 the new is Outlook 2016. Both on Windows 10 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried help/chat they wanted me to buy maintenance agreement; no thank you...&nbsp; they are supposed to be sending me links with ways to fix the abeyance of email/flag issue. Haven't received anything yet...</p>
<p>
</p><p>They said I could buy Office 2010 from 'third-party' (but couldn't tell me where) &amp; 2016 pst files/docs are compatible if I found 2010. Anyone know if that's true?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Ok, I found (on 'suggestions' for Outlook 2016) that a number of folks are having the same problem with the flag option and (as was mentioned here) it's an issue with IMAP, not POP email services. No idea why it's working on 2010 other than maybe something
 that's changed on the email providers side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm back to wanting to purchase Office 2010 if I can find it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding to my 'bug' list for Outlook 2016;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opened a contact tda and it's now formatted (square box that can't be changed in size) with tabs for 'contact' &amp; 'note'. Can no longer do a control F to open a find box within the notes, nor scroll (with a Microsoft mouse) beyond what looks like page breaks...
 or maybe scrolling is just stopping.... Who knows.... Do the programmers just toss out updates and see what causes the most flack? No idea...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and links within the note are no longer underlined so can't click to go to web page... I'm done... After playing around, found that (between yesterday &amp; today) the 'view' setting changed. Not sure if an update 'reset' the defaults or what... who knows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm actively searching for a desktop app to replace Outlook... any suggestions?</p>

            Hi Doug<br />
<br />
I've downloaded and installed the Merge Tools package which seems to install correctly but won't fire up correctly. &nbsp;each time I do so, even after shutting down and re-starting Word, I get an error message<br />
<br />
"13 ---- &nbsp;Type Mismatch"<br />
<br />
This doesn't happen with the document itself UNLESS I click on the <strong>Many To One
</strong>button. &nbsp;I'm running Office365 license on locally installed version of Office. &nbsp;Any ideas how to address?<br />
<br />

    <title>Favourites keep disappearing randomly from Windows Explorer 11 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Favourites keep disappearing randomly from Windows Explorer 11</h2>
                    <p>For some reason my 'favourites' often disappear randomly from Windows Explorer 11 - not all of them and not always the same links.</p>
<p>I have noted that they then appear in the Recycle Bin. If I restore them they re-appear in Windows Explorer. So it appears that somehow they are being deleted. Any ideas on what is causing this would be appreciated. I am now on Windows 10 but the same problem
 existed with Windows 8.1. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Outlook reply feature not working correctly</h2>
                    <p>I'm in Microsoft Outlook 2016, and am trying to reply to an already sent mail to add further information to it. When I click the reply button, the email gets automatically directed towards me (unless I manually change the To field of course). When I click
 the reply all button, then only does it send to whoever I was sending the original email to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else having this bug or a fix for it?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to start Outlook in safe mode from the following&nbsp;steps mentioned below and then verify if Outlook is performing correctly or not:<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:<br />
Outlook /safe <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: There is space between Outlook and /.<br />
<br />
If Outlook works&nbsp;in&nbsp;safe&nbsp;mode as expected, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below to determine the problem causing add-in:<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please post to us if you need any further information with Office.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>
