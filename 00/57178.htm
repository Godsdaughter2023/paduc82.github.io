<h2>            Orange light on surface, Does not charge when connected</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My surface pro has never given me any problems before and I was out with it yesterday and didn't have my charger with me, so it eventually died. Weird thing is I noticed this orange light coming from the right side of it for the first time but didn't think
 anything of it. Well, I got home today and tried connecting it to the charger and the charger doesn't seem to have any effect on it. Anyone had this problem or any ideas on how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Check the power connector light. Is the LED light on the power connector turned on?</p>
<p>- Did you try to unplug and plug the charger again?</p>
<p>- Did you allow the battery to charge for some time (half an hour perhaps)?</p>
<p>- Have you tried pressing the power button for a couple of seconds or tried turning it on? Is there any changes or is it responding?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>I've been having a similar problem for a while and tried all sorts of suggestions found on the web, to no avail. I finally tried the factory reset on my LG TV &amp; after retuning &amp; setting up the wireless connection the play to option miraculously appeared.</p>

            Hi VIctor.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />Another thing to try is in the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  locate the Device, open it and choose the Driver tab, then Roll Back if that button is available, if not try Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall which effectively resets.
<br />
<br />Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br /> 
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi thanks for your help. I have tried everything in your e mail, except the last suggestion which seems a bit too scary for me. the problem is not resolved. is it possible the fault is in the Marantz HDAMP1 ?&nbsp;&nbsp; When I unplug the power cord from the amp and
 then re connect it, the computer recognizes the amp everything seems normal, that is the amp lights up and the computer shows the dedicated driver as default ,&nbsp; but when I start to play audio on itunes or&nbsp; a video on a web site, it plays correctly for a split
 second and then the amp powers off and the there is no connection between amp and computer. When I then check&nbsp; for the dedicated driver, it is no longer there.</p>
<p>Regards </p>

 a folder from one drive to another but instead of copying it you created a shortcut instead (perhaps the "Alt" key was pressed when you dragged the folder?).&nbsp; If you then removed the drive from which you copied, you will get the error because that drive is
 not connected.</p>

            <p>Hi Anup, <br />
<br />
I apologize for the late response from our side.</p>
<p>The option shown in the screenshot will allow you to change the “saved password” windows uses to connect to the internet and not the password your internet service provider accepts to connect your computer with the internet .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you change the password here, you connection will try to automatically connect to the internet using your newly saved password. If you do not change the password from your internet service provider’s selfcare portal and change the saved password, you
 will not be able to connect to the internet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select an existing PPPoE connection, you can change the password for the connection. Before you make this change, ensure that your ISP has made the change in their settings as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the article for more information:</p>

<p><span>when downloading an attachment from hotmail, the file association is defaulted to .ashx rather than the original file that created it e.g. word /excel. it opens with the default programme associated with it which was PowerPoint
 but i can chnage to WORD, but EXCEL is not permitted and consequently Excel attachments cannot be read.</span></p>
<p><span>is there a way to ensure the original file is retained and when opened the ashx. extension is not added?</span></p>

<p>Hotmail is not changing your file names... you're just accidentally downloading the wrong file. &nbsp;.ASHX files are web site programming files (ASP.net Web Handler File). &nbsp;What's happening is that you are probably right-clicking on the attachment link, then
 choosing to "save target as".</p>
<p>Instead, you need to click the link. &nbsp;This will direct you to the .ashx file, which runs a server process and then in turn delivers the file to you, which will be the correct format.</p>
<p>The reason you may be seeing partial success when you download the wrong file is that Word (or whatever other program) is trying to open the file and is following along, sending the query back up to the server and getting the resulting file.</p>

 literally stuck. I am typing this question using my phone, and I dont have access to another computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to get rid of a virus with Kaspersky, but to no avail. And of course, reseting my pc didnt work, nothing else did, and now here I am with this mess. I just want to get it back to normal and without danger of someone stealing my information.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Saira, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<h2>            Windows update not finding updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, for some reason Windows update on my Windows 10 install no longer seems to be able to find the latest cumulative updates, weirdly it still manages to update Adobe Flash with no issues whatsoever. Everything worked perfectly until the end of 2017
 so all 2018 updates which aren't flash related seem to be invisible to my computer. I can't find anything online about others experiencing this problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help sorting this out would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Parralel Port printers, No Driver Support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredbear22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Parralel Port printers, No Driver Support</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft.</p>
<p>I am running WIN10 Pro, Version 1803.</p>
<p>Recently I had to reinstall my two HP parallel port printers.</p>
<p>Both printers are using TP-Link Network adapters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I decided to change the ip addresses for both printers due to a changed router.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot find the HP drivers that used to be available on the Microsoft Drivers Site.</p>
<p>Now I do hope that Microsoft in their wisdom have NOT purposely removed these drivers as both my LPT printers are in excellent working order.</p>
<p>Please can you direct me to WIN10 drivers for the following printers?</p>
<p>HP Laserjet 5MP</p>
<p>HP Deskjet 1120C</p>
<p>I do hope you can sort this for me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

<p>Hello <span>Johann Eva,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your response, however it in no way solved my problem!</span></p>
<p><span>You appear to be unaware that Microsoft offer updated drivers for many brands of printers as is clearly available to me when using the provided software to install the two 'Dongles' which
 are Ethernet to Parallel Port Printer Adapters. </span></p>
<p><span>In this software there is a section to 'Add A Printer' which clearly directs me to&nbsp; 'Windows Update' which after 2 or 3 minutes provides a selection of many manufactures printer drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately since Version 1803 was installed on my computers the drivers for Parallel Port Printers are no longer available.</span></p>
<p><span>Why is this so?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>Fred</span>P.S. If you wish I can send you a screen grap to confirm this.<br />

<p>Have you already contacted the printer manufacturer as suggested above? Please do understand that third-party programs, devices, and applications that are not developed or manufactured by
<strong>Microsoft </strong>should be addressed by their respective creators. That is why they have their own download website for users to download their drivers.

<p>Hello Johanna.</p>
<p>Yes of course I have however the drivers if available will not work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you are avoiding my point about drivers that are now not available from Microsoft/Others since 1803 was installed on my computer.</p>
<p>Your/Microsoft's policy regarding updates is a DISASTER for many users.</p>
<p>Thank you anyway for your replies.</p>

    <title>Anytime upgrade from Home Premium &#40;OEM&#41; to Ultimate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yanini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anytime upgrade from Home Premium &#40;OEM&#41; to Ultimate &#40;academic&#41; doesn&#39;t work, but worked before</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Samsung laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. It’s a legit OEM license that came preinstalled on the laptop, although I have subsequently reinstalled it using the DVD supplied by Samsung. It has a product key, but did not require activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a legit upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. This was purchased as a DVD with a product key under the “students and faculty” program at my university (the actual DVD says “Systems Student Media”).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to upgrade my installation from Home Premium to Ultimate using the product key for the latter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The problem is that if I enter the product key in the “Anytime Upgrade” dialog box, Windows says that the code is not valid. It gives no further explanation.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I called activation support and they checked the upgrade key and confirmed that it was valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I insert the Ultimate DVD and try to upgrade from there, it tells me to use the Anytime Upgrade, so I’m stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now before someone tells me that an academic upgrade key won’t work with Anytime Upgrade, I can tell you categorically that it has done so previously, with this exact computer.</strong> Previously (in 2012) I reinstalled the OEM version of Home Premium,
 then ran Anytime Upgrade, entered the Ultimate upgrade key, and thereby successfully upgraded to Ultimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want to do now is the same thing I did previously, having subsequently reinstalled Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I make it work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance and <em>please</em> don’t post if all you’re going to say is that this doesn’t work. It did work before so it should work now.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>So, after backing up, I tried the same method on the actual PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to have worked, but took 6 hours and was a lot of hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon first boot after the completion of the upgrade, Windows displayed an alert that the .Net framework 4.5 needed to be reinstalled. It then did the reinstallation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After the first of many restarts, Windows update notified me of 144 updates. After installing most of these it said there was an "unknown error" in the update, and to try again after restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a restart and re-run of Windows update I determined that the update to IE10 was failing. I tried it repeatedly but it wouldn't work so I ended up disabling IE altogether by using "Turn Windows Features On or Off".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a step back - prior to the upgrade, I was running IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Windows update again, there were at least 20 further updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all I had to reboot the machine at least a dozen times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had to re-disable scheduled defragmentation and reset the paging file size, which had returned to their defaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran disk cleanup to remove some 6GB of temp files created by the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then came the critical part: activation. Of course, it didn't work at first. The activation wizard told me to phone the automated helpline. The purpose of this seemed to be for me to verify that the key was being used on only one computer. Once I'd done
 so, activation completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, did it work? Yes, it appears so. Would I have done it if I'd known it would take 6 hours of unpaid work? No, I'd have sooner bought another computer. :-|</p>

<p>Hi Andrey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible for Microsoft Office to install different language or <span>keyboard</span> layout. Check if you are able to
<span>remove the&nbsp;languages from the Microsoft Office&nbsp;Language Tool.</span> Check out this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Remove-languages-and-fonts-you-don-t-use-0915EFDF-3EEC-4E87-8B2F-BA0D47242EA6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> and look under the Remove languages that you don't use section of the article. You can also try going through
<strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Clock, Language and Region</strong> &gt; <strong>
Change input methods</strong>, and if you are still not seeing the language you want to remove, try to add it and remove it again. Other users report that doing so eliminates the unwanted keyboard layout.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results. </p>

<h2>            Windows Photos Won&#39;t Open &#91;Resolved&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, an extremely frustrating issue has occurred&nbsp;ever since the creator update where I cannot see an image with windows photos. The application opens up and remains blank, then it stays like that for a few minutes before displaying an error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second most annoying thing is that I KNOW there is an update in the windows store, but recently my windows store app cannot open either. On the occasions when it does open, downloads get an error. It has actually opened on many different occasions when
 I have tried the variest methods over and over again. Yes, I have looked up EVERYTHING like using wsreset.exe or troubleshooting windows update and NOTHING works. Wsreset.exe is stuck, the powershell method does nothing, windows update has been fixed, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling that everything comes down to the update for the windows store app but everything has gone in a loop or not opening or not responding. I swear, every time&nbsp;there's been an update, it seems like something goes terribly wrong whether it's high
 disk usage or something as small as the windows store. Seriously, when there are articles on the Internet asking people whether or not the windows store is even worth the time, then you know you've messed up. As for me though, just give me back the old windows
 photo viewer for the love of God. Windows photos should have never been replaced and the windows store app DOESN'T BELONG on a PC!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: All that I needed to do was to get the fall creator update from the microsoft website. I don't know why my computer said it was "up to date" before then but everything is fixed now.&nbsp;</p>

            First lets try sorting out Photos.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />Scroll down to Photos then select it
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />Restart your computer the check if Photos is working again.
<br />
<br />If not, you need to check the store for updates. 
<br />
<br />First, try these options to fix the store app:
<br />
<br /> Try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + X.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer. 
<br />
<br />If you need more help, please continue to engage with us. We want to help you through this. 
<br />
<br />If none of the above work, try a repair upgrade:

<br />
<br />If don't want to bother with any of the above, then you can try installing Photo Viewer:

            <p>Go to Tools &gt; Internet Options and under the General tab delete your browsing history.&nbsp; Uninstall the AOL toolbar, you don't need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How are things running now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that you do have another problem, maybe related.&nbsp; you have <strong>Privacy Safeguard BHO</strong> in your system, this is malware and has hijacked your browser.</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel and uninstall any programs related to Privacy Safeguard BHO.</p>
<p>Run Malwarebytes again and do a Full Scan.&nbsp; Once completed, go into Windows Defender and do a Full Scan also.&nbsp; Note that these will take time to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to rid this malware, you may have to reinstall Windows on your computer but only if I say so.&nbsp; Do you have an installation disk.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 - Folder &#47; File icons dont show up in Large and Extra - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krishy77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - Folder &#47; File icons dont show up in Large and Extra Large Icon view - Medium Size icon view works ok</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am facing a weird issue - Folder and File icons don't show up when i select the view type as Large icon or Extra Large icon view - these show up only if i select the Medium size Icon view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in addition, when i try to set a wallpaper, all the images show up as blank previews and when i try to select one of these, it does not change the wallpaper. If instead i use Microsoft Office 2010 picture viewer or irfanview or picasa to view image and set
 as background, that works - though again, if i try to use the Desktop &gt; Personalization &gt; Wallpaper option to change wallpaper, it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am on Windows 7 Enterprise + SP1 with all critical patches setup. McAfee Virusscan Enterprise antivirus is present and no viruses have been detected with a full scan. Microsoft Defender scan also did not show any malware. In addition to Base Windows 7 +
 SP1, Microsoft Office Professional 2010 is also setup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a genuine copy of Windows, Office etc, i have enough space (70GB+) in C drive and problem comes even if i use the restore point that was setup just immediately post Windows setup. Had faced the issue about a month back and hence had re-imaged the
 OS from scratch - again, after re-imaging, the issue was not there initially for a few days, but came after a few days (not sure what the pattern is which causes the issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried suggestions mentioned in various forums present online - these include (but not limited to) what is mentioned below - none of these help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using cleanup utility to clean the thumbnail cache.</li><li>Deleting the thumbnail cache and restarting windows.</li><li>Using a restore point (Base windows + SP1 on which issue had not been seen originally)<br />
</li><li>Display file icon on thumbnails option is checked. Option "Always show icons, never thumbnails" is unchecked.
</li><li>Updating to use latest drivers from the vendor site.</li><li>Changing display resolution - native resolution on laptop is 1920x1080 - changing it to other resolution does not help.</li><li>Using Aero troubleshooting option - this does not detect any issues. (Option chosen in Performance settings&nbsp; is "Let windows choose what is best for my computer"</li><li>Have tried sfc /scannow and restarted system post it's run.</li></ul>
<p>Problem comes irrespective of whether drive is encrypted using Bitlocker or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the wallpaper issue - have tried deleting transcodedwallpaper.jpg, checked folder permissions, checked group policy etc</li></ul>
<p>Attached screenshots show the issue in more detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extra Large icon view (not ok : Blank):</p>

</p><p>This is a Lenovo W530 laptop, 16 GB DDR3 RAM (no memory errors in the RAM), 200 GB SSD Drive - have checked in Lenovo site and updated all Video drivers and software related to display - this also does not help.

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Created a restore point, backed up the registry, downloaded the fix-it and ran the same - it did apply a fix as well, but that did not help. Have done a restart post the fix-it run, but still both issues mentioned are still present.</p>

            <p>So if I understand you correctly the registry changes had no effect in solving your problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open a command Prompt by right clicking and select 'Run as Administrator' <br />
and then at the command prompt type:&nbsp; chkdsk&nbsp; /f&nbsp; /r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then press the enter key.</p>
<p><br />
If prompted to schedule the volume to be checked the next time the system restarts,<br />
enter: y </p>
<p><br />
Also if you know the manufacture of your hard drive you can download their diagnostic software.</p>
<p><br />
Another utility: SpeedFan has an online health analysis feature <br />
(SMART tab) for hard drives. It will show how your drives <br />
compares with other drives of the same make and model.<br />

=====================================================================</p>
<p><br />
2) Try running the&nbsp; SFC&nbsp;&nbsp; /SCANNOW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command one more time. </p>
<p><br />
Click on Start/All programs/Accessories&nbsp; then <br />
Right click on Command Prompt option and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />
(or "Safe Mode" open a Command prompt)<br />
At the command prompt enter:&nbsp; SFC&nbsp; /SCANNOW</p>

Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Yes - the registry changes (as run by the fix-it tool) did not help.<br />
<br />
#1 - Ran chkdsk - no errors were found after the scan. (This is a 200 GB SSD drive).<br />
<br />
#2 - sfc /scannow gave the message<br />
<br />
Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.<br />
<br />
Errors are shown against following files in CBS.log file (checked for pattern [SR])<br />

            <p>Hi Stuart,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Downloaded the Intel Solid State Drive Toolbox and ran the utility (full scan) - no errors were found though it did suggest a few tuning improvements.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Could the files mentioned in the SFC report be causing the issue? if so, i can try to get these files from some other laptop which has the same version of Windows. Would replacing any other files from a running system help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A query : As mentioned, icons show up for Medium Size icon view but not for Large and Extra large view (for these two, blank image show up) - do the icons for all 3 sizes come from the same source in Windows or are there different sources?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Stuart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While checking something else, found something though not sure if this would help in any way - if i keep the color depth as 16 bit (instead of the default value of 32 bit), then, wallpaper preview does show up - though still am not able to set the wallpaper.
 In this case, icons dont disappear, but dont scale either when set to Large/Extra Large size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reverting the color depth to 32 bit does not help - issue remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting the "Desktop Window Manager Session Manager' service does not help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Stuart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under display adapters (Device manager), there are 2 listings</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Intel HD Graphics 4000</p>
<p>2. NVIDIA Quadro K1000M</p>
<p>
</p><p>For NVIDIA, went to NVIDIA site and updated the driver to the latest one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Intel, have tried both the driver from Lenovo site and also force installed the adapter downloaded from Intel site - with both, the issue exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current driver versions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel HD Graphics 4000 - 10.18.10.3496</p>
<p>NVIDIA Quadro K1000M - 9.18.13.3276</p>
<p>

            <p>The Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver is for the built in graphics on the CPU / Processor.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA driver is for a separate graphics card or integrated graphics on the motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would indicate you have two possible graphics choices, one of which may or may not&nbsp;be an external connector on your laptop.&nbsp; If it is an external connector and you have access to a monitor, try connecting your laptop to the external monitor and see
 what the results are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check your BIOS settings to see which graphics processor is in use.</p>

<p><span>I have a dell inspiron 1525 and was using vista home basic on it. Then i upgraded to Win 7. the main Issue that i was facing was that previously my video RAM was showing 128 MB but not it
 has gone down to 64MB i have a intel Mobile Intel® 965 Express Chipset Family motherboard that has the integrated Video card.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are no issues with the performance of the OS but it does create problems when i try to play games that were running fine previously, mainly PES2010. Any Solution?</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried to reinstall the Graphics card drivers but to no effect.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Some of the settings in the BIOS might have changed; you may run ‘Dxdiag’ to check what is the total memory allotted for the Video
 RAM.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To run ‘Dxdiag’</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the Start Search Bar type Dxdiag, then hit Enter.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on the Display tab and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also check in BIOS if the Video RAM is shared with the Physical RAM.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>FWIW I'm not familiar with that driver but just did&nbsp; a&nbsp; dir/a/b/s spaceport.sys&nbsp; and can see there are new versions in&nbsp; WinSxS&nbsp; as recently as last month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I'm dubious about the "system needs repaired" diagnosis because it just sounds like a bad driver scenario from the meaning of the code</p>

<h2>            How to delete Old&#47;Fake &#34;Windows&#34; and &#34;Program Files&#34; folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Well, I have a "serious" problem as you can see on the subject. I've tried various ways but none of them worked so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because I "accidentally" copied those folders into my main drive back to when I was 12.</p>
<p>Now, my job's eating my main drive capacity, and I'm desperate now...</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<p>Is your C drive your Boot Drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so you just need to take ownership of these 'Fake' folders and then you can delete them. This can be troublesome to do . . .</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ek5gmtjmjf6d49r/InstallTakeOwnership.reg?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click HERE</a>&nbsp;to download a .reg file from my DropBox account, right click it and choose 'Merge' and confirm the merge. This .reg file will add
 a new entry to the right click in Windows File Explorer which will make the process easier . . .
</p><p>
</p><p>Then in Windows File Explorer, navigate to these 'Fake' folders, right click and choose 'Take Ownership'.
</p>
<p>Once the command has run, you should then be able to delete these folders . . .</p>
