<p>Hello NadineFleming,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important this is for you. I'd be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't find their Skype Name, there might be a typographical error as you search them on Skype or they have given you the wrong Skype Name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a suggestion, ask for their Skype Name again or the email address they registered with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there’s more than one matching result and you’re not sure which one is your friend, right click on one and select
<strong>View Profile</strong>. It's like their Skype business card which contains all the details they've added – like a photo, city, country or phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p>

    <title>Error 85030011 - POOM Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonedr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 85030011 - POOM Failure</h2>
                    I recently ungraded the ROM on my HTC Windows 6.5 smartphone. Since then I have been unable to sync with my desktops (Windows XP) - I keep get an error message and the error code is 85030011. A search of the web indicated this is a POOM failure. However,
 there is no solution offered. Any suggestions as to how I can correct this problem.

<p>Not sure about the solution but I was thinking .... (that could be dangerous)</p>
<p>Pocket Outlook&nbsp;suppports a set of COM objects, known as the <span>Pocket Outlook Object Model</span> (<span>POOM</span>).&nbsp; It provides an&nbsp;application with access to the data stored in the Pocket Outlook applications. In addition, the POOM is used to add
 new contacts, schedule appointments,etc.&nbsp; So if there is an issue with the POOM, I'm wondering if there is an issue with the data&nbsp;on your&nbsp;PIM.VOL file (such as a missing flag or pointer).</p>
<p>I certainly would <strong>try Prof Julie's and Linley's proposed solutions first</strong> but if that did not work I might try a few things.</p>
<p>First, back up your PIM data.&nbsp; I would use two ways of backing up (<a href="http://sn1-p3.myphone.microsoft.com/mkweb/Start.po?mkt=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MyPhone</a> and<a href="http://www.dotfred.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PIM BACKUP</a>).&nbsp; Both are free, work well and will save you if there
 is an issue later.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that there is an issue with the&nbsp;PIM so I would now rename it to PIMOLD, soft reset the device and a fresh new PIM is created with&nbsp;no data. Now restore the PIM BACKUP file&nbsp;to the device.&nbsp; Verify that your data is there and then&nbsp;try to sync to
 see if it works (I would definitely delete the old partnership on the device and PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it may all get messed up so playing around with it potentially can cause an issue.&nbsp; However, that is why you have MyPhone and PIM BACKUP to save the day if there is an issue.</p>
<p>Of course if you have been syncing regularly and if your Outlook on your PC is reasonably up to date, when you create the new PIM, you could just delete the existing partnerships on your device and PC then sync with your PC and the data would be brought
 over to your device.&nbsp; If it syncs, then the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant ... I was just thinking about what I might do</p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help. I am using Al Capitan with Office 2016 including all updates for OS and Office.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can change from Mail to OL2016, but I can not save it.</p>
<p>When I open it the next time, the standard is Mail and not OL2016.</p>

</p><p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the change from Apple mail to MS Exchange 2016 as standard for email.</p>
<p>The next problem is, that the series mails are in drafts and could not be send.</p>
<p>I am using 2 mail accounts. Exchange 2010 and a IMAP mail account. Standard mail account is IMAP.</p>

            Just delete the "unused" rows, if your last true ros is rows 10 then highlight rows 11 thru 65536 and delete them.

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>If you are an end user of Office 365 Edu, you can ask your admin to change the display name for you.&nbsp;admins can change users’ display name in Office 365 admin center -&gt; Users -&gt; Active Users -&gt; Edit. End Users cannot change their display names themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no admin in your tenant, the IT admins in your school can perform an admin takeover to become an admin of the tenant. Then they can manage the service for everyone.</p>
<p>To become an admin, you can refer to the articles below:<br />

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>Expect for admin takeover, there is no other solution for you to change your display name.</p>
<p>In addition, only admins can manage users and it is not feasible for you to delete the account and register again.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards<br />
Ran</p>

<h3> lovalvob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 on WP8 when MSFT and O365 account use same email</h2>
                    <p>I've had a Microsoft account for 10 years because of MSDN.&nbsp; I've had an office365 account for maybe two years.&nbsp; They both use the same email address, but they are different accounts with different passwords.&nbsp; This sometimes confuses the Offce365 website,
 but that's generally it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I got the WP8 phone, I used my Microsoft account to set it up.&nbsp; When I try to use Office365 on WP8, it works for 'email' and 'skydrive', but SharePoint asks me to set up an account.&nbsp; When I attempt to do so, it tells me that that account is already
 in use.&nbsp; Frankly, I'm confused.&nbsp; I suspect that it's because that account was used to set up the phone, but maybe, there's more going on.&nbsp; Any suggestions.</p>

Iova,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interesting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read the part about your accounts, and this is most likely the issue.&nbsp; You have 2 accounts of the same name, using different passwords.&nbsp; This is where you start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with support for your Microsoft Account.&nbsp; Somehow these 2 accounts can be brought together and become a single account with a single password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once done there, the rest of your issues, should go away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; Office 365 is part of Windows Phone.&nbsp; There is no need to independently log in to gain access to your account, UNLESS the Microsoft Account on your phone is different than the Microsoft account used for O365.&nbsp; If they are the same, there is no need
 to independently log in under the Office Hub.&nbsp; Your SharePoint configuration may require some work, and getting over to Office 365 support would probably be the best thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But focus on those Microsoft Accounts first.&nbsp; You won't fix anything until these are fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can start at
<a href="http://accounts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a> and see what happens.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is not an option. As I noted above, one is a true Microsoft account, the other is an Office365 account. They can't be combined as far as I know.&nbsp; I could synchronize the passwords, but that wouldn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume that the underlying problem is that both Microsoft and Office365 are using WAAD (Windows Azure Active Directory), and that the WP8 client is failing to consider scope when it checks if the account has already been added.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This used to happen on the Office365 website before the recent enhancements to the login screen. Now, when logging in to Office.com, it explicitly asks if you're using a Microsoft Account or Office365 account from a private domain.&nbsp; Prior that that enhancements,
 it was necessary to log in using a private browsing session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing that it's going to require an update to the WP8 client for SharePoint.<br />

Sad,but yes.&nbsp; If you have the azure account, then it is not compatible with the Microsoft Account.&nbsp; I recall when this came out, there was a lot of turmoil around MS about releasing this particular account because it was so similar to a MS Account, yet uniquely
 different.&nbsp; </p>

I've tried, but the each of the teams, office and WP responds with a suggestion that I speak with the other team.&nbsp; I'll probably focus on the Office365 side, since that's a paid account and has real support.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they're so caught up in the rollout

<p><br />
Well, I'm not an MS employee, so internal workings are beyond me. However I did contract there for a short time, when this new account came out, so I know the angst it prompted. I know the parameters around it....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder, if you really want to focus on it because its the paid account is the right thing to do. Having a single entry point into the accounts is the ideal, but I wonder what else this account is NOT good with? XBOX Music? Windows Store? Otherwise transferring
 everything to a single account would be the ideal..</p>

<p>I just remember the round table arguments the day this was put on the agenda....borderline violent. This exact situation was discussed. As I recall Azure did not relent in its insistence to have this " special ' account. Though I do recall, vaguely, that
 this account was never intended to be used with WP.&nbsp; But that was pre O365 HP thinking...</p>

            Hello Lars1985,
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that you are having an issue with Outlook 2010 as your screenshots are not displaying correctly and shows as <code>cid:xxx.png@...</code> instead. I know how annoying this can be and I will try my best to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor for MS Community and I am sorry to inform you that you have posted this thread in the wrong forum. The correct forum is Office &gt; Outlook. (You don't have to create a new thread, simply edit it!)
<br />
<br />It is important for you to post your thread in the correct forum so that users equipped with the right expertise can better serve you.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, please revert back the following information so that other users can help you easier:
<br />
<br />1. How long has this been an issue?
<br />2. Do you recall taking any action that could possibly result in this?
<br />3. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far?
<br />
<br />I find that this article may be relevant to you: <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/problems/picture-placeholders-displaying-outlook-email-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/problems/picture-plac...</a>
<br />
<br />Have you tried to fiddle with your Internet Explorer settings?
<br />
<br />1. Go to: Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced tab
<br />2. Under Security, untick "Do not save encrypted pages to disk"
<br />
<br />Otherwise, generally, the easiest method to resolve this is to re-create a new profile or repair/reinstall Microsoft Outlook. If you think it is too inconvenient because of the sheer amount of data involved, you may like to pursue for other resolve as detailed in the article above.
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create...</a>
<br />
<br />Remember to do a backup of all your Outlook data to a <code>.pst</code> before doing anything.
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope it works!
<br />

<br />Sutharsan

            <p>I suspect a spammer has gotten hold of your email and is using it.&nbsp; You cannot block your own email address or you would stop getting all mail so your options are limited.&nbsp; You can create a rule to block the topics if they are similar and you can report
 the abuse as described below</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>This solution article provides information on how to report abuse and SPAM in Outlook.com</strong><br />
<strong>To report spam or unsolicited emails:</strong><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></em><br />
<em>* Non-MIcrosoft customers should address an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Depending on the originating
 mail domain: hotmail, msn,live, or Outlook.com). Attach a copy of the spam email to this email and send it. If we do not receive a copy of the email as an attachment our ability to take action against the spamming account is severely impacted.</em><br />
<em>* We ask for a full copy of the email so that we have conclusive evidence showing from which Windows Live Hotmail account the SPAM was sent. It is possible that the email address
 was spoofed, and we don't want to mistakenly close a non-spamming account.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>To report abuse:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>
abuse</strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">about harassment, impersonation, child exploitation, child pornography etc, received</span>
<strong>
from a outlook.com account</strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">should send their complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with all the relevant&nbsp;information (abuse@hotmail, or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</span></em><br />
<em>*
<strong>If you are being threatened please call your local law enforcement.</strong></em><br />
<em>*</em>
<em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you wish to report abuse against a non Microsoft account, please send the complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** , where xxxxxx.com is the text that appears after the "@" symbol
 in the sender's e-mail address. For example, if the unwanted email came from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then report the email message to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. You can also use the site http://abuse.net to identify the correct abuse reporting address.</span><br />
</em><br />
<strong><em><span style="color: rgba(235, 0, 115, 1)">* In addition to these ways of reporting Spam you can also click the "Report Spam," button in your email program.</span></em></strong></span></span>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what happened with my skype account and the changes with microsoft. Now I have a skype account that is linked to my microsoft account, but it is a new skype account with none of my contacts or history. My old skype account is still active on
 my iphone, and I can find it when I search my name from my laptop, but I can't login to it. It was set up with the same email as my other accounts. How do I get back to this old skype account and still be linked to my microsoft?</p>
<p>

            Both accounts have the same skype name and the same email address. I followed the link you added, entered my email and it gave me two options, one from Canada and one from NZ, so I must have set the previous one up while in Canada. I changed the password

            I have a problem. When my friend search my contact using my email, 2 accounts appeared. Does this mean that my email is linked the 2 accounts? I can't remember if I had Skype account before. One account is actually the account I sign up lately. When I
 checked using the link above, it stated that it has 1 skype account only for the email. Thus, I would like to know, why 2 accounts appeared when someone search using the email. If it is related to the email, how can I delete the other skype account?

            I have had the same problem - when I tried to log on earlier today it said I do not have an account... so a new one was created towards my old / same email address.<br />
And following that I could not sign on neither through the app (on mac), nor on the skype for web page.<br />
Now, when I've retrieved and gone back to the "old" existing account, I can sign on through the skype for web page. But the app still does not work.<br />
<br />
I think you need to ramp up the testing you do before you deploy new releases, this is not acceptable. Imagine the amount of people trying to call each other over Christmas.<br />
I've been working with computers since before Windows, I cannot imagine how this issue impacts "Bridget, 67 years old" and unaccustomed to reconfiguring firewalls and software.<br />

            I've found the issue out: You need to reinstall the classic version of Skype.<br />
<br />
The newer version does not support firefox nor safari, and probably something else in the background is required from google chrome (which is supported).<br />
<br />
So for all of us who do not want to use google chrome, I think you can only go back to the old skype version and it will work.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Really frustrating that Microsoft support does not reveal this "kind of" crucial piece of information and tries that out first).

Its been over 5 days and I am unable to access Skype on my laptop; to send texts or video chat. I sent 2 emails to Skype informing them of this but I did not get a reply as yet.

<h2>            How to create or emulate a cursor in Access 2010&#63;</h2>
                    Hi to All:<br />
<br />
I'm not a user of Access so I wanted to know how can I create or emulate a cursor (or other kind of query) in order to do something like the following:<br />
<br />
- This table reflects the source of information:<br />
<br />
Field1&nbsp;&nbsp; Field2
<p>ItemA&nbsp;&nbsp; Value1</p>
<p>ItemB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value1</p>
<p>ItemA&nbsp;&nbsp; Value3</p>
<p>ItemB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value2</p>
<p>ItemA&nbsp;&nbsp; Value2</p>
<p>ItemA&nbsp;&nbsp; Value4</p>
<p>ItemB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value3</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
So I need a query to return the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Items&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Values</p>
<p>ItemA&nbsp;&nbsp; Value1, Value2, Value3, Value4</p>
<p>
ItemB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value1, Value2, Value3</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Best regards</p>
<p>
<br />

            <p>There are many possible solutions, but remember that the concatenated result must do less than 256 characters since 255 is the max, for a single field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution that I propose is to first create a new table, which will hold the result at the end of the process:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SELECT DISTINCT field1 AS Item, iif(false, " ", null) AS concat INTO tempTable<br />
FROM originalTableNameHere</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, we have to concatenate the values together with a single update query:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE tempTable INNER JOIN originalTableNameHere ON tempTable.item = originalTableNameHere.field1<br />
SET tempTable.concat = (tempTable.Concat + ", " )&nbsp; &amp; originalTableNameHere.field2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As previously said, the result is now in tempTable.</p>

<h2>            protect worksheet,, but allow users to hide rows</h2>
                    I have a protected worksheet that is working great, except that it has more rows than are needed because we never know when the next worksheet needs to be created how many rows will be needed. I've got the maximum number of rows with formulas and just
 want to hide the rows with no data when the new worksheet made from the protected default worksheet is created. Right now only the person with the password to change the formulas can hide these rows and I can't see an option to allow row hiding/unhiding among
 the protection options.

<p>Recenty purchased an N97 mini -- great versatile little phone.</p>

<p>No one else is doing this?</p>
<p>In case anyone is researching this, it seems to be that serving internet WiFi is draining the battery faster than the USB cable can charge it. This week I had it go down completely and refuse to start at all. After a few minutes recharging, it started again
 with a low battery warning.</p>
<p>I need to try plugging in the mains charger instead.</p>
<p>Hope that helps someone.</p>

<p>Today I ran the Joikuspot app with the phone plugged into the mains charger (not merely the USB charger to the computer), and it ran flawlessly. Served 400MB over about 6 hours.</p>
<p>I'm therefore convinced that the issue is not a fault with the phone, nor with the app. It's just that serving WiFi drains the battery, which makes sense. Keeping it plugged into the mains charger is therefore the way to keep it going.</p>
<p>Just for fun, I did make call today while it was serving WiFi (still plugged in.) Worked fine.</p>
<p>Hopes this helps you and others who may used this app.</p>

<h2>            Insider Build 17686.1003 does not install &#40;&#34;Restart pending&#34; forever&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently on Insider build 17677.1000.&nbsp; According to Windows Update, it has downloaded 17686.1003 (rs_prerelease), and it is in the "Pending restart" status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, no matter how many times I restart it remains in that status.&nbsp; I get constant notifications to schedule restarts; I schedule one, that time comes, the computer reboots and... it remains in Pending restart status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>* Restarted manually with the "restart now" button</p>
<p>* Scheduled a restart and allowed that time to pass, causing a reboot</p>
<p>* Run the Windows Update troubleshooter, which just told me that I needed to restart to finish an update</p>
<p>* Contacted Microsoft Support, who were of no help and told me to just come post here on answers.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reboot there's no error or failure; it just reboots normally.&nbsp; If I check my update history or event log, there's no failed updates -- it appears no attempt has ever been made to install the update, and it remains in "Pending restart" status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to get off this build and onto the next one?</p>

            I stopped the Windows Update service, deleted both c:\windows\SoftwareDistribution and c:\Windows10Upgrade, and rebooted.&nbsp; After restart today, Windows downloaded a different build than before (17692.1000) and that one installed without any issues, so
 this problem is now solved.

<h2>            Installed Windows Technical Preview  Build 9860 and lost My Wireless Connection</h2>
                    <p>Hello Team and congratulations with the new build 9860. The build downloaded and installed with no technical problems but I just realized that I am unable to connect using my wireless network. I have a Intel Centrion wireless N 1000. Of course, I can see
 the available wi-fi networks but is getting the error "can't connect to this network". This is the network that I have used forever. I tried uninstalling the drivers and reinstalling but that did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>SOLUTION to the problem - for the most part!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to those who offered advice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result of a lot of Internet research and tons of trial and error on my part, I have come to the conclusion that in the latest Windows 10 Technical Preview (Build 9860), something has gone awry in the way Windows 10 handles Wi-Fi access during the start-up
 process for a significant number of users, but not all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update, my computer lost its ability to access my wireless network on start-up. I need to mention here that I am using the Netgear Nighthawk R700 router broadcasting in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. This will become more significant a bit later. Without
 getting into all of the natty-gritty details, I discovered that during the 9860 upgrade Windows somehow disables DHCP for Wi-Fi. For those who are having this problem, the solution is quite simple; you just need to re-enable this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate your wireless adapter and right-click properties.</li><li>Select “Internet Protocol v4” and select properties again.</li><li>Make sure that the top button is selected: “Obtain IP address automatically.”</li></ul>
<p>This should correct the problem of your computer not being able to access you wireless network on start-up PROVIDED it is a 2.4 GHz network. If you are trying to access a 5 GHz network, things get a bit more complicated. For some reason, the new build 9860
 is not able to automatically recognize a 5GHz network—even after enabling DHCP for W-Fi. The only solution I have found is to manually access the 5 GHz network after you have been able to log on using the 2.4 GHz network. Once you manually enable the 5 GHz
 network, the 2.4 GHz network is automatically disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether this is being done by design or there is a problem with the new build is uncertain. I know this much, given the same exact equipment, I never had this problem with Windows 8, Windows 8.1, or the first build of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this has helped those of you who have lost your wireless access after the update.</p>
<p>

<h2>            O365 OneDrive - Recent Update - Removal of Ribbon</h2>
                    
<p>In the recent update to O365 OneDrive the Ribbon was removed. Generally this is positive and I love the new look. However, the removal of the Ribbon also removed the ability to upload a file as a new version. Now the only option is to upload and overwrite
 the previous version which is not useful given the ability to upload a new version is critical to business users.</p>

<p>Is there something I am missing here or has the function been removed from the new update?</p>

<p>There is a classic view that you can fall back to. I believe this change is to simplify the UI and considering how many users will use the feature to upload a new version from the UI.

<p>hi mark,</p>
<p>glad to hear your love of the new interface of onedrive for business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>based on my test, the removal of the <b>ribbon</b> doesn’t remove the ability to upload a new version of document. here is a workaround for your reference: when you upload a document which has existed in onedrive for business, you’ll get an error
<b>1 item wasn’t uploaded </b>like the following one.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2d06ae20-a6c5-4cb4-a6cc-0975e141cdc6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2d06ae20-a6c5-4cb4-a6cc-0975e141cdc6" /></a></p>
<p>if you click it, a window pops up. click <b>replace</b> and then a new version will be created.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=64c86c4c-1cab-414d-a87c-aa0a003b6193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d64c86c4c-1cab-414d-a87c-aa0a003b6193" /></a></p>
<p>but this method is a little critical for users, given this situation, i invite you to

<h2>            ActiveX controls in Excel have been broken since 2014</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping Microsoft could get around to either fixing or removing Active X controls from Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screen cap of an ActiveX button. There is only one button called CommandButton1 in this image. Unfortunately, rather than executing the code behind this button, Excel just displays a smaller version of the button I'm clicking above and to the
 left of the button I'm clicking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes saving and reopening the document temporarily fixes this, but this is not a consistent fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem comes to me from another less experienced Dev that spent a day on the problem. That computer and the Windows image installed on it are unique to my workstation, the only commonality is they are both running Windows 10 and Office365. We suspect
 that this problem is entirely due to a decade old bug in Excel not being fixed, which is unfortunately common complaint I get from users of Microsoft Office products.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            The text is missing when we receive a Word document by email</h2>
                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"Invisible text"</div>
Hi.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Microsoft Office 2011 Home and Student installed on an iMac and my daughter has the same on a MacBook Pro (from the same multi licence). Both machines have Lion installed and both have the same problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If we receive a word document by email, often when it is opened the text is missing. In a form, the borders may show there but no text.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, if I open in preview, I see all the text or if I save it to google docs I see it and if I do a word count in the 'blank' document, it will count the words that are invisible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can often open in OpenOffice but I can't find a way to make the text visible in word though. It is a big problem. I have checked all the settings but can't figure it out and any help would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>many thanks</div>

    <title>Slow map downloading - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coldwaves  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow map downloading</h2>
                    
<p>I have a UAE version N9 used in the US. &nbsp;When I download the map to use offline, the downloading speed is quite slow. &nbsp;At the same time, my US version N8 downloads maps very fast. &nbsp;Web browsing on N9 seems to be fine although I cannot do any speed test due
 to the lack of flash support in the browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am wondering whether the server for downloading the map differs from country to country, i.e. my UAE N9 is trying to use some server there and therefore the downloading is not as fast.</p>

<p>I don't have this problem. &nbsp;I download the whole USA map and the size are the same in both N8 and N9. &nbsp;It is just slow downloading speed on N9. &nbsp;That's why I am wondering whether it is related to my UAE version or not.</p>

            In Australia I am finding map download painfully slow. 150mb took over an hour when connected to a fast ADSL2 home network.

                    <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for a bit of clarification before taking the leap...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in the states but travel to Europe often. &nbsp;Instead of taking time off of work, I'd like to be able to continue working while abroad, which would require me &nbsp;a number of phone calls to clients in the states, some of which are on land lines. &nbsp;From the
 research I did, for a small monthly fee I can make free wi-fi calls (even to landlines) to anyone!</p>
<p>I just need to verify that this is actually the case...</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Michele,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can use Skype to make calls to landline/mobile numbers. You will just need an&nbsp;internet connection and a subscription or Skype credits. To proceed, please open this link:
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates/United%20States?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates/United%20States?language=en</a> then type in USA on the search bar&nbsp;for example. Below is the screenshot available, it includes World Subscription
 that you can call 63 destinations.</p>
