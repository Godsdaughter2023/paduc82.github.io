    <title>Blank screen between Windows 10 logo and Login - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blank screen between Windows 10 logo and Login</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my Toshiba Satellite U845W-S410 from Windows 7 to Windows 10. All went fine and it initially booted very quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the updates happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a long wait between the Windows 10 logo and the login screen. There is a blank screen, then a blank screen with cursor, then a blank screen with cursor and spiny blue thing. There's also a lot of processing noise coming from the computer like
 it's doing something really hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Intel i5-3317U processor and my control panel tells me I have an Intel HD Graphics 4000 display adapter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something that I have noticed recently is that I now have Intel graphics options when I left click on the desktop and a Intel HD Graphic function in my control panel. I don't remember having these with Windows 7 or when I first upgraded. Similarly, when
 I woke my laptop up after the update that included these Intel HD Graphic functions my resolution was all messed up until I restarted; so I figured it was fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me there is a conflict between some driver update, following my research of similar forum questions with other versions of windows the graphics drivers seem to be the culprit, and this seems the case here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is, I don't know how to either check this or fix it. Can you help?</p>

                    This error does not come on right away, after i'm on the internet or running a downloaded program it will appear in the bottom tool bar approx. 3 minutes after I start. It does not seem to have a effect on what I am doing. I click ok and it goes off untill
 I start my laptop again. I'm really stumped on why it started and how to fix it?

            Hi Coby,<br />
<br />
You don't mention what software you are running so it kind of limits the troubleshooting.&nbsp; What is the downloaded program?<br />
<br />
I would try to clean boot the system to see if the problem clears up.<br />
<br />
<p>Follow the steps below to place your computer in “clean boot”&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <b>Start</b>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop </li><li>Type <b>msconfig </b>in the <b>Start Search</b> box, and then press <b>ENTER</b>.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <b>General tab</b>, click <b>Selective Startup</b>. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to <b>clear the Load Startup Items check box</b>.&nbsp;
</li><li>Click the <b>Services tab</b>, click to <b>select the Hide All Microsoft Services</b> check box, and then
<b>click Disable All</b>.&nbsp; </li><li>Click<b> OK</b>.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
<p>When you are prompted, click <b>Restart</b>. <br />
<br />
<br />
When the desktop loads, test again and see if you still receive the error.<br />
<br />
If this <b>does</b> resolve the issue, then see the following Microsoft Article on “Clean boot” and the section “How to determine what is causing the problem” to determine which program or service maybe causing the issue.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a>
</p>
<p>How to set your computer back,&nbsp;to boot normal: </p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <b>Start</b>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop </li><li>In the <b>Start Search</b> box. Type <b>msconfig</b>, and then press <b>ENTER</b>.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Click the General tab.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <b>Normal Startup</b> - <b>load all device drivers and services</b>, and then click
<b>OK</b>.&nbsp; </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart to <b>restart the computer</b>. </li></ul>
<br />
Please let us know the results.<br />

            Hi Keith
<br />
<br />Currently there is no way to create a custom voicemail in Skype, though it is one of the most asked for features, so hopefully the Skype engineers are working to give us this feature in a future update . . .

<h2>            Unable to change optical output error code 0x80bd000a </h2>
                    
<p>I changed my sound settings for the optical cable output to be stereo uncompressed to reduce latency for Rocksmith 2014.&nbsp; While attempting to change the output back to bitstream out for Dolby Digital, the error code 0x80bd000a is listed with the wording:<br />
<br />
There was a problem using this setting.&nbsp; Make sure your optical cable is plugged in (it is, there's sound transmitting properly) and your receiver supports the setting.&nbsp; Also, make sure to choose at least one audio setting.&nbsp; Both can't be off.<br />
<br />
My hdmi out is stereo uncompressed and when trying to change that it returns the same error.&nbsp; Bitstream output is defaulted to off and is greyed out without the ability to change it. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've performed a hard reboot (holding the front power button) and there was no change.</p>

<p>Sad to see there are no replies to this as I'm having the same problem. I'm trying to get my Astro 2011 editions connected with the mixamp 5.8 and according to Astro they should work fine. But try as I may, my xbox one won't allow me to choose bitstream
 audio via optical. </p>
<p>No idea what else I can try but getting very frustrated as it was easier to do this on my old 360 :/</p>

<p>You need to cold-boot the Xbox One by holding the White Power Button on the front of the console down for five (5) seconds. Wait 10 seconds and restart it. Once it boots back up you can reset the bitstream settings.</p>
<p>Rocksmith 2014 apparently changes this to uncompressed automatically to prevent latency issues.
</p>
<p>Ideally I would want to be able to set Optical out to uncompressed (optical cable from Xbox One to stereo receiver for rocksmith) and HDMI to Bitstream with Bitstream Format set to Dolby (TV passes thru via optical cable to Stereo receiver so I don't have
 to change audio inputs between Xbox One, OTA Antenna, Roku etc), but keep in mind Dolby Bitstream was not an option when Rocksmith first released iirc</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t finish windows 10 PRO 64bit install due to BSOD failures.</h2>
                    This is going to be a bit long because I want to provide all the info.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind, This PC built under try 1 ran for a few hours before first BSOD failure.<br />
<br />
A new PC build with all new components:<br />
1st try<br />
windows 10 64bit OEM dvd<br />
ASrock z170 extreme 7+<br />
Core i7 6700<br />
Noctura NH-D14<br />
Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4 2666MHz<br />
MSI GeForce GTX 1070 Founders Edition<br />
samsung evo 850 1Tb<br />
Corsair RM850XI&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Power up and windows install went fine. &nbsp;Upgraded to latest windows version so I could install video card drivers. &nbsp;No problems. &nbsp;Installed video card drivers. began install&nbsp;of MB drivers from disc and I get assaulted by BSOD's. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since I was fresh into a new install and instead of trying to find out why, I formatted the hard drive and went to reinstall Windows again. &nbsp;I have yet to finish an install.<br />
<br />
I tried various configurations of RAM from 1 stick to 2 to all four. &nbsp;I removed the video card and went off on board video. &nbsp;nothing worked. &nbsp;I was able to return the&nbsp;motherboard which leads to build #2 below.<br />
<br />
2nd try<br />
windows 10 64bit OEM dvd<br />
ASUS Maximus VIII Hero<br />
Core i7 6700<br />
Noctura NH-D14<br />
EVGA 16G (2x8gb) DDR4 3200MHz<br />
MSI GeForce GTX 1070 Founders Edition<br />
samsung evo 850 1Tb(also tried WD 1Tb HDD and crucial 256G SSD)<br />
Corsair RM850X<br />
<br />
Before windows finishes installing, I'm slammed with BSOD.<br />
<br />
the errors are in no particular order:<br />
page fault in non page area<br />
whea uncorrectable error<br />
irql not less or equal<br />
computer restarted unexpectedly. &nbsp;windows installation cannot proceed...<br />
<br />
I've built over a dozen setups since 2000 and have never had a problem that I had to reach out for help for. &nbsp;Now it's time to suck it up because I'm mentally exhausted.<br />
<br />
What gets me the most is that it was running initially. &nbsp;I've done a lot of searches and everything is pointing to these errors as a product of upgrades from 7 and 8.1 with&nbsp;AV software or drivers needing to be removed. &nbsp;I can't figure that would be the case
 on a clean install.<br />
<br />
The only thing i can think of to do next is try another processor. &nbsp;I don't really want to go down that road because I can't imagine a processor would fail out of the blue. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 850w power supple should be big enough.<br />
<br />
When it comes to log files, I'm lost so if you need a startup log, please point me to a reference so i can learn how to do it.<br />
<br />
I've also tried to go into safe mode during install but it won't let me saying that windows can't complete install in safe mode. &nbsp;

            <p>You can take pictures and record video with the pre-installed Camera app on your surface. Search for "Camera", without quotations, from the search charm in the Charms Bar by swiping in from the right-edge of the screen and selecting Search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have opened the Camera app it should default to the camera. Simply point at what you want to take a picture of and tap the screen to take the picture. If you swipe your finger up from the bottom edge of the screen you should see a contextual bar
 with some options available for you to use. You should also see an option to switch to Video mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you switch to video mode you will start the recording process by tapping the screen and stop it by tapping the screen once more. There should also be a few recording options you can play around with if you swipe up from the bottom of the screen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't taken the time to play around with the Camera app much at this point in time but for more information regarding this application

<strong><span>&lt;&lt; Remove from list.</span></strong><b><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Add the email address to your Safe senders list</span></strong><br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Black Screen on Boot Cannot reinstall windows with CD.</h2>
                    <p>Was having an issue with black screen/windows background with cursor on boot. The system gives me the options of repair mode or start windows normaly. Nothing works. Tried using F8 and all of the options under that. Nothing has worked. Moved on to trying
 to reinstall windows via the repair CD and it loads fine. Selected repair windows and it loaded files for a bit and hung at the windows background with cursor screen. Rebooted and tried selecting install windows and it is now hanging at a setup is starting
 screen with a circlular revolving cursor for about an hour. Laptop was working fine Thursday night. Left for the weekend to go camping and came home to a paper weight. Joyful. Spread the word camping is bad for windows 7!

            <p>Hello, I have tried every option including the system restore from my Bios.&nbsp;Low res mode hangs at splash screen with cursor.&nbsp;The system restore option hangs. Tried safe mode - hangs. Would need&nbsp;to get past the hanging splash screen to disable my video adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also
 tried to repair windows from the windows boot disk and I also tried reinstalling windows from the disk. All the first mentioned options end in a black screen or windows splash screen with cursor that doesnt go any further. When trying to reinstall windows
 7 from the disk it sits at a "setup is starting" screen and does not ever progress. I tried again last night to see if it was performing some sort of scan that took a long time. It sat on that screen for 10+ hours. Any other ideas?</p>

<p>I decided that I need more space on my primary drive, and I wanted a faster SSD drive, so I have been trying to get my data onto the new drive but I am not comfortable with erasing the OS from the old drive until I am certain it is an EXACT match. &nbsp;Well,
 I created a backup image of the OS drive, SEVERAL times, and burned several recovery disks. &nbsp;It wasn't until I decided to pop in the original installer disk that I realized that there is a REAL problem here! &nbsp;I can boot from the old hard drive, GREAT, but
 what if that drive goes out? &nbsp;I have an image that I can't get to, and after disconnecting ALL other drives and putting several other drives in to install a fresh copy of windows to, it is official that windows will NOT load. &nbsp;I don't get past the windows
 progress bar. &nbsp;I have spent two days now trying to figure this out. &nbsp;How the hell is this ok? &nbsp;I need to protect my data, including my program configs and installs, and I am also trying to optimize my system performance, but I can't upgrade hardware without
 a NIGHTMARE??? &nbsp;That's INSANE! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every method suggested, and neither disk will load windows for fresh install OR recovery. &nbsp;Hello, Microsoft, help PLEASE?!?!?</p>

<h3> tom whittle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 cannot find miracast receiver &#40;PTV3000&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first forray into writing a question in the the Microsoft forums because usually I can find the answers by just searching, however this time I'm having no luck, can anyone offer any guidance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 and I want to use the Netgear PTV3000 and miracast to display wirelessly. My issue is that the SP3 cannot find the PTV3000 device when I search for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to the PC settings &gt; PC and devices and click "add a device". it then searches but no device is found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely it found the device once, the pairing failed and now it's not been able to find it since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am fairly sure the PTV3000 is ok because my android phone finds it and I can display the phone absolutely fine, this leads me to assume that the issue is with the SP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the latest PTV3000 firmware (2.4.53) and I've done all the updates on the surface pro 3, it says there are no more updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling and re-enabling the wireless adapter, some people say this helps, I have tried putting it into and out of air plane mode. Nothing has worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom Whittle</p>

            <p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, sorry for my delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got to the bottom of the issue in the end thanks to yours and other peoples information I found by searching around. My issue was some kind of conflict with my Cisco AnyConnect VPN client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others have had this issue and some were able to untick various boxes in the wifi adapter properties but my issue was resolved if I uninstalled the AnyConnect client. I could then connect to the device, pair and everything worked wonderfully. I then re-installed
 the anyconnect client again and, touch wood, I've not had any problems yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help, I just wanted to close off this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Let&#38;&#35;39&#59;s discuss your most powerful poisons.</h2>
                    
<p>I wonder if people here has made any builds around poisons.<br />
<br />
I never have in the past, so it was sort of a new play style for me.<br />
<br />
I came across this poison playstyle while playing in oblivion about two weeks ago. It was just the enemies were doing so much damage, that I had to come up with ways of killing them quickly. I had poisons but they were doing much damage so I didn't real bother
 them, that is, until I learned about the weakness to poison spell in oblivion. I started doing some research about what that spell effected and from there I started formulating some experiments with alchemy. And I gotta say……..the results were WWWAAAYYYY better
 than I ever imagined.<br />
<br />
I was stacking as many damage buffing effects into one dose and made them stack on top of each other, and then the second dose was doing the damage and everything was dying, REALLY fast in Oblivion. Even with the difficulty slider at MAX, I was killing everything
 with a single hit of the poison. and we all know how friggin hard that game can be with the slider up to max. The poisons were by FFFAARRR the most effective way of dispatching targets the easiest and quickest. You hit them with the poison and just try not
 to get hit while the poison decayed their flesh.<br />
<br />
What I was doing was using as many weakness to X in one spell, like weakness to fire/lightning/poison. And then I would make a poison that did x amount damage of fire/lightning/health over x amount of time. and the weakness to X element would increase the damage
 of the element itself, and the weakness to poison would stack with the weakness of X element and further increase the debuffing effect, and then I would hit them with the poison and it was doing some crazy damage .<br />
<br />
So I decided to play sky rim today and make a whole new character around what I've learned in oblivion about poisons. So I'm going down that alchemy tree heavy.<br />
In oblivion, there were spells that did, weakness to X element, but in sky rim I see those are actual poisons now and those spells don't exist. So I'm trying to see if I can achieve the same level of success with using these poisons to debuff the enemies and
 then, hit them with the damaging poisons and see what happens.<br />
<br />
Anyone here got any poison experience or tips you would like to share, any great ingredient combos you think I should know???<br />
<br />
I also see you can't no longer combine 4 ingredients like you could on oblivion, but now only three. This will make things…………….challenging.</p>

<p>My usual one two hit in Oblivion was a bow with 100% weakness to magic followed by a fireball. &nbsp;I have tried the weakness poisons in Skyrim but didn't notice any real use. Since the poison has to be applied each hit it disrupts my play to poison with a weakness,
 stop, poison with something else. I never really experimented with using an aversion poison on a bow that does the same damage. I mean poison a fire bow with aversion to fire. It would not have worked in Oblivion but I have no idea if it will in Skyrim. On
 the other hand, the one two I used in Oblivion would but there are no potions that give a total weakness. Sounds interesting so keep us posted.</p>

<p>"I have tried the weakness poisons in Skyrim but didn't notice any real use. Since the poison has to be applied each hit it disrupts my play to poison with a weakness, stop, poison with something else."</p>
<p>I see what you mean. That's where the lingering damage comes in handy at. You apply it once, and it does damage over time, instead of instantly, and having to apply another poison again and again. The lingering damage does more total damage than the damage
 health poisons, but lingering damage takes a longer time to dish out the total damage, where as the damage health does the total damage instantly.</p>
<p>In oblivion and in skyrim, I always used the damage over time, and stacked as much of it as I could. SO I would hit them with the weakness and then, hit them with the damage over time poison, and continue to attack or defend while the poison does it's thing
 over time. I got both set as hot keys so I don't have to go into any menus.</p>
<p>"I never really experimented with using an aversion poison on a bow that does the same damage. I mean poison a fire bow with aversion to fire. It would not have worked in Oblivion but I have no idea if it will in Skyrim."</p>
<p>Actually, it does work in oblivion and in skyrim. A bow that does fire damage and used fire aversion on it will, in fact, increase it's damage output. But the attack that applied the poison's effect does not get buffed with the effect, but all the attacks
 after, will be buffed for as long as the effect time. I currently, have a frost sword from a dungeon, and I put a weakness to frost 55% on it and the first strike, didn't seem to do much damage, but the attacks after, seemed to do more damage as I saw bigger
 chucks of health taken with each strike. This same thing applies in Oblivion. It works exactly the same.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, the one two I used in Oblivion would but there are no potions that give a total weakness. Sounds interesting so keep us posted."</p>
<p>About the poisons that gives no total weakness, I've personally seen potions that gives 100% weakness from store venders in the later game. But the REAL results comes from making them on your own, as you can make weakness potions that goes beyond 100% weakness.
 THIS is where the poisons really shine. Making weakness poisons go over 200% weakness will wreck havoc on enemies.</p>
<p>Crafting enchanted gear that has improved alchemy can really help with that along with a high alchemy level and perks.<br />
<br />
The thing I am quite interested in, is weakness effecting the enemies that has a natural immunity to poisons, like draugr. In oblivion, using a 100% weakness spell, made fire atronachs weak to fire……..let that sink in………….so yea, Im wondering if that same principle
 works in skyrim. &nbsp;But since it's not a spell, and it's a poison, and they are immune to poison, one would think that it wouldn't work. But what about weakness to fire aversion used on draugr??? since it's a poison, would it still work, or would it say, it's
 immune to poisons.<br />
<br />
questions questions questions I need answers to.<br />
<br />
I need to make me some more weakness poisons, and use it on a draugr and see what happens.</p>

<p>The nice thing about a weakness to magic is that it affects everyone and anything you put on it. So it is the best poison one would think but I have used it on high level mages and they laughed in my face. Remember that a draghr &nbsp;is resistant to poison not
 immune so a poison still may work. I find frost still works just fine on Nords because the stamina damage still works as well as a lowered but still there damage from the ice.</p>
<p>Likewise, to get nearly 100% resistance to fire/ice/shock you need to have those three on your gear plus a resistance to magic. They stack so you end up with about 97% resistance to the three elements.</p>

<p>I like using frenzy poisons, especially on a group of bandits delivered with a lower damage bow. Purely for the entertainment factor of course, those idiots need little encouragement to spill their cohorts guts on the floor. I rarely use other poisons except
 to sell, my usual bow kills most any biped with one shot, and a good many dragons who are not aware of my presence. Tipping that one with poison is just overkill.</p>

<p>I use the frenzy spell also Dre. It's cleaner than the poison, and I don't get involved as soon, or often completely escape while the dimwits scrap. If I stick one with an arrow, I'm usually found. I think I'm going to try the spell again before I hit my

<p>I've been busy overhauling the level 47 Imperial that really only did the main quest with a bow and some magic. She had a pile of perks she never used so I'm working her up to do mage armor and conjuration and was thinking of using illusion but wondered
 if frenzy and calm really work at high levels. I brought her illusion to 50 so I could get silent casting. I was thinking of using a bow with poison, conjured dremora and invisibility potions but was unsure about it. I haven't yet found a conjured anything
 that was as strong as me and they usually die and leave the baddie looking for something to kill. The perk tree on illusion just says spells work on higher levels but not how high. I was going to throw in potions but that just extends duration not strength.</p>
<p>I went and got Windstad so I can move everything from Honeyside and Breezehome into one location. Then I can get to work crafting gear to give me free magic, all the resistances and all those buff and poison potions. I made a bunch of Dragonbone arrows last
 night but need to go see where the rest of my dragon pieces/parts are. It is so much easier to stay organized and focused with the Hearthfire houses! In the early days I just dumped stuff whereever and my enchanted gear looks like it was crafted by a kid with
 ADD. I learned so much as I went along. This Imperial is the only one of my main 5 characters who never got pulled out again after Heathfire was introduced.</p>

<p>Poisons were a must in Oblivion at the harder difficulty settings. &nbsp;But I generally don't use them in Skyrim because so many of the top-level baddies are resistant. &nbsp;Nothing's worse than using your last really powerful poison against an enemy and seeing
 that it resisted the poison. &nbsp;I'll sometimes use Slow or a Slow/Damage Health on Bandits at lower levels, but mostly poisons are just for making money.</p>

    <title>Moving User Folders to Another Drive--Dropbox problem and Restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghnv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving User Folders to Another Drive--Dropbox problem and Restore Default problem</h2>
                    <p>I have three questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; One about what happened when I moved the Documents folder from the User folder to my D: drive</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The second about the effect of the move on my Dropbox folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The third about trying to move the Documents folder back to the C:\ drive and the User folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry about the amount of explanation I go into below, but I find so often that people who ask questions and those who give answers assume everybody knows too much and leave out important details. &nbsp;In fact, I think that's how I got into the trouble
 that I am in now. &nbsp;And the advice I followed came from Microsoft (as well as a couple of well-intentioned users on forum discussion sites).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new computer running Windows 8.1 Pro. &nbsp;It boots from an solid state drive, which has been designated C:. &nbsp;Because the SSD has limited space, I thought I would conserve its space by moving the User folder that takes up the most space--Documents--to
 the D: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the directions on the Microsoft webpage:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/redirect-folder-new-location#1TC=windows-7</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions there were pretty much the same as the one given for Windows 8 by a Microsoft representative at</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-files/how-to-move-user-folders-to-2nd-drive-in-windows-8/f58029d0-bfcf-4fab-a266-a56f6d9e65b5</p>
<p>
</p><p>I right-clicked on the Documents, selected Properties and the Location tab. &nbsp;In the prompt, I entered the location of a folder I'd created earler: &nbsp;D:\STUFF AKL. &nbsp; The move seemed successful. &nbsp;But two peculiarities puzzle me.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. &nbsp;In my file manager, the D:\STUFF AKL folder disappeared. &nbsp;My disk space analyzer showed the folder, but the Windows 8.1 File Explorer did not show the folder. &nbsp;Is this normal? &nbsp;Did the OS make the folder "invisible" when I moved
 a User folder into it?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">2. &nbsp;When I looked into the Documents folder, there were TWO Dropbox folders: &nbsp;one called Dropbox, the other called My Dropbox. Both had the same contents.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>THE SERIOUS PROBLEM OCCURRED WHEN I TRIED TO USE DROPBOX. &nbsp;It wouldn't sync properly. &nbsp;I'd create a folder in Dropbox on my new computer, and it wouldn't show up on my iPad. &nbsp;I'd create a document on my iPad and save it to a folder, and the document wouldn't
 show up in the folder on my new desktop computer (the one on which I'd moved Documents, and the Dropbox folder is in Documents).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to Dropbox.com and in instructions about moving the Dropbox folder, I found this warning:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Important</strong><span style="color: rgba(61, 70, 77, 1)">:
 Your Dropbox folder will keep the same name as before and can't be changed by using the move feature. &nbsp;Dropbox will not sync your Dropbox folder if it has been manually renamed<strong>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>or moved through your operating system</em></span></strong>. &nbsp;If Dropbox loses track of your Dropbox folder, it will attempt to re-sync the folder in its entirety using its last known location.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The article at Dropbox.com said that Dropbox should only be moved using the Dropbox app downloaded to your Windows 7 or 8 system. &nbsp;(Complaint--the warning came mid-way in the instructions for moving Dropbox, five paragraphs from the beginning, and it was
 printed in normal type. &nbsp;I emphasized it here in my email. &nbsp;WHY WOULDN'T YOU PUT SUCH A WARNING IN LARGE TYPE AND RED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE INSTRUCTIONS????)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided this whole business of moving User folders was too dangerous to fool around with. &nbsp;So, again, following instructions from Microsoft, I right-clicked on the Documents folder on my D: drive, selected Properties and then the Location tab. &nbsp;Then I
 clicked on Restore Default and "Yes" when prompted to move the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seemed to have worked. &nbsp;BUT . . . my file space analyzer app shows Documents in C:\Users again, but NOT my Dropbox folder. &nbsp;And the Documents folder is also still on my D: drive, and so are the Dropbox folders--Dropbox and My Dropbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my file management totally screwed up now? &nbsp;Is there any way to fix this? &nbsp;And why does Microsoft on-line documentation tell people that moving a User folder from C: to another drive can be done but doesn't warn about the possible dangers of this move?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is happening? &nbsp;Should I go in &nbsp;and delete the Documents folder?</p>
<p>

</p><p>

<p>I would need to see it to be sure, but I have a feeling that two issues may be at play.</p>
<ol>
<li>The folders inside your "personal" (user account) folder dropped the word "My" from their names back in Windows Vista. But you'd be forgiven for not noticing, because it was only missing at the file system level. If you opened a command line, the default
 document directly would not have the "My" in it (e.g. c:\users\shawn\documents).&nbsp; The reason you still see the word "My " is because of a naming trick carried out by a hidden file inside the folder called desktop.ini.<br />
<br />
This can make it difficult to rename files and folders, because you'll notice that the name they show on the icon is not the actual folder name.&nbsp; Here's&nbsp;a real example on my computer.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04a9316f-c854-45f5-b55f-62ce255270bd" /><br />
The desktop.ini files used for the user's own set of folders are more customized so that when you browse files in an office group, the folder would say "Shawn's Documents" instead of "My Documents".&nbsp; Yes it truly is that "smart" of a system, but as you can
 see it really just confuses users.&nbsp; But hey someone really put their heart into building that feature (in 1999) so I can't complain too much.<br />
<br />
These files are safe to delete (the worst that can happen is they get re-generated by whatever program put them there, or your icon will lose it's "specialness" and show the actual folder name.<br />
<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Your shell folders (the records of the settings you picked in the "locations" tab of each special folder) may need to be checked in the registry just to make sure they're consistent with what you want.&nbsp; How to do that I actually just wrote about.&nbsp; Take
 a look at the "answer" on this question page: "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-files/files-and-folders-from-root-showing-up-in-my/3b71459c-3619-4335-959f-142b6db26766">Files and folders
 from root showing up in my Desktop and Documents folder</a>". This was a user that had accidentally left out a folder for his location, so the root of his external drive literally became 'the documents folder'.&nbsp; Oops</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think these two together should help you get your stuff back tidied up.&nbsp; Let me know if you get stuck or have any questions</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am having the same problem with my Surface Pro 2 accessing the Internet. I fixed it once by uninstalling the Marvell Avastar Wireless Device and rebooting. It worked for about one week. What is happening?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not had the time to search for what I need to download on another computer and transfer to my tablet.</p>
<p>Can we get a permanent fix on this?</p>

    <title>Surface Book CPU Fan stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> satanoperca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book CPU Fan stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I often use my Surface Book for some heavy calculations in Matlab, but yesterday the book suddenly made a strange noise - sounding like a hickup - not from its speakers, but from the clipboard itself. As I thought this was not normal, I shut it down and
 waited until the next day to turn it on again (it was in the evening when it happened). So far, everything seems to be back to normal, but when I stress the CPU, I can't hear a fan. I'm worried that the fan broke. I ran Prime95 and the CPU temperature exceeded
 100°C, which seems to be a bit too hot and still no fan kicking in. Is there any way to manually try to check if it works (maybe by just setting the fan speed to some value and looking if I can hear it?). The device is out of warranty unfortunately, but I've
 always transported it in a case and have taken great care of it as it an expensive laptop.&nbsp;</p>

            I wouldn't recommend using a CPU melting bench program like Prime95 on any SB. My desktop CPU can hit 95 degrees using Prime95 with liquid cooling on a cold boot. That being said, my SB2 also runs at 100 degrees using Google Chrome, so... I'd also be interested
 to know if there was a way to see the RPMs on the internal fan.

            I only used it to heat up the CPU so that the fan should kick in, which it didn't. When your CPU reaches 100 degrees, can you hear the fan? Because I could hear it, whereas now the SB is absolutely silent.&nbsp;

            Sometimes the fan turns on, sometimes it doesn't. I also made a complaint about this in

<p>Heya,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you still have the problem or did you get it fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have similar problems when using graphics heavy softwares. The fans stop working then and the CPU falls drastically resulting in choppy and laggy screen. The only way I found to fix it was to unplug power from the laptop, then Alt-tab to desktop at which
 the fans come roaring to life to cool the system down. The get back into the software (at which point the fans will keep working), then plug power in. Give this a try and see if it works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully they come with patches around this soon.</p>
<p>

            <p>What I'd want, is to restore my SP built-in restore capability (out from the recovery partition and not from an external media).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are your suggestions going to help to solve this problem or are they a different way to restore my device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the following article "https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-or-reset-surface?os=windows-8.1-update-1":</p>
<p>what will happen from Step 5? Will the process update the recovery partition on the device out from the USB key or just install Windows and not update the recovery partition at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, will I need a installation Key during all this process? I don't have access to the one from the preinstalled Windows I believe. Do I?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>
