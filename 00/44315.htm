<h2>            My home wireless does not show up on as an available network on my work laptop and always did before.</h2>
                    <p>My home wireless does not show up on as an available network on my work laptop and always did before.&nbsp; It does show up and connect on my personal laptop. I have a Linksys Broadband Router - been using it for at least two years with no problems until this.&nbsp;
 I know that my wireless is working on my laptop because there is one unsecured network listed in the window of available.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A really odd thing that happened two weeks ago (and I don't know if it is related) was my personal laptop was fine for several hours - then it kept dropping the internet connection.&nbsp; I could not get it to stay connected - rebooting etc. did not work.&nbsp; I
 have not connected again until today - and it is what I am using now.&nbsp; It connected fine today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My work laptop had been connected to my wireless network ealier in the week but when I tried to connect as normal on Thursday evening it did not connect automatically as it always has done in the past.&nbsp; Nothing changed.&nbsp; The security patches my company had
 sent through for this week did not download until after I had tried to connect and could not.&nbsp; Nothing was new - there was no reason that I should not have connected automatically just as I have in the past.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What changes have you made prior to this issue?</li><li>Did the issue persist in safe mode?</li></ul>

<p>I googled this issue and followed one recommendation to remove/disconnected all add-on external devices in my laptop.&nbsp; Reboot my PC and it worked fine. Looks like a driver issue.<br />

    <title>Qbasic on my web pages&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> max keon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Qbasic on my web pages&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My original question was: <br />
Am I permitted to store a downloadable copy of Qbasic on my web <br />
pages???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply: <br />
Unfortunately the issue is not clear, please answer these <br />
questions so that we can understand the issue and help you <br />
better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the Operating System installed on your computer?<br />
2. What do you mean by "Am I permitted to store a downloadable <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of Qbasic on my web pages. <br />
3. Where do you want to store qbasic?<br />
------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to answer these questions is with an example of <br />
how I intend to use Qbasic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For question 3; Qbasic will need to be accessible from somewhere <br />
on the web, preferably Microsoft. For the example, I've stored <br />
an executable zip file containing Qbasic.exe and Qbasic.hlp on <br />
my web pages. The link to the zip file is provided on a test page <br />
which is set up to accommodate almost any level of expertise. <br />
<a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/mskeon/qbastest.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://members.optusnet.com.au/mskeon/qbastest.html</a><br />
The link to the test page would normally precede a Qbasic program <br />
written on some other web page. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current Qbasic program of interest to me is about half way <br />
down the web page at this address <br />
<a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/mskeon/pioneer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://members.optusnet.com.au/mskeon/pioneer.html</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help will be much appreciated. </p>

<br />
You can the Deskjet 970c driver as a good match for the Photosmart 1115. (I am assuming you have the Photosmart 1115 with the 45 and 78 cartridges.&nbsp; There is also a (Photosmart) PSC 1115 which is an all-in-one that uses different drivers.)<br />

<h2>            Cortana changes mic volume to 34&#37; when using &#34;Hey Cortana&#34; or clicking on the mic</h2>
                    <p><strong>System Information</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer - HP Pavillion p6330f using multi-boot environment (Specs can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c01969881-32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="HP Pavilion p6330f Desktop PC Product Specifications">HERE</a>)</p>
<p>Primary Operating System - Windows 10 Home 64-bits (Cleanly installed after upgrade)</p>
<p>Secondary Operating System - Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bits (Original Operating System)</p>
<p>Compatibility Operating System - Windows XP Professional 32-bits (For apps that do not work on anything later)</p>
<p><strong>Hardware changes, or additions</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Replacement of 1TB HDD with 7200RPM of equal size</p>
<p>Addition of two additional internal HDDs 3TB each</p>
<p>Addition of PNY NVidia GeForce GT 610 (2GB) Graphics card</p>
<p>Addition of Rocketfish 2 port USB 3.0 internal add-in card</p>
<p>Addition of PCI Express Wi-Fi add-in card</p>
<p>Added more RAM for a total of 8GB</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally keep my mic volume set at 100%, because for some odd reason other people on skype (and other voice apps) can't hear me if it's lower. Every time I use "Hey Cortana" or I click on the mic icon in Cortana's search box, my mic volume is
 reduced to 34% and i have to manually reset it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This causes problems in Cortana, because when she turns the mic volume down, she can barely hear me, and I have to speak louder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I've tried</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Manually changed the Mic volume, thinking it might have been set that way before. It just resets back to 35% when Cortana's voice stuff is used</p>
<p>2. Completely shutdown windows, and cut power (Power reset) then started computer again. Had no affect.</p>
<p>3. Restarted windows. No affect</p>
<p>4. Disabled all enhancements in the enhancements tab of Microphone properties. No affect</p>
<p>5. in the "Communications" tab of the sound options dialog, I set it to Do nothing. no affect</p>
<p>6. disabled Exclusive mode in the advanced tab of the microphone properties. No affect</p>
<p>7. This only happens when using "Hey Cortana" or other Cortana related voice stuff. No other voice software changes my mic volume automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>All settings that I've changed for troubleshooting purposes were put back to their defaults prior to submitting this post.</p>
<p>This system uses Realtech HD Audio.</p>

<h2>            Issues after update 24.12.15</h2>
                    <p>Hi community&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>after allowing microsoft updates on the 24th December the updates appear to have knocked out the USB hub stating it doesn't have a drive and no drives can be found. Obviously my mouse, keyboard (both microsoft ware) have been knocked out as well as the touch
 screen on my HP laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a system restore to no avail twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Report says - standard enhanced PCI to USB host controller doesn't have a driver. USB Hub also no driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice? Thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;Unfortunately none of the suggested fixes have resolved the problem. &nbsp;It keeps saying the required drivers are not available. &nbsp;Do you think upgrading to windows 10 will solve the problem? &nbsp;It seems clear that Microsoft caused this
 problem in the first place as it all started after installing their updates. &nbsp;Any further suggestions would be much appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks again for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are facing issue with the drivers then it may continue with Windows 10. As drivers are the basic requirement for any hardware device to work properly. If you were unable to find drivers from

<p>
</p><p>Do keep us updated.</p>

<h2>            Why do my pictures show as icons instead of pictures&#63; This just randomly changed in Windows 10.</h2>
                    When I click on the folder of pictures, it used to show a little image of the picture. Now it just shows the name of it. I can't stand trying to preview each picture when they have names like AE100.jpg. I want to see the picture! This just changed and
 I can't get it back. I click on "list view" or whatever, and I still don't see the pictures, just the names of them. Help me pleas!

    <title>Microphone Latency&#47;delay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> el-n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone Latency&#47;delay </h2>
                    I have a Dell studio edition laptop with two headphone jacks and a mic input jack. Recent bought a condensor mic and a Mackie 802-VLZ3 mixer to hook the mic to. Now I plug the mixer to the mic input jack and when you speak into the mic, there a delay.
 How do I fix that problem?

<p>You are using a pro Mixer with probably a "cheapo" on board sound card. Its a standard problem.</p>
<p>To reduce latency, in an ideal world, you really need to have either a dedicated USB or Firewire sound device and disable your on-board sound device. You can then play with the I/O buffers to reduce the latenc until you get no delay..</p>
<p>That being said, you don't say what software you're using to record with. If its something like Sonar or Cubase, you can also play with the I/O buffers of the software.</p>

            BS. Its strictly a problem with using Windows 7. It has absolutely nothing to so with the driver. I've been recording professionally this way for years and also hold a Masters in Computer Science with a Minor in Programming. I can safely and boldly tell
 you that Microsoft has committed a major crime with Windows 7. They have created a huge problem with the audio architecture which has caused a huge latency problem. To them its not an issue. But to thousands of engineers out there it is indeed an issue to
 gripe about. Those stiffs at Miscrosuck are waiting for the consumer to find a fix while they sit and simmer in their air conditioned offices. Do a Good search and see just how many thousands of posts there are about this across the internet since 2008. Also
 notice the typically automated style responses you get from Microsoft. Reminds me of those incompetents working for AT&amp;T customer service. Update your drivers and watch NOTHING change.

<p>I completely agree with JohnSull.&nbsp; I have 1 firewire, 2 different USB and an Audigy Platnium.&nbsp; All of them respond the same on two different Dell XPS models under windows 7 with a delay of 500-1000ms.&nbsp; XP works properly regardless of the interface or PC
 hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I too have been watching these threads across the net for about a year and the only thing I can find that's even close to an answer is the Microsoft posting a psuedo automated response refering to a link on how to hook a cable into your line
 in for a microphone or even better going to the surefire answer of "this is a driver problem".&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a recording professional, this irritates the life out of me and the longer Microsoft waits to fix the problem - the more money goes into the bank to replace all PC's with a Mac capable of the same functionality.</p>

<p>Dear Both,</p>
<p>No 2 PC's are the same. What works for one, may not work for another. But then, I don't have a Major in PC science nor a Minor in programming ..... My university was hands on, hands dirty under the bonnet work.</p>
<p>FWIW, I have no latency delays, and a perfectly good working DAW, have had through XP and now W7. So if it works for me, why not for you lot ???</p>
<p>Its too easy to blame MS, you just need to take the time and sort through your poorly set up PC, one thing at a time.</p>
<p>Mr Minor Programme : you should know that 3rd party drivers are sometimes VERY shoddily written, and that if you go to DAW forums, the emphasis is not on blaming MS, but the hardware manufacturer's driver writer.</p>
<p>I did a search for Latency in W7, and there are a lot of fixes on the web, suggest you both take the time to read some of them instead of sounding off like novice schoolboys.</p>
<p>For a professional, Mr Calibrated, I would suggest you give your PC to a real pro and get him/her to set it up for DAW work for you.</p>
<p>And with that,</p>
<p>Have a nice day</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

<p>Check out that thread. There are some fixes mentioned that have seemed to work for some people, and you might be lucky enough to join their ranks. If you have a RealTek sound card and only need to record through the mic input, there is a fairly simple solution
 that works and is mentioned several times in the forementioned thread. If you have a different sound card, let us know what it is.</p>

<h2>            Lexmark X85 Printer driver hangs for hours</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all<br />
i was wondering if anyone else have came accross the problem with the drivers for the lexmark X85 within windows7 RC Build 7100<br />
when installing the drives all goes well up to the point of placing the USB cable in and then it goes to setup and just hangs there overnight if i let it,
<br />
and on checking the running process in task manager it says it is running.<br />
The printer works fine with XP home and Vista home, ive even tried all the compatility options and to no avail<br />
Does anyone know if there is a patch or workaround so i can use my printer or do i have to go and buy another printer to use with windows7 as i will be buying windows7 when it is finaly released<br />
thank you in advance<br />
<br />
please let me know if i have not&nbsp;supplied enough information within the SPECS<br />

<p><span>Hi 123ray,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Most hardware manufacturers are planning on having a driver available by the time Windows 7 is officially released.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you might try turning off your anti-virus and firewall software will trying your printer install.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype require more ports than officially listed &#33; Which ones are really in use and should be opened&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At our organization we faced an issue where Skype is constantly showing "connecting" in our internal network. From public network status is fine.</p>
<p>I ensured that all "official" Skype ports are open:</p>
<p>443/TCP<br />
3478-3481/UDP<br />
49152-65535/UDP + TCP</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it still does not work properly. I tested opening all high TCP ports (&gt;1024) and then it started to work as it should. But as we all understand it`s not a good configuration for business environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone advise which Skype ports are really in use? Skype version 7.37.32.103</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Some users are not even able to connect.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That is true, using those ports are fine, but if this is for Skype connection or connecting issue, let me set your expectation that we are aware of an issue with some
<strong>Skype accounts experiencing unusual behaviors in both Skype and New Skype.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some following symptoms are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Presence labeled as blue spinning circle</p>
<p>- Cannot send instant messages</p>
<p>- Contacts show as offline</p>
<p>- Appear offline to others</p>

<p>Persistence is the only way. Just be glad it wasnt your controller i sent my Day One controller in back in January and they said they never got it. As it turns out they did have it. they just never filled the order due the manufacture not creating any extra
 stock of the item they couldnt fill my order. This is not what they told me they said they didnt get it but after Tons of calls and Reporting &nbsp;it and Escalating it i got no responses. Finnally i Demanded to know what the heck was happening with some poor guy
 who just happened to be the straw that broke the camels back. He then had to break protocol and Get a Email to his boss who contacted Tier 3 Boss who then Emailed me assuring me they did have my controller and that they were going to send me a new one as soon
 as tehy possible could.</p>

<p>Oh my! Well I think I have something to add to this. </p>
<p>On February 17th I placed a Service request for my Day One Edition Controller since the mic port didnt seem to work. I sent it in a bit later because I wanted to fully enjoy the Titanfall Beta. They received it on February 27th as confirmed by them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I was promised that I would get it by Titanfall (March 11). That did not happen.</p>
<p>Days later I was told that it was on its way to the shipping carrier and that I would receive an email within an hour.FALSE!
</p>
<p>Then one chat support rep told me that they did not have any in stock.</p>
<p>One said that there was confusion with the shipping carrier that I chose. So they tried turning it on me.
</p>
<p>Then they decided to "escalate" my case to the Advocacy Team and told me to wait 3-5 days for a response.
</p>
<p>I waited and was told that I could still receive a message on a Saturday because they work 7 days a week. Well on Saturday I got nothing from them and told them and said to wait until Monday. On Monday I got nothing so I contacted them again. I was literally
 told that they never did actually elevate my case to the advocacy team after 2 people told me it was. So now they did escalate my case and had to wait ANOTHER 3-5 days. I didnt hear anything from the team. Contacted them again and said they were working on
 it and had to wait yet ANOTHER 3-5 days!! I was told by MANAGER LEE that the advocacy team promised that I would get my replacement on March 28th, GOT NOTHING! I finally got a message today, Saturday March 29,2014. Which is a day they dont actually "operate".
 They told me they are completely out of stock an would send it to me as soon as they have more. That could be 2 years from now. That doesnt tell me anything. Why do I have to escalate a case, where they set me as "priority" and later "top priority" just so
 they can tell me they have none. What happened to the promises they made?To the control I was supposed to receive yesterday? I have a lot of snapshots of most of the lies they made and a lot of the transcripts as well. I didnt get some of the earlier lies
 because I thought they were being honest and didnt start recording everything until I began to notice all of their BS!
</p>
<p>Please if there is anyone else going through something similar,do share it! Their service seems good and everyone is nice but in reality, it's absolutely terrible. I shared some of the snapshots with the Twitter team and they said "Dear goodness!!" and asked
 me to DM them instead. I never really snapped at anyone because I worked with customer service and dealing with people but man Im so close.

<p>At the moment i have been over a month without a working console.</p>
<p>I got a day one console that worked fine for the first few months. Then in February noticed the fan was making a weird ticking noise like something was catching.</p>
<p>Put in a repair request and sent it off. Got it "repaired" and sent back about a week or so later. It was still exactly the same. So i got onto customer support and told them that i wasnt happy because theyd done nothing. The CS woman arranged for me to
 have a replacement console sent.</p>
<p>This new one was even worse. The hard drive sounds broken. A very loud ticking, scratchinng noise that doesnt go away when you put a game on. It also started making my tv do weird noises even while muted.</p>
<p>So i go on live chat again to explain whats wrong. I am told because it is my 3rd repair request it has been escalated to the advocacy team who will contact me by phone or email within 72 hours. I wait a week and havent had any contact. So i contact them
 again mid-week to be told "by Friday".</p>
<p>Friday comes and goes and still no contact so i go on live chat again and explain whats been going on. This time the guy starts a new service request, apparently writes everything down for documentation and tells me ill receive contact within 5 days.</p>
<p>Again the 5 days pass and still nothing. So i go on chat again and tell them whats going on and that im getting pretty sick of it now. I wouldnt care if they said it was going to take me a week or month to get it sorted, just so long as they tell me something.
 He tells me the team know about my request and that he will personally chase it up for me and contact me by phone in 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>No prizes for guessing i havent heard anything still :( I am seriously at my wits end. Even though ive bought games for it i think at this point id rather send the rest of the console back and get a refund :(</p>

<p>Yes, their service is Horrible! Like Ashielle Said, I don't mind waiting as long as they tell me something. They just told me to wait and that they would let me know when they have a replacement. That could take forever, I dont know! I got a message from
 the advocacy team and everyone said they had the power to do things but all they want me to do is wait. I grow impatient like that. its ridiculous!

            <p>Hello Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need some more information about the issue so that we can help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you receive any error message or code when you say, "when I close one window it closes 2 or all open windows"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts or if Windows is infected by a virus or malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode and check.</strong><br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a></p>
<p><br />
If the issue does not persist in safe mode, then use step 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Perform clean boot </strong>and check.<br />
<strong>Refer this article:</strong><br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Run Microsoft safety scanner to check for virus or malware.</strong><br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>These are probably unrelated issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have several windows open as in explorer for example, you can shut down the last in a chain of related windows by holding the shift key down while closing it.&nbsp; Is it possible you are doing that?&nbsp; Could be intentional or a failing keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for clicking on a favourite, responsiveness of that web page is almost always the result of the web site's performance.&nbsp; It is unlikely it is the result of your computer or internet service.</p>

<p>Sounds like it is failing</p>
<p>Easiest is to connect it to another usb port</p>
<p>If using a wireless mouse try a wired mouse.</p>

<h2>            Xbox always freezes</h2>
                    
<p>So i;ve had my xbox one since the day it was released and i;ve noticed these past 6 or so months it freezes daily, i cant go a day without hard restarting the system because it has frozen in between windows when im trying to do something, when it has frozen
 the only thing way i can get &nbsp;response out of he console is when i hold down the xbox button to bring up the "shut down console or controller" window but even after that it wont respond if i click on either option and this happens daily. Another issue with
 my xbox is that sometimes and this is not as likely as the freezing thing but sometimes i'll cut it on and it wont be connected to xbox live, it will be be like its not connected to the network and the only way to fix this is to hard restart because nothing
 is wrong with my network cause the console was just connected last night and every other device is connected. My last issue is that sometimes it will say the kinect isnt connected either when its plugged in the back and nothing has changed. But seriously is
 my console defected?</p>

<h2>            DxDiag problem during gameplay</h2>
                    <p>This has only happened while playing "The Hunter Classic".</p>
<p>DxDiag starts by itself, closing the game and the report presents no error, as shown in the photos below. There was no problem before, but after the 21.11.2017 update, version 1709, the game has been forcibly closed by DxDiag when it starts.</p>
<p>How can I disable the program from automatically running?</p>

<h2>            windows 8.1 pro update problems error&#58; 0xc0000135</h2>
                    Everytime I try and upgrade to windows 8.1 pro through the windows store, I keep getting the same error code after it has applied changes and has gone to Gathering information.<br />
The error code is always 0xc0000135. How can I fix this?<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you have installed any third party security software like antivirus program/firewall, they can interfere with the download. I would suggest you to temporarily disable and check if you are able to download the update.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><b>Important Note:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to
 install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</font></font></font></p>

            Thanks very much for your reply. I have a essential program though that the update checker says will not work in windows 8.1, although it works in 8, so I am just going to continue to use windows 8.<br />
