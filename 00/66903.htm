View Details</strong>. The window that opens displays the error code for that update.
</li><li>Also, check the status of the Windows 7 SP 1. Make sure it is installed.</li></ol>
<p>Now, if you see that Windows 7 SP 1 is already installed and even after successfully installing the failed updates (if any) you still facing this issue then perform these steps:</p>

<strong>updates</strong>” and search for the <strong>Service</strong> <strong>Pack</strong>
<strong>1</strong> from the list of <strong>installed updates</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>Right</span></strong><span>
<strong>Click</strong> on the update and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
&nbsp;

<h2>            Cannot view shares on a computer running Windows 10 Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Recently updated my laptop to Creators Update. For several days everything worked as usual. A few days ago file sharing stopped working. The details:</p>
<ul>
<li>net view \\computername shows all shares</li><li>net view \\ip-address shows error 53 and no shares</li><li>ipconfig shows on lan card that netbios over tcp/ip is disabled. No changes in settings change this</li><li>nbtstat -r shows: NetBT is not bound to any devices</li><li>using powershell to enable/disable smb1 and smb2/3 does not help.</li><li>the problem does not limited to lan, the same happens on wlan as well. </li><li>no driver change of lan card can change </li><li>using Fing on mobile device shows that the computer does not provide smb over ip service (on port 445). It&nbsp;is the case with&nbsp;switched off firewall as well.</li><li>only two Windows update package was installed prior to this, removing them changes nothing</li><li>other computer with the same Windows version does not produce this error on the same local network.</li></ul>
<p>I've run out of options. Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>No luck. Changed the name of the computer, reboot, no shares by ip, only by name. The thread you suggested is about an earlier (yet similar) problem, which was fixed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Mine is a new one, and it started weeks after updating to CU.</p>

<p>I made some progress in this. As&nbsp;nbtstat -r shows: NetBT is not bound to any devices I tried to find ways to bind netbt to a device. I found a registry entry (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetBT\Linkage) that has values containing lists of interfaces.
 The guid of the lan card (taken from HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards) was not in any of those lists, so I've added to them and restarted. Now netbios was enabled on LAN but shares were not accessible. I found further registry
 keys for smb (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Lanmanager and lanmanagerworkstation) and amended the lists there too. After restarting shares started to work at some extent. Locally net view showed shares by ip, other Windows computers where able to
 see shares but only if I created the proper credentials manually. Simply by selecting the computer in Explorer it asks for username and password but unable to accept the correct one (Microsoft account).</p>
<p>Some other devices (a mediaplayer) are not able to see the shares.</p>
<p>Is it a better way to correct these bindings and the missing other settings? Possibly a tool to manage SMB settings?</p>

<p>Since that the issue still persists, we recommend that you go back to the previous build of Windows you had before the Creators Update. Kindly refer to this Wiki article created by J W Stuart for the steps:

            I'd also like to add that my Toshiba PC reports the same Windows 8.1 update error along with "never" having checked for recent updates- which isn't true. (I went a long time (months) between updates but performed a bulky download successfully recently.)
 I am on a metered&nbsp; connection so I do it when it is economical for me. I also refreshed my browser when facebook claimed I hadn't cookies enabled, which was also false. That seemed to be a facebook stand alone issue. That remains unresolved too.&nbsp;Usoft says
 all my update issues are fixed, but this one remains. Good Luck

<h2>            Can&#39;t run .exe file</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am running Windows 10 on a laptop which has all of a sudden stopped running any .exe files. As we as this I can run anything through the command prompt - it just delivers an error message, nor does any Adobe function work, Microsoft Office, or either
 of the Chrome or Firefox browsers (Edge still works, but internet explorer does not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched every forum I can for answers and the issues I have appear to prevent me from running any of the suggested fixes. Any help would be greatly appreciated as the only thing I can use my laptop for now is to browse the internet.</p>
<p>

            We see that you are still having issues running .exe files. Since you are getting<strong> No such interface supported error</strong> when running SFC scan and regedit, we would suggest that you place the computer in
<strong>clean boot </strong>and check if you are able to open .exe files. Check this

<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.

    <title>Disconnecting while playing F1 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gray92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disconnecting while playing F1 2011</h2>
                    
<p>Over the past week I've been having random disconnects from Xbox Live whenever I start playing F1 2011. At first it happened about once or twice a day but now it's got to the stage where I can't last ten minutes without being disconnected and have to completely
 restart my router to be able sign back in. I can play any other game or sit on the dashboard without having this problem, it only happens on F1. :/</p>
<p>It can't be an internet problem either from what I can tell because my PC and PS3 stay connected while the Xbox cuts off.</p>
<p>I tried re-downloading my profile last night and it didn't help.</p>
<p>These are the error codes I get when I try run a network test.</p>
<p>W: 0000 - 0021<br />
X: 8000 - 100D<br />
Y: 0000 - 0000<br />
Z: 0000 - 0000<br />
ID: 0001- 0003<br />
L: 8015 - 1904<br />
Q: 801C - 274C</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated as this games become unplayable. :(</p>

<p>Hey Gray, I just want to be 100 percent sure that this is the only game on your console having this issue. If you're able to use other Xbox 360 games and services without disconnecting, then I'm afraid it sounds like there's an issue with that game's servers.
 Have you contacted the developer/publisher about the issue? </p>

<p>I have been having a similar issue...</p>
<p>I started playing F1 2011 a few weeks ago, and whether I'm playing online or offline, I find I get disconnected after a random period of time. &nbsp;Sometimes it's 20 minutes, sometimes 90. &nbsp;I get disconnected from everything, even if I'm not on the internet
 for anything else.</p>
<p>I even had the internet radio on and found it kept going whilst the Xbox disconnected. &nbsp;I got rid of all the silly set-ups I had in my wireless router and this proved fruitless. &nbsp;It is only F1 2011 that does this, and I have no problem with FIFA12 or BF3.</p>
<p>I use Virgin Media's broadband service.</p>

<p>Hello there Colin Devaney! As Mister Fitzer stated, if this is only occurring with F1 2011 it is most likely a matter of the game server's. Have you contacted the developer/publisher? If you would like though, you are also welcome to create your own thread
 in this forum after reviewing our <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/155724.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi bhaney,</p>
<p>As I see from your post, a background program or any of the third party service is interfering with your program.</p>
<p>Clean Boot will help you start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program or any of the third party service is interfering with your program.</p>
<p>To find out which startup application is causing the issue, you may perform clean boot.</p>
<p><strong>Note </strong>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)
<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.</p>
<p>Note Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do
 this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK, and then click Restart.</p>
<p>For more information on clean boot, you may visit the link mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><strong>Note: Set the computer in normal start startup after the issue is resolved.</strong></p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to run online scan to remove any malware or spywares from the system. To do this, visit the following link and run the scan:<br />

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am in Word or Excel etc. If I go to save as &amp; choose a network location it can take up to a minute before I can open the folder.</p>
<p>Does the same from google chrome etc &amp; download a file to network locations.</p>
<p>Anything local is instant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I almost immediately shows the 3 folders being shared, but click on 1 and it is greyed out for perhaps 30 second to a minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does it for any network location, 2 other win 8.1 PC's, a WD My Book Live.</p>

</p>
<p>It has done this since upgrading to 8.1, don;t think it ever happened under 8.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have actually has a HD failure so had to do a full FRESH install and was not really concentrating on this issue during recovery but 99% sure it was OK on 8.0 and as soon as I put 8.1 on it is doing it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also changed routers recently &amp; switches &amp; did it before &amp; after so not this.</p>

</p><p>The odd thing I have just noticed, when I click save as/choose network location/click on a folder, it goes grey, if I CANCEL and click on the folder straight away it seems to open it without delay.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to make Edge pages pinned to taskbar open up as individual pages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pool mansiere  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make Edge pages pinned to taskbar open up as individual pages vs.  window of tabs</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,<br />
<br />
Like most people I've been MEH on using Edge as my main browser.&nbsp; Most people seem to prefer Chrome and I prefer Firefox Quantum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Edge recently introduced a feature that really interests me but they didn't finish the idea.&nbsp; I would use Edge WAY more often
 if it offered this full functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an Android user.&nbsp; Whether MS likes it or not I want to use Google Maps, Google Inbox, Contacts, Calendar, Keep, Play Music, and Photos in my taskbar.&nbsp; In this way I have zero fear of syncing issues since there is nothing to sync.&nbsp; In addition I want
 to pin my Ecobee web interface to my taskbar as well as some third party webpages I frequent too much.<br />
<br />
Edge gives me the ability to pin so many of these apps.&nbsp; In a way easier than Google does.&nbsp; One click (instead of 12) and BOOM it's in my taskbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f853bcf-f49a-42a2-b8f5-a4293b02e6cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f853bcf-f49a-42a2-b8f5-a4293b02e6cb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of waiting for apps to arrive in the Windows Store we simply click a button in Edge and voila it's in the taskbar.&nbsp; The problem is these Windows do NOT open independently.&nbsp; Yes, the first one does, but after that they start tabbing onto the previous
 window.&nbsp; This removes the app 'feel' to this feature.<br />
<br />
If that wasn't clear:&nbsp; when I open, say, Google Play Music -- I want Edge to open that window as an app.&nbsp; (Which it does.)&nbsp; But if I then open Google Photos -- Edge simply adds Photos as a 'tab' beside Play Music.&nbsp; I do NOT want that.&nbsp; Or why bother having
 separate items in the taskbar?<br />
<br />
It seems Windows is (understandably) worried that if they offer this feature this way their own mail and music and contacts will suffer.&nbsp; I get that.&nbsp; But the thing is Microsoft failed to launch a phone ecosystem.&nbsp; And so what they need to do is offer a way
 to piggyback the Google ecosystem.&nbsp; By doing so the appeal of a Chromebook becomes even less interesting.&nbsp; Having all those web apps in the taskbar plus access to alternative software on the web is Window's last selling point.&nbsp; And it's a good one.<br />
<br />
If Windows is already working on progressive web apps for their store, goodee, but in the meantime simply add a feature to the browser.&nbsp; One I read IE already had.&nbsp; The ability to make each window open a new window instead of a new tab.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 8.1 Calendar reminders always set to 18 hours, how do I change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nigelpinsent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Calendar reminders always set to 18 hours, how do I change that&#63;</h2>
                    My calendar app always sets my default reminder time to 18 hours before the event and for the life of me I cannot find the option to turn it off! &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also own a Windows 8 phone and when making entries to the calendar on that the default is set to 18 hours (there is no option to change that on the phone) so I'm guessing that as my phone and laptop sync calendars its an Outlook.com setting but again,
 I can find no options online to change the default notification times. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Simple functionality appears to be missing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone else had an issue like this? &nbsp;If so what did you do to fix it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks all.</div>

            It appears that the default for All Day Events is 18 hours and you can't change that, although you can&nbsp; of course change the reminder on individual events from the default to anything you like. Non all day events default to 15 minutes.<br />

            That's not happening to me Gordon. &nbsp;All day/non all day events all default to 18 hours. &nbsp;I just want to turn them off, I don't want any notification for my calendar entries. &nbsp;Why would Microsoft believe that everyone wants a notification for all calendar

            This is a very annoying "feature" that should be put to sleep with the fishes immediately. I get automatic reminders attached to every single calendar item I add, WPhone or Windows 8.1, and it's 15 minutes for regular appointments, 18 hours for all-day.
 This is exceedingly annoying not only because I only want a reminder on perhaps 20% of my calendar entries, it's tough to remember the reminder is there because in both cases (phone and W8.1) the reminder is HIDDEN in the default entry view, until you click
 for more details. This should, at the minimum, be a default that can be individually set.

            I found this thread when browsing for a similar issue.<br />
<br />
When I make an appointment in the Calender app on my Surface, and explicitly set reminders to -none-, outlook.com still has a 18 hour reminder when opening the appointment there.<br />
It screws up my calenders on my phone and Thunderbird.<br />
<br />
It's just silly, please stop doing that. It's aggravatingly annoying.<br />

            Best of all, now when you specifically set a different reminder timing for an event, the calendar app ignores what you tell it and it reverted to 18 hours. Another triumph for the windows team. Why waste time fixing obvious program bugs when you can spend
 time trying to emulate Android hamburger menus?

<p>Very annoying is right! </p>
<p>We have our calendar set up to sync via Outlook Calendar and Exchange ActiveSync to both our phone calendars. If we create an appointment in the evening and forget to go in to the appointment, and then into the hidden settings, and then turn off the reminder,
 alarms go off on our phones and our W8 tablet at 1 - 3 a.m.!!!</p>
<p>FOR SHAME MICROSOFT - how&nbsp;was this ever fit for release in this state!!! WHY is this not a priority for you to FIX!!!!</p>

<p>Agreed. When creating a new event in W8.1 Calendar on my up-to-date version:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. It defaults to creating an All-Day event - you have to go into Add Details and actively change that it you don't want an all day event,</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. It has already set the reminder to 18 Hours, and to change this you have to "Show More", and actively change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you forget to do these things, or don't know that they are necessary,&nbsp;as is very easy especially because the reminder setting is hidden by default,&nbsp;then if you create any evening appointments, you will be helpfully reminded of them in the early hours
 of the morning. (19:00-18 hours=01:00).</p>

<p>
</p><p>The file was not under number 1 but was under number 2.&nbsp; I tried to delete it but windows said the file is no longer located there.&nbsp; Is there somewhere in windows that the actual icon is stored?&nbsp; Perhaps in the registry?&nbsp; Oh, by the way, a reboot did not
 help.</p>

                    <p>I've blocked an App in Family Safety setting for Win 10 device.&nbsp; The Family Safety web site accepted the blocking of an App when clicking on "Block" by changing to "Blocked".&nbsp; When I refreshed the page the App would not retain the "Blocked" status, hence
 the App is still able to run.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Audio not working on only SOME applications</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been having a problem with my system audio for 4-6 weeks now. In that time (about 2 weeks ago) I upgraded to Windows 10 hoping it was a windows 7 issue but its still here. As title implies I have audio working in some programs but not others. Here's
 an example list: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Working: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome</p>
<p>Edge</p>
<p>GTA V on steam (sometimes) </p>
<p>Spintires on steam</p>
<p>Steinberg Cubase 8</p>
<p>Ableton Live</p>
<p>Firefox (on blackboard) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not working: </p>
<p>Firefox (youtube, dailymotion, etc) </p>
<p>All other steam/origin games (Fifa 16, SNOW, Just cause 2 &amp; 3, etc)</p>
<p>Viber</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Important to note: </span></strong></p>
<p>I'm using a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 external USB audio interface (for recording from piano and sending everything to studio monitors but this isn't an issue with the hardware. I have successfully
 done the test speakers tool in windows audio menu and it responds to both the external interface and the motherboard I/O speaker outputs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">what i've tried so far: </span>
</strong></p>
<p>1) tried to update drivers. Winows said I was up to date but i knew that was false so I force uninstalled and downloaded official drivers from Focusrite for external hub and realtek for the
 HD audio. </p>
<p>2)tried uninstalling/reinstalling affected progams.</p>
<p>3) ran the "troubleshoot problems" utility and it came back with this:
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37edca57-dff7-4c97-93fd-8bfe2473fec1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37edca57-dff7-4c97-93fd-8bfe2473fec1" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d932e22-d438-4138-88f0-06cb5255a134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d932e22-d438-4138-88f0-06cb5255a134" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though when I am playing a video in chrome It shows audio on here and I can hear it:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d14d970b-883c-4a9c-90cb-7d604e627122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d14d970b-883c-4a9c-90cb-7d604e627122" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet when playing that same video in firefox it doesnt show any signal bar coming through, nor any other non working program. I'm fairly certain its just a windows setting somewhere. I have, by the way, messed with the allow applications excluse control and
 settings similar as i have seen that suggested in the past, but it changed nothing for me. please help!</p>

<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>1.&nbsp;What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
2.&nbsp;Are you facing the issue while playing steam in Edge or IE? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to check if all Firefox plugins are enabled. </div>
Also update motherboard chipset drivers from the oem website to check if that helps.
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I built the system myself. Here are the system specs: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro </p>
<p>intel i5-4690k @ 4.3 GHz</p>
<p>AsRock z97M-ITX/ac</p>
<p>8GB DDR3 1600MHz ram </p>
<p>MSI Gtx 960 2GB</p>
<p>Sandisk Ultra II 120GB SSD (for OS)</p>
<p>WD Caviar Black 1TB (for data)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above I'm also using the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 external USB audio interface as a sound card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steam is a standalone application that is a marketplace and client for PC games. To answer your other question I have all firefox plugins enabled and have recently updated the motherboard drivers from asrock directly.

<p>I'm not aware of any games that allow you to turn the picture taking ability off. However you can delete them by going to the picture gallery (this may vary per game) and delete them. I assume you're talking about Kinect Adventures, aren't you?</p>

If the place where you purchased it from referred you to Xbox support, most likely they are going to be the only ones who will be able to assist.&nbsp; Just make sure you have a receipt/proof of purchase and what remains of the code available with you.

<h2>            Taptiles Daily Challenge coins and badges disappeared</h2>
                    I've been playing Taptiles since early November. &nbsp;I had earned enough coins in the Daily Challenges that I was past the Silver Badge. &nbsp;Then a few days ago when I went to the Daily Challenge all of my coins and badges had disappeared. &nbsp;Many days on my calendar
 now show 0/3 challenges completed. &nbsp;But when I click on the day the screen will show that all challenges have been completed. &nbsp;They all show a ribbon. &nbsp;Is there any way to get back the coins I lost?

            I had made no changes to my computer but there may have been an app update. &nbsp;I know I've had some but I can't say for certain whether or not TapTiles was updated. &nbsp;I followed all of the steps on the page of the link you gave me,even uninstalling and reinstalling.
 &nbsp;The issue is unchanged. &nbsp;My calender still shows many days with 0/3 challenges completed but when I click on the day it shows three ribbons - that all challenges have been completed. &nbsp;And my coins are still missing.

            Lost more coins today. &nbsp;Opened TapTiles from the left side bar but it closed itself. &nbsp;When I opened it again I had lost many of the coins I had earned. &nbsp;No changes have been made to the computer. &nbsp;The only anomaly was TapTiles closing itself.

            The app closes itself sporadically. &nbsp;Microsoft Mahjong Xbox has also closed itself on occasion. &nbsp;The TapTiles Daily Challenge just seems to be very glitchy. &nbsp;In addition to losing coins and the days on the calendar that say 0/3 challenges completed but
 show three ribbons and all challenges completed on the individual day I also was able to replay the days and even get credit for winning the challenge a second time. &nbsp;So now my November calendar shows some days 4/3, 5/3 or even 6/3 challenges completed. &nbsp;I
 actually earned the Bronze medal twice in November but also lost it twice. (lost the silver medal first and then lost the bronze medal I had re-earned)

            Same problem, and it seems to happen in Mahjong as well. I would really like to get my badges as I earn them. Mahjong also refuses to unlock the next puzzle for me - it showed it as unlocked after I completed the previous one, but when I try to play that
 level it says "you must complete coliseum first". No matter how many times I complete the puzzles preceding it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
That combined with the daily challenge coins disappearing is absurdly frustrating. No changes have been made to my computer (I only play on my Surface RT), and no updates are made either. It's just buggy.

                    I have been constantly been getting BSOD in the past few days every time I close my laptop and open it back up. It sputters and eventually conks out and gives the dreaded BSOD. I have a Dell D630 and there have been 3 separate results revealed and I have
 listed them below. I would be greatly appreciative for someone to help me solve this problem.<br />

            One of the first things I tried was un/reinstalling the Intel Media Accelerator Drive but that didn't do anything. Any other suggestions? Tried defragmenting and CCleaner but nothing has worked so far. I've been using it a lot recently and it has been
 getting kind of hot. Could heat have caused this? and would it be lasting or should I let it cool down? Someone also suggested a failing video card but idk, I'm not that big of a computer tech junkie to know these types of things off hand.<br />

            Did you install a later version of the drivers, not install the same version?<br />
<br />
That 0x116 stop error by the looks of it can be hardware based. So, you maybe right it maybe the videocard<br />

Is it still under warranty?<br />

            Yea. I downloaded/installed the latest version Media Accelerator from Intel so I'm pretty sure it's gotta be a bug, defect in some hardware or I need a new video card. It's only ever happened lately after closing the top and trying to open it again. It
 would most likely happen if I closed my lid right now so I'm going to keep it open until this is resolved. I tried contacting the company I bought it from back in Feb because its been crashing before now sometimes daily and sometimes monthly but the BSOD never
 stayed up long enough for me to snap a picture of it. Now it stays until I turn off the laptop. Thinking I may have bought a lemon with a defective video card in the first place but I'm waiting back to hear a response from them.<br />

            GREAT!!! So basically I bought a faulty laptop that has known issues cycling and cooling to result in a breakdown of the video card. And surely by now the warranty is long expired. Welp, hopefully the company that sold this to me will do me a solid and
 replace it or fix it. I bought it off of Amazon and the laptop and them have great reviews on customer service so hopefully they will take it back. Now I've got to deal with the issue of backing up my hard drive. I could argue that they knowingly sold me a
 faulty product and at least get a partial if not full refund. Man, just when I thought it couldn't get any better. Thanks JDD for bringing this to light for me.<br />
