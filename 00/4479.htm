<p>It sounds as though you're somehow attaching a link rather than the actual PPT/PPTX</p>

<p>Hi Garrett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The add-in may not work if your Office application is outdated or if there are other add-ins that may block it from working. For now, we suggest that you check if your Office application is updated, here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open any Office application, such as Word or Excel.</li><li>Go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Account</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Product Information</strong>, choose <strong>Update Options </strong>
&gt; <strong>Update Now</strong>.</li><li>Close the <strong>You're up to date! </strong>window after Office is done checking for and installing updates.</li></ol>
<p>After installing the updates, restart your device and see if the add-in works.</p>

    <title>Word &#38; Excel 2012 Recent Documents Not Working On Taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elijah1838  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word &#38; Excel 2012 Recent Documents Not Working On Taskbar</h2>
                    I have been having this issue with both Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel 2012 where the "Recent Documents" do not work on the Taskbar or Start Menu, but they are fine within the programs' menus (I am using Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit). I have looked
 through questions about this, and have tried everything I found to supposedly fix the issue (i.e. unpining and running WinWord /r, deleting the contents in Automatic Documents, using the install disc to repair programs) and I have even tried completely uninstalling
 Office 2012 and re-installing it, and nothing has worked. The Recent Documents works for PowerPoint and other Office 2012 programs when I right-click or click-drag on the pinned Taskbar icons, but not for Word or Excel, and I cannot figure out the issue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I believe the issue started after I uninstalled Office 2012 Starter (which is Word and Excel). I realize I should have done this *before* installing Office 2012 Professional Plus on my new laptop, but I figured it would remove it during&nbsp;installation. I
 am wondering if this has something to do with the issue, and I hope this information can help fix it. I may possibly try uninstalling all Office 2012 again, and re-installing Office Starter from the website before re-installing Professional Plus, but I don't
 know it that will do anything that installing Professional Plus won't.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know if that will work, or of any other ways to fix this issue? </div>
                </div>

            Thank you for replying so quickly. Unfortunately, neither of those worked to resolve the issue. The Recent Documents still does not work for Word or Excel on the Start Menu or Taskbar (after I open several files). They show up in the programs' menu lists
 for Recent Documents, but not in either of those places. Could there be some issue that is with Windows and the Taskbar/Start Menu but not in Office itself?

            Since you were using Office starter, try re-associating the Office files to Office professional plus. This should resolve the issue.<br />

This isn't an error message.&nbsp; It's something Word thinks we need to see every time we open a mail merge document.&nbsp; It goes something like this "Word is going to put data from Database ABC where "lastname" =Smith into your document.&nbsp; Do you want Word to do this?
 Press Yes if you want data from Database ABC to be put into your document, press No if you do not."<br />
I too find it annoying and would like Word to stop it.<br />

<p>If you've spent or lost anything near the amount of money you claim, you should have realized long ago that local computer stores and technicians, including yourself, aren't knowledgeable enough to deal with true network attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should have instead contacted a commercial network security organization long ago, with the proven ability to examine your network computing devices and find the real security issues that may exist.</p>

<p>This wasnt a case of waking up and money was missing, it was almost 4 years of criminals key logging and using my idenity to take funds. I have filed tons police reports and its hard to explain how you have idenity theft at this level as files of sales data
 was getting deleted and or modified to hide funds missing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it was around $100 a day for 3 years and when i caught employees and hired attorney all my funds diverted away to prevent me from getting help as if yout in a partnership and you think said partner is invokved its a civil matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My issue now is need to get files off to present and its been a ongoing effort as i lose a battle against people that are making sure it me that fail and this issue never comes to light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have paid and contacted people to assist and misleading information of their lack of skill left me with &nbsp;all my retail closed and friends and family not understanding My situation.</p>

<p>Didn't say the FBI doesn't do that Charles, it's just a waste of time for a small business in most cases, since unless their attack is truly something new the&nbsp;FBI wants to&nbsp;investigate, they'll typically be at the bottom of a long list.</p>

<p>Easy. Go to file, options, schedule. Show me the screenshot of hours/month.</p>
<p>All of your durations are in emonths but the project summary task shows working hours, but displayed as months.</p>
<p>That is, working hours according to the project calendar, displayed as months. Whatever the duration display, the dates are correct. The problem (your problem) is simply the choice of ambiguous durations units (months), which are just bound to be confusing.</p>
<p>In file, options, schedule, change duration is entered in months to duration is entered in days and all will become clear.</p>
Any help?

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, but no, not fixing it</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is literally a high level indicative proposal schedule and not an execution quality schedule, hence not resource loaded or daily working hours left in default. Duration and Work settings in Months . The idea is to give a client an indication only. if
 it was professional to use Excel that would have been the easy option. So there is no way anyone accepts those dates/duration combo. The bottom-line is a summary task is a Summary Duration of x amount tasks from a first Start date to a last Finish date - similar
 to a LoE task in P6 or a Hammock in Artemis</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the different scenario's. If I change all the tasks to months or Elapsed months it still rolls up to 12.8 Months, ending 27May then. a few days less than 1 year, but displaying more than a year. In the post you responded on, the activities were
 changed to edays to display the exact year duration on a day to exact date. I don't see it being a work calendar issue either as the elapsed duration option eliminates the calendar variable? It's not resource loaded so it can't be resource hours.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change all task calendars to 24hrs it's even worst</p>
<p>
</p><p>This were all the options before I posted it to the forum</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - the Options screenshot attached as requested. Hopefully you see something I might have missed</p>

<p>Just change the duration entered in&nbsp; months to duration entered in days.</p>
<p>Insert one new line above the current line 1. Call that "Heading" or similar. Indent everything under it.</p>
<p>There is no problem with MSP. The numbers check out.</p>
<p>However, if your audience has to be catered for, and you want the number of months to be 12 instead of 13, change the days per month in file, options, schedule to 260/12 = 22.1, but it has to be a whole number so 22.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the effort, much appreciated. </p>
<p>I've done what you suggested and yes, as Planners we understand the working hour/calendar conundrums. As per your own re-work the summary task in MSP is unable to display 364ed as 12 months :-) even though the hours add up. So yes the audience play a role.</p>
<p>Alternatively working days per month require a decimal, hence it remains a workaround.
</p>
<p>Another workaround is to not use the Show Schedule Summary Task option, but a Manually Scheduled task as task 1, other tasks indented, and change the Gantt bar display as if it was an Auto Scheduled task. PDF it - and you have it in presentation format</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again thank you for your assistance. Let's consider the matter closed</p>

<p>Yes, the matter is closed.&nbsp; Be advised that 1 elapsed month in MS Project is always 30 elapsed days = 720 elapsed hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our human concept that February (28 days) and March (31 days) each possess a duration of 1 elapsed month simply "does not compute."&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Mango uses PJPEG when emailing images. Why the change&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david ushka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mango uses PJPEG when emailing images. Why the change&#63;</h2>
                    I recently learned that when I send an image from my Htc hd7 using Mango, the image is sent as a progressive jpeg file type. This is a change from wp7 prior to Mango. Since pjpg is very nearly an obsolete file type, I was curious why the change? Is this
 a bug or by design?

<p>
Would you please be kind enough to tell me how to test the 16.18 version. I have signed up for the Office Insider Fast program, unfortunately whenever I check for updates (and I am doing it very frequently in the hope of finally getting the problem fixed!!)
 I keep on receiving the same message telling me that "there are no updates available for your Microsoft software at this time". With many thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved your question to the special Insider forum, where hopefully someone from Microsoft can jump in and tell you how to get AutoUpdate to work right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open an Office app, such as Microsoft Word, and go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates. That launches AutoUpdate.app. Make sure the check box is checked that you joined the Insider program, and that the pop-up choosing Insider Fast is set. Your
 Mac has to have a live internet connection, or you will get the message that no updates are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours is the second report of this that I've noticed, so maybe there is something wrong with AutoUpdate. Make sure it is set as shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bddb0af-1af5-4273-96f5-04e777e51681?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bddb0af-1af5-4273-96f5-04e777e51681?upload=true" height="914" width="834" /></a></p>

<p>If you have set to automatically update you will get no notice that anything has happened&nbsp;the only way you can tell you got an update is Open a program go to the program Menu Tab and choose about ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's actually better to Manually Check, and check once a day And update yourself so you know what going on. If everything set automatic you don't know when to report&nbsp;when a Bug has been added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a new wrinkle to the Insider Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Effective immediately only those having an Office 365 Subscription license type will get Insider builds. This is because the release of Office 2019 is imminent, and those having perpetual licenses for Office 2016 are not eligible to get Office 2019 updates.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Game bar not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonicnerd15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Game bar not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I like the idea of Game Bar, and brings Windows even further in terms of the social side of gaming, but here is its downfall...for now. I doesn't always work, and it may not be much of a fault of Microsoft's, but I think like most things it can be fixed.
 The main issues is that when ever you hit the hotkey it doesn't pop up, and then when you figure out that most games have to be in windowed mode for it to work you just look up like ****!? Listen, almost no one plays games in windowed mode if they don't have
 to, so it doesn't even make any since for it to be a requirement to use the feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I managed to get a couple games working in Game Bar, I can't remember which ones exactly now, but the results are in consistent. Now like I said may not be a fault of Microsoft, but it can be fixed. Please fix this because its a small issue that
 doesn't need to ve an issue any more.</p>

 I have checked his phone compatibility and his account settings as much as possible but still do not know what is going on. It does not seem as if Microsoft technical support understand what phones are so please help a Dad help his son. Thank you.</p>

<p>Yes. &nbsp;Just set it up the same way you did initially on your 30GB device. &nbsp;Name it differently than the 30, and set up your sync mode however you like. &nbsp;The software will recognize which device is connected when you sync, and so your settings can be customized
 to each zune.</p>
<p>If you have a zune pass, you will be able to sync to both devices as well. &nbsp;You are allowed up to 3 Zunes on your zune pass account.</p>

    <title>Outlook calendar not linking phone numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> king256bob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook calendar not linking phone numbers</h2>
                    
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook in Windows Mobile 4 and 5 hyperlink anything that looks like a phone number (anywhere in Outlook) so that clicking on it, and confirming will have the phone dial that number.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Outlook Calendar for Mobile 6 (on a HTC-8900) does not have this feature on by default.&nbsp;A number in the body of an email can still be dialed by clicking on it, but a phone number in a email/appointment header is not linked, and a number
 in the body of an Calendar entry is also not linked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to turn this on? It is extremely annoying to have to copy a phone number off the phone so you can re-enter it. Especially if you relied on this feature in an earlier version of Windows Mobile.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Thanks for the reply. I could not get your suggestion to work, but I found a related post, "<span>Dial a phone number from Calendar, WM6</span>". In there is
 says that you need to type a space after the phone number:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tel:1234567890&lt;space&gt; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; It didn't work for me until I entered the space after the number -- and a carriage return didn't work. In WM4 almost every number (i.e., 1234) would be hyperlinked to the dialer. I think I liked it better that way. Now I will have to edit
 every phone number sent in an meeting invite to make this "strictly typed"&nbsp;format work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h3> vlad0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Last Windows 10 build 16193 is terrible&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Two days ago windows insider program installed on my surface pro 4 tablet the latest update of windows 10: build 16193.</p>
<p>After this installation almost any program installed on SP4 failed to work: Skype, Start menu 8, all programs of AVG: Avg pc tune up,</p>
<p>AVG Internet sequrity, AVG malware fighter and many other programs. The only windows program, that works yet, is Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>I've tried to uninstall the latest version, returning to previous build 16188, but failed to do this: the active "uninstall" option in</p>
<p>Windows insider settings, became inactive, when I've tried to press it :( How could I restore the previous Windows 10 build?</p>

<p>I've succeeded at last in rolling back to build 16188! I could not describe this long and obscure process,</p>
<p>just because I did not remember some details of it. But now all my progs are OK :).<br />
The only thing I remember in this process is: before I've got the surface pro with the screen I am</p>
<p>accustomed to, there arose several restarts, where there appeared a menu, proposing to accept or change</p>
<p>some UEFFI settings, like password for this UEFFI and some other settings. I do not know exactly,</p>
<p>what UEFFI means, but after some restarts and choices in those settings, followed by windows restart, I finally</p>
<p>saw the usual screen of windows and the restored build is 16188 :)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this idiotic Windows updated me back to this idiotic build 16193, though I delayed the next</p>
<p>update by one week. Fortunately, I've restored back build 16188 rather quickly, without playing around</p>
<p>with UEFFI menus. This time I've changed the speed of updates from "fast" to "slow", hoping, that at least</p>
<p>one month no new builds would abruptly fall on my tablet.</p>

<p>It Is bit of a tedious process that involves installing a fresh copy of windows and leaving the program but first i will recommend you to try rolling back the update, if you have already tried that check if you have any previous system restores and trying
 restoring your device last time it worked fine.</p>

<p>In my second and third posts above I showed, how I really solved this problem, but some details were omitted.</p>
<p>First, in search window inside "Insider program settings" I wrote "rollback". Then the windows took the process</p>
<p>into its hands, giving me advices, where appropriate. At last, it rolled back to the previous build 16184, but, instead</p>
<p>of booting into windows, it booted into UEFI menu. It takes me a lot of time and a number of restarts, before</p>
<p>I've boot in windows. As far as I remember, I've canceled any other boot (from usb device or net), leaving only</p>
<p>"Boot from windows manager". Then pressed "exit" in UEFI menu and restarted in windows at last. And os build</p>
<p>was 16184 :) The only bad thing was that before entering windows, the dark red stripe appeared at the top of the</p>
<p>screen, with the lock drawn on it. I suspect that this is because, being in UEFI menu I refused to write any password</p>
<p>for entering UEFI menu, choosing "none" instead. An hour ago, l learned, looking through the UEFI specification,</p>
<p>that CIA hacked UEFI in order to spy users. So that it may be not so bad idea, to enter UEFI menu once again, and to</p>
<p>invent some password for UEFI. But I do not know, how could I enter into UEFI, not being the member of CIA :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the good thing is that I remained the "insider", whereas my original intension was to cease my participation</p>
<p>in this activity. But later on I simply changed the speed of renovations from "fast" to "slow"-- once in a month.</p>
<p>I hope, that in the next build the major bug of build 16193 would be removed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Slow ring gets much tested and less buggy Updates, Where as fast build gets Under testing ones.</p>

<p>Thank you very much! Though my problem with extremely buggy build 16193 was solved by myself,</p>
<p>the previous build 16188 is buggy as well. Its only bug I've discovered until now, is that the tablet did not see</p>
<p>any camera. So it can not identify me by my image, and I am forced to use PIN any time I enter windows. By the way, I could not enter UEFI menu as well, any keys I used to enter BIOS, like F2 or F7, do not act on UEFI :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to rollback once again to even earlier build 16184, but windows said that this build was not saved, so the only</p>
<p>thing I can do now is to reinstall windows from the scratch. Or to wait until build 16193 would be debugged.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I found the solution for this problem over the web, Downloading an additional Speech Language for 'English (United States)' solved the issue for me. You can still keep English (India) as default, just need to download the additional pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do that by going to Settings &gt; Time &amp; Language &gt; Speech &gt; Add a Language &gt; Select English (United States)</p>

            That is odd because I am using a Lumia 950 build 351 and live in the US so I already have this language as default. Just started having this issue-microphone in search or holding search will not work. But the music icon will search music I am trying to
 identify.....tried soft reset too

            Yes this is certainly odd, but after months of searching I was glad this fixed it for me. Sorry to hear, its still an issue for you, may be next update might fix it :)

<h2>            nokia 520 no sound, cannot make calls</h2>
                    Last week my Nokia 520 that i have had for three months has started to breakdown. When playing music on the phones speakers or playing anything that had sound on the phone it stopped working. My headphone socket still works. The strange thing is my ringtones
 and alarms still work through the speaker? I had completed a factory reset and still it has not worked.<br />
Now i cannot make calls my phone rings the person i cannot hear them at all they cannot hear me? Im really disappointed and want to know has anyone else came across these problems? Thanks

<h2>            Isn&#39;t it painful working with MS Excel 2013 &#38; 2016&#63; Why you did this Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Microsoft Office since last 18 years, Excel being most used for me,&nbsp;and have seen gradual changes in versions over the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember using&nbsp;MS Office 1997, then 2000, then 2003 then 2007 and then the experience begun to spoil big way. Especially with MS Office 2013 and 2016, it is great pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder why the extensive testing and development didn't identify &amp; fix this? Or is it so that this never been the goal for respective Microsoft Team?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I face issues working with Excel files larger than 3 mb now, face issue with using data filter on mid-size data worksheet, can't switch&nbsp;through open Excel files, face issue of unusually grown file size for unknown reasons and then too slow operation. All
 these issues with same file will not be faced while using MS Excel 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not looking for solution of above specific issue for just myself, but on this forum, I see many people searching solution for most of such issues particular to MS Office 2013 and 2016. I tried to give this matter as "Feedback", but was instead diverted
 by Support Executive over Chat to come to this page, that is another strange thing as there seems no way to provide Feedback to Microsoft. I am curious to see if Microsoft listens to such feedback and queries or they have their rigid&nbsp;approach which avoids
 customer feedbacks.</p>
<p>

<strong><u>awful</u></strong>!&nbsp; It's difficult to read and the color choices are limited.&nbsp; (How about some other choices besides nine different "soft pastels"?)&nbsp; Oh, and how about all those office theme choices:&nbsp;white, light gray or dark gray.&nbsp; It's so hard
 to choose because they all suck.&nbsp;</p>

            I agree, aesthetics were thrown out the window in this generation of Office. Outlook online email is also so sterile looking, and not at all intuitive. The majority of the users are not teens or college age people, why strip it down to bare bones? Many
 of the accoutrements have disappeared as well, I can't even access the option for creating a Group its faded out and unavailable. This blows.&nbsp;
