<h2>            Error 0x80240020 Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So this morning I woke up, hoping to see the Get Windows App sending me a notification telling me that my free copy of Windows 10 was ready. But when I woke up the Get Windows App looked just like how it looked before Windows 10 came out. So tonight I found
 out how to force start Windows 10 to start installing and it took a couple tries, but I managed to make it to the part where it completes looking for updates. It displayed error code &nbsp;0x80240020. I tried and tried again, deleting all my files in the Downloads
 folder, which was recommended by many people, but it turns out it didnt work for me. Anyone have a more in-depth reason or fix to this bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft releases a optional update that fixes the most common Windows 10 upgrading bugs. Please Microsoft, Please do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you guys, please help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>If you still have access to your account then you were not hacked. Someone in your house or even you probably changed the clan tag without you knowing. :)</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also, it is VERY unlikely you will ever get hacked. Most people on Xbox lose their accounts not from hacking, but they lose control of their accounts for calling for fishing scams (MSP generators for example) or they gave out their email and have very easy
 to guess passwords.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Just don't fall for scam messages and never give out your email and password and you'll never be 'hacked'</p>

<p>i doubt you were hacked what MOST likely happened was when you switched games you have a different clan tag for that game. If you already didnt know you have different clan tags per game!</p>

<p>Someone in the house more than likely changed it, if someone would take all the time to hack your account (Which is possible, but VERY VERY VERY unlikely to happen) then they would have done alot more than simply change your clan tag and leave.

<p>From what I understand a person can only hack your account if he has certain information that is related to your account like usernames,email address's and passwords. If you have never given those pieces of information away your fine. Your friend that you

<p>It has nothing to do with you drinking too much beer and then sucking at CoD, does it? Could have got gamers booze depression and changed your clan name. I think I have solved this case, good day.</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your microphone
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback tab
<br />Right click your Microphone
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level

<div>Actually, I just bought a new CPU and I hope to maintain it well, not like my old piece. I would like to ask is it advisable to use ccleaner and defraggler by piriform over Microsoft cleanup and defragment? Is this free program safe? If I am not mistaken,
 i think it posted microsoft partner on their site, can I assume that it is relatively safe as being a ms partner.</div>

    <title>Xbox One 450&#36; Bundle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray iz ramb0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One 450&#36; Bundle</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I have been a microsoft supporter for over FIVE years. I've bought countless games and items over xbox; thousands of dollars spent over the years and then I get *** over like this? I buy the console for 540$(tax included) + Titanfall, ghost, bf4, and forza
 5(on the way). Then a bundle comes along for 450$? I shrugged it off after buying the console + titanfall for 60, but now a bundle for 450 + titanfall for free comes out? This is absolutely ridiculous. I'm not going to be brash about it, but I do think myself
 and others who have bought the console for full and the game for full get some type of compensation (and not some *** indie game or 10 bucks to spend on live, hell no). I am literally ready to start a mass petition, feedback gathering, etc. This is completely
 out of hand and a huge slap in the face. Microsoft, please rectifiy this problem.</p>

<p>-Show me why you're better than Sony, JUSTIFY my purchase of the Xbox One.-</p>

<p>Well that old saying goes good fortunes come to those who are patient. This isnt microsofts fault and they will not compensate for bundles that were announced weeks before games were do to release. Enjoy your xbox one.</p>

<h2>            Money disappeared from account</h2>
                    I had two accounts. I put money on one of the accounts. It was not connected to Microsoft then. The other was. Later, when I was trying to reach my account with the money, I was forced to connect it with Microsoft. Now it&nbsp;doesn't show any funds on it.
 The money has disappeared. What shall I do? It was less than two months ago. Thank you

    <title>Microphone playback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamsok  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone playback</h2>
                    Hi, I cannot seem to enable microphone playback on my Acer 5735z Vista-32 bit laptop. I had trouble getting to work on vista 64-bit desktop but it is fine now. The microphone is working, sounds can be recorded etc, but there is no option to have it&nbsp;as
 playback (during recording). I have read countless hours worth of posts relating to this elsewhere and no-one seems to have a working solution. The main difference between the two computers is&nbsp; that in the Realtek HD Audio manager microphone tab, there is
 a playback slider on my desktop, but none on my laptop. Have tried registry fixes posted by others but to no avail. I understand all the feedback issues and perhaps this is why it is set to off by default, but this is to listen to guitar through headphones
 (already going through a floor processor) whilst the laptop is playing music. Any help/suggestions are hugely appreciated. Thanks<br />
Jamie

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Could be the Laptop does not have Full Wave capability - see more about that below.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have the latest Realtek Driver and all settings are correct.<br />
<br />
Realtek - click HD Audio Codec Driver on right side of page.<br />
<a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.realtek.com.tw/</a><br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - Audio Device<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
If your driver shows 06 you have the windows default and that is part of the issue.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and get latest Sound/Audio drivers - Download - SAVE - go to where you<br />
put them - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN - Reboot <br />
<br />
Check the Version on Driver's tab in Device Manager as often sound drivers rollback and then finally install<br />
the current version. Reboot and check after each try, not unusual to have to run the driver 1-4 times or so.<br />
Just make sure the version you installed shows up in the driver's tab.<br />
<br />
Then go to Device Maker's site and look for even newer drivers and repeat install procedure.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After updating driver.<br />
<br />
<strong>Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;Disconnected
<br />
Devices and Show Disabled Devices - check your mic</strong> - highlight them and then on lower right properties.
<br />
Make sure the proper one is enabled and check other settings - on Levels tab make sure MUTE is unchecked<br />
and APPLY / OK changes.<br />
<br />
Also in Control Panel look for some Audio Manager (maybe named after sound driver maker). Mine<br />
is RealTek Audio Manager, yours can be entirely different name if you have one.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Windows Update keeps installing Bing Bar 7.0 &#40;KB2626804&#41;</h2>
                    I've upgraded a pretty old Win7 machine to Win10. I tried to clean it up a lot and uninstalled a lot of clutter first. One of those thing I believe was the Bing Bar. Now that I'm on Win10, Windows update keeps trying to reinstall it. My update history
 says it has been installed 12 times today alone.&nbsp;When I check my installed apps under the system menu, it isn't there.&nbsp;Is there any way to stop it from popping up?

            <p>I have successfully solved this for my issue (KB2626806).&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall ALL 'Live" programs...sorry, that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>is</strong></span> part of the problem.</li><li>Uninstall IE 11 (all of it)...Bing Bar is embedded in IE 11 as a toolbar--<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>from</strong></span> the Live installation.</li><li>reboot</li><li>Reinstall only IE 11, NO in-line search help (part of install options during install).</li><li>reboot</li><li>try not to install Live again...it will cause the same issue all over again.</li></ol>
<p>This solved it for me....I tried to have MS help, MS CHAT SUPPORT....but as you can plainly see from all the forum answers from MS, they don't REALLY help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried MS Online Chat, 3 times....it always seemed to me that I was dealing with an A.I. and not a person working from a script...or maybe it was the other way around.&nbsp; Regardless, Support had no effect--even with remote connection.&nbsp; At one point a chat
 tech actually gave themselves wonderful marks (on their own survey--popped up when they closed the chat window but Log-Me-In was still running).&nbsp; MS even tried to sell me support, Azure support.......I haven't had Win 10 for 1 year--yet.</p>

    <title>USB Flash Drive not detected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Flash Drive not detected</h2>
                    I plugged in a flash drive which worked. I proceeded to format the device to FAT32. I then safely removed the device. I then plugged the device back in at which point the device was not detected by Windows 7 (Professional). I have since rebooted the computer
 and the device is still not detected. When I say detected, I mean detected, the device does not show up in the Device Manager nor in Disk Management. I have plugged the same flash drive into another computer and it works just fine. I even formatted the device
 on the other computer (to NTFS) and yet, the computer still doesn't detect the hardware. What can I do to get the flash drive detected/usable?<br />
<br />
- The device worked at one point, it does not now.<br />
- I have tried different USB ports, including ones known to work (e.g. the port my keyboard is currently plugged into and I am typing this from)<br />
- The flash drive works on other computers just fine.<br />
- The device does not show up in Disk Management nor Device Manager.<br />
- I have ran the Hardware Detection Fix It tool Microsoft provides which didn't help at all.<br />
- Deleting USB root hubs and controllers and allowing Windows to re-install them does not work.<br />

            1) Yes, keyboard, mouse, other USB flash drives, USB wireless adapters. etc.<br />
<br />
2) Home built comp that was handed down to me.<br />
<br />
With Linux there is 'dmesg' which prints out all hardware events detected by the kernel (and some more stuff). dmesg is really easy to use, type command, info is displayed. Is there anything in Windows even remotely as simple or helpful? Device Manager lists
 what devices Windows knows about, sure, but it doesn't tell me when a device is plugged in or any info as remotely helpful as demesg gives about that device.<br />
<br />
For example, in linux what I would do is plug in the device and try 'dmesg' and I would see something like:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Whether or not the device is working I would know that the device was detected and I could then move on from there. Is there anything in Windows that would allow me to see detailed information like the above from dmesg? I know the USB device works, it worked
 one time on the computer already and the device works on all my other computers. I don't see how a driver update would help when the device worked on the computer at one point and all other USB devices work.<br />
<br />
Basically the way I see it, Windows 'blacklisted' the device some how, because at one point it worked and now it doesn't on the one, single computer.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help, sorry for my late response.<br />

    <title>Original Xbox 360 Won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Read Specific Disks that Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> subsquentual  say:</h3>
<h2>            Original Xbox 360 Won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Read Specific Disks that Xbox 360 Slim can read</h2>
                    
<p>So allow me to go into detail about this, before someone throws the "Clean Your Disk Tray", "Clean Your Disks," ect.</p>

<p>My Original Xbox 360, I bought from Gamestop, it's probably been about 2 years now, and I've treated it like sacred ground. I'm not a rich individual, so when I get something like an xbox, I treat it with the most respect I am able to.</p>
<p><br />
It decides that it will read only specific disks, no problem. Games such as original Bioshock, Eragon, Naruto Rise of a Ninja, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, and such load up with little to no problem at all, and I won't get any problems from those disks. Some
 of them are even really scratched up because they were previously used, and the fact that I live with 5 and 6 year-olds that can't even keep track of their shoes, let alone take care of a game disk.</p>
<p>So when I put in a game that is brand new or has no scratches at all, it could take 30 minutes to 2-3 hours before it will finally read the game. I will get stuck with "Open Tray" "Unrecognized Disk" "Play DVD" (&lt;- What the crap?) and the worst, It will
 say "Play Game" go as if it was, and then before the logo can pop up, a window appears, "The game is unreadable."</p>
<p>Then I take those games, specific ones like, Riddick **** on Dark Athena (With Butcher Bay Included), Skyrim, Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age II, and now the brand new Dragon Age Inquisition, and put them on my brother-in-law's Xbox 360 Slim, and they
 will load up first try absolutely no problem at all.</p>
<p>I am very angry, and the main reason of my anger, is this.</p>
<p>I just got Dragon Age Inquisition. I've been wanting it for a long time now, practically, since it came out. So I finally get a copy. Only to find out that it needs to be installed on a hard drive with 7.1-9 Gigabytes of space. Now, here's something else.
 The Slim, which the game reads on no problem, only has the 4 Gigabyte built in hard drive. So it can't fit on there.&nbsp; So I clear some space on my flash drive that I use as a back-up hard drive, only to find out, the game CANNOT be installed on a flash drive.</p>
<p><br />
The hard drive on my ORIGINAL XBOX 360, that WON'T READ THE DISK has 9.7 Gigabytes worth of space. But you can't put an original xbox 360 external hard drive on the xbox 360 slim.</p>
<p>So what I want, is a solution that will make my original xbox 360 read the Dragon Age Inquisition disks so that I can install the game and play it.</p>
<p>I've blown air into the xbox, keep it cool, and kept it out of small spaces. If I put another game into it, like the ones mentioned above, it will load them up practically first try, like it should. The games that I actually WANT to play is the ones it won't
 read. I know the problem isn't with the disks, or else they wouldn't load on the slim so perfectly, and it can't be the laser since the other games load perfectly on it.</p>

<p>Hi there, a few things, installing games to the console is highly recommend due to helping overall performance, it can even help with the drive not reading the disc. So I would suggest formatting a USB and using that as your storage device if you can't afford
 another hard drive or external hard drive: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../usb-flash-drive-faq</a> </p>
<p>Though with the original Xbox 360's their disc drive does fail and I mean like nearly every time. I'm like you and treat my electronics products extremely well, but my original 360 still got the disc drive error eventually and needed to be replaced, the
 drive reading games as dvd's or nothing at all is really the first signs.</p>

<p>I have a few games installed onto separate hard drives, but I don't have the money to keep buying Hard drives, and All of the games I already have on there are on disks, which require me to have the disk in and have the console read it, which really sucks.</p>
<p>Heck, earlier I blew out the disk tray again with some compressed air, hoping it may do some good, and the stupid nozzle flies off the bottle and straight into the xbox. And then of course it tries shutting the tray on it, so I had to hold it open and pry
 out the nozzle with a pair of pliers. I don't know what that could have done, but I'm not using compressed air cans again.

<p>I did suggest a USB which is much cheaper then a new hard drive, I believe you could also buy a 2tb external hard drive and you'd probably never need another storage device again for the 360 which in turn could be the cheaper option in the long run.</p>
<p>Though why I suggested doing it to the USB is it should be a fast way of determining if installing the game will allow it to run on the original Xbox 360 without having to delete other data.</p>
<p>The disc is needed to start the game, but the disc tray should stop spinning and will read the data directly from the storage device. It will only register the disc is in the tray, not actually run the game from it which can eliminate disc drive issues.</p>
<p>One last thing, I never use compressed air to clean electronic products and don't recommend it either as you've found out the hard way.</p>

<p>Yeah, I do prefer using flash drives, and I do plan on using them in the future, but Dragon Age Inquisition requires a hard drive. The game will not install if you select a flash drive for it to install on. That is the first time I've encountered that, and
 I understand why they made it like that, so people wouldn't spread the game on for free. I understand the reason, but find it frustrating because I planned on installing it on the flashdrive on the my brother-in-law's xbox, since it could read the game, and
 then put the flashdrive on my xbox because I just prefer my own.</p>
<p>But life said nope and slapped me in the face as hard as it could with the nearest brick it could find.</p>

<p>You're right, they won't let you install that particular game on the USB, it has nothing to do with copyright though as every installed game still needs the disc to run so you could install it as much as you wanted, but it won't work without the disc.</p>
<p>As my last suggestions I would say if you do have an official hard drive for the Xbox, maybe delete a game off there that will install to a USB, because you most certainly can install games to USB's it's just DA:I that doesn't let you do it and hopefully
 that way you can get it running.</p>
<p>If not, I would seriously take the game back and say it wasn't clear you would need a hard drive to play it.</p>

<p>I plan on taking the disks back tomorrow, cleaning them, get a hard drive for the slim, just to be safe, and try again. I would install it on his xbox, but his has the internal memory unit that is only 4 gigs, which sucks.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help. I'll save up some money and get a new xbox when I get the chance. And an extra hard drive and a flashdrive for any future picky games like DA:I</p>

<p>As I understand, all of the consoles have internal storage as well as there hard drives, so you should just be able to add the hard drive to the units that don't originally come with it. That's just for your information.</p>
<p>I was trying to help you get it working on that original Xbox, haha, I wasn't sure the slim was an option!
</p>
<p>Anyway, don't mention it! I hope you eventually get to play it because it really is an awesome game!</p>

<p>When I buff the disks, it may or may not work on the original xbox. When I recieved Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena, it loaded perfectly on the slim and not on mine till I got it buffed at the store, so maybe I just have to buff it. Still going to get the
 slim hard drive though in case the buff doesn't work. That's what I meant :P</p>
<p>And yeah, I hope I do too. Thanks for the help.</p>

<h2>            How to open multiple files at once &#40;same .ext&#41; in Win7 search&#63;</h2>
                    Have several folders, in XP I could search and find the file I need to edit in each folder, highlight them all and press "ENTER" or right-click and "Open With" and it would say "are you sure you want to open 20 files at the same time" and I could hit yes.<br />
<br />
I'm on WIndows 7 Professional x64 now and cannot do the same thing. This is very frustrating, now I have to go into each folder at once to open up the .dbf file I'm trying to make just one change in, instead of being able to open them all at the same time.<br />

            <p>looking further on the web I found this workaround on the windows club site.&nbsp; It works:</p>
<p><em>If you do not want to touch the Windows Registry, there is a workaround to get this done.</em></p>
<p>Place a shortcut in the following ‘Hidden’ folder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now open Start Menu &gt; All apps and locate the shortcut you placed. Right-click on it and select Pin to Start.</p>

<p>This is absolutely ridiculous.. I work in IT and deal with providing Enterprise clas of IT services to huge baseline. This outage taking this long to restore is absolutely unbelievable. I am extremely disappointed in Microsoft. With this being, Xmas vacation
 for kids and everyone not having access to game saves specifically ones that have taken many hours to get to where they ain games. This is awful. Not providing,a technical description of the problem or an expected restoration time is pathetic. &nbsp; I think I
 my have to think harder about buying more games on the PS3 instead of the Xbox.</p>

<p>Build out some new storage, carve it up as needed and restore the user data...Come on get on the ball... And using the excuse that you have restored some people's access. That is awful lame saying that so that some people believe you have been working, cuz
 no one can prove otherwise. I think you just haven't &nbsp;called in the right people because of the holidays. Because if you have Microsoft is much worse off than I thought.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Error Code 0X80070002 when doing system backup</h2>
                    <br />
I recently upgraded from windows Vista to Windows 7 Home Premium<br />
When I do a system backup the backup completed sucessfully but I get a message that some files were not backed up.&nbsp; The message is as follows:Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\LocalLow. Error:(The system cannot
 find the file specified. (0x80070002))<br />
Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C:\Users\Administrator\Contacts. Error:(The system cannot find the file specified. (0x80070002))<br />
Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C:\Users\Administrator\Searches. Error:(The system cannot find the file specified. (0x80070002))<br />
Can anyone tell me how I can locate and correct this problem?<br />

            The Administrator account is disabled by default in Windows 7?&nbsp; Have you taken any action to enable the (built-in) Administrator Account?&nbsp; Unless the Administrator Account was enabled (and used)&nbsp;then those files would not exist on your machine.&nbsp; Was the
 Administrator Account enabled in Vista and those folders carried over from Vista?<br />
<br />
What folders (if any)&nbsp;have you got in this location anyway?<br />
<br />
C:\Users\Administrator<br />
<br />
If you configure backup to exclude those files then the error may disappear.&nbsp; If you do not run the Administrator Account then it is probably safe (after saving a copy) to delete any folders found in C/Users that belong to the (built-in) Administrator Account
 (not any active user accounts), and to disable the account too.<br />
<br />
enable or disable the Windows 7 build in administrator account<br />

Don't disable it if you are using it.<br />

            <p>Hello Shuaib,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check if it helps.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a><br />
(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us updated.</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You can back up the data on your MP3 player and format it. And then copy the data back again in it. Follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on
<strong>Start</strong>, Go to <strong>Computer</strong>. </span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click on your device that is connected.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Format</strong> (full format) in the <strong>Fat32</strong> File System.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It might take a few minutes and then copy the data to it again to it. And check.
