    <title>PC Suite&#47;Outlook contacts SMS Synch tip - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PC Suite&#47;Outlook contacts SMS Synch tip</h2>
                    Through a process of trial and error, I discovered that Outlook will automatically remove the leading zero &amp; insert a space between the country dialing code (in this case +44) and the number of your contact. This looks pretty and all, but if you sync up
 outlook to your phone with these numbers, the phone (in this case N70) won't recognise it as being one of your contacts if they reply. The solution I found to this was to manually edit my contacts on the phone to include the +44 WITHOUT a space and of course
 without the leading zero, then to Synch up to PC with settings set that the phone overides the PC. You may also then have to go into the PC suite contacts list &amp; re-edit one of your PC Suite contacts in the same manner, which then asks if you want to "update
 contacts". When you click yes you'll then see that ALL of the numbers that you've manually edited will show as they should, on your phone, on PC Suite contacts, and more imporatntly, in Outlook. Bit of a pain, but I'd rather use a keyboard to type SMS texts
 than my thumbs...<br />
By the way, I couldn't see a way to stpo outlook inserting the space. Hope someone else finds this useful :-)

            there is actually an easier way. if you are entering numbers into outlook you will be prompted to allow this, just cancel it and your numbers will not have this problem.

            now you tell me ;-) actually the numbers had originally been stored on my previous phone, 6600, and transfered across, then synced into Outlook. Now I know, i'll bear it in mind, so thanks :-)

<h2>            Mobile Build 15063 deleted half my contacts, six months of texts and removed both my mail accounts</h2>
                    <p>As the title said -- I thought this was fixed? I deliberately skipped the damn build that reportedly did that. I woke up this morning, and my plugged-in fully charged phone was in this state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a backup - will a reset fix this, or has the continual backup likely trashed my backed up contacts and messages too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Skype as the messaging app, and have enabled SMS sync and backup there too. But why did my mail accounts disappear?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sigh. This ride is becoming extremely irritating - in fact, it's now untenable for me to remain an insider. How can 1703 for the PC be released on one hand and yet the mobile build is so unreliable/unstable?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have 15063 trash their phone yet? I'm on 10.0.15063.2 on a Lumia 950.</p>

<h2>            Nokia N96 and Rover Rover Car-Kit</h2>
                    
<p>Hi and Help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone can throw some light on a problem I'm having with my Nokia 96 (on 02), which I upgraded from an N95 8Gb at the beginning of December 2008. I have had numerous Nokia Phones (and a Blackberry) all on 02 and all working well with the built in
 car-kit in my Range Rover Sport. The two are connected via Buluetooth, but I am experiencing the following problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Everytime</strong> I get in the Car with the phone, it asks if I want to connect and asks me to input the code which I do and it connects. It is listed as authorised but I still have to go through this procedure each time.</li><li>When I'm on a call, the quality is good, but after a couple of minutes, I can hear the person on the other end, but the speech is very clipped, and they cannot hear me and as long&nbsp;as&nbsp;we both persevere, the call continues and returns to normal after 20-30
 seconds but this issue is repeated every few minutes for the duration of the call. This happens whether I make or recieve calls.</li></ol>
<p>Some of the things I have tried but which have not worked:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>02 have replaced the phone and I'm now on my second, brand new unit.</li><li>I upgraded the software on both and I'm currently running 12.043, 26/11/08</li><li>I have had Land Rover look at the car kit when it was serviced yesterday (26/01/2009). They confimed they had tried it with other Nokia phones and it was working correctly and could not replicate the fault, albeit they weren't using an N96</li><li>I have independently checked the Land Rover webpages and confimred that&nbsp;the N96 is compatible</li><li>Partial and full reboots.</li><li>Deleting and setting up new Bluetooth connections</li><li>Changing the Network from Dual to GSM only</li><li>Trawling through N96 and Land Rover forum looking for some sort of clue, and I can find absolutely nothing anywhere else!</li></ol>
<p>I hope someone can help as I'm finding this increasingly frustrating and it's knocking my faith in Nokia products, and I'm considering returning to my N95.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have got almost the same problem as you detailed below, however call quality when connected is fine. Even have the same car. Got a brand new N96 after two weeks but it is exactly the same, keeps requesting the pairing and code instead of connecting automatically.</p>
<p>If I cannot get this sorted I will swap for another cheaper phone that will work. Basic Nokias do the trick. Like Nokia have never used anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone can throw some light on a problem I'm having with my Nokia 96 (on 02), which I upgraded from an N95 8Gb at the beginning of December 2008. I have had numerous Nokia Phones (and a Blackberry) all on 02 and all working well with the built in

<ol>
<li><strong>Everytime</strong> I get in the Car with the phone, it asks if I want to connect and asks me to input the code which I do and it connects. It is listed as authorised but I still have to go through this procedure each time</li></ol>
<p>Any help would be appreciated but I am guessing that there isn't any,</p>

<p>Hi Pedro,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a really frustraing point. I have had several emails from Nokia, all of whom tell me to try things which I've already done (as per the lsit above), and thy don't seem to grasp the point that the car kit is actually physically built into the car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also spoken to 02 who won't now swap the phone. I asked for another SIM card so that I can use my N95 whilst in the car but they refused&nbsp;as you can't register two SIM's on one account and it would invalidate my insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My son has also got an N96 but on Orange and I've tried that and it doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put simply, despite what both Land Roaver and Nokia say, this phone and the car kit are just not compatible. The best I can hope for is another update at some point which may solve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            iPad Word error reading - The server you are trying to access is not supported by this version of Office</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work at a College and we are using iPad's with word and one drive. Through the business 365 account this has been working well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, recently a member of staff has logged on as normal to open up a word file and an error comes on the screen saying "The server you are trying to access is not supported by this version of Office"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file opened last week but not today. Nothing has been changed on one drive or re-saved differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any idea how to correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have tried the reset word section of the settings in the iPad (clear all documents and delete sign-in credentials)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

Article ID: 2596516</a>, but applying to Outlook 2013.&nbsp; It <em>works fine on the same computer using Outlook 2010, and with Outlook Web Access,</em> but it only doesn't work with Outlook 2013.&nbsp; I have tested it with different using accounts, with the same results.&nbsp;
 Exchange Server 2007 has the latest service packs and rollups. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any settings that I should make on the server to enable Outlook 2013 to set Out of Office replies for Exchange Server 2007?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<h2>            &#91;e72&#93; Bluetooth music volume problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with Bluetooth music volume in e72-1. It's work great&nbsp; when I make a call- I can make it louder and silencer by the volume keys on the side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I want to listen to the music via bluetooth (nokia player, core player, ttpod, etc) the volume control won't work. When I use the volume buttons, the volume will not decrease or increase. There are only two levels - mute (when gauge is on 0) and very
 loud on others gueage's positions.<br />
The buttons do work because a gauge is displayed on the screen. When I press the volume down button until the volume is 0 then the<span> sound</span> will mute. On the other side, sometimes the music via Bluetooth won't play at all, but
 in calls it work perfect... If i play music via earphons with 3.5mm jack or by phone speaker the volume control work fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I don't know what to do. Before e72 I've been using e71 as mp3 player always via BT and there wasn't any problems... Blehh</div>
<div><br />
<br />
I already updated the firmware (021.024)<br />
<br />
Does anybody have an idea?</div>

                </div>

<p>my e72 suffers the same problem,while my another cell N79 works fine.it's kind of annoying that it has nothing to do with the hardware.because the firmware of e72 matters from the beginning,which most of us might not have relevant professional ability to
 fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this problem has been existed for a long&nbsp;time ,but nokia didn't take it seriously,sounds like a humuliation towards those who still use its products,huh?</p>

<h2>            Shared calendar where duplicate appointment times aren&#39;t allowed&#63;</h2>
                    
<div>I work for a school district and our teachers use shared calendars to reserve equipment. They're wanting to know if it's possible to disallow someone from creating a reservation appointment if one is already made for that specific day and time.</div>


<div>So for example, if one user adds a reservation appointment for today for 3-4pm, they're wanting to know if there's a way to make it where nobody else can schedule a reservation appointment for that exact time slot using the same shared calendar.</div>


<div>I know you can edit permissions to where a user can't edit another users appointments but this is a different scenario</div>

<p>hi jmiller,</p>
<p>from the description, i understand that you are using resource mailboxes for a centralized calendar to manage reservations and users can create conflict-free reservations for the equipment. if so, this is by design behavior. however, if you want to refine
 who can reserve the resource, when they can reserve it, and for how long, there are many options available to fine-tune the resource mailbox and the reservation process.</p>
<p>for example, you can assign resource mailbox owners who are responsible for approving or rejecting reservation requests, and you can define acceptable and unacceptable resource reservation requests.</p>
<p>for more detailed information: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj215770%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
manage equipment mailboxes</a></p>
<p>moreover, you can try to troubleshot this issue via <strong>allow conflicts</strong> enable to check this issue:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;open resource mailbox via select <strong>open another mailbox</strong> in outlook web app.<br />
2.&nbsp;click on the <strong>settings</strong> icon in the top right corner next to the resource name and select
<strong>options</strong> from the dropdown list. <br />
3.&nbsp;expand the <strong>calendar</strong> section in the left navigation pane. <br />
4.&nbsp;click <strong>resource scheduling</strong><br />
5.&nbsp;<strong>allow conflicts</strong> (allow or prevent conflicting meeting requests (double booking).
<br />

<p>i'm double checking, but i'm fairly certain the calendar in question is a shared calendar that a user created under their personal outlook account. it's not a separate equipment mailbox with it's own email address. how would i edit the scheduling settings
 of a shared calendar like this?</p>
<p>i've checked in owa but i can't find the resource scheduling tab.</p>
<p>for example, the shared calendar would be test in the picture.</p>

<p>hi jmiller,</p>
<p>based on your description, about the shared calendar (test), do you refer to create a calendar by right-clicking your personal calendar as screenshot shows below then share it with other users?<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=be98dd30-f519-4ab9-a881-a554acbe5295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dbe98dd30-f519-4ab9-a881-a554acbe5295" /></a><br />
if yes, the “shared calendar (test)” is a personal calendar rather than a resource mailbox. i understand you want to disallow users to use the shared calendar creating an appointment when there is a meeting is already existed in the shared calendar for a specific
 period, it is not feasible to do that. and there is no resource scheduling tab for the personal calendar.</p>
<p>however, we do think it would be nice if we can disallow conflict scheduling for personal calendars. therefore, i would suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:<br />

<p>Correct, I'm pretty sure the calendar was created in that fashion. It's looking like we'll either keep the calendar the way it is or setup a resource mailbox. Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Release Preview Ring no longer advertised as previewing fixes for the current public release of Windows</h2>
                    <p>The WIP booth at MSIgnite has a display describing the purpose of the Release Preview Ring.&nbsp; It describes the Release Preview Ring as "...only comes out once every six months...." instead of the original purpose of providing "fixes, apps, and drivers" as
 it appears on the WIP page in your Settings.&nbsp; The RP ring is supposed to allow us to test new updates for RS4, while the Slow and Fast rings allow us to test RS5.</p>
<p>

<p>The WIP booth at MSIgnite has a display describing the purpose of the Release Preview Ring.&nbsp; It describes the Release Preview Ring as "...only comes out once every six months...." instead of the original purpose of providing "fixes, apps, and drivers" as
 it appears on the WIP page in your Settings.&nbsp; The RP ring is supposed to allow us to test new updates for RS4, while the Slow and Fast rings allow us to test RS5.</p>

<p>I do agree with you about testing patch Tuesdays. No idea why MS would stop doing this. They should be giving us a day or two to ensure no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think they should drop this ring, they are still getting telemetry and are testing any new apps that are being upgraded, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Ring is also the final checking point for MS prior to a new public feature update. As we have no idea of the number of computers in this Ring, MS is still getting all that data before rollout begins. These can be dealt with CU's.</p>

<p>They are not getting telemetry that helps with Insider previews because Release Preview Insiders are not using builds of the next release of Windows.&nbsp; They are getting updates to the current release of Windows.&nbsp; Right now the RP Insiders are on build 17134,
 not 17763.&nbsp; MSFT gets telemetry (though less extensive) from the April 2018 users anyway. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The classification of the RP ring as "Insider" confuses people all the time.&nbsp; The RP ring has nothing to do with future releases of Windows.&nbsp; The RP ring was created simply because Windows 10 does not have Optional Updates like Window 7 and 8.1 so some sort
 of release preview mechanism was needed for advance testing of Patch Tuesday updates.&nbsp; MSFT tacked it onto the WIP program.&nbsp; I think it should be removed and dropped because it is no longer serving its stated purpose.&nbsp; Why have something that only makes a
 difference twice a year when the user is going to get the feature update in a couple of weeks anyway?&nbsp; Slow Ring should be the last stop before release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Release Preview Insiders are counted in the 15 million claimed for the Windows Insider Program.</p>

            I have been tweeting Brandon since early 2017 about this issue.&nbsp; Each time he promises to look into it and let me know.&nbsp; He has never responded.&nbsp; Obviously (to me at least), the RP ring has dropped through the administrative cracks.

<p>They are still getting telemetry on the current version. This may in it self help them on the CU's for the current release and also be helping them on any new apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see this all the time, for apps, as I keep putting one vm in this Ring. When I first go online, (Base Snapshot is Offline) I do all the updates and app updates. Join Just Fixes Ring, and then another 6 or so apps will update. They are still being tested
 in Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Citing your example of 15 million Insiders, let's say hypothetically that there are 5 million in Release Preview. That is still giving MS, 5 million more devices that it can test via telemetry before final rollout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Confusing, yes it is. Should it be part of Insider? Probably not, but this is most likely the simplest method of implementing this final round of testing. It's all about the telemetry they get.</p>

<p>But did you know that if you contact Microsoft Support about an RP device the Answer Desk agent will refuse to help you because you show on their screens as an Insider?&nbsp; They are not authorized to help Insiders with issues and will only help you revert to
 a non-insider status before assisting you.&nbsp; This is garbage to me since the build number is exactly the most current public build number.&nbsp; After all, by the time you call everybody has the same major/minor build string you do.&nbsp; Remember, have any CU to you
 early so there is literally no difference in code on RP devices and non-Insider devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the telemetry, there is none concerning upcoming Patch Tuesday updates because they aren't providing them in advance of the same date everyone gets them.&nbsp; IMHO, the advantage of telemetry from the two weeks before the new version roll-out is minimal
 since the final build has already been previewed in the Fast and Slow rings. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I am aware of the MS lack of support for Insider, but was not sure about Release Preview. Agreed, this is just wrong. It is Release build with some newer Apps, that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having dealt with MS support once in the past, I really have no respect for their low-level tier of support. Insiders in this forum have more knowledge than some of these so called support people. Once they move you into a higher tier, you finally get someone
 with actual knowledge. But this is opening another can of worms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least Preview Ring does give one the next Release prior to the general public roll-out. This may just work for some, without the risks of Fast or even Slow Rings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I truly wish MS would use this Ring for it's original purpose of testing the CU's before Patch Tuesday. Now we are seeing CU's twice monthly, some months 3. That was never the intent unless some security risk came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now going off topic, why even bother with Skippy. This time we got 6 builds, last cycle I think was only 5. Is there ever anything new, nope, just get some Insiders excited for the latest number and they can't get in. Features are not generally added till
 the big merge, just some code change. Another totally useless Ring.</p>

<p>I have used Support dozens of time with very good results so I guess it is YMMV. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that MSFT is doing some catch up on the April 2018 Feature Update with all the CUs during Sept.&nbsp; They got some flak about a lot of fixes that were needed and not being addressed for 1803.</p>

<p>There were some buggy Cumulative Updates in the past, that either never went to Release Preview Ring, or they went there and severe issues were identified by Insiders, but these issues were ignored and the patch went out to the public without modification,
 causing a lot of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So historically, even when CU's went to Release Preview, the Insider feedback was apparently ignored.&nbsp; There must not have been a proper structure in place at Microsoft to respond to Insider feedback to these updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be a large enough number of Release Preview "Insiders" that it provides one final assessment of the readiness of a Release Candidate that is of value.&nbsp; But if they would never consider cancelling a particular build's public release, as a result
 of such feedback (or at least creating a new Cumulative Update that addresses this feedback) Release Preview Ring may not have real value.</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking the time to share all these details.&nbsp; We suspect the app is failing to display the categories because it's not properly handling your language settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please share some details about your language configuration?</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you select for locale when installing Windows?</li><li>Did you make any changes to your language configuration after install?</li><li>Is your language set to en-in?</li><li>Also, do you have any special network configuration or are you running tools like Fiddler?</li></ul>
<p>We deployed an update about an hour ago that may fix your issue.&nbsp; Please restart the app and let us know if the categories display again.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reply Erik!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First things first:</p>
<ul>
<li>I Installed Windows by selecting English (India) Locale.</li><li>I didn't make any changes to language configuration after Install.</li><li>Language set to en-in.</li><li>Nope i didn't anything like 'fiddler' or any web proxy</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows on 9th December after installing windows TP i was using Feedback App without facing any issues but from past two days the app didn't responds properly. The app categories still wont load correctly, the app just just showed the 'Reload'
 button!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking time to respond!</p>

<h2>            Norton refuses to uninstall</h2>
                    Can someone help me uninstall Norton? Everytime I try literally nothing happens also I'm not sure but it might be because of this notification that continuously pops up on my desktop screen every time I have to repeatedly click the X button until it goes

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to a recent update causing the data in Outlook to get corrupted or some of the settings in the rule you created are not compatible. To resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which browser are you using to access your Outlook.com account?</li><li>Were there any error messages that showed up when you attempted to create the rule?</li><li>What specific rule did you attempt to create?</li><li>What device are you using to access Outlook.com and what is the OS?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for providing the details we requested. Outlook.com allows you to create rules but they only run in your inbox. Rules don't run on other folders. As a suggestion, you can use an email client like the Outlook desktop app or any other third party email
 client to manage your email folders. If you would like to see this feature made available in a future release of Outlook.com, we encourage you to submit your issue using the Feedback Hub.</p>

<h2>            Newbie&#58; How to play .3gp  &#40;rtsp&#41; with RealOnePlayer on a Windows Mobile 6 with Pocket Internet Explorer</h2>
                    Hello All<br />
<br />
On this forum I'm a newbie, English is not my native language. So please be gentle. Thanks. First I want to describe what I want to do, next I'll describe all my attempts and finally I'll give the technical details.<br />
<br />
In short I want to play&nbsp;'Intenet movies' on my phone using my WLAN. Not just movies you find on YouTube, but also on Google Video, 123Video and so on.
<br />
<br />
Let's concentrate on YouTube. When I go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.youtube.com</a>, I get redirected to m.youtube.com. This is the mobile version of their site. I don't know if they offer the same movies, or different (mobile) quality. A clearification
 would be nice but not necessary. Any way, when I click a movie there's a warning I might do something dangerous, I click it away and Windows Media Player kicks in. It tells me the movie is corrupt or missing. This is because YouTube uses and address of the
 form rtsp://server/.../video.3gp and my version of Windows Mobile Player does not support this file format. When I force Pocket Internet Explorer (PIE) to use
<a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.youtube.com</a> by clicking on Desktop at the bottom of the page or by providing ?nomobile=1, YouTube tells me support for my browser will soon end. When I click on a movie, nothing happens.&nbsp;Actually it says 'Video not available
 (may have been removed). So this is my problem. <br />
<br />
I also have a Symbian smartphone (Nokia N80, S60v3). On this phone everything works like a charm; when I click on a movie RealOne Player opens en starts playing the movie. So my first step was to install RealOne Player (ROP). This went well. Unfortunately PIE
 doesn't want to use ROP to play the movies. So I installed a nother browser, Opera. Same problem. So I started looking for more obscure solutions; The Core Pocket Mobile Player&nbsp; (TCPMP) with FlashBundle. For some people this works, for me it doesn't. I get
 a proxy error I am not able to solve. While I was looking for a solution I also installed YouTube's own mobile 'browser' and YouTubePlay. Both solutions work for YouTube, but not for other movie sites.<br />
<br />
Here are the technical specs:<br />
HP iPAQ 614c Business Navigator with Windows Mobile 6 Professional, ROM MP-1.00.04of Mar14 2008 (updates are welcome).<br />
Windows Media Player 10 Mobile for Pocket PC (version 10.3, build 18125).<br />
Opera Mobile 10 Beta.<br />
TCPMP 0.72RC1.<br />
FlashVideoBundle v1.3.<br />
RealOne Player v1.10<br />
<br />
I you need more info, just ask. Hope you can help me. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Regards, MatheMagie<br />

<h2>            Are there any copies of Office Home and Business 2010 still on sale anywhere&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know where I can still purchase a brand new, genuine copy of Office&nbsp;Home and Business 2010 with an intended area of distribution that includes the UK?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did recently purchase a copy from a marketplace seller on the UK Amazon Web site but, when it arrived, its certificate of authenticity stated "US Only DVD" "MADE IN PUERTO RICO" "FOR DISTRIBUTION IN US ONLY".&nbsp; So I promptly returned it.&nbsp; There are a few&nbsp;other
 marketplace sellers offering the product and I have written to them asking what is stated on the certificates of authenticity on the copies that they are selling.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;just in case it turns out that none of these copies are intended for distribution in
 the&nbsp;UK, I thought it might be worth asking about other possible sources&nbsp;on this forum.</p>

As "<i>the individual</i>", I still say your concern about a package marked for US distribution is valid.
<br />
<br />
EU law about MS License terms and conditions is not the issue, restrictions in the MS Activation system are the problem you have to be concerned about.&nbsp; Many people have had problems trying to activate copies of Office that were purchased in "MS sales Regions"
 that were different than where they were being activated.&nbsp; North America is one sales region, Europe, including UK is a different one.<br />
<br />
There are some vendors who have still have unsold "old" licenses.&nbsp; You will have to search around for ones in the UK.&nbsp; Your best bet may be to see if you can get one from Amazon UK directly, not from one of their resellers such as this link I found after a
 cursory search:<br />
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-Office-Home-Business-2010/dp/B003FOYV4O/ref=pd_sim_sbs_computers_1&nbsp;&nbsp; (too bad they don't provide any info about the real vendor, is it the "real" Barcleys or someone else?)<br />
<br />
Sorry, I do not have any UK specific links, here is what I've found about the subject

Sorry, I have no idea about the EU position on MS Terms and Conditions.&nbsp; In general I would not be surprised if EU laws over-ride MS's "wishes" expressed in the Terms and Conditions (lets face it, the Terms set things totally to MS's advantage).<br />
<br />
As I said, based on my understanding of the activation process I agree there is a probable issue activating products marketed for North America in the UK.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
BUT, once you get the program activated you should not have a problem with Windows Update.
<br />
<br />
Getting support from MS in general is another question. Many people have a hard time getting "good" support from MS regardless.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, on second thought, you can get support even before activation because MS does provide support if you have problems installing
 and activating, ie:<br />

<p>In my last post, perhaps I should have replied specifically to Palcouk's post and not your post, which just happened to be the last post in the thread.&nbsp; My expression of surprise at the statement that&nbsp;MS's Ts&amp;Cs have no legal validity in the EU was really
 a reaction&nbsp;to what Palcouk reported, not to anything that you wrote.&nbsp; I apologise for any confusion.</p>

<h2>            N70 Firmware - T-Mobile - success&#33;</h2>
                    I've just come back from my local Nokia Service Centre (ECD in Wolverhampton).<br />
<br />
I took it in because my T-Mobile N70 had the V2 firmware and it was causing me loads of problems with Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
Imagine my suprise when I found that they'd upgraded the firmware to V5.0609.2.0.1 but it's still fully T-Mobile branded!<br />
<br />
For the first time (OK, I've only had it four days), I can now make handsfree calls via my TomTom RIDER.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps...

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are right.&nbsp;To use shared computer activation, you must have an Office 365 plan that includes Office 365 ProPlus. You can assign licenses under your Office 365 plan to let your uses&nbsp;connect to the terminal server.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 920 Heating up &#38; Battery Drain Issue while on Standby</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just after the black update my Lumia 920 suddenly heats up to almost unholdable temp and during that heating up battery drains at 10% per minute. I have to shutdown and let it cool before I can use again and after a few hours after restart the problem
 cycles again. take note this happens while the phone is on standby and no background apps running. Most of the time on my pocket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've been nodding my lumia 920 for weeks trying to identify the culprit and pinned it down to the Microsoft Account continuously syncing.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just after the black update my Lumia 920 suddenly heats up to almost unholdable temp and during that heating up battery drains at 10% per minute. I have to shutdown and let it cool before I can use again and after a few hours after restart the problem cycles

<p>Have you taken a look at your data sense to make sure there isn't another app that is causing a problem? I know, probably isn't the case, but thought I'd ask.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes i did and there's no app running in the background and all are blocked for running in the background. And this are all done from fresh reset i have no apps download from the store yet so basically just the MS account. An to validate that, just last night
 after 4 days of no heating and battery drain issue I setup again MS account and viola I woke up today with my battery drained to zero% from 100% after 5 hours . . . no apps running even in background and no apps download yet and uninstall all apps that can
 be uninstalled coming from factory reset. So now I reset again without entering the MS account and back to normal . . . my battery is still 99% for 3 hours now. no heatup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw . . ."daily" sync? did that already many time few weeks ago and factory reset everytime i change settings to validate which settings are misbehaving . . .&nbsp; . .still syncing . . . yes i'm in "manual" sync for my outlook account unfortunately you can't
 do that for MS account. That is why I'm requesting microsoft to add and option for "manual" sync for MS account cause that works for the outlook account while we are waiting for the 8,1(hopefully it will be resolved) or the fix before the release of 8.1.

<p>
</p><p>yes already turned off all services/sensors even location services . . . here's the thing . . . with MS account all of this turned off there is the heating problem. . . . but now without MS account even if i turned on location services and both at settings
 and maps &amp; drive settings as long as i'm not accessing any program that uses that location services . . . i have no heating issues . . . in fact i have my location services turned on now and still at 99% charge. if i use the navigation sure it will heat up
 but to a normal level only and battery drain is normal also. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not particularly blaming MS account for this but basically how the accounts sync (MS, outlook, gmail, etc) because as i said i have my outlook account installed but set it to "manual" sync and once I change that to "as item arrives or anything but manual"
 i will have the heating and battery drain issue. . . . weird as you may call it . . . .

            <p>I think i already solved this issue (at least for mine . . . give it a try and post your update if this works for you). I think there is a flaw in the manner updates are downloaded from the servers be it OTA or via Nokia Retail Updater.
<br />
<br />
What i did is that I deleted the previously downloaded Black FW in my PC which I used in reinstalling in my L920 countless times with same issues/results. Downloaded it again at the time where my internet connection is at fastest and stable (in my case 3mbps
 at early morning) to ensure a flawless transfer of data but this time I used the Nokia Software Recovery Tool. Just go to the same process and viola . . .&nbsp; for 6 days now I'm having no issues with my L920 and a battery life of 2 days for normal usage.
<br />
<br />
Maybe this is the reasons why the causes are random, some have issues with gmail, whatsapp, outlook, games, gps and for me the MS account. The issue will depend on what part of the update/transfer went wrong . . . well as i said with me its the MS account.<br />
<br />
Now my MS account is set on "as item arrives" and no issues with the following apps<br />
connectivity tiles<br />
pdf reader<br />
flashlight<br />
converter lite<br />
battery doctor<br />
here city lens<br />
here drive<br />
here maps<br />
nokia cinemagraph<br />
nokia creative studio<br />
nokia screen beamer<br />
nokia smart cam<br />
office one note<br />
panorama<br />
outlook &amp; gmail account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Syncing is also a breeze . .&nbsp; .before it takes forever! And will load more apps from then on . . . hope this helps and solve yours . . .
