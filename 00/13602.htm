<h2>            Email Sign in Username will not save &#40;autocomplete&#41; in Outlook&#47;Live&#47;Hotmail</h2>
                    Hi. Recently Outlook/Hotmail changed to a new sign-in screen; when it did, my sign-in username stopped working, &amp; now I have to manually type it in each time. After 3weeks of this&nbsp;it's a bit much, manually typing my username in 10 or more times a day.
 I cleared my autocomplete form data already, &amp; all other sign-in screens save my username, accept Outlook. I'm on W7/IE11.&nbsp;What must I do or try in order for Outlook email sign-in screen to save my username(s) like it used to before the new sign-in screen
 we all have to use now? Ty&nbsp;

            <p>This is a known problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The Forum Moderators and Community Moderators here cannot fix this bug. Only Microsoft developers can fix this bug.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps to report this problem to Microsoft developers ....<br />
<br />
1. Go to this page: &nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/id-support<br />
<br />
2. Click on "I am having trouble signing in"<br />
<br />
3. A page will open where you can describe the problem signing in (i.e., auto-complete not working when typing the first few characters of your ID into the new Microsoft Account sign in page).<br />
<br />
4. Click the Submit button.<br />
<br />
You will get email with a case number. Then you may get email with a scripted reply telling you to enable auto-complete in your browser. Verify that auto-complete is working in your browser by signing on to other sites you use (such as netflix, gmail, facebook,
 etc and typing the first few characters of your ID). Then respond to the email you received and tell them that auto-complete works on other sites ... it just does not work on the new Microsoft Account sign in page. Be persistent and eventually your case will
 get escalated to a higher level.<br />
<br />
If enough people complain, Microsoft will fix this problem.

<h2>            memory for N73</h2>
                    I'm a bit confused, are N73's with latest firmware supporting more than 2 gig miniSD's? so could I buy a 4 gig in order to be able to put the whole Europe map from route 66 version 8 on my phone?<br />
On E-bay there are 4gig cards for sale of which they say they are N73 compatible..... but I don't trust everything I see.....

            No, N73's cannot support 4GB cards with any firmware version.<br />
<br />
The cards you see on ebay are rubbish, they don't work properly. Thats why well known manufacturers like sandisk or kingston haven't released a card, because 4GB SD doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Cards that are 4GB or larger are in the SDHC format. The N73 cannot ever accept this format because it doesn't have the needed internal hardware to support them.

<br />
Why is it foolish? The N73 was designed and released before the micro and mini SDHC standard existed.<br />
<br />
Back then the limit was 2GB and there was no way around it. They can only work with whats available at the time.<br />
<br />
Phones get old quickly nowadays so maybe it's time you moved on to another model if you want more storage space?<br />
<br />
Delixis also made a good point. You could have one card full of music and one card with movies on. 2GB cards are dirt cheap now and the phone supports hotswap.<br />

            SDHC support doesn't require hardware changes. It would require firmware changes - SD uses FAT16, SDHC uses FAT32. Not a major upgrade, but its very unlikely that it'll be added.<br />
<br />
And as said, the N73 pre-dates the SDHC format, and for a lot of people 2gig is more than adequate.

            It's not just the file system that is different, it's also the internal hardware required to read the card. That is why an older SD card reader on a PC cannot read a SDHC card (newer readers released since SDHC can read both).<br />
<br />
I've yet to see any device from any manufacturer that has been updated from SD to SDHC using firmware.

            Just read up a bit more on SDHC.<br />
<br />
It uses different memory addressing methods to SD, but the physical connection is the same. It would just be a firmware update to support it on older devices. Obviously on card readers this is generally unlikely to happen, and on most other devices (phones,
 cameras, etc.) its not actually in the interests of the manufacturers to add the support on when they want you to buy more products.<br />
<br />
There is one device thats had SDHC support added in firmware - the Nokia N800. So it is possible. Just unlikely.

            well, if all that is required is a firmware update i would love nokia to do it, especially seeing that they are launching n-gage soon, n73 users would have a reason to keep theirs, but where's the storage? that's something to think about.<br />
<br />
but there is no doubt that i will upgrade to the n78, but in the meantime my card is almost full and carrying more than one card isn't as convenient as it sounds.

            Its not in Nokias interests to do an update to support SDHC cards though.<br />
<br />
The N800 was different - its aimed at a completely different market, generally techie linux geeks, and the addition of such things isn't surprising.

<p>Contrary to Arturo's response (and ignoring his comment about WP7 being for<br />
kids and basic users), it is possible to email Office docs from the device<br />
(though not PDFs yet).</p>
<p>To send an Office doc, simply go to the Office hub, press and hold the<br />
document you want to email, and then click send.</p>

<p>I made a Non VBA solution (based on Excel Only) that you can find <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=8870C7A03CA89CE3!258&amp;authkey=!AOS_aQIpCTyt37E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> .</p>
<p>In sheet Source copy your long texts in range A4 to A32 and go to Sheet Results to see how it goes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To add more rows in each source just Drag the grey row down, then drag last row with formulas down till the grey row (end of formatted areas), same for both sheets.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>I have done all that you asked but it is still the same it just not fit the screen, I do not have this problen with say google store it works perfectly. I seem to be having all sorts of problems with windows, it causes my laptop to slow down and the mouse

<p>My laptop is a HP Compac nx6125 the resolution is set at the recommended 1024x768,&nbsp;</p>

            Regret I can't offer you a fix - one must hope someone senior at MS is getting a grip on this!&nbsp; I hope some of the Workarounds discussed below might help you temporarily?<br />
<br />
As you can see from the current MS announcement at top of the forum pages and the flood of reports from other users there is a obviously still a widespread problem with opening the People page/Contacts list from the Outlook PC site.&nbsp; Please keep hitting the
 "Service status" page... <br />
<br />
It would be a good idea if everyone still experiencing this problem kept reporting it on MS' Service status page. If enough users do this the issue will be further escalated :
<a href="https://status.live.com/detail/people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><font color="#0072c6">https://status.live.com/detail/people</font></strong></a><br />
<br />
Below are some ways you might tackle the problem until MS get a proper fix in place:<br />
<br />
<i>People page won't open... People page just "hangs" forever... can't access my Contacts list... address box does not populate when typing a new e-mail...</i> etc.&nbsp; This all seems to be the same
<u>very</u> common current problem (bug?) with the failure of MS OUTLOOK's contact database to load correctly on the PC site.&nbsp; Most browsers seem to be pretty equally affected (perhaps Chrome less so - if you have it - try it).<br />
<br />
The forum moderators variously suggest <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser%27s-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing your browser's Cache</a> and Cookies, Updating to the latest version and/or Resetting your browser, etc.&nbsp; All reasonable ideas and if you look through recent forum topics you will find these suggestions laid out in full.&nbsp; Sadly not that many successful
 outcomes - but then you might just be lucky?<br />
<br />
These are 4 Workarounds being suggested, one or more of them may work for you:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; You may be able to at least access your Contacts list by using OUTLOOK's <a href="https://profile.live.com/home/contacts/?bfv=um" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Mobile site login</font></a> page (https://profile.live.com/home/contacts?bfv=um).&nbsp; Best to try this when you are fully logged out of OUTLOOK.&nbsp; Sadly this is of limited use as the Mobile page "footer" link back to the PC site People page
 will just hang forever as well.&nbsp; However it will prove your Contacts list still exists and in extremis you could copy/paste or write out e-mail addresses!<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Try <b>disabling </b>the<b> </b>Adobe<b> Flash plugin</b> in whatever browser you are using and then just use the reload/refresh button and hopefully the "hung forever" PEOPLE page will then complete loading normally.&nbsp; It's a pain to have to keep disabling
 and re-enabling Flash but this Workaround may allow you to use your Contacts list almost normally again.
<br />
<br />
If not sure how to disable/re-enable the Flash plugin a search engine will quickly find the instructions.<br />
<br />

<b><font color="#0072c6">Address Book inaccessible in OUTLOOK.COM Hotmail</font></b></a> topics.&nbsp; Thanks to
<i><b>CWH803</b> </i>for finding this Workaround.)<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Try a different browser - Chrome seems to be the least affected, others have had success trying Firefox, and some have succeeded by resetting whatever browser they were currently using.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; If you have access to other machines try them... especially if you have an older machine still running XP/SP3 - several users report that their old XP PC is unaffected by this problem.<br />
<br />
Hope the above might help - you are not alone - there's a shed load of similar topics, information and other frustrated OUTLOOK users on the forum.&nbsp; All in all it's a right pigs ear and hardly MS' finest hour?

<h2>            Printed Pages Are Blank&#33;&#33;&#33; Print Preview Is Always Blank Too&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to print something out, it always comes out blank.&nbsp; Even worse, when using Print Preview the results are always blank as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help me fix this problem.&nbsp; I normally copy and paste what I need into Adobe Acrobat XI&nbsp;Pro and print things out that way, but getting my older parents to do this for every page that they need printed is not an option!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried printing out webpages with and without Enhanced Protection Mode turned on and off...&nbsp; And the results are the same.&nbsp; I can print everything else out on my computer but not IE11 Desktop Mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can print out pages with IE11 Metro Mode and IE11 Metro Mode's Print Preview Mode does show the page properly too... So this is an IE11 Desktop Issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, this problem exists on both 32bit &amp; 64bit browsers... I have 6 computers all having the same issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you kindly, and please post solution online vs. private messages!!!</p>

            <p>Found the solution after tons of BINGING...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Half the problem is my fault but only to a small extent.&nbsp; The other half of the problem is Microsoft not taking into account or changing things up in the USER PROFILE section where the problem resides.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I like to partition my hard drives in half or keep a secondary drive which I always MOVE the default folders to as protection from losing my data.&nbsp; What do I mean, once I install a computer from scratch I always move My Documents, My Music, My Videos, Downloads,
 Desktop, Contacts, etc. to my D drive or Secondary Drives so that my data is protected from day one.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But, here is where the problem lies with Internet Explorer not being able to print pages out besides blank pages.&nbsp; There is a folder within USER PROFILES where Internet Explorer uses for all temp files, etc.&nbsp; Even though I don't mess with any of these folders
 on my computers, it seems that changing my folders over to another drive either deletes the temp folder or corrupts it.&nbsp; The strange thing is that these folders are in a totally separate location from the folders I relocated, but still corrupts the final destination
 regardless... and I am assuming that it's most likely the DOWNLOADS folder that's the culprit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So here's the solution that I found online and that fixes this problem if your like me and like to relocate your USER Folders to another drive or location.&nbsp; This helps to do with your Internet Explorer closed out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Step 1:&nbsp; Run Command Prompt as Administrator and type the following command in:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>mkdir %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp\Low</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Step 2:&nbsp; Run Command Prompt as Administrator and type the following command in:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>icacls %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp\Low /setintegritylevel low</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now open your Internet Explorer as you normally would and see if the pages you want to print show up in Print Preview or by Printing the page out.&nbsp; This should fix your problems...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If anyone as Microsoft can help me devise another way of relocating my USER Folders where this problem won't exist moving forward, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you so much...</p>

<h2>            Can Entourage manage a snail mail mailing list for my small business&#63;</h2>
                    I am looking for a program to manage a snail mail mailing list for my small business.&nbsp; Will entourage do this? I currently use this program for e-mail and I have only names and e-mail addresses in my address book.&nbsp; I have my postal adresses typed into
 an excel spreadsheet.&nbsp; With the spreadsheet I can not manipulate my mailing list as I would like to.&nbsp; Can anyone suggest a program that might help me?&nbsp; I would like to be able to print lables, sort list and print only selected labels, etc.&nbsp; I can use the spreadsheet
 to do labels, but I can't sort and manipulate my data as I would like to.&nbsp; I hate to type over 1,000 contacts into Entourage not knowing if this program will do what I need.&nbsp; If entourage will do this, is there a way to back up my address book info after I
 get it all typed in?&nbsp; <br />

            You keep referring to Excel not being able to do what you would "like to" but you don't give any indication of what it is that you would like to do that can't readily be done :-) Data properly stored in Excel can be 'manipulated' in virtually any means
 necessary. It's far more powerful in that regard than any email client. After all, Excel is first &amp; foremost a data management app. Combined with the Mail Merge Manager feature of Word it makes for one of the most versatile systems available for any type of
 merge... Form Letters, Labels, Envelopes, Catalogs, as well as merging to email using Entourage.<br />
<br />
Have a look in Excel Help on the topic: Create and print mailing labels<br />
<br />
As well as the info available in Word's Help on the merge features.<br />

            Entourage has no limit on how many recipients you can include in a message, but ISPs do. The number of emails you can send depends on the Host or your ISP. Some indicate no more than 100 emails in a batch and no more than 500 in a day. Others limit it
 to 50 per message.<br />
<br />
It's unclear to me if you want a mailing list where users can post replies or if is just an announcement list.<br />
<br />
I manage several mailing lists using Mailman and Dada that are available as part of my
<a href="http://www.hostmonster.com/track/dianeross" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hostmonster</a> account. Mailman limits to 100 subscribers, Dada has no limit.<br />
<br />
Entourage does not export groups. If you enter the addresses only into a group, you can loose data. I suggest that you add each contact to your Address Book and assign a category for the name of the group to the contact. Sort by the category to create your
 group. This will allow you to export by category your groups so they can be recreated if necessary.<br />

    <title>Windows Phone marketplace country - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amir saleh alavi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone marketplace country</h2>
                    Hello<br />
I have 2 windows phone smart phones, a Lumia 710 which is wp7.5 &amp; a Lumia 520 which is wp8. But I have a really weird problem: Both of my phones are associated with one windows live ID, but marketplace region for each of them is different. It's OK for lumia
 710, which is US, but for my Lumia 520, it's set to Saudi Arabia, which I have never set any of my accounts or my devices in whole world to this country! Now I can't install many apps on my phone.<br />
The other weird thing I just found out, is that even if I reset my wp8 to its factory reset, and link it with a new account that I created in PC and set its region to US, it still changes the region to Saudi Arabia! I tried to create an account right after
 I reset my phone with my wp, but it errors that "we can't connect to network", so it doesn't allow me to create an account and set its region there, but I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the network! I guess this phone that I just bought is from Saudi Arabia
 or Iraq, so it's locked to set the region there, but isn't there anything that I can do with it?<br />
I have thought of a solution for it, but yet couldn't test it, because I didn't need any SD card yet, so I don't have one. But if I download the app somehow and use SD card to install it on my WP8, will the problem solve? Or it will come up with an error related
 to region? But still after that, I'll have problem in buying the apps!<br />
What is the solution please?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Amir Saleh Alavi<br />

            <p>Hello Amir Saleh Alavi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting in the forum! </p>
<p>Please login to account.live.com with the Microsoft account in question. In your Info what country is set there?</p>
<p>In any case on the WP8 you can change your country/region and thus the Marketplace, so on your Phone go to Settings - Language+Region - Country Region - Change country region. US, UK are the best options. After that soft reset the phone and try to use the
 Marketplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Please let us know if you have any further questions<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Have a nice day!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you tried updating the HealthVault app? Did you encounter any error message when trying to connect to the app? What steps have you done to resolve the issue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Question to the moderator: how does a user update an "app" that is purely a website (and databases) on MS' servers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue (I just discovered this today. I do not regularly check if data is actually synched between two solutions from the same manufacturer but today I wanted to look up some data on HealthVault and realized that all Band (2) data since mid
 December has not been synched)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I though maybe I can "restart" the synchronization by disconnecting and then reconnecting the apps. But guess what: After I disconnected Health Vault in the MS Health (or now Band) app, there is no connect button anymore.</p>
<p>HealthVault is still listed, just without a connect button. The only thing left is a "marketing" link that takes you to the HealthVault webpage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that Microsoft is now doing everything they can to mob Band users off the platform. Great way to treat your customers, especially the ones who had decided to build their whole ecosystem (PCs (including tablets), phone, "fitness" tracker and all
 the related apps) around MS / Windows solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is worse is that MS is not openly communicating the end of support for solutions like the Band or Windows Phone. Do that in the right way and explain your decision and user might accept it (even if begrudgingly). Ideally, recommend good alternatives
 and potentially work with the recommended provider to make their products better.&nbsp;But MS&nbsp;lets users find out step by step over time that they are being left out in the dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft was trying to write the book on how to alienate their biggest supporters ("fans"), they probably could not do it any better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what is just sad: the Band 2, with all the flaws it has (breaking strap, battery for some, room for improvement on some apps), is (was) one of the best life / fitness / sports tracking solutions available - I know, I have been screening the market for
 a replacement for my Band 2 for more than a month now (the strap is breaking ...). I am pretty sure that &gt;90% of current Band 2 users would have upgraded to a Band 3 that would have fixed the known flaws (most prominently the breaking strap) and potentially
 have provided some asked for upgrades (mainly waterproof / able to track swimming). They probably would have also told everyone around them how good a device it is at a very reasonable price (and at least I would have been willing to pay more than I paid for
 the Band 2). </p>
<p>
</p><p>But now: Basically every Band 2 user will be telling their friends to not trust MS when they introduce new and innovative solutions (if they are in a good mood they might add "for consumers").</p>

<p>Hi Li and thank you for your inquiry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company Name can be for the most part whatever you want it to be as this becomes the Account name for your Bing Ads account. Some advertisers just use their own name as the company name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps! Please reply back if you have any further questions or concerns. We will be more than happy to assist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Bing Ads! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Build 9879 beware</h2>
                    Before Windows 10 build 9879 Team Fortress 2 worked even though the game doesn't download custom maps even with the internet but was "almost non playable" with horrible performance unlike Windows 8 which works flawlessly even on max settings 60 fps or
 more with rarely any lag. Also the keyboard caps, number lock light indicator used to work too but now Team Fortress 2 refuses to launch and the keyboard caps and number lock no longer lit up.

            <p>Hi Akhilesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the below mentioned formula to get the desired output.. Note that it is an array formula. You have press Ctrl+Shift+Enter after typing the formula.. Here in the below formula, B5:B11 is the Leader's Range, C5:C11 is the&nbsp;Subordinate Range. D4 is the Leader
 criteria...</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(--(FREQUENCY(IF(B5:B11=D4,MATCH(C5:C11,C5:C11,0)),ROW(B5:B11)-ROW(B5)+1)&gt;0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want total summary, you can do the same by using pivot table. In pivot table drag Leader into Rows and Subordinate into values in the field list.. You will get the desired output..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>BKG.</p>

</p><p>Note - Array Formula is not entered by pressing ENTER after entering your formula but by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. If you are copying and pasting this formula, take F2 after pasting and CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. This will put { } brackets around the formula which
 you can see in Formula Bar. If you edit again, you will have to do CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER again. Don't put { } manually.</p>

<h2>            How to deselect items &#40;Outlook 2016&#41; while installing Office 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to install Office 2016 (64 bit), whithout installing Outlook 2016? I don't see an option to 'deselect' any item...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to upgrade my Outlook (version 2010), because an Exchange server (version 2003) mail account&nbsp; I'm using a lot will not be upgraded.&nbsp;I found out the hard way that Exchange 2003 does not work with Outlook 2013, nor Outlook 2016. But I would like
 to upgrade everything else from Office, from my current version 2013 to version 2016. I've an Office 365 subscription license and running Windows 10. Thanks for your suggestions.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Custom installation feature is not available in the Office 2016 version, so you would not be able to upgrade to Office 2016 without installing/upgrading to Outlook
 2016.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, upgrading to Office 2016 will not help in your case as you are using Exchange Server 2003, provided your account is also upgraded to Exchange Server 2010 in
 which scenario you will be able to upgrade to Outlook 2016.</span></span></p>

 thing just hype?&nbsp; How can I get word&nbsp;for free&nbsp;so that I can use windows for homework?&nbsp; Thank you.

 editing of documents only on tablets and phones with screen sizes less than 10.1 inches. On laptops and desktops, the apps allow only reading of existing documents unless you have a paid-up consumer subscription to Office 365 -- in which case you can have
 the full Office 2016 suite and have no need for the stripped-down Office Mobile apps.</p>

                    <p>I suspect this is related to the inability to launch apps (32-bit only?) without admin rights in this build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reported this via feedback, but wanted to confirm if others are seeing this.&nbsp;&nbsp; About once an hour, I get 3-7 popups for UAC, related to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>...SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe (and maybe others).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various switches in place after the executable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some examples are:</p>

<p>SetFlightsDetectionFrequency</p>
<p>SetFlightsDetectionFrequencyEnabled</p>
<p>SetFlightsAuOptions##DELETE##0</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You might be aware that Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in developmental stage, you may expect some compatibility issues as of now and some features or settings might not work as expected.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is good to know that you are already reported this via feedback. Your efforts to work on this issue is very much appreciated.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Further, you may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check the status.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with
 the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but you should consider the issue before offering a generic "Clean Boot" response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're suggesting that a 3rd party app could potentially clock Windows UAC from working correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that's the case, you have a serious security issue on your hands.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that 5 others are seeing the issue (at this point), and that we have a known issue with admin rights in this build, I suspect it is build-related.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks !&nbsp; That is good news!</p>
<p>I'm downloading 10074 at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be able to test this when it finishes installing......if the previous two builds are anything to go by, that will be in about eight hours time......
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm running this evaluation on a old Dell Inspiron 1525 with a Pentium Dual T3200 @ 2.00 GHz and 3.0 GB of Ram.</p>
