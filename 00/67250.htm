<p>First of all if you realized that now you can report for what he is doing.</p>
<p>So what I suggest is either disconnect your modem/router to change your IP or if that doesn't work then you have to manually change your IP address. Try to go on Google and search on how to change your IP address.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Dual NIC&#39;s - Private &#47; Public Networks appear not to be correctly assigned</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two NIC's attached to my Windows 10 PC. Each are connected to two separate Routers, both using the IANA Private IPv4 Addressing space. One NIC, however, is not connected to the internet and is intended to be "Private" only. &nbsp;Both however, are reported
 as being a "Private network"- which concerns me, as that would suggest the Private network Firewall settings will apply to the real Public facing NIC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, "View your network properties" shows the Connectivity correctly for each NIC (Connected to Internet, Connected to local network), yet both NICs are shown as Private - this doesnt really make sense in terms of the Security Settings. Furthermore, old
 regedit hacks to address this matter, no longer appear to work ....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to this ?</p>

            The problem appeared to be related somehow to the Windows Firewall. Reinstating the defaults resolved the matter.

    <title>Printer works everywhere but my Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kellome  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer works everywhere but my Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am able to use my HP series 2549 printer on all my devices, WinXP mini-laptop, 3 different Apple products, but not on my Windows 10 after the last updates on February 7th. The printer was already installed and working fine. The printer is currently installed
 again, however, I keep getting a message that I am denied access to change preferences or settings. Tonight, I was able to set up a lot of printer functions, such as manually setting my IP configuration and reinstalling the software, troubleshooting software,
 and indeed, print - but not anything I chose. Only a test page came out. I am unable to print documents or photos. In fact, when I try to print if I get past the 'There is no printer installed' message, my only options are to print from "This PC" and not my
 downloads or word documents. When I try to print from Excel, I get the dialog box with no printer listed, but everything else is there. When I click to try to add a printer, I get this message "The Active Directory Domain Services is currently unavailable".
 Under the "Find in the Directory" inquiry. I am wondering if that is the issue, the ADDS ? That doesn't seem like an 'unavailable' item. All my permissions are intact. I've been with this trouble for weeks now, a support person from Microsoft did a restore,
 but only up to the day after the update that caused my issues. Somehow, buying a new printer does not seem like the fix here, it seems like an internal, program issue. I am seeing that the printer driver install
</p>
"Device SWD\PRINTENUM\WSD-2de7bcb5-4326-40fa-a3c2-89fdab47f254.006a requires further installation." message is now appearing. Is this my answer ? Can you decipher it in plain talk for me ? I also do all updates, and virus protection. This hard drive only has
 windows 10 on it. No changes to my computer at all since I got it new in late 2016. In fact, I don't even use it but a few times a week. Thanks !!<br />

<p>Hi KelloMe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that your printer driver is either outdated or incompatible. Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the printer driver?
<span>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click the name of the device, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, update the printer driver. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, type<strong> Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards,&nbsp;expand the&nbsp;<strong>Display adapters</strong> category, right click your graphics card and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

            I will do these changes. I have done them already but I have no problem doing them again. When you say "<span>It is possible that your printer driver is either outdated or incompatible", can the printer become this way
 because of an update to the system ? I am not aware that this was possible but it certainly could explain working one day and then not after the update. I would be very happy if simply replacing the printer would cure this frustrating issue. I will return
 with a response soon as to how things went with your advice. Thank you.&nbsp;</span>

            I did what you had advised. The printer appears in my devices area but it says there's no driver installed now, this is after I searched for the updated drivers - after uninstalling it through device manager. I will go to HP and get the drivers again.
 However, for the heck of it, I clicked "Add a device" and not only was no device found but I received this message "Windows can't open add a printer. Access is denied". This seems to be the consistent message no matter what I do, over the last two weeks. The
 "Access denied" needs to be addressed, I believe. Buying a new (compatible?) printer will do nothing if the system is having issues with itself, not the printer. I am going to retrieve the drivers again and will wait for your reply or any others. Thank you.&nbsp;

<p>If installing the updated drivers from the manufacturer's site still doesn't work, try to roll it back to the last good configuration. To do that, you may follow these steps:

<li>Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your printer driver, select <strong>Properties</strong>, and browse to the
<strong>Driver </strong>tab. </li><li>Press the <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> option if available, and Windows 10 will begin the process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, try to install the driver in compatibility mode. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Select <strong>Compatibility </strong>tab. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop-down list.</li><li>Let the driver install, and then check the functionality.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If these steps still won't make any difference, I suggest that you open up the
<strong>Print Server Properties</strong>. Type <strong>cmd </strong>in the search bar, right-click on the best match and select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. Then, type the following command: <strong>
RUNDLL32 PRINTUI.DLL,PrintUIEntry /s</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the <strong>Security </strong>tab and add <strong>Computername\Users</strong> (substituting
<em>"Computername"</em> with the name of your computer). Give the permission to <strong>
Print </strong>and <strong>View Server</strong>. It should have full permissions. Press
<strong>OK</strong>, and then restart the system to check if you can add the device.

            It's not going good. Now I'm getting this code:&nbsp;
<div>
<hr />
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Error code 0x80070005 is also known as "ACCESS DENIED." And cannot do a whole lot because of it. At least I was smart enough to finally research the numbers above that led to hearing "ACCESS DENIED" yet again. And again, this does not seem like a printer issue,
 but a permissions(?) issue. I have to guess that the Microsoft tech that did a restore remotely to my computer also received that message as the system has yet to have a successful restore, due to the above code; for when it showed up, he quickly left without
 a word. I'd like to get past all the printer 'fixes' and address this&nbsp;<span>"ACCESS DENIED" issue, please. Thanks.&nbsp;</span></div>

<p>Thank you for the update. In order to resolve user permission issues, using the Registry Editor is one to correct it. Please note that making mistakes while modifying registry could affect your system adversely. Therefore, make sure that you follow the steps
 carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you may refer to this

            My apologies, power outage for days, printer ran out of ink... Anyway, I was able to apply all the steps in the log above this reply. I was surprised that there are 6 different 'users' considering I am the only person in my home, but I allowed access to
 everyone. Even restricted, but will alter that possibly (not sure) if I actually get to print. Which I have not been able to do. I can see my device is in the devices and printers section of control panel. However, it seems only partially there. I can see
 that it is showing that 'scan' is an option but there is no reference to 'print' and I had opened several different pictures, documents and things, all stating no printer is found when I tried to print. Because the device is not appearing in Device Manager,
 there's nothing in there I can do. I can't print because it states there's no driver. So I feel like perhaps significant progress has been made -&nbsp; for all the things I've done this evening, I've not seen any "Access Denied" messages so

<p>Hello KelloMe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us. For now, I'd recommend performing an in-place repair using the Windows 10 ISO file. You check the guidelines posted by
<strong>Andre Da Costa </strong>on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">Forum Article.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"If your Windows 10 installation is demonstrating unusual behavior such as built in apps not working or launching, you can perform a repair upgrade to fix the problem. A repair upgrade is the process of installing Windows 10 over the existing installation
 of Windows 10 on your hard disk, using your installation DVD or ISO file. Performing this can repair broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications.</em><strong>"</strong></p>

<p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all of the uninstalling of my printer, I was unable to fully install it ever again here on my laptop, with the windows 10 OS. This is still the case. However, I made a tiny bit of progress this evening and actually got this far (see image). But that
 is where I am currently stuck. Can you direct me as to how to get my Directory to become 'available' ? Thanks. I appreciate the option listed above from Andre Da Costa, but I decline. Thanks.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b14fc58b-19d6-43a7-ba25-fba6c3a9bddc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b14fc58b-19d6-43a7-ba25-fba6c3a9bddc?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p><span>Hi Nick,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Problems working with files and folders in Windows can be caused by permissions issues, corrupted user accounts or even corrupted files. These issues often occur after upgrading to another version of Windows, connecting to other computers over a network
 or even just connecting an external hard drive into your computer.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
"Access Denied" or other errors when accessing or working with files and folders in Windows<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2623670/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2623670/en-us</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can refer to the below steps to provide <strong>full permission</strong> to a particular file or folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the file or folder which you need to provide <strong>
full permission</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now <strong>right click</strong> on that file or folder and click on
<strong>Properties.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on the <strong>Security tab</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on the <strong>user account</strong> through which you are logged in.<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">
</span><span>Clicking on the <strong>user</strong> will show you the <strong>permissions</strong> set for the user pertinent to the
<strong>folder.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After you have viewed the <strong>permissions</strong> that are already set, you can now click on the
<strong>Advanced Button</strong> that is right below the "Permissions for Authenticated Users".</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Once you have clicked <strong>Advanced</strong>, a box would appear, the "<strong>Permission Entries</strong>" box, which shows all the
<strong>permissions</strong> that are set for the <strong>users</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Now, after you have <strong>spotted</strong> the <strong>
user</strong> whose <strong>permissions</strong> you wish to <strong>change</strong>, click "<strong>Change Permissions".</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on the <strong>user</strong> you would like to
<strong>edit</strong>, and then click the option that says "<strong>Change Permissions</strong>" which is
<strong>right below the box</strong>. To change permission you have to click on <strong>
edit.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Once <strong>edit</strong> is <strong>clicked</strong>, you are going to get the same box pop up but this time you can actually edit the options.</span><span> You can do that by clicking the "<strong>Administrators</strong>" user
 again, and this time, you are going to click the "<strong>Edit</strong>" option.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, try the steps mentioned below and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Install the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Download the <strong>Game</strong> </p>
<p>b) Right-click on the Game and click on ‘<span style="font-weight: bold"><span>properties’</span></span>.</p>
<p>c) Click on the ‘<span><span style="font-weight: bold">compatibility</span>’ tab and check the box ‘<span style="font-weight: bold">Run this program in compatibility mode for’</span></span> and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.</p>
<p>d) Click on ‘<span><span style="font-weight: bold">Apply</span>’ and click ‘<span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span></span>’ and run the file to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If issue still persists, post back with current status of your computer and result of proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</p>

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />You would need to format the drive, which would remove all the data from the partition.
<br />Click Format just below which should install Windows. Do not format drive D as it contains your data. However, your Installed Software's on D won't work.

            Hi Einstyle.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated steps here for doing the best possible Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You really should back up your data first so you can do a true Clean Install by deleting all partitions off the drive, then follow the steps for how to create and format the necessary partitions - they even cover how to have a separate data partition which is popular lately.  
<br />
<br />If not then delete all of the partitions up to the Data partition, highlight the Unallocated Space and click Next to let it create the necessary new partitions in the Unallocated Space (only) and begin install.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi einstyle 
<br />
<br />From your screenshot, you need to select each partition on Disk 0 (4 partitions in total) and click Delete
<br />
<br />Then when you are left with 1 unallocated space on Disk 0, click 'Next ' to install Windows 10 - please Note - do not touch Drive 1 at all

</p><p>I have tried to do many of the Microsoft forum fixes for 2 months now and nothing I read about will fix my Lenovo laptop Z580 that's just 15 months new.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I had Win. 8 and since Win. 8.1 came out I could always install apps and get the&nbsp;updates&nbsp;great. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in May I got all of the 2ed Tuesdays updates and I also got that 1 KB that said I need to&nbsp;install this kb update to get all future updates.!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I even tried to do a search how to fix this error from other web sites that still are for windows store Fixes for this error code.&nbsp; I have tried so many fixes I read about but nothing I have come across will fix this error code.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

 how to fix this??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh there's 1 thing I can still do with my apps I already have that the other people can't do when they get this&nbsp;error.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I can click on any of the Apps from the App Tile start page and use any app.&nbsp; But when I read about other people that get this error
 code that they &nbsp;can't even use any of there apps. &nbsp;And&nbsp;Some also could not open the windows store at&nbsp;all. &nbsp;But I can still do all of these.&nbsp; I just can't install a app or get updates.?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any and all help so I can use my laptop at the windows store again??.&nbsp; And I don't have a windows 8 install disk, my laptop did not come with one.</p>

<h2>            Errors 0xC1900101 0x2000C while updating from 8 to 8.1 on Win-Store</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I downloaded the update 8.1, tried to install but not succeed. Always after restart, about 7% or more it shut down and rolled back to Win 8. Error codes are&nbsp;0xC1900101 and 0x2000C. I saw on some forums that it was because the hard disk is encrypted, so
 I deactivated BitLocker but always the same errors. That is very frustrated. Hat someone the same issue? Any ideas to solve this problem?</div>

<div>thanks for support. I had no external devices connected, all softwares are up to date. I have also removed antivirus software but still the same errors. I give up! My laptop is a VAIO: i7, 6 GB RAM, 256 SSD, I think the hardware is okay. Have to be happy
 with the 8 :(</div>

            I an having the same problems on my Toshiba laptop. It came installed with widows 7 and I upgraded it to 8 on day 1. Now I want to get 8.1 but I am experiencing this problem. I updated a few of my drivers but to no success. I will try to update the rest.
 Anyone know of an easy fix?

            <p>It was pre-warned that Windows previous versions would need to be re-installed, then Windows 8 and then upgrade to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You might try putting the system in clean boot and retry installing the update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or, </p>
<p>You could always use the Upgrade Assistant and create an .ISO file which may be used to install it.</p>

            I noticed something recently and I am wondering if others can check this out and see if it is true. The error occurs during the setting things up part. During it, the computer just shuts off. When that happened I immediately turned it on and it only stayed
 on for a second before tuning off again. I waited longer and it stayed on longer. The longer I waited, the longer it stayed on until I got to the point where the battery charged enough. If anyone has an old handheld gaming thing (DS, gameboy, psp) and you
 let it run out of battery all the way, and turn it back on as soon as you plug it in, you will see it turn on and off. The longer it stays plugged in the longer it stays on until a certain point where it just stays on. This is exactly what I saw happening.
 This leads me to believe it is a battery error. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears almost everyone with this issue has a tablet or laptop. What it looks like to me is the update is murdering the battery and using up way to much energ

            Sounds feasible, except for the fact that my laptop is fully charged and it was off no more than a minute before I turned it back on. My laptop stays fully charged, I do not run the battery down.

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>

</p><p>I understand that one of your customers wants to use Windows 7 machine to create a small Terminal Server with a third party software. However, your question is beyond the scope of what is typically answered in this consumer forum and would be better suited
 for the IT Pro audience in TechNet. </p>

    <title>How do I make sound settings persist through reboots&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve rothkin  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I make sound settings persist through reboots&#63;</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 64-bit on a Lenovo Thinkpad Edge.<br /><br />I have a Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Notebook (model SB0950) installed. It is ALWAYS inserted and connected to my mic and speakers.

I have turned off all Sound Blaster special effects (including X-Fi Crystalizer and CMSS-3D). Every time I reboot, they become re-enabled on their own. I have even checkmarked the Disable Sound Blaster enhancements in the Windows speaker properties for the X-fi -- that ends up getting automatically unchecked on reboot. <br /><br />This is really annoying. I want these enhancements OFF because I am doing voice lessons over Skype and ear training with GNU Solfege. The enhancements cause cords and intervals to sound different which is a huge problem for me. I have updated to the latest soundblaster driver for my system. That hasn't helped.<br /><br />I initially sent this information to Creative's tech support. Their response was:<br /><br />This is a common Windows problem that affects many devices

            I already verified I have the latest driver before posting here. I tried Update Driver from the properties page for the card and I also downloaded and installed the latest driver from Creative.<br />
<br />
The sound card works fine. The only problem (to reiterate) is that every time I reboot it re-enables several "enhancement" settings that I have explicitly disabled because by their nature they change the sound in ways I find undesirable.<br />

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am thinking the folks over at Creative might have misunderstood the question. The problems seem to be with the Creative software itself correct? It sounds like there should be some sort of setting within the software itself that should allow you to save
 the settings. The link they gave you about random things being reset in Windows is not very helpful because, correct me if i'm wrong, but the only thing that is getting reset is the software from Creative themselves.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, my suggestion is to press Creative for better troubleshooting steps for their software, or totally uninstalling and&nbsp;re installing&nbsp;the software.&nbsp;</div>

            I am again pursuing with Creative, however the settings show up on the Sound Blaster tab of the generic Windows speaker properties dialog (from Control Panel -&gt; Sound). And whatever is set on that tab is lost on reboot. I'm not sure but maybe Creative
 is expecting Windows to be responsible for saving/maintaining those settings.<br />

 the recovery.</p>
<p>One suggestion from Apple was to use an Apple pc to restore the ipod to factory settings for the 4th generation shuffle. I don't have assess to an Apple pc :(&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ajay.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If the problem persists and you have a System Restore point from before it began, you can try rolling back next:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />If this cannot be done from Windows you can do it from Repair mode:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hey thanks for such a quick reply, the thing is now I tried to close the tab which gave e that error and I got a new tab saying the rpc server is unavailable. With the same title rundll32.exe</p>
<p>After searching it said it had something to do with remote access to printers and what not, does this error mean someone has access to my laptop remotely like a hacker. Remote access to my pc is turned off, this is quite scary and I feel quite anxious, I
 would be great full if you could tell me what this error message means&nbsp; Also after closing this message, file explorer opens,&nbsp; which didn't happen when clicked on the link before hand</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and I look forward to your response</p>

            Give these a try first:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)

<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />If that does not work, the next option I would try is a repair upgrade:

</p><p>Hey guys I got an error message saying that rpc server is unavailable, I'm not sure what this means and I Googled it and it talked. About remote software or access, this is quite scary and anxious for me as a former sufferer from a hack attack, I was wondering
 what this means. If it means someone has gained access to. My pc though malicious means, this happened after I exited another message saying&nbsp; That call was cancelled by message filter, both of the windows were titled rundll32.exe, I was wondering what this
 means and if it is something malicious, this only happened after file explorer didn't work so it wasn't all out of the blue, remote access to my pc is turned off, is this a sign of a hacker or just a casual windows error?&nbsp;

    <title>Time Stamp in FTP explorer mod issue. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmy510  say:</h3>
<h2>            Time Stamp in FTP explorer mod issue.</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>Windows</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>7,&nbsp;Explorer
 is showing a -6 hour difference in time from my actual</span><span><span>file</span></span><span>
 date. This is NOT simply the time difference between my </span><span><span>computer</span></span><span>
 (in Central time zone) and the server (on Eastern time). Explorer is ignoring the server's time stamp and subtracting exactly 6 hours from the time of the what the server should say. I know this because I'm also looking at the exact same folder and files using
 XP and the time stamps are exactly as they should be. I modified a file locally (on Windows 7) and copied it up to the server. The time stamp local is 9:36a. The time stamp on the server should be 10:36a, but instead it says 4:36a. So, I copied a file from
 the server back to here and it reports locally 6 hours later (10:38a) than what is on the server (4:38a). Looking at the exact same files through explorer on XP shows that the time should have been 10:38a.</span></p>
<p>If it wasn't for time showing correctly on XP, I'd assume it was a problem at the server, but there seems to be something in either the display of time, or in the way it sends the<span><span>file's</span><span>time</span></span>-stamp.<br />
<br />
And now I'm testing it on another 
<span><span>ftp</span><span>server</span></span>,
<span><span>ftp</span><span>server</span></span>,
 which I think has their time set to UTC (my 10:00a is their 4:00p). Using XP, I create a brand new file locally, and transmit it to this server. It initially appears with the same timestamp as the original file (10:16a). I then do a refresh of the server list
 (in XP) and it jumps forward 6 hours (4:16p). I look at this server with Windows 7 and it shows that the file has a timestamp of 10:16a. So I
<span><span>copy</span></span>
<span><span>copy</span></span>
 that file (using Windows 7) to its local drive and it tells me that the timestamp is 4:16p (later today).<br />
<br />
I've triple-checked my PC's time settings (set to UTC-06:00 Central Time). I've verified with the first server's techies that the PC is in Eastern time (I've not reached the other server's people yet). In both cases, however, Windows 7 is showing the time of
 the files on the ftp servers to be 6 hours earlier than their actual time-stamp.</p>
