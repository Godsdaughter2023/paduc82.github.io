<h2>            How to restore application icons to the Desktop</h2>
                    I did a "clean up" with 3rd party utility. It "cleaned up' many application desktop icons to the generic windows icon. my bad :( won't do that again....<br />
I'm using a small SSD and had previously set the system on only keep the latest restore point. My system had gone though a couple windows updates, and the only restore point I have is after the icons changed. The icons work but do not look good.<br />
Any suggestions.<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p><span>The simplest way to restore&nbsp;a Desktop icon is to create a new one. Can you name a commonly used Application icon you need to restore and I will try to give you a procedure for restoring it.</span></p>
<p><span>For your more general system complaints here are two suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span>Select Start, Control Panel. Action Center, Click on the Arrow down to the right of Maintenance and then on View reliability history. In the graph you will see red orbs, Click on one and it gives details and to the right is another link saying View
 technical details. Can you copy and paste the description in a further message. Repeating reports are more relevant than one off problems.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Here are some notes about Event Viewer Reports which may help. When you have a lot of errors you need to concentrate on system errors and warnings, even if it is applications that are giving you grief. Sorting system problems first can make resolving
 application problems easier. Note the time the computer is last booted and deal with those at the beginning of the boot first. Correcting the earlier errors can resolve later ones.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding
 the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the
 box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report at the top.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button on the General tab to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into
 the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous
 session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting
 better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</span></p>

<h2>            Game not running in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>original title: Game not running </p>
<p>I have the CD version of Rome Total War Gold Edition, with barbarian invasion. This game had worked before I installed windows 10. I have successfully installed it and have the short cut on my desktop. I click on the short cut and a pop up comes up and says
 " Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your PC?". I click yes, the pop up goes away, there is a loading icon beside the mouse for a few seconds and then nothing happens. What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS laptop and Windows 10 if that helps.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 will not boot up. I have tried almost everything&#33; Please help&#33; &#59;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, a few days ago when I tried to log into windows it froze so I restarted it. Then it was stuck on a black screen with the cursor after turning it on but I managed to boot it into safe mode and disable the driver in hope that that would fix the problem.
 However when I then restarted the computer I was stuck in Aptio Setup Utility, which is the bios set up, and I could not find any way to fix it. After searching google and emailing and calling both Microsoft and Asus the only thing I could find to do, that
 I hadn't tried and failed at, was to download windows 8.1 onto a usb. I managed to do this and when I put it into my computer it shows the Microsoft logo in blue with a turning circle thing below it but then it just goes onto a black screen with nothing on
 it where not commands that I could find actually do anything. I am trying to download a recovery drive onto a usb now, but I do not have one that is big enough, so I am borrowing my friend's however it is pretty, well broken, so after about an hour of download
 it says that there is no disk in the drive, so I have to take it out and put it back in, which restarts the download all over again. But Amazon to the rescue! I have ordered one that won't turn up for about a week and I was wondering if somebody has had this
 problem too or if anyone could please possibly help me. My laptop/notebook is an Asus X550C running Windows 8.1 and if anyone could help then I would be so greatful! Thank you anyway for reading this long thing even if you can't help but if you can then please
 contact me :D Thanks again!</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Kieran,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue that you are facing right now might be because of outdated BIOS drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>In order to assist you better with the issue could you please confirm a couple of things like:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Could you please mention what is the BIOS version that is currently loaded in the machine?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Have you connected any external devices other than mouse and keyboard?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Nevertheless, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if this helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>Perform Automatic Repair using the Installation media and check if this helps. Automatic Repair can detect and fix certain types of system problems that might prevent Windows from starting.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have media, then refer to the following Microsoft Help article to create one:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have successfully created Windows 8.1 bootable USB drive then&nbsp;using the same perform a startup repair&nbsp;and check if that helps.<br />
a) Insert the <strong>installation USB </strong>and boot Windows 8.1 from it.<br />
b) In the <strong>‘Windows setup’ </strong>page select the<strong> language to install’</strong>, ‘<strong>Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.</strong><br />
c) Click on <strong>‘Repair your computer’</strong> and select </span><span><span><strong>‘Troubleshoot’.<br />
</strong>d) Click on <strong>‘Advanced options’ and select ‘Automatic Repair’</strong> and select the operating system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Perform System Restore using the Installation Media and check if the issue persists. Follow the steps below on how to perform a System Restore:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After you boot your computer using Windows USB, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from USB". Press any key.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong> in the lower left corner.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from Choose an option screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>Advanced options</strong> in Troubleshoot screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select System Restore.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Refer to the link below for more information on how to perform system restore:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system
 restoring. During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may
 lead to loss of important files as well.</span></span></p>

<h3> ecs0008  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t log into computer with Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I cannot login into my Windows 10 computer. I'm stuck at the login screen where it asks me for my password. I never made a local account as Microsoft's software directed me to simply make an account through them. Unfortunately, I also did not have to create
 a password, but a PIN number. I do have a password for the account as I am posting this, but both the PIN and my password do not work. My computer cannot check if it is as it says there is no network connection despite there being a working wireless (I've
 used it yesterday and weeks beforehand) as well as Ethernet. Both have not worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I don't know what to do. I've tried doing a system restore but need a password to. I can't create a local account on my PC to bypass it. I can't do anything in safe mode or whatever you call it from holding shift and hitting restart as everything requires
 a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please help. This is killing me.</p>

            My dad came to visit. It took him 3 days of tinkering with the computer, backing up files, re-installing Windows 10, making himself an account, then adding an admin account, and doing various hacks to get it so I could log in again with the PIN I had set
 up. The primary issue was that my log in for my computer was my Microsoft Account log-in, but my computer would not talk to the internet, despite being connected to it. The PIN I had set up and normally use was not being asked for and wouldn't log me in. I
 would take your machine to a computer geek who could try and bypass the password and get you in so you can reset it. My dad seriously did about 100 things to get it working again, including a lot of research. Thank goodness for retired, bored, former IT guys.

            Hi,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>What is the anti-virus program installed on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In many cases, the Windows Update will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with any update and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with downloading updates,
<strong>Windows update troubleshooter </strong>can automatically identify and fix some problems with downloading and installing the updates.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Run <strong>Windows update troubleshooter </strong>
and check if it helps.<br />
1. Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search area on the taskbar.<br />
2. Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
3. Select <strong>View all </strong>on the top left corner.<br />
4. Click <strong>Windows Update</strong>.<br />
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Restart the Windows update services and check.<br />
1. Tap or press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong>, type <strong>services.msc </strong>
and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
2. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
3. Locate <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service </strong>and check the <strong>
Status</strong>.<br />
4. If the Status is <strong>stopped</strong>, right-click Background Intelligent Transfer Services, and then click
<strong>Start </strong>in the menu.<br />
5. Locate <strong>Windows Update </strong>and check the <strong>Status</strong>.<br />
6. If the Status is <strong>stopped</strong>, right-click Windows Update, and then click
<strong>Start </strong>in the menu.<br />
7. Close <strong>Services</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Now try to install the windows updates and check if it works.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps. Revert to us with the results, will be glad to assist you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h2>            Movie Maker freezes when editing</h2>
                    <p>I had an older version of windows live movie maker so I upgraded to Windows Essential 2012. Now the movie maker simply just freezes whenever I try to edit a video, even if I just open the "trim video option" the program freezes. I tried upgrading my driver,
 using the "repair windows essential" option, when that didn't work I uninstalled and reinstalled and I am still freezing. What can I do to fix this issue?</p>

            <p>Hi Sullij15,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your query. I understand that you have tried various troubleshooting steps but still experiencing the freezing issue in your Movie Maker. I would like to request log files of your Movie Maker for investigation. For the instructions, kindly
 refer to my message on the private message area. You need to sign in to Microsoft Community to see
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I would like to ask some questions for isolation:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the file types used on the project?</li><li>Does it happen to all of the videos you are trying to create/edit?</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>

    <title>Switching Japanese Windows 10 Pro to English Menus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Switching Japanese Windows 10 Pro to English Menus</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to use my Japanese keyboard on Windows 10 "properly" so I just reinstalled Windows 10 Pro, replacing my English one with a Japanese (not the single language version - I think!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that I could change the admin/menu language to English. So far I have downloaded and installed the English Language Pack and have set English to the default language in the control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to the other control panel for languages (Win_Key-X) I looked at the top selection box which I think changes the system language but did not see English as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

<li>Just to clarify, are you trying to switch the language to English but would like to keep the keyboard to Japanese?
</li><li>Can you please show us a screenshot of the Control Panel settings where you are unable to view English as an option?
</li></ul>

                    <p>We have received 3 new computers with Windows 8.1. All of us 3 have the same problem: we cannot delete exe files with message "The action can't be completed because the file is open in Windows Explorer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I download skypeinstall.exe on desktop, install the program correctly and then try to delete the file: file is in use by Windows Explorer, cannot be delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We reboot computer, we are able to delete the file. But, if I restore the file from the recycle bin on the desktop, I cannot delete it again until I reboot the PC. I used ProcessExplorer to see what is locking it and I can see 5 instances of explorer.exe
 locking the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can always reproduce the same way: </p>
<p>1-Reboot</p>
<p>2-Delete exe file</p>
<p>3-Restore file</p>
<p>4-Delete stop working and 5 explorer.exe handle are locking it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following so far after reading multiple threads: </p>
<p>- De-activating Windows Search service</p>
<p>- Activating User Experience service</p>
<p>- Deleting from command prompt (no success)</p>
<p>- In folder options: inactivate display icon on thumbnail and activate always display icons, never thumbnail</p>
<p>- Changing folder view (contents, detail, small icons...)</p>
<p>- Using Lock Hunter - not working</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these worked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We all have Windows 8.1 with Crucial SSD drive, could the problem be linked with the SSD drive incompatibility?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description you are unable to install the updates and the </span>
<strong><span>this problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>The Windows Update database is corrupted.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Antivirus software is configured to scan the %Windir%\SoftwareDistribution folder.</span></span></li><li><span><span>The Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) service does not receive a content link header.</span></span></li><li><span><span>A required system file is registered incorrectly.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span>Try the below mentioned methods and see if it works for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>First, I would suggest you to run <strong>Windows update troubleshooter </strong>
to get the problem automatically detected and fixed. This fixit checks Windows Update Component configuration and repairs, resolves incorrect Windows update data locations, and registers required services.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “<strong>Windows Logo</strong>”&nbsp;key from the keyboard or click on start icon.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if you are able to access Windows Update services and also make sure that the following services are started. If it is not started follow the below mentioned steps:&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type "<strong>services.msc</strong>" (without quotes) in start run box and&nbsp;press
<strong>Enter</strong>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate <strong>Windows Update</strong> service.</span></p>
<p><span>c. <strong>Right click </strong>on the Windows Update service and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In <strong>Start-up type</strong>, select <strong>Enable</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong>Start</strong> under <strong>Service status</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>g. <strong>Repeat the steps c</strong> to f for the following <strong>services</strong> also:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Background Intelligent Transfer Service &amp; Cryptographic Service.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If these steps do not help to resolve the issue, then you may proceed with the step mentioned below and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>If issue still persists I would suggest you to <strong>reset Windows Update components</strong> and for that t</span>ry to run the
<strong>fixit</strong> provided in the following article. If you had already tried the same fixit before I would request you to run the fixit again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>How do I reset Windows Update components?</span></strong></p>

<p>This did not fix the problem.&nbsp; I was able to run the Troubleshooting tool on Windows Update, as you said.&nbsp; The tool detected two problems and supposedly fixed them both.&nbsp; (see the report, below).&nbsp; However, I could not do any of the steps in Method 2.&nbsp; The
 service start states are: Automatic, Automatic (Delayed Start), Manual, and Disabled.&nbsp; (There is no Enable state).&nbsp; I set the service to "Automatic Delayed Start".&nbsp; Let me know if that is NOT what you intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run the fixit tool as well.&nbsp; The error still persists, and subsequent runs of the troubleshooting tool finds the same errors, over and over again. Here is the report from Windows Update:</p>

    <title>Tablet and disk space issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardostreet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tablet and disk space issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am wondering if someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Chuwi Vi8 Dual boot tablet (Windows 8.1 and Android). It come with a 32GB data capacity, windows is pre installed on a 13.9GB partition on the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reserved windows 10 excitedly. However I found that I was running into some roadblocks straight out of the gates. I found that I could not upgrade as unfortunately the drive is too small. Every time I tried, after uninstalling everything, making as much
 room as possible... I could not get anywhere. The disappointment was excruciating. It was like someone had come along and cancelled Christmas. Defeated but not without hope I continued my quest to install Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I found out about the media creation tool. All my prayers had been answered, Christmas was back on. So I downloaded the tool and got my USB all up and running. I thought, ill just try to do the upgrade. But nooooo that would have been far too simple.
 Disappointment prevailed again, still not enough space for me to install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what I can do to get round this issue? I don't really want to have to go and start changing partitions etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information would be greatly appreciated!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard</p>

            I have almost the same problem, I have the VI8 but the older one without Android, when I install it does everything then when it restarts and reaches 17% it gives me the error Install_Drives and then restores my windows 8.1. Does anyone know what this
 means? I would also love to have 10 on my Chuwi Tablet

    <title>Unable to play back videos I have recorded on my camera app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to play back videos I have recorded on my camera app</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recorded some video files today with the camera app that came with my Windows Surface, and now I am unable to play them back. The file format is .mp4 as it records as standard with the camera app. When I attempt to play I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Can't Play</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try something else. This item's file format may be unsupported, the file extension may be incorrect, or the file may be corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xc00d36c4"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I'm missing the obvious here since I'm not great with technology, however it seems counter intuitive that the video file I recorded with a windows app isn't supported by another windows app? That leads me to believe that the only answer is
 that the file itself is corrupted, if this is the case is there any way of recovering the file as I don't want to lose the file I captured? Here are the steps I have taken to try to resolve:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to run the video in all windows supported media apps as well as VLC player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that all of my drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the PCs in built troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted the PC and attempted a clean boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following these steps I'm not sure what further to attempt so any ideas are appreciated. I have also tested recording some more video from the app but the issue still persists. If it helps, on my camera roll there is no thumbnail image for the newly recorded
 videos. I will keep attempting to resolve this on my own steam but it's getting pretty frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Navigating in Windows 10 using a keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> f&#233;lix langlois  say:</h3>
<h2>            Navigating in Windows 10 using a keyboard</h2>
                    <p>There seems to be a problem with Windows 10 that wasn't there in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following shortcut file on my Microsoft Surface machine:</p>
<p>Open Walkway and Driveway.lnk</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's stored in the following folder:</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Dossiers</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8.1, I pressed the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Search</span> key (the key with a magnifying glass logo on it). Then I simply typed
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Walkway</span>. It would find and select the shortcut mentioned above. I then pressed the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Enter</span> key. Then, it would open my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Walkway and Driveway</span> folder in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">File Explorer</span>. This doesn't work anymore with Windows 10. Instead, the new operating system suggests to search the Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone fix this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Thank you Mr. Kishore for your reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I should point out that I carefully followed the steps that you suggested. In the end, I got the
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the following discussion, every shortcut mentioned comes from the following folder:<br />
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Dossiers<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the same discussion, the Search tool is the one accessed by pressing the Search key, which has the magnifying glass logo on it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a shortcut's target type is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows Batch File</span>, then the search tool finds the shortcut. For example, the name of one shortcut is
Open Bills -- Bell</span> shortcut and selects it. Please note that it doesn't suggest to search the web even though I left my
<strong>On</strong>. I then press the Enter key. Then, File Explorer opens where the current folder displays a list of Bell invoices. Everything works fine with this shortcut. Below is a screen capture just before I press the Enter key.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be9fc468-40ee-4f3d-ac8a-2233c3fcb239" /><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if a shortcut's target type is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
File Folder</span>, then the search tool doesn't find the shortcut. For example, the name of such a shortcut is
Search the web</span>. The screen shot below is the result of this procedure.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a69ea662-1eaf-47ff-8e2c-f85ce3b65c44" /><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This bug didn't exist in Windows 8.1. I don't think that the Search tool should discriminate against certain types of shortcuts. Using the Search tool, I should be able to easily access and execute anything I like on my PC.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Yup! With the use of realms servers, you can play across almost every platform! Im fairly sure you can also just join your friends games so long as you have their information or they have yours.

<h2>            Unable to access Windows 7 Starter from Windows 7 Professional on HomeGroup.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Professional on my PC and Windows 7 Starter on my Netbook. My system includes a router and I am able to access my Internet connection on my Netbook via the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up a Homegroup on my PC which I can detect and use on my Netbook - I can "see" all my PC files on my Netbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I cannot "see" my Netbook on my PC. Following the instructions which take me to the Control Panel for my Netbook to "join" the network I find the "JOIN" button greyed out and a message to the effect that there is nobody in the Homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help will be appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Walter, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for sharing this information with us.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try disabling the antivirus software on both, the PC and the netbook temporarily.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most
 cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable or uninstall it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus
 software is disabled or uninstalled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, I would suggest you to refer to the information and details mentioned in the following articles and hope that this will do the trick.

            <p>PC Refresh is in it's infancy, and is behaving much like the early versions of System Restore in Windows ME and XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite honestly, after I did a refresh, there were enough issues such that it was worth doing a complete re-install from scratch. You might want to consider doing the same..

    <title>Problems with Logitech C910 webcam in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bus_prof_199  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Logitech C910 webcam in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a new PC that cam loaded with Windows 10. When I tried to install the webcam (Logitech HD C910) that I had been using with my old Windows 7 computer without any problems the audio won't work at all. Windows recognizes a driver for it, but
 when it installs it says "Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910 Driver error" in the device settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open device manager it shows the webcam under imaging devices and under "Universal Serial Bus controllers" as having valid drivers, but under "Sound, Video and game controllers" there is a yellow triangle with an exclamation point in it next to the
 "HD Pro Webcam C910" driver. As a result the video works fine with the webcam, but the microphone will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating the driver, but there doesn't seem to be a generic driver that works with this and the only available driver shows the error message. When I do the reinstall it shows a (code 19) error, which indicates that there is a registry error.
 I tried a clean boot and installing the software again, but it gave the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Logitech, but they said that it was a Microsoft problem. I contacted Microsoft, but they said that it was a Logitech problem. The last thing that they told me to do was to get a new "compatible" webcam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody else have this problem or a solution to it?</p>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I had the same issue my C910 was not working with Windows 10 originally, and with the new PC.&nbsp; My problem was that the camera would load the initial starting and when I would click on the WEB CAM for pictures or videos it froze up completely and responded
 as (Not Working).....so, understanding that todays newer PC's and laptops are coming with USB ports rated at 3.0....I did a simple change and installed the USB in a standard 20. Port and it works perfectly with Windows 10 now....so, if you are having this
 problem that I did, check your PC, the standard 2.0Ports are still black, and those PC's that come with both, the 3.0 Speed port will be blue.&nbsp; This is what I am finding out so far, so, hope this helps others.&nbsp; The C910 is still my best camera with exception
 that it does not support the older Video effects which were quite fun actually.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. I would like to verify if you suspect that Windows Live Mail has been malwared because your contacts and email messages has been duplicated. Let me assist you with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you suspect that your Windows Live Mail has been malwared, what you need to do is to scan for virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that you have configured your account in Windows Live Mail twice, that's why you are getting duplicate emails and contacts. You need to remove all your account in Windows Live Mail and
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
re-add them again</a>. Note: <span>
<font color="#000000">Before removing an account, check that the messages you want saved are available when you sign in to the web version.
<span>If some of your messages are available only in Live Mail, export your messages before removing the account. See

<p>I am the administrator for my younger son (15 yrs old)'s laptop.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>I have set his account as Standard user, and implement Parental Control with "Time Limit" to block 1 am- 7 am.&nbsp; Somehow, my younger son could change the clock back a few hours (with&nbsp;the
 date advanced to next day) to get around the time limit setting so that&nbsp;he could use the computer up to 3 am or 4 am at night.&nbsp; Please advise what's wrong and how to fix this.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>I have tried to change the administrator password but he could just change the date/time as before.&nbsp; He did not do it in Parental Control.&nbsp; I could only see that he has adjusted the clock shown&nbsp;at the bottom on the right hand side of the tool bar.&nbsp; The date
 would be changed to the next day also.&nbsp; However, he should not be able to adjust the date/time or the timezone as a Standard User and not knowing the admin password.</p>

<p>Way back, I was a Novell Master CNE, so I do understand a bit of system administration but too bad that I was not familiar with Window admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see where in Windows that the user could adjust the time/date.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Computer slows down in windows 10 when closing lid using external monitor</h2>
                    I just upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10. I use an external monitor and close the lid on my laptop. This used to work ok in windows 8 but now in windows 10 as soon as I closed the lid everything slows down. The mouse barely reacts to movement. I
 have a wireless mouse and key board that is connected to the computer but everything else is goes through a hub (monitor, backup drive) I have updated all the drivers and check power settings. HELP
