    <title>Installing Windows 10 from scratch. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing Windows 10 from scratch.</h2>
                    <p>OK. So I do have a qualifying copy of Windows in order to get a free upgrade to 10.</p>
<p>Let's say I will upgrade, but then after 12 months I decide to reinstall Windows from scratch. What then?</p>
<p>It is normal, that from time to time you would need to have a fresh installation on your computer. Everybody does it.</p>
<p>Will it be possible to download an ISO file of Windows 10, to have it handy just in case reinstallation of the system becomes necessary?
</p>
<p>I understand I have to be in possession of a valid licence of previous version of Windows, but I prefer to have a system freshly installed.</p>
<p>What can you offer for an user like me</p>

<p>There was a suggested process to rectify the missing start button in Win 10 that called for&nbsp; following the procedures outlined in the January 22 message from Sharath Srinivasa.&nbsp; Following from the&nbsp; pages of replies to this procedure I was not particularly
 impressed.&nbsp; If Srinivasa's process was so useful, why has Microsoft not been able to use it to correct Win 10 flaws. It has&nbsp; been 11 months since the posting. Surly by now MS has found a working solution&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not all users of computers have the training, skills, and most importantly, the confidence to tackle a repair to faulty software. It is the responsibility of MS to&nbsp; provide a working&nbsp; Win 10.</p>

            <p>Hello Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. Let me assist you to resolve the issue for once and for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
I suggest you to perform a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Reset</span> of the operating system and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
<p>
</p><p>Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls Windows. To get started, go to
<span>Settings</span> &gt; <span>Update &amp; security</span> &gt; <span>Reset this PC</span> &gt;<span>Get started</span> and choose an option.

<p>Hi, personally I had this problem for weeks untill i 100% figured out how to fix it. I know you said what you did or tried, but I will say what I have done.</p>
<p>First i <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">requested public IP</span> at my ISP provider (I am not sure if it's 100% needed but without public IP I had strict or closed NAT always) it was ready next day and free. Next I forwarded ports :</p>
<p>These are prots need for xbox live service as said in&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">there</a></p>
<ul>
<li>88 UDP </li><li>3074 TCP/UDP </li><li>53 TCP/UDP </li><li>80 TCP </li></ul>
<p>These are&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">NOT</span>&nbsp;mentioned in link above, but I have them open too I had problem with few games that used these and I see no harm in opening them.</p>
<ul>
<li>500 UDP </li><li>3544 UDP </li><li>3574 UDP </li><li>4500 UDP </li></ul>
<p>After that I checked my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UpNP</span> settings on router, it should be checked on (or enabled) [Internal/External port 3074 UDP for IP adress of your Xbox (192.168.0.<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">100</span>]</p>
<p>Next I checked <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>DMZ</span></span> status and it should be enabled for host address (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">192.168.0.10<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">0</span></span>).
 [This will be IP of your Xbox One. You can pick any IP address you want from 100-999 but you must fill everywhere the same one)</p>
<p>Now &nbsp;this <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">MAY BE optional</span> but my router does NOT support port forward for more IP adresses. So i had manually set IP address on my XBOX ONE. In network settings go to advanced settings:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>IP SETTINGS</em></span></p>
<ul>

<p>For Xbox One please use this article, to open ports: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live</p>
<p>bloodlight796, can You please check what IP address Your router or modem got from Your internet provider? Post it here, only first two octets, it would be something like this: 172.16.xxx.xxx - it's example.</p>

<p>I know what these mechanisms are and how they work so I know my settings may look stupid and useless, actually UPnP is useless I just want to have it enabled. Rest is must or its not working. I disagree with what you said about misconfiguration of router
 that is almost impossible.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Microsoft do not recommends to use such setup, as You recommend to topic starter.

<p>I think you are here to help others not argue with me. So far as I see you did nothing just told him to open ports I have written. I use UPnP because it was default set on enable in my router and it's not doing any conflict so I do not see any reason to
 turning it off. If i force open ports by any way possible how can this affect my router configuration ? Anyway UpNP is ignored by router as there is DMZ active and also those port forwards. As I said if I only forward ports and let DMZ off it is NOT WORKING.
 If I use only DMZ but no forward ports IT IS NOT WORKING EITHER. I know it is weird but IT IS IT. Anyway what I do with my router and MY console is nothing of your bussiness. I am starting to take this personal. I had this problem for 2 months and NO ONE helped
 me, yes they tried but with robotic support like you DO. Do this do that what we have a topics about and that's all we can do for you. I am talking about real support not like-to-be-usefull like you.

<p>If you want to Open your NAT try this, it worked for me. </p>
<p>I would reset your router back to factory settings. </p>
<p>Go to test your multiplayer connection. When it is done, do not hit A. Hold all bumpers in and triggers at the same time. This will bring up your detailed NAT, it will take a sec to load. You will see the status of your NAT. It will say either a port behind
 or a cone is missing (something like that)</p>
<p>Now hit B and test your multiplayer connection again. Hit A and then check your NAT type. You may have to do this a couple time to get the NAT open.

<p>When you click 'Test Multiplayer Connection' wait for the result to show, then hold down both LT, RT, LB &amp; RB to go to detailed statistics when it all loads tap A to continue and that should the change your NAT type from Moderate or Strict to Open</p>
<p>I recommend doing this because whenever my NAT type is Moderate i do this method and it changes it to Open 100% of the time, i hope this has helped you solve your issue and i look forward to hearing from you :).</p>

<h3> whg&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            NEED Hal.dll for Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to upgrade my SSD 256GB to an SSD 500GB. &nbsp;The drive is a Samsung and I have done the data migration program and everything seems to have copied over with respects to the C: and D: partitions as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I place the new 500 GB SSD into my laptop, I get a blue screen that say missing or corrupt hal.dll file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replace the old SSD and try to create a recovery drive using a USB 16GB stick. &nbsp;Windows informs me that something went wrong and couldn't create the recovery drive. (There are files on the recovery drive and it has been renamed RECOVERY)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this came prebuilt with the OS already installed, I do not have any media to use. &nbsp;HOWEVER, I bought 2 discs of Windows 8 Pro years back and tried to use this as a recovery option. &nbsp;I was able to boot into CDROM to get to repair. &nbsp;When I try to repair
 it brings me back to the Blue Screen to start all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I am trying to do is give myself enough disk space to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't working for me at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!</p>

            You do not need to run an in-place Upgrade to WIndows 10 and should not because this is an inferior install that most enthusiasts won't run in the first place.

Follow these steps to do the gold standard Clean Install which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587 

The media is included along with illustrated steps how to boot it properly as a UEFI device if offered, delete all partitions to  get it cleanest, set it up optimized to perfection.  

I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            When you say "you did the data migration program', what did you do?

If I were you I would clone the 256GB SSD onto the 500GB SSD using a third party app like the free AOMEI Partition Wizard or Macrium Reflect

            Could you describe how you actually performed the migration: program used, restoration steps?

I recommend you reinstall the old 256 GB SSD then follow the steps to create a system image saved to an external drive then install the new 500 GB SSD then restore it using the following instructions:

How to: Create a system image in Windows 10
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869

If that does not work, you can look into third party options such as Macrium Reflect or Easeus:

<h3> 7upanais  say:</h3>
<h2>            25-Character Product Key Invalid</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have trouble with re-installing os system for my&nbsp;dell laptop. It's asking to enter 25-character product key located on the side or bottom of my computer.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have 25-character product key on the bootm of my laptop, but when I entered the product key, it's saying "The Product ID which you entered is invalid. Please try again." What exactly is the problem? Is there other product key which I suppose to enter?
</p>
<p>And&nbsp;for some reason,&nbsp;I have window vista sticker on, but os system is xp. Could anyone help me with reinstalling the os system? My laptop is keep re-booting when I turn on the computer. So, I was re-installing it on the safe mode.</p>
<p>Thank you for the help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edited.</p>
<p>I've noticed that I have 2 OS disc (one is XP and the other is Window Vista). What I used to have is XP, and when I inswer XP disc,&nbsp;I have to enter&nbsp;25 product key which doesn't match. And when I inswer &nbsp;Vista disc, it says "This computer does not have enough
 space for temporary files window installation need at least 460MB of space on any partition for temporary files. To install window, free enough space and restart the installation." I don't have a lot of stuff on my computer, so the space shouldn't be a problem.
 I don't know why it's keep saying there is not enough space. I'm on safe mode by the way as my computer is keep rebooting.

            <p>Thank you for the tip. But I'm almost certain the product key that I have is correct. The label is so clear that it's hard to misread the characters. Is there any other way to fix the problem of computer keep rebooting?

    <title>Reinstalled XP - can&#39;t connect to internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moth7000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalled XP - can&#39;t connect to internet</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; I have an Asus Eee PC 900 which I have restored to factory settings, using the XP disc that came with it.&nbsp; However, I cannot connect to the internet.&nbsp; Incidentally I am having the exact same issue with my Eee PC 701 with Windows XP as well, after
 restoring that to factory settings too (have installed Linux and it connects fine) so I think it is an XP thing.<br />
<br />
The pc shows available networks, I have tried all the things I know, have set up the network and typed in my network key.&nbsp; When I try to connect, nothing happens.&nbsp; If I try to repair, I get the message Windows could not finish repairing the problem because
 the following action cannot be completed: Connecting to the wireless network.<br />
<br />
I have tried:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
1) Reinstalling the driver (it says it's Ok and is the latest one listed).<br />
2) Setting the date and time correctly on the computer.<br />
3) Checking that 'Enable IEEE ....' is ticked, in Authentication<br />
4) Turning off 'Use Windows to configure my wireless settings' (but if I do this, no available wireless networks show up)<br />
<br />
I am wondering if Service Pack 2 is just too old to connect to the internet!&nbsp; Is there anything I can download on my other computer onto usb and install onto either of the Eee Pc's?&nbsp; Like Service Pack 3 or something?<br />
<br />
My network is WPA2 Personal<br />
<br />

            The box to "Enable IEEE 802.1x authentication for the network" should <u><b>NOT</b></u> be checked.<br />
<br />
You should have installed Service Pack 3 as part of your restoration efforts.&nbsp; Unpatched, Windows XP Service Pack 2 is not able to connect to wireless networks that use WPA2 encryption (which is what you are -- and should be -- using).&nbsp; Older hardware also
 may be unable to connect using WPA2, but that doesn't seem to be your issue because you connected before the restore and can connect now using Linux.<br />
<br />
There is a Catch-22:&nbsp; Windows Update will not install any updates for XP (including Service Pack 3) unless you have Service Pack 3 installed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Connect your computer to your router with an Ethernet cable and do the following:<br />

<p>If you can't connect your computer to the router with an Ethernet cable for any reason, use another computer (e.g., the one you're using to post questions here) to download the patch from the HP site and SP3 installer from the Microsoft site and copy them
 to a USB flash drive or burn them to a CD.&nbsp; Then copy the files to the desktop your your computer and run them as if you had downloaded them.<br />

<h3> four-channel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your Nat still Strict&#47;Moderate&#63; Check here.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Okay, &nbsp;there has been numerous posts about opening your Nat. Most of those posts refer to the UPNP issue where you have to have your UPNP Plug and Play connection on through your router. Though there is another hidden settings
 in a lot of routers that even with that on will still cause you some Nat issues. Well to get to the point of things, there is the Nat, which is a connection through your Gateway allowing multiple devices to connect to the internet with Open Port use. One of
 these devices is your Xbox 360, your computer, even a network compatible Blu-ray player. Though you get online with these devices and they cause some lag, or they're not getting full connection, like displayed on your console it says, "Your Nat is Strict"
 even Moderate. After reading a lot of the posts and looking through them I have noticed that there is a basic problem with peoples Nat settings, a lot of times you can turn this on in your router settings yourself (or like my ISP had them hidden).</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Full Cone Nat (&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_cone_NAT#Full-cone_NAT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_cone_NAT#Full-cone_NAT</a>&nbsp;)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This setting is a built in controller used by a lot of Internet Service Providers and this will cause restrictions to your Nat settings if these are turned off. What is going to happen is that some of your ports will be turned
 off automatically by this service only allowing a certain amount of services to be sent through your ISP's Gateway. When you want to fix this issue you'll have to change the settings in your Router or contact your ISP to change them for you. In truth I recommend
 contacting your ISP about this issue first off. Now how would you know if your Nat is Full Cone or not? Usually these can be found in your Routers information page, under my router (Yours maybe different) is Gateway Overview and in that page is the Wide Area
 Network overview, when you click the View/Properties of the your Gateway it will come up with a page and on that page it will show usually if your Nat is Full Cone, it should say if this is disabled or enabled. If you can't find it, UPNP is on and you are
 still having issues connecting to games or with friends this will show that your Full Cone Nat is disabled and you either have a closed Nat Cone or a Restricted Cone Nat, there are also Port Restricted Nat and a Symmetric Restricted Nat, which all these can
 cause issues to your Xbox Live Connection.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Although I will say changing your NAT type is something you don't normally see as an option on your router, its usually set it firmware and can't be changed via any front end menu</p>

<p>Thanks for tagging that, I got a new router and it had Upnp and it still had Nat issues, so even if your router is Upnp compliant you can still have Nat issues if your Full Cone Nat isn't open.

<p>Very true, many routers support UPnP but not all to the same degree, I believe one of the tests for a router to be "Xbox Live Certified"

<p>I decided best bet was to go back to my old configuration with my netgear prior to service upgrade and set my Ubee up as bridged and just using it as a modem and not using it as a router as well.</p>

<div>This is supposed to happen every 100 closings of OE (see <a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#2</a>), but other programs access the OE message store and mimic OE opening and closing and that's why you are getting that message.&nbsp; Several programs can do this.&nbsp; If you have Windows Search installed, then go to Control Panel |
 Indexing options (I think that's where it is) and exclude OE from being indexed and see if that fixes it. If that's not it, then its likely some other program, so go to Start | Run and type msconfig and then disable the startup items and reboot and see if
 that fixes it.&nbsp; If so, then you can selectively enable the startup items you need to see which one of those is the culprit.&nbsp;</div>

<p><span>You can control the Compacting process by doing it at a time that suits you at any time before the count reaches 100.</span></p>
<p><span>In Outlook Express place the cursor on Local Folders and select File, Work Offline followed by File, Folder, Compact All. Do not attempt to interrupt
 or stop the process until it has completed. Close Outlook Express when it has completed but do not rush closure as changes will still be being made for a period after the compaction process appears to have completed.</span></p>
<p><span>After compacting, check your Outlook Express folders are as they should be. Then select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk CleanUp
 to Empty your Recycle Bin and Remove Temporary Internet Files. Run Disk Defragmenter.</span></p>

<p>General OE Caveats:</p>
<p>- Don't use Inbox or Sent Items to archive messages.&nbsp; Move them to local folders created for this purpose.</p>
<p>- Empty Deleted Items folder daily.</p>
<p>- Frequently perform a manual compact of all OE folders while "working offline".&nbsp; More at<a href="http://www.insideoe.com/files/maintain.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.insideoe.com/files/maintain.htm</a></p>
<p>- Do not cancel Automatic Compacting, should it occur, and do not attempt to close OE via Task Manager or shutdown your machine if Automatic Compacting is taking place.</p>
<p>- Disable email scanning by your anti-virus application.&nbsp; It can cause corruption (i.e., loss of messages) and provides no additional protection:</p>

<h2>            How do I get ahold of Microsoft directly.</h2>
                    <p>They used to have a contact number to talk to them directly, as I have been trying to figure out a way to get ahold of them, because I had an issue with buying the game pass deal for a year going for $99.99 that includes the following games&nbsp;<span>Forza
 Motorsport 7 and Forza Horizon 3, I when I went to purchase it I had over a $150 in my bank account, I received an error message stating that something went wrong on Microsoft Soft end and not mine which this has happened to me b4, I did it after midnight
 on the 30 of September which technically it turns to October 1 it was still available to get at the time so I reset my system to see if it was on my end and it wasn't so I tried it again and still had the same results after awhile I waited just incase Xbox
 Live was having issues and when I went back it was over and I didn't even know it was going to end at 3am on the 1st of October.</span></p>
<p><span>So i'm a little upset about it because I really wanted to get it to extend my subscription but I couldn't because of some technical issue that accured.</span></p>

            I tried both suggestions and the second one fixed my keyboard problem. I tried the same with the touchpad mouse, but it didn't work for it. When I did the system check, it said everything was working and that my driver was up to date. This did not fix
 the problem, so I uninstalled the driver. This also didn't work. Any other suggestions please. The mouse pad was working until I installed Windows 10.

<h3> mjs_20  say:</h3>
<h2>            audio device on high definition audio bus installs every time i log in or retstart the computer</h2>
                    everytime i log into my account or just start up the computer, the high definition audio bus driver installs.<br />
<br />
i have no audio issues, and no error messages in my device manager. Everything seems to run perfectly fine with the computer, other than that every time i log in, it installs this driver. My sound works even before the driver is installed.<br />
<br />
What I want to do is keep this message from popping up every single time. <br />
<br />
I am running windows 7 on bootcamp (latest version ]) with macbook pro&nbsp; .&nbsp; Again, everything works perfect in the computer, its brand new.<br />
<br />
Why is this happenening? <br />
How do i fix it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<span>Hi mjs_20,</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Thank you for the reply.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>If you perform the above steps, it will automatically stop the system from install of updates. But if you want you can still select the updates and install it manually.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You can also go the computer hardware manufacturer website and download and install the drivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be glad to help.
</span></p>

            Where are you seeing the backup folder?&nbsp; Windows 7 does not have a "restore option with retaining user files", but maybe you used some other backup program that does which I am not familiar with.

            <p>Windows 7 itself doesn't any ability like that, so&nbsp;that recovery partition came from your system manufacturer (whatever company built the laptop).&nbsp; It's common for them to include these abilities.&nbsp; But since it's not part of Windows, I'm not very familiar

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />

<br />
Other methods :<br />
<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to&nbsp;user (to lowest level) APPLY/OK&nbsp; then go back<br />
and reset&nbsp;it to Admin APPLY/OK - this helps clear corruption. Do this a few times. Do the same for other<br />
accounts that might have problems. Then if needed you can also reset your passwords&nbsp;in the accounts.<br />
Remember to leave your account as Admin and the others at the level you wish.<br />
<br />
Make another&nbsp;Admin Account&nbsp;with your password&nbsp;and use it to fix the others when needed. (just to<br />
repair with, not to use as regular account, a safety valve) Always keep a spare ADMIN&nbsp;account.<br />
<br />
DO NOT LEAVE THE HAA ENABLED OR USE IT DAILY. If it corrupts you are toast!<br />

<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />

<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember to always<br />
leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

<h2>            Boot Device not found after opening my laptop- Help needed for making a bootable USB</h2>
                    <p>I bought my laptop about a week ago and yesterday I opened it and it said that the boot device wasn't found. I had barely anything saved it on it so I wasn't that bothered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the procedures that were recommended by HP and nothing worked. I did the hard drive check (both extensive and quick) and it showed no errors. The laptop that I bought, HP Pavillon Gaming laptop model 15-cx0001na did not come with a recovery
 disk. Windows isn't loading, I just get a message saying&nbsp;<span>"boot device not found/ please install operating system on your hard disk (3F0)."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only solution that I thought of was to create a bootable USB and so I reinstalled Windows 10 on the USB but since the only other computer I had was a iMac, I had to use the Boot Camp Assistant application and created
 it on there to use. After it was on the USB, I put into the laptop and booted it up.&nbsp;</span><span>For a while, it kept looping on the HP screen but after closing it and opening it again, it went to the setup menu but I was
 stuck on the drivers part. Also, the USB was formatted beforehand as FAT32.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>TL;DR: need operating system for laptop, created bootable USB on Mac and now stuck on the steps</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So my question is: Is the bootable USB that I made on the Boot Camp Assistant application only usable for my iMac and if so, how do I make a bootable USB on a Mac?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance. Also sorry if the topic's wrong, I'm not sure really sure what to put it under.</span></p>

<h2>            Why is my D drive included in system image&#63;</h2>
                    I want to create a system image of my C drive for backup purposes, but when I use the built-in backup tool, my D drive is also selected and I can't uncheck it. My D drive is filled with videos and stuff and I really do not need that backed up.<br />
<br />
This should explain:<br />
<a href="http://stuff.digicrap.com/backup.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://stuff.digicrap.com/backup.png</a><br />
<br />
Is there a way to check why this is marked as required for the system? Is there a way to make it so that I don't have to backup that drive?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Edit: this might have something to do with it: <a href="http://stuff.digicrap.com/backup2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
No, no, look at the picture: you'll see that the destination is actually G (an external drive with 2tb storage). The problem is that it wants to make an system image of both C *and* D, while that will take 5 times as much diskspace than just making an image
 of C. Especially since there's no relevant data on D that needs backing up.<br />
<br />
Edit: I changed the title to make it less confusing.<br />

As you can see in my second screenshot in my first post, the D drive is marked as a system drive. That's probably because it used to be my system drive (with windows Vista). My C drive is an SSD with windows 7 but it seems that D still retained it's "system"
 tag.<br />
<br />
Hence, I'm looking for an option to mark the C drive as a system drive, that *might* solve the problem.<br />

I tried doing this with the win7 recovery console, using bootrec /fixboot, but no change, the D drive is still marked as the system drive :(<br />

No on all accounts, unfortunately. No Pagefile, nothing installed, and my documents are safely on C.<br />

            <p>That it used to be a system drive is enough. What you need to do is move all data from D to G. Just copy it across for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then install the hard drive manufacturer tools for the D drive make and typre and 'write zeros' to completely clear it of anything which might identify it as a system drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Repartition and format the drive, then move all of your data back to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when you run a backup, you should be able to deselect D. In fact, it will be unchecked by default..

            Actually, not the same was answered there at all, sorry Zigzag :)<br />
<br />
What they actually answered was that due to it being an SSD, Windows installed the boot partition on D (the first mechanical drive) instead of C. They offered me a tool, EasyBCD, to copy the boot partition over to C. Then I set in my bios to boot from the C
 drive, and *that* fixed it.<br />

<h2>            Facebook using Windows 10 on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 3 with a detachable keyboard. Since moving to Windows 10, my keyboard no longer works on Facebook.&nbsp; Does anyone else have this problem?&nbsp; The keyboard works fine for other websites, just not Facebook.&nbsp; Any ideas to resolve this?

            <p>I assume you are&nbsp;referring to&nbsp;the Facebook app and not the web access of Facebook.&nbsp; Does it work with the on screen keyboard with the touch cover detached?&nbsp; Have you added Cortana to your Facebook friends?&nbsp; What I would do is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot if you have not done so and see if it works.&nbsp; If not, with Facebook open remove the touch cover and reattach it and see if it works.&nbsp; If not uninstall and reinstall Facebook from windows store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of that&nbsp;works then hope someone else responds.&nbsp;</p>
