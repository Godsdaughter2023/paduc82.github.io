<h2>            Why won&#39;t Windows&#47;Internet Explorer let me open a file I download&#63;</h2>
                    I have a computer that runs Vista Home Basic and whenever I want to open an attachment from my email (Hotmail), it will only let me save first, then open from the "Downloads" folder.&nbsp; On another Vista-based machine (Business), there is an option to "Open"
 the file.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to allow files to just open?

<p><span><span>Hello thetaylor310,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Are you using Windows Mail as your email client to receive mail from Hotmail or are you accessing Hotmail via the website?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am not sure that I understand your issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you receive an email via the Hotmail website or in Windows Mail that has an attachment, one of your computers running Vista Home Basic is unable to open the attachment directly from
 the email message.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must first save the attachment to your “Downloads” folder before you can open it.
<span>&nbsp;</span>What happens when you click on the attachment link in the email message?
<span>&nbsp;</span>Do you receive any error messages?<span>&nbsp; </span>
You also have a system running Vista Business and on this machine when you receive an email with an attachment via the Hotmail website or in Windows Mail you ARE able to simply click on the attachment link and open it directly from the email message.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is this correct?<span>&nbsp; </span>Does the type on file attachment make any difference?<span>&nbsp;
</span>In other words if the attachment is a Word document or a JPEG does it make any difference on the machine with Vista Home Basic?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Are you using a third party antivirus/internet security software package that monitors and scans email attachments?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are using Windows Mail as an email client to receive email from Hotmail, when a message arrives with an attachment, clicking
 on the attachment link should give you the option to “Open” the email provided that you have Windows Mail configured to “Download messages when viewing in the preview pane”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you do not have Windows Mail configured this way then the attachment would have to first be downloaded before it could be opened.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can check your configuration in Window Mail by clicking on Tools and then selecting Options.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click on the Read tab and make sure there is a checkmark in the box next to “Automatically download messages when viewing in the Preview Pane”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are viewing a message with an attachment in the Hotmail website clicking on the attachment link should give you the options
 to either Open or Save the attachment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Clicking Open will allow you to view that attachment but it is not saved on your HDD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are using a program other then Windows Mail to view your Hotmail then we will need that information to help you troubleshoot
 this issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the suggestions I gave you do not resolve your problem please include the answers to all of my questions in your response.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also, include any error messages you receive VERBATIM from the screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Jack<span>&nbsp;

    <title>Passwords with symbols not accepted&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 2983451  say:</h3>
<h2>            Passwords with symbols not accepted&#63;</h2>
                    Following the recent microsoft password scare (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/07/hotmail_phish_password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/07/hotmail_phish_password/</a>) I changed my password to include a symbol (a question mark) to
 increase it's strength. <br />
<br />
This worked fine on the web with all services. When I try to update the password&nbsp;on my phone (running Windows Mobile 6.1 professional), however, it will not accept the symbol and 'greys out' the "Sign in" option.<br />
<br />
Please could this be fixed so that stronger passwords which include symbols can be used?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />

            Hi,<br />
please confirm the you are inserting a different password from the old one in the switch live id screen. The sign in option only will be available when you insert a different login or password.<br />

            Yes I can confirm I was updating the My Phone software with the new password which included the symbol on the switch live ID screen.<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />
BTW this is not a problem for me at the moment as I just dropped the symbol. Just wondered if it was a known issue or just me.. !

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I retried your use case and I didn't found any issue regarding the insertion of symbols in the password.<br />
My Phone will "grey out" the sign in option in the following cases:<br />
- Email address invalid (user and domain are not valid or didn't have the necessary size);<br />
- All the credentials inserted are equal to the ones that My Phone already has.</p>
<p>Are you changing your password with all the others fields correctly filled?<br />
<br />
Thank you for using My Phone :),<br />

            Do you have any 3rd party Virus/Malware programs installed? what version of Windows is installed on your system now? Anything plugged into USB/Media slots except for KB/Mouse? &nbsp;Reading your other postings I see where you have Norton installed if that is
 installed it must be removed as beta builds might have issues with virus programs as it has been posted many times on this forum, 3rd party programs might not be updated by the makers of such programs during the Beta testing of a new operation system. &nbsp;Also
 the Beta testing program doesn't have any direct support from Microsoft.

<p>&nbsp;Is the HP Stream the PC you are working on? If it isn't, go to manage my account in settings, all of your PCs will be listed. If you don't have a HP Stream, delete it from the list.</p>

<h2>            Excel File Vanished or Disappeared</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Today I was working on an excel sheet in Office 365 on Windows 10. I hit Ctrl Save as I regularly do. However this time the program stopped.</p>
<p>When I re-opened the program I and tried to open my recent file it told me that it was either deleted or moved. I went to the original file location. It was gone. I checked the recycle bin. It was not there. I did a search for the file by name. It does not
 come up. I searched all .xls files. It doesn't show up anywhere. I don't have onecloud set up. My backup which is automated by windows onto an external drive I now discover has not been backing up...</p>
<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to retrieve this file. It must be somewhere?</p>
<p>Thanks very much</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t send email to bluehost mail server</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When sending an e-mail from outlook.com to an account on my personal domain name whose SMTP server is hosted by BlueHost, the email never reaches&nbsp;the account.</p>
<p>I don't receive any failure email from outlook.com</p>
<p>I can receive e-mail from bluehost</p>
<p>I can reply to an email from bluehost, the reply is then received, so replies do make it, new emails to the same address don't.</p>
<p>the email is not in the spam folder or anywhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose the domain name is blacklisted.</p>
<p>How can I resolve this issue ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

 change an account to a Child Account.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the above but no luck.&nbsp; My children do not have email accounts, so have local accounts.&nbsp; This works on our other devices and was broken many a few months ago (I don't remember exactly).&nbsp; There was a note that this would be fixed but obviously not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feature is an incredible feature, really helps us out.&nbsp; When will this get fixed?&nbsp; I'm on build 10074.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            <p>I'm having the same problem on the same build.</p>
<p>I have tried adding a new account, selecting "add a child account without email". When I go back into settings to check the new local account, it's a standard user and the only other option is Administrator. There is no option to change the account back
 to Child.</p>
<p>My child 's existing account is linked to an email address, so obviously the problem is not linked to that.</p>

<p>I'm having the same trouble. The suggestion above is the same advice given in the online help. No matter what I try, it acts as though family safety has not been enabled on the machine. When I go to the website to manage things, the child accounts show up
 as expected, but there are no devices registered for them. On my PC, there isn't an option to designate any user accounts as "Child".</p>

<p>Comment is spot on. &nbsp;The issue is even more serious then this, however. &nbsp;I too previously set up child accounts for our kids, linked to their email addresses. &nbsp;The bigger issue is that, when I added their accounts to our Windows 10 system, it actually converted
 their Microsoft Accounts to standard - screwing up their accounts on our Windows 8.1 system as well. &nbsp;I didn't realize what had happened until I noticed I wasn't getting use reports any longer. &nbsp;Going into the Family Safety manager, I noted that it had created
 multiple duplicates of each account - was a total mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be listed as a known issue, and prioritized for resolution.</p>

    <title>Scan is showing a folder that doesn&#39;t exist - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Scan is showing a folder that doesn&#39;t exist</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have reason to believe that my computer is infected with something - virus, malware, something! We had been using Rogers Home Protection but it was not getting it clean. I uninstalled Rogers and installed Microsoft Security Essentials and ran my first
 scan. It unconvered a couple of trojans and removed them. I think there is something still there though. When I run a full scan it gets stuck on a folder that I cannot find hidden or otherwise and the scan runs for 24 hours plus. I have a lot of files but
 not THAT many! I have a screen shot of the scan and the path it appears to be stuck on is:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Application Data\Application Data\Termporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\....various file names it is supposedly scanning appears here</p>
<p>I stop the scan and the MSE gives me the Amber icon thinking it has not done its job. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>It is an older machine:</p>
<p>HP 2 GB RAM, 32 Bit OS</p>
<p>Intel Pentium Dual CPU 1.6 GHz</p>
<p>Windows Vista Home Premium, Service Pack 2</p>

            <p>According to the link that's a temporary internet file that is causing a scan problem.&nbsp; Have you deleted your temporary internet files before running a scan?</p>
<p>Suggest you be sure you have totally removed "Rogers Home Protection" from your OS since remnants of prior security programs may conflict with other security programs such as MSE and cause "behavior" as you have described in your post.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

 I have no idea which antivirus program is "powering" Rogers Online Protection (and I don't see that infomation on their website) so the only suggestion I have re uninstalling it is the following link:
<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/ca/rogers/yop/yop-35267.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.yahoo.com/l/ca/rogers/yop/yop-35267.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; If that doesn't work try the Revo Uninstall Free Version:
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once that's done you need to uninstall and then reinstall MSE.&nbsp; Suggest you thoroughly review the following:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Check list for installing Microsoft Security Essentials</span></a></span></p>

<h2>            How to disable Basic Authentication dialogue window sign in when opening documents from online contents services&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">We have users who have&nbsp;asked if there is a way to bypass the basic authentication when trying to open a document from a file in the file explorer that contains documents from online contents services (Alfresco in this case). The
 users can open a document and sign in to allow it to open, if that same document is left open the user can also open other documents without signing in. However when they are closed and another document is opened the sign in dialogue box shows. This is occurring
 with Office and PDF documents but not&nbsp;with other&nbsp;documents like&nbsp;jpegs. </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">In this support article it shows (at the bottom of the page) the registry that should be changed so you do not have to sign in each time, however it is not working in this case.</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your query in this community.</p>
<p>The Authentication Policy is set up for good reason. Since you are trying to access the Office documents via Alfresco which is a 3rd party service, Microsoft must verify your certification first,
 so I am afraid it's not feasible to disable this authentication. </p>
<p>Anyway, according to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Azure AD federation compatibility list</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d16b132a-530b-4ff9-8cd3-b720fb712c39?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d16b132a-530b-4ff9-8cd3-b720fb712c39?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>We would recommend you to confirm with Alfresco support if their service can be federated with Office 365 Azure AD. Once it's federated, you should have access to the documents without sign in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex Chen</p>

<p>It's probably not your PC that's sending the messages.&nbsp; The most likely scenario is that your mail address is being used as the sender address on some spammer's junk.&nbsp; Many of the target addresses for that junk are invalid and so the receiving mail server
 generates a Non-Delivery Report and sends it to the address it sees as the sending address of the original message.&nbsp; That address is yours and so you get the bounces even though you didn't send the messages.</p>
<p>Spammers change sending addresses often, so wait a bit and the bounces should stop, or at least decrease substantially.&nbsp; It happens to everyone, particularly those who post their mail addresses in public forums like Twitter, Facebook, newsgroups, Yahoo!
 Groups, or any other Internet venue.</p>

<h2>            Restore Cropped Picture From Cropped Out Portion - DATA IS STILL THERE&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>I cropped several photos, then lost the edited photos. However, I found the "leftover" part of the original picture that I had edited out with the crop, with a dark, blank space over the rest of the picture, which I had cropped "in" to the newer, edited
 pic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the data is still there. I can see the full pic on the thumbnail view, AND, sometimes when I open the pic in Microsoft Office 2010, I will see the full original pic for a split second, before the darkened space reappears over the part of the picture
 that I originally cropped "in". Also, when I enlarge by using Ctrl + Mouse Up, it will still display the full original pic on the thumbnail until it gets big enough to a certain point, then the dark portion appears over the originally "kept" part of the picture
 again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every tool on the toolbar and I can't see how anything else in the program can help to restore the original pic, but there has to be a way... can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Mo,</p>
<p>From your description, it does sound like the original image is still there (i.e., you apparently haven't compressed and saved the picture using the Compress Pictures option on the far left side of the Picture Tools&gt;Format ribbon, which would strip out the
 cropped material). While we wait for one of the experts to reply, I'd suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a picture that has been cropped.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Picture Tools&gt;Format </strong>tab.</li><li>On the left side, in the <strong>Adjust </strong>group, drop down the arrow next to
<strong>Reset Picture</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Reset Picture &amp; Size</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>That should restore the image to its original size and shape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach is to just select the cropped picture and&nbsp;choose <strong>Crop
</strong>again. If the cropped material hasn't been compressed/removed, you should see the original material, albeit darkened. Just grab a cropping handle and drag it back out to the original size.&nbsp; (You'll need to do that dragging more than once if you had
 cropped on more than one side.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming either of the above techniques is successful, I'd suggest you right-click and "Save As Picture" for each image you restore to its original size/shape. Don't want to suffer through that all again . . .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Phil</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your timely reply. However, I don't think I have those tabs. I'm using Microsoft Office 2010 to view the picture. I have a Pictures tab and a Tools tab, but I don't have anywhere that leads to an option to format. It sounds like that
 may be what I need though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Actually... I'm not exactly sure why these partial pics are still saved at all. I'm pretty sure I had cropped them down to edit. But... if so, why would I still have a copy of the "leftovers" of the original pic saved, with a browned-out area over the portion
 of the picture that I wanted to save?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a demo version of an image recovery software program, but it didn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this has to be a good mystery for someone with skills/knowledge about this stuff. The data for the whole pic is definitely still there, but it just won't open. It's quite perplexing. Hopefully, one of the experts you alluded to will take an interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            When you select the picture, the contextual <strong>Picture Tools | Format</strong> tab is the one that appears. You can use the Crop tool to "uncrop" the picture. But it sounds like what you've got is the cropped-off portion and not the center, so that
 wouldn't work.

                    <p>I can't seem to use the drop down menus on the internet sites I frequent since I got a new compter and windows 7.&nbsp; I'm sure there's something I need to turn on or off to fix it.&nbsp; I can't copy and paste from a page and enter it in the seach box either.</p>
<p>Specifically I'm trying to add/change shipping weights and services by selecting for an exsisting menu.&nbsp; When I click on the menu it should drop down and offer different selections.&nbsp; Instead it does't do anything.</p>
<p>Secondly when I copy a word or phrase from a page and try to search it in Bing it doesn't paste in the search space.&nbsp; It has copied the word but it won't paste so I don't have to retype it.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had my Nokia N95 8GB since 2008 (It's OLD I get it haha) and I've had no problems with it until recently, where it would randomly turn off and then back on, such as when I'm in the middle of writing a text. The most ridiculous incident was when it turned
 off and on while just lying on the table!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no software updates available for this old phone, so I was hoping someone could give me a solution!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The problem may be due to a faulty SIM Card or loose Battery. You may try putting a packing near the side opposite to the contacts..else check with a different SIM. If SIM is the problem, you may ask your Operator for a replacement, that should be Free of
 cost in most places..&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, I understand you want to set an auto reply for the former employee to notify the sender that the user’s address has been changed to a new one. Am I right?</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, follow the steps below to do it:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Sign into<strong> Exchange admin cente</strong>r (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/ecp</a>) with your Office 365 admin account.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click your picture on the upper right corner of the page, select Another user and double click the former user’s email address. Navigate to<strong> organize email –<span>&nbsp;
</span>automatic replies</strong>. Select <strong>Send automatic replies</strong> and type the content for the replies for internal users and external users respectively. Click
<strong>Save</strong> at last.</span></p>
<p><span>After doing the steps above, any sender will receive an auto reply when sending emails to the former user.</span></p>
<p><span>Please let me know if you need further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

                    I installed the recent update to windows today. And I was not able to boot into windows and getting BSOD's because of it. So I rolled back to the previous build. So now I am on the build from a couple weeks ago. But I can not update to the most recent
 one now even when I check for windows updates. How can I update without losing my stuff.

            <p>Hi Travis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior upgrading your system to the latest build, I would&nbsp;once have you run the DISM tool and then try updating to the newer version. Refer to the following steps to do so:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open an elevated command prompt. Press <em><strong>WinKey + X</strong></em>, click
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li>Type the following command, and then press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.<br />
<span><strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong></span></li><li>After you get message “The operation completed successfully” type second command and press enter. It will take some time to finish.<br />
<strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></li></ol>
<p><span><strong>Important: </strong>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Reboot your computer, check for the issue and post back your results for further assistance.</span></p>

                    I am using Access 2010 with an older .MDB database. I wrote a very simple UPDATE query (1 field in 1 record) and it says zero records updated Looks like there may be some security setting that is preventing table updates with SQL. If so, I can't find it.
 I can update tables in plain dataview. Any help? Thanks

            You said your query was intended to update "1 field in 1 record". In actual fact, it will update every row in the table to the same value. Is there, in fact, any data in the table? I can see nothing about your query that should prevent it from running.

<h3> j. davidblaine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 corrupted normal.dotm, how to fix or replace</h2>
                    My normal.dotm seems to be corrupted because throughout many documents, text is marked as Language=Italian or Language=French. This screws up my grammar checking and spelling. I tried deleting all dictionaries except English (U.S.) but problem persists.<br />
<br />
Language info of normal.dotm styles looks like this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/407c7347-b780-41a6-93cf-d2c058a0fa1b" /><br />
and, when I scroll down, many other languages are checked:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcb3467b-a5ea-4076-9c39-b22becfc5e43" /><br />
<br />
How can either completely delete and replace normal.dotm with a "clean" copy? Or how can I clear out all of these extraneous language settings?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />

            <p>Based on your first screen capture, it would appear that no language is assigned to the text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That language taht is assigned to the selected text is indicated by the blue highlight as shown below:</p>

<p>The ticks with the ABC above them merely indicate that your computer is capable of checking spelling and grammar in those languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While in your case, I do not think that it is necessary to replace Normal.dotm with a clean copy, with Word shutdown, rename the Normal.dotm template to OldNormal.dotm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you then re-start Word, it will create a new one with the default settings.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. I have a shortcut to login.live.com and log in from there</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Microsoft outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I don't think so but since posting the question I have found out that my email has been moved from mail.live to outlook.live as part of move to office 365. I guess this is the cause of the problem. Now my outlook has connected to Microsoft exchange right
 at the bottom, is more basic than before and is harder to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I do not know which one either before or after the change but I use vista</p>

    <title>Instructions for installing Office 365 Home to D&#58; or E&#58; drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d pauldalton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Instructions for installing Office 365 Home to D&#58; or E&#58; drive on Windows PCs</h2>
                    <p>We just purchased a Key Card for Office 365 Home and I want to be sure I know how to download and install it correctly for our configurations. &nbsp;We have not yet downloaded the product to install on our two computers, because we want to be sure we download
 the right thing to get it installed the way we want and properly licensed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife and I each have a PC, one running Windows 8.1 and the other running Windows 7 Home Premium (she isn't quite ready to move to 8.1 yet). &nbsp;And, of course, we anticipate that we will be wanting to move everything to Windows 10 after it is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of our computers are set up with two drives: &nbsp;The boot drive is a 128GB SSD that has only the operating system files installed on it (including the large 16GB pagefile.sys). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The D: drive on her computer and the E: drive on my computer are regular hard drives (WD Black 2TB) onto which all programs are installed. &nbsp;All photos, documents, etc. also reside on these hard drives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the standard Office 365 download uses a "Click To Run" installation that is hardwired to install only on a computer's system drive (C: for us). &nbsp;I have tried to research how to nevertheless install Office 365 Home on our non-C; hard drives,
 but the results have been confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thread (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_install/can-office-365-office-preview-be-installed-on-a/bb68297a-edce-42a0-91b0-37c6fcb3b140) suggests using an MSI installer and contains a link to a TechNet page of "Office Evaluation"
 products that does not include "Office 365 Home." &nbsp;I don't know which, if any, of these I could download, install, and then use the keycard to activate and have the license work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thread (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_install/after-downloading-the-installer-does-nothing-just/665afc23-dd77-483e-b473-11981850b560) provides a link to MSDM subscription downloads, which - again - do not include Office 365
 Home, so I don't know which to use. &nbsp;This thread also includes some bad links. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet another thread (https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/3689fc35-0523-4868-8e4d-e6feb93540be/installing-office-365-on-a-different-hard-drive-to-that-of-the-windows-installation?forum=officesetupdeploy) seems to suggest that creating
 a new Registry Key will cause the installation to go to a different drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please detail a specific set of instructions about how to accomplish what we need to do? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if we download and install the trial version of Office Professional Plus onto these non-system drives, will we be able to activate and use those applications via the Office 365 Home keycard?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; or</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we make the recommended Registry changes, will we then be able to download the Office 365 Home regular install package and have it correctly installed on the non-system drives?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would just like a clear, step by step explanation of what to do to accomplish what we need and have the licenses work correctly going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            <p>AFAIK there is no way of installing office 365 on anything other than the C drive.</p>
<p>FYI - my machine only has a 120GB SSD and I have Office 365 installed perfectly OK on that - so I'm not sure what your concern is.</p>
