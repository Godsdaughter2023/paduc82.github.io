<h2>            outlook voting buttons</h2>
                    <p>When sending or receiving a poll or survey, I noticed that if I have the "show as conversations" button clicked, I am able to see how everyone on the distribution list has voted.
</p>
<p>How do I prevent others from seeing the responses of others when voting?</p>

<p>I assume that by Toolbar, you are referring to the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT).&nbsp; To add the Save As command to the QAT, select Office Menu (or All Commands) from the Choose commands from: drop down in the Word Options&gt;Customize dialog and scroll down the
 list until you find it.&nbsp; Then select it and click on the Add button.</p>

                    <p>My recently&nbsp;BOSS Win 10 Pro x64 1511 bit the dust with busted bios, etc. I did not desire or have time to&nbsp;invest in fixing an aging 2 core AMD laptop box bios, etc. issue, so bought off the shelf a 4 core AMD 10 HP system. I was told it was a Win 10 Pro;
 when back to office; opened box ~~ info available only said Windows 10, but nothing about EDITION. Store said fire it up; I said ok; when fired up, Winver said Windows 10 HOME; with only little fuss, store said &amp; DID&nbsp;$ from me for&nbsp;Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;MS &nbsp;Windows
 10 Pro Full Version little box with Flash x32 x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded the Win 10 Home with the free retail OS above. With some issues involved, it did install, and after the updates came in, utilities installed, &amp; many tweaks,&nbsp;some &nbsp;By

            <p>Hello CopierGuy</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's computer just updated itself to 10586, her computer is not part of the insider program so this is a standard update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC is running as you want it to there is no need to change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;go to 'Windows Update' you will probably be asked to set a time for reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The insider upgrades are for people who like to tinker with their OS's and don't mind it when things don't work as they should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't recommend running insider builds on people's main PC.</p>

    <title>Word documents gobbledygook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clivemarks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word documents gobbledygook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have recently loaded windows 10 and am trying Office 365, although this problem is also present in open office so I have ruled out a program problem. When I try to open word files, probably word 2003 or 2007, I get an 'ASCII filter options' box with
 choices for lots oif languages. The text in the box is ASCII characters. None of the options work and I cannot choose to do anything else. I also have a problem opening mpg video files. I am prone to thinking that I need to download some converter files but
 I have no clue what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has anyone got any clues on this? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your suggestion but I do not think it is an open office problem. Firstly, I cannot open mpg video files and they do not open with word or open office. Secondly, I installed open office because I had this problem with word and I wondered if
 open office would work. So open office is innocent. Because it is happening with word, open office and whichever program opens mpg video I am prone to thinking it is a problem common to all three.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so far for your suggestions. Yes I have been moving files from my old PC to the new one with USB drives, I always remove them properly though. I have been chewing at this some more today and have further information. Whereas none of the moved
 files were working, MPG, DOC, AVI, etc, I have downloaded some codecs and the AVI files are OK now. I still think it is a missing codec or converter problem. I have recovered the files from my old PC and tried them there and they do not work, It is office
 2000, not 2003. I re-loaded office 2000 and it made no difference. I have seen a DATA1.MSI missing message. This file is on my 2000 disc but it does not want to load. So, some small success with the avi files. Any further thoughts? Thanks.</p>

            <p>The MSI extension is for Microsoft Installer files.&nbsp; So finding it on an installation disk makes sense.&nbsp; It probably won't load on its own, only as part of Office 2000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still having problems with older DOC file formats go into:</p>
<p>File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Trust Center option &gt; Trust Center button &gt; File Block Settings option.&nbsp; If any of the file types you are having problems has "Check marks" in the "Open" box, remove the check.&nbsp; OK out of the dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not familiar with the MPG file format.&nbsp; You will have to find the application that you used to open it and install it on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try installing Office Libre / Star Office. It seems to be more flexible opening older file formats (DOC) and sometimes slightly corrupt DOCX files.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the ideas. I have re-loaded office twice now and have the same problem. I have tried Libre office with no luck. The MPG files, actually MPEG, used to open with any player, such as VLC, media player etc. I still think I have wiped some key
 file while changing PC's but I have loaded all I can think of.</p>

<p>Hi Christine,</p>
<p>The latest OneDrive for business version is <strong>15.0.4771.1000</strong>, could you update it to the latest version and check the result? You can Open any Office app &gt;
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> &gt;under <strong>Product Information</strong>, click
<strong>Update Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Update Now</strong>.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, the issue could be related to the OneDrive for Business cache. Could you try the fix it tool in the following article to remove the OneDrive for Business cache and resync files?</p>

<p>Hi Christine,<br />
<br />
According to the screenshot of the error message, there is Office Professional Plus 2013 on your computer. The OneDrive for Business you mentioned should be included in this Office suite. It is an MSI installation version of Office 2013.<br />
<br />
In this situation, you may directly download the update package from this<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2986219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> support article</a> to update the Office suite.<br />
Note: To apply this update, you need to install <strong>Microsoft Office 2013 Service Pack 1</strong> mentioned in the same article.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you may follow the section <strong>Run Windows Update for a traditional setup (MSI) installation</strong> in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-the-OneDrive-for-Business-sync-app-49771c73-e7ad-4d26-bff1-50bb12a83817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a> to update it. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If anything is misunderstood, please post back with the screenshot of your Office applications Product Information. ( Open an Office application and click<strong> File</strong>&gt;<strong>Account</strong>)<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>Hi Christine,<br />
<br />
Have you tried syncing again after installing the update package? You could firstly restart your computer and then try syncing again.<br />

<h2>            Outlook for Mac Office 365 Getting Duplicate Emails using IMAP</h2>
                    I have Office 365 and when using Outlook for Mac, I am getting duplicates of every email I receive. I have 2 Yahoo accounts connected to Outlook. Previously I was using POP and thought switching to IMAP might solve the issue but it didn't. I've noticed
 numerous others with similar issues but have yet to see a response that offered a solution.

<p>Hi Japand92,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please sign in to Yahoo account web version to check if you received duplicated emails as Diane mentioned. If you also received duplicated emails, please contact Yahoo support to get further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue doesn't happen to web version, please try to remove your account from your Outlook and re-add it to check the outcome, Besides, please check if your rules in Outlook are correct. If you have duplicated&nbsp;accounts set up, please remove one of them.
 You can refer to following link about the issue:</p>

            I have removed both accounts (they are 2 different accounts) in Outlook and re-added them, one at a time and still experienced the duplicate emails. I do not use rules in Outlook, so that shouldn't be an issue. I do not have my accounts duplicated either.
 The version I am using is Microsoft Outlook for Mac 16.17 (180909) with an active Office 365 subscription.

    <title>Nokia 5800 Battery Life Declined Fast - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 Battery Life Declined Fast</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my 5800 about 2.5 months now. I don't use it any differently now than the day I got it, infact I may use it a little less as the initial excitement has worn off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the 1st couple of months I was getting 2.5 to 3 days out of the battery, which I was happy with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the last couple of weeks the battery life has suddenly declined to 1.5 days, I might scrape 2 days out of it if I am lucky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have Wifi Scanning on, the screen brightness is half way, I do however leave bluetooth on. Maybe 5 mins of calls and at most 10 texts sent and received a day. But, like I said that is exactly the same usage as when I got the phone. With less time
 playing around with applications and games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone other 5800 owners experiencing battery life issues like this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it may have start around the time I updated the phone to the v20.0.012 firmware.</p>

<p>@smokinjoe: I normally get about 3 days out of it with the usage I described above. However the one thing I always do whenever I get any battery powered device, is cycle the battery a few times. I.e. let the battery drain almost to the point of the phone
 switching off and then charge it full, several times. Also when I get a new phone I always make sure that the first time I plug it in to charge that I make sure that it will stay plugged in until the battery is 100% charged. Apart from that I have not had
 a phone yet that didn't take a couple of weeks of usage before the battery started lasting its longest. (These are just my experiences, this does not mean the same is true for you. If you are feeling that the battery is not up to spec, speak with nokia customer
 care asap)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@cjlim: not trying to sound cheeky mate, but I know how to get the most out of a phone battery, I prefer to use the phone the way I want and sacrifice a bit of battery life. My problem was that almost overnight without out changing the way I use my phone
 everyday the battery started running out faster. But thanks though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happily enough the problem seems to have rectified itself, I am getting my usual 3 days (roughly) again. Not really sure what happened, but I am happy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also tried a full charge to flat test and a few other tests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first tried charging fully, using the phone for mp3 player and general use (leaving swtched on over night but offline as everyone reccommends) - charged Friday about 7pm used MP3 for 4 hours on Sat, battery flat by sunday at 12 noon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I charged the battery again about 7pm Sunday, again in offline mode Sunday night, by monday morning the phone had dropped 1 bar, by mid afternoon it had dropped to 2 bars left (not I had received 2 voicemails and 1 text and the phone display is minimum
 and standby within 1 minute) - when I came back to the phone on Tues morning it had switched off and I had to charge so I could switch back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone is going back to the shop for a replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a friend who uses his extensively and he charged his on the Friday afternoon and then used for GPS texting email receiving and his was still going strong on monday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it appears there is some high drain irrespective of the physical usage of the phone (otherwise the mp3 would have drained the battery) - not very scientific but interesting to note.</p>

<p>theres lots of things that can drain battery. But have noticed that one feature on 5800 uses alot of juice, the usb mass storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use bluetooth all the time with nokia bluetooth stereo headset (og course listing to music), i also use wifi (update my podcasts). But when i use usb cable (storage mode) this thing needs lots of battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a Palm treo 650 which i use card reader, it the same feature and i can tell you, i can have this thing on all day and is doesn't use too much battery. But the nokia 5800, leaving it on about 2 hours can almost use 70% of your battery.</p>

            hi, i've had my 5800 for a couple of weeks. Battery has been lasting 2.5 to 3 days with normal use. I charged it yesterday at about 19:00 and when i went to use it after work today (17:00) it was dead - like absolutely flat. I thought it was broke - it
 even took a while for the charge to initiate when i plugged it in. I had barely used the phone since the charge at 19:00 yesterday - so it seems very odd that the battery would completely drain. Fully charged now and gonna watch what happens

<p>I got my silver 5800 (didn't know there were silver ones in circulation before that day!) from phones4u on a contract with orange, on the 31st of March.. I use the phone every day for 1 call and 2 txt at most, since I am abroad right now (Greece), and I
 prefer my o2 PAYG as it's cheaper on call charges. So I have call forwarding from the Orange locked 5800 to my other handset. The battery life goes down dramatically fast (like 1.5 day or so), without using the phone at all. One thing is that I have the forwarding
 service; but I think that this has nothing to do with the device itself, since the calls are redirected from the provider directly. The other thing is that the phone was trying to find some signal here in Greece, as I didn't have the roaming activated; so
 this MIGHT have been a reason. But then again, it's hard to believe that this was the issue, as I get normal and constant signal now, LOCKED on a provider, in GSM ONLY mode (not dual mode), and without using WiFi, BT, Music or anything else whatsoever from
 the device's functions...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps&gt; I had an exactly same phone from Orange on PAYG, which was modified (product code changed to match Greek settings and Language pack), and upgraded to the latest EMEA update from Nokia Software Update application (Orange UK supported only up to v.11.0.0xx,
 while the rest of EU and unlocked providers, support HW version 20.0.013/014). That phone could go up to&nbsp;5 days stand by (wow, eh!) with zero-usage, but it couldn't revert back to the old product code, as it would occur a downgrade compatibility issue which
 cannot be solved (unless you want to hang, crash, brick, u-name-it your phone). So this cost me my warranty; and I don't want to sacrifice that phone's warranty for 3 days extra life...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas on that please? Any help will be appreciated...</p>

            exactly the same problem and circumstances. O2 support suggested upgrading software and try again.I've just done this and will see if there is a difference. This forum suggests that this should not have been a surprise to the phone's suppliers. I'll let
 you know how it goes

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you use a bluetooth mouse in particular a Logitech one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been suffering battery issues and mouse problems, I failed to link the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of days back, I swapped to a cable mouse and suddenly my phone battery has not needed charging</p>

<p>Thanks for your response, Black Barron. I can't upload this (company protected) file, though.</p>
<p>I'll try to further explain.</p>
<p>When adding a new row in an existing Table, Excel draws from a set of column formulas and formats to insert the new row with similar populated data as the other columns in that Table. I need to edit the 'default parameters' for that new row so it will contain
 updated formulas and formats, but I cannot figure out how to edit the 'default parameters'. Several columns (in a newly added row) will have old formatting and old formulas which are automatically populated into the new row.</p>
<p>In Office 2003 there used to be a bottom row which appeared for adding new rows. It was&nbsp;signified with an " * ". You could format that 'add-a-new-row' row and when you entered new data, wallah! it's formatted correctly.</p>
<p>In Office 2010 that row was elminated and replaced with a simple "Hit the &lt;TAB&gt; key and a new row magically appears" function. In a perect world, you create a new Table by starting with two rows - one header row followed by one data row. IF you format the
<p>Unfortunately, there's not an easily found resource for explaining what to do when 'hitting the &lt;TAB&gt; key' produces unwanted results... i.e., old formulas or formats which are being referenced for creating the new row.</p>

<h2>            Bing Maps and Directions with GPS</h2>
                    
<p>For simple things, I like the Bing maps directions on the phone. &nbsp;It lists each turn and shows the little map at the top, and thats all I really need. &nbsp;So, on the little map, your location is tracked and shown with a moving dot. &nbsp;Ok great. &nbsp;Now... &nbsp;is there
 any way for the map to MOVE as your location dot moves? &nbsp;I don't care if the written directions are even shown, I'm good with the map and the route-line with my little location dot that follows me around. &nbsp;It seems so close that I feel I'm must be missing
 something simple.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p><span><span>I've used the direction feature in maps whilst in my car and I can tell you that the map&nbsp;<strong>does</strong> move as your location moves.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, network and location services need to be switched on.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have selected your start and destination, tap the map again to hide the route details.<span>&nbsp;</span>The yellow dot (your current location) is now the focus
 and will move with the map as you move.<span>&nbsp;</span>If you then manually move the map around, it will lose the location focus and the map will of course&nbsp;stop moving.<span>&nbsp;</span>To return the focus back to the yellow dot, tap the 'me' pinpoint icon at the
 bottom of the screen and it will centre the yellow dot again and move the map as you move.<span>&nbsp;</span>It's works very well on my HD7 in 4.3 inch glory.<span>&nbsp;</span>Only thing missing is turn-by turn voice navigation and I'd be complete!</span></span></p>

 I get from them is cut and paste replies from outdated forms with old outdated links and standard form replies.&nbsp;<br />
We are signed up to the the&nbsp;proprietary services JMRE and SNDS and they don't give us anything since we have to low volumes of mail (below 100 a day) and no other mailservice is blocking us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are on no SMTP blackslists and our&nbsp;https://returnpath.com/ senderscore is 100.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>We have had this problem twice before and then after butting heads with&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=614866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook.com Deliverability Support</a>&nbsp;for a couple of days they performed "mitigation"
 and delivery of our mail resumed and the support stopped communication with us completely. No explanation as to what we should/could to continue to ensure delivery, nor what the underlying cause was for the block in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a serious company and want to adhere to guidelines and recommendations and to our knowledge, we do (and apparently other e-mail providers think we do as well!) but Microsoft decide to block us without telling us why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get ahold of a real support for this problem? Someone who doesn't read and cut'n'paste from a form to questions?</p>

            BC:326 reply might seem very rude, but you don't know how frustrating this is becoming.<br />
<p>
</p><p>I just hope you never face the same problem <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/64848e61-4705-462c-9053-211a8809568a" title="BC:326">
BC:326 </a>and many of us are having, suddenly not being able to send emails to a client you have been talking for months, and not knowing it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can assure you I have not send an unsolicited email from my account in all my live, and in any case, even if I had done it: if you reply an email you have received from a Client and that email gets blocked, that is very bad, and I think that Microsoft
 should be doing much better than that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, those receiving your emails may not agree. For example, I have a mortgage with a bank and they send me email relating to my mortgage. Great. Those I want. They also send me stuff to open checking accounts or credit cards or whatever, and to
 me, those are Spam and I file them accordingly. Maybe your customers have done the same.</p>
<p>At some point your emails have been classified as Spam, the contents of the emails are "spam-like", or the servers that send your email have been found to be sending spam or malware. Those are the typical ways you get blacklisted and have the mail sent from
 your organization go straight to the Junk Folder.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft is doing a great job as 97% of the spam I receive ends up in the Junk folder and the "false-positives" are very few in number. I always double check my Junk folder to make sure something doesn't go there that I do in fact want, and occasionally
 I'll find something. That's what your customers should be doing and if they really want your email they'll take it out of Junk and reply to it appropriately.</p>
<p>So, the method currently provided by Microsoft is to fill out the form I indicated. There's no group you can call or "support" to contact, it's all via that form and the results you get from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>A big part of the problem is that you as a sender don't know why your mail is blocked, or that is actually
<strong>is</strong> blocked in some cases. All of the server replies are correct indicating that the e-mail has been delivered and the e-mails still don't reach the recipient or their spam box.
</p>
<p>Unless the recipient contacts you, asking for the e-mail you are in the dark. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A correct block on server level would suffice, a SMTP 471 error code would be a correct implementation of the block.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you always know all of the legitimate e-mail you are supposed to receive and contact the sender if one was missing? Would you know if one was missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The different causes for not having mail delivered varies in all possible areas, not only customer interactions towards the mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That makes rectifying the root cause a hard task since you don't know the root cause.</p>
<p>A hint towards what the cause is would be appreciated but you don't really receive that from the support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imagine yourself, the e-mails you send all of a sudden not reaching the recipient and your e-mail provider only says "We have delivered it to the recipients server" &nbsp;and thats all you know.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately many of my clients are not teach people at all. They are on their seventies-eighties and they don't know much about computers/email stuff, and they don't need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They trust on my hands something they love much, and they are usually in another country during the winter, and speak other language. It is very difficult to call them and try to explain that there is an spam folder, that I just sent them an email, that
 probably is there. They just don't follow you, especially if up to that day you had been communicating with them through email perfectly. If you tell them about an email you sent, they always think is one of the ones they received and won't listen about the
 spams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is my job to send the email from another account when I suspect the email was not received, but why should I do this!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because all this is a guess. You don't know when they don't receive the emails, no bounce back email, no error on the logs. Nothing. And that is what it is frustrating. Because if you know for sure something, you try to act to correc it, but if it is all
 guessing, then ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me, like a bussiness, can't affort to don't get on the inbox account 3% of the emails I send, because 90% of my Clients will never see them. And I am not talking about newsletters or promoting my services. I am talking about replying emails that someone
 sent me, or informing one of my clients that his boat is ready, or there was this or that problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks God, it is only like 3% of Clients with emails from Microsoft, but I know that sooner or later I am going to have troubles with those, misunderstandings, frustrations, etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you, viewing you with a Client perspective (for example, Client of your Bank), and with the technical knowledge you must have, I can understand that there is no problem for you and that Microsoft is giving you a good service. But I do believe there is
 a big problem with this, and there are many unhappy users out there. Because I am also a user of Microsoft, and I don't receive my own emails sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I have refilled the form you suggest again (I did it in English this time, as the Spanish one is badly translated and I didn't have a clue of what I should input at each textbox), and let's see...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was an invoice this time, so maybe I was indeed blacklisted this time after all ;-)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I see you know very well what are talking about, could I kindly ask you, if yo know if I can be being blocked by those emails that spammers send from does_not_really_exist_<strong>at</strong>_your_domain_<strong>dot</strong>_com (they have a name in English...)?
 I see in my log files that I receive many of those, and I imagine other people might be receiving them also, but they are really not originated on my server, they just pretend to come from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks and kind regards from Spain,</p>

<p>That, I don't know. Microsoft doesn't reveal exactly how they classify spam because if they did then spammers would have more knowledge available to them to get around it.</p>

<p>Yes, I would as I keep track of who I do business with and who should be sending me something and roughly when. Fortunately, none of the businesses I work with have been blacklisted by Microsoft.</p>

    <title>MSE won&#39;t update, Error &#34;The virus and spyware definitions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MSE won&#39;t update, Error &#34;The virus and spyware definitions didn&#39;t update because of an Internet or network connectivity problem&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title : MSE won't update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running a *new* install of Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit using a *new* installation of MSE.<br />
<br />
When trying to update the definitions files, I keep getting the following error message:
<br />
<br />
"Connection failed<br />
The virus and spyware definitions didn't update on XXX (date/time) because of an Internet or network connectivity problem."<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with my Internet connection. It doesn't give me any kind of error code, so the error message is practically useless.<br />
<br />
I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling MSE and it updates OK for a short time, but the issue always comes back.<br />
<br />
I've tried installing the MSE definitions update manually by downloading the approx. 80MB exe. file, but that doesn't work either.<br />
<br />
The only other anti-malware software I have on my system is Malwarebytes Anti-Malware.<br />
<br />
If I didn't know better, I'd say MSE was unstable software...<br />
<br />
Anyone have any thoughts? Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>Malwarebytes Free is an good on demand scanner that runs quite well with MSE installed...I use it myself.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Malwarebytes Pro also includes a real time scanner that&nbsp;<b>may&nbsp;</b>cause conflicts with MSE.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?&nbsp; &nbsp;What about a trial version of an antivirus program that was pre-installed when the computer was purchased? McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro?&nbsp; If you reformatted/reinstalled the operating system did you also reinstall a trial version
 of a security program?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<b>possible</b>&nbsp;reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC.&nbsp; Be sure you have completely removed&nbsp; all other security software from the PC to include using the appropriate removal tool for
 that software (AVG Removal Utility, McAfee Removal Tool, Norton Removal Tool, etc.).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may need to use a software cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

<br />
Hi again John,<br />
<br />
I followed that link and read the article. Made a couple of tweaks to my system. Then uninstalled MSE and rebooted.<br />
<br />
Then installed MSE anew.<br />
<br />
Same problem - connectivity error message on attempted definitions update.<br />
<br />
I don't know what else to do...&nbsp; :(<br />
<br />
PS - Windows Update is totally up-to-date<br />

            Recommend you see the Answer of Stephen Boots in this thread&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/security-essentials-install-problem/fc34c181-f63f-40c9-9da5-bc96e185f750">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/security-essentials-install-problem/fc34c181-f63f-40c9-9da5-bc96e185f750</a>
<div><br />
<div>And be sure the time and date on your computer are correct - if necessary reset the clock/calendar and reboot the computer.<br />
<div><br />
<div>If it were my computer I would not spend a lot of time with this issue. &nbsp; Most (but certainly not all) such issues involve third party software conflicts with MSE or problems with Windows Updates. &nbsp;If you're comfortable you've done all you can to ensure
 such a conflict is not causing your problem I would uninstall MSE and use another antimalware program. &nbsp;MSE is a good program but so are several other freebies. &nbsp;The one down side to other free programs is they will "nag" you a bit pushing their pay products
 which MSE does not do.

            I have <strong>exactly</strong> the same problem, I do have Malwarebytes (Free) as well as MSE, but it's never been a problem for me before. MSE turns amber and tells me I need to update my laptop, click to update it takes seconds to load and then halts
 at the end before saying I have internet connectivity issues and making my whole laptop freak out about a potential threat. However there is
<strong>NO</strong> connectivity issue, so what am I supposed to do? The time and date is all correct so it's nothing to do with that.

            <p>I know this is an old post.&nbsp; But just in case other people are having the same problem, here are the steps that I've been able to take to fix the problem.</p>
<p>1) Stop the Microsoft Antimalware service</p>
<p>2) Rename the Definition Updates folder to Definition Updates_old.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you're a Windows 7 or later user, the location is C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware.&nbsp; If you're a Windows XP user, the location is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware.</p>
<p>3) Start the Microsoft Antimalware service.&nbsp; You should get a warning that the definitions have not been updated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>4) Manually run an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be good to go.</p>

            <p>There are a couple of thing that can cause that. &nbsp;Is the account you're using an administrator of the computer? &nbsp;If not, you're going to need to do this with an account that has admin privileges. &nbsp;Another possibility is that another process has the folder

            <p>Hello. I am having exactly the same problem, and haven't solved it yet.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled Malwarebytes.</p>
<p>I uninstalled MSE</p>
<p>I re-installed the latest MSE, and it did all the updates, etc, right up till today.</p>
<p>I then tried the update button, but the same message comes up as per the OP here, suggesting a connectivity problem.
</p>
<p>But there IS NO such problem - I have even deleted my connection to my Wi Fi and done it all new again - no problem with anything else, all works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the solution as per DK's post above, but the said file reverts to Definition Updates.
</p>
<p>It WON'T take the _old bit at the end, even though I am the only administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have re-started several times, done a disk clean, etc, etc ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating. Please help further ?</p>

    <title>View jumping to top of page when entering formula - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            View jumping to top of page when entering formula</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I'm working on Excel 2011 (14.3.5 (130515)) and since last week I'm experiencing some strange - but already seen in the past - problem:<br />
<br />
When I'm entering a formula in eg D70 it will jump to the top of the page.<br />
Also when using the arrow keys to navigate around it behaves strangely: moving up/down will keep the active cell in the very last row; moving right the active cell leaves the visible screen.<br />
<br />
I'm working on an xlsx spreedsheet which was generated on this machine.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your help very much!<br />
<br />
Best regards,&nbsp; patrick<br />

<h2>            Reminders on Recurring Tasks in Outlook</h2>
                    I use the TASKS function a lot in Outlook on my PC. I have a task that is scheduled to repeat daily and I have a reminder set for 8pm in the evening (which reminds me if I've forgotten to action this task). When I mark the task as complete, it appears
 again the next day (as expected), though the reminder is now unchecked (unexpected). Is this a bug or is there a setting that I'm missing?

    <title>Installing&#47;activating Office Professional Plus 2010 on a second - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diego v.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing&#47;activating Office Professional Plus 2010 on a second portable PC</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have Office Professional Plus 2010 installed in my netbook... yup, I still got one.&nbsp; I believe the software comes with at least one additional license for personal use.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I've purchased a new laptop PC and would like to install the software there too.&nbsp; The original installation was a download (netbook doesn't have a CD/DVD drive) and I have a product ID but because it was download, the product ID is expired even though Office
 is activated and functioning (as it should be) in my netbook.&nbsp; Should I just download a Office trial version into my new PC and then call to activate it over the phone with the information that I have or do I need to uninstall from the netbook first?&nbsp; I have
 been unable to find a straight answer. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.

One of the terms of the license state that you can install it on a "primary" device. The UNWRITTEN ASSumption is it is a desktop. Another term is that you may install it on a portable device for your use.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here is an extract from the terms document:<br />

2. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
<div>
a. <span>
One Copy per Device</span>. 
<p>You may install one copy of the software on one device. That device is the “licensed device.”</p>
<div>
b. Licensed Device.
<p>You may only use one copy of the software on the licensed device at a time.</p>
<div>
c. <span>
Portable Device. </span>
<p><span>You may install another copy of the software on a portable device for use by the single primary user of the licensed device</span>.</p>
<br />
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
"Product ID" is not what you need. You need the 25 character Product Key to do the activation on the new machine.&nbsp; You can use one of the following tools to extract it from the netbook:<br />
<div>
<b>Tools to Extract Product Key</b>
<p><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Your original package or purchase confirmation email</span></li><li><span>Online download account</span></li><li><span>You can extract the Product Key from the machine itself</span></li><li><span>Image copy backups of system with Office installed</span></li><li><span>Activation backup utilities</span></li></ol>

    <title>Outlook for iOS and Outlook.com calendar integration&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobhatcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for iOS and Outlook.com calendar integration&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've given up trying to sync the calendar for Outlook on the desktop with the calendar with Outlook.com so, I've now standardized on the latter. &nbsp;It was nice to see Outlook for iOS and I've put that on my iPad. &nbsp;But, the question is, how do I sync the calendar
 between them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's crazy that the iOS one does not have Office 365 or Outlook.com (can someone please explain the difference?) under "Calendar Apps".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, can someone please tell me how to get my calendar to sync between Outlook for iOS and Outlook.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Same problem. Here's more information.</p>
<p>If I change the Windows mode to Dark, Light, and back to Dark, it will let me select the box for the Start, taskbar, and action center to show color in. If the Windows mode is Light, that box is "uncheckable", i.e., the description is grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've had to do is set the default Windows mode to Dark, the default app mode to Light, and select the Start, taskbar, and action center.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I still have the black background... not what I want... This worked correctly, letting me make the choices I wanted in the previous version of Windows 10, but I just upgraded...&nbsp;

            My task bar does turn black and all of the colors through out are not the vibrant colors that I had and when the screen saver comes on, the back ground is white. This just happened all of a sudden &nbsp;

            It's a personal choice you can try Windows 10 and if you don't like it rollback to 8.1 with the windows device recovery tool you just need to go to the WDRT On a PC and follow the instructions to rollback to 8.1to update to 10 download The upgrade advisor
 app on your phone and run it

    <title>Can&#39;t register software due to error with my Microsoft account in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bgano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t register software due to error with my Microsoft account in the Profile Center</h2>
                    <p>For the past several months, I've been unable to register any MS software (e.g. Visual Studio 2012) due to an error my account receives in the Profile Center:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>An unknown error occurred while processing your request. This is most likely due to a connection failure. Please try again.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error occurs regardless of the browser/computer I use whether I am logged in or not when attempting to register. I also receive it when trying to register for events. It's tied to my account and affects three other linked accounts as well. Creating
 a new account solves the issue, but once it links, the issue infects that account as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My account appears to work fine in all cases outside of registering software or events. I've seen several similar reports on this forum and elsewhere, but none of them have solutions.</p>

<br />
Could you please tell us the exact and complete steps that you have followed in registering the MS softwares, please include URLs that you've accessed to in the process and other important details.
<br />
<br />
Also, <span>
may&nbsp;I request for your Microsoft account?&nbsp;I need to check your account&nbsp;from our end&nbsp;for any possible cause. Your email address will be automatically masked and only you and the moderators will see this.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I contact the Profile Center? That link takes me to online help, but there isn't a way to contact anyone. The contact link in the footer doesn't have anything relating to Profile Center. The closest thing I could find was Microsoft Account. When I
 click that, it says there is no support for that product and I should look online for a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if this helps, but when I'm on the Profile Center page, the following pages give me the same error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
