<h2>            DPC watchdog violation - how to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I did a windows reinstall using ISO file on my windows 10 laptop recently. Since then a blue error screen with the stop code: DPC watchdog violation started to occasionally appear. I updated the drivers and the laptop worked fine for a few days, but
 then it started responding sluggishly and freezing for a few seconds at intervals and the blue error screen appeared again. I checked the event viewer and found the following errors:</p>

            Hi RaFa408, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            hearts, free cell, solitare.</h2>
                    <p>I have win 10. Previously I had win 7. I did have a backup of the three card games, hearts solitaire and free cell on a CD: down loaded it to my win 10, they're all on a shortcut and every&nbsp; time I attempt to install or open one of them I get a note that
 says "Can't find the target". &nbsp;I am not that familiar&nbsp;operating a&nbsp;computer and the&nbsp;vocabulary doesn't mean that much to me. As a result&nbsp;I don't know what this means.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I get these card games from win 7 to work on win 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can get a simple, detailed explanation, I would be very grateful on how this install can be done. Thank you for your consideration.&nbsp;</p>

      You will have to register to see the download, but it's safe and
      works. <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Not only did I get the classic games back, but my cumulative
      scores were still intact. <br />

<h2>            Skype and font accessibility</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated my desktop Skype to the new version since the old one is not going to be available after September 1st. I'm visually impaired and I use skype to communicate with friends. Is there a way to change the font? I knew how to do it with the old
 version but I can't find it on the new one. The font is super tiny and makes Skype really inaccessible&nbsp;now. Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            I bought gold but says i dont have it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>First of all I'm sorry if this is the wrong section but anyways I'm going to get to the point. I have recently bought gold membership in hoping to start a fresh new account. I bought the gold membership through my PayPal and usually if I buy gold it comes
 straight through right away. I tried to play an online multiplayer game, to be specific Halo Reach. So I go into matchmaking and it says "Requires Gold Membership with permission to play Xbox LIVE". I thought how funny didn't I just buy gold? If anyone can
 help me out I'd be that'd be greatly appreciated.</p>

I have already done this. It took around 20GB space of the usb drive.<br />
Can I use this USB drive to boot from and format and reinstall windows 8?<br />
Can you explain terms 'refresh' and 'reset'?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can follow the steps to create a recovery DVD by referring to the link:<br />
Refer to the section "<b>Create the recovery drive</b>"<br />
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive</a>
</p>
<b>Note:</b> Creating a recovery media will erase everything on that media. Make sure to transfer any important data from your DVD to another storage device before using it to create a recovery drive.<br />
<br />
It is also recommended to refer to the articles provided by Sony at their website to create one.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if you need any assistance on issues with Windows.<br />

    <title>MAK Volume License Upgrade from Windows 8 to 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MAK Volume License Upgrade from Windows 8 to 8.1</h2>
                    My organization purchased a multiple-activation key (MAK) for Windows 8 Pro. Well, as I found out, the free update to Windows 8.1 Pro doesn't make itself available in the Store if Windows is activated through a MAK or another volume license key. I'd like
 to get our Windows 8 Pro users up to 8.1 Pro to enjoy the new OS but it seems this isn't possible.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried the Windows 8.1 Pro VL iso from MSDN, hoping that an in-place upgrade (or a clean install) would make it happen, but it won't take my organization's MAK key from 8 Pro (It spends a few seconds checking it, then reports back "That key doesn't
 work - try another one".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What's going on here? Does my organization have to re-purchase a MAK key for 8.1? That seems awfully ridiculous considering the update is free for retail and OEM users.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions. Yes I had understood Photoshop CS2 was compatible with Windows 8.1 and saw it listed. I'm trying to install the US English version 9.0 which is the "free" version as I no longer have my CD for the copy I installed on XP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing as Administrator, tried running the trouble shooter, tried your Method 2, I've read most of the comments on the Adobe site and mine seems to have slightly different error problem, i.e. the Error 1926 and Error 0 with reference to
 not having enough privileges to modify the C:\Windows folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial PhSp_CS2_English.exe file runs and puts down a setup file with associated files for instillation. It is this second setup which starts then comes up with the complaint of not set security for the C:\Windows\. Error: 0. check sufficient privileges...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now run the cmd file to take ownership of the C:\Windows files and this has let the instillation go through to completion, but I thought Windows 8 was partly selling on the increased security of it. Now it seems that much of that security locks it
 down so it can't be used without potentially breaking the security in some unknown fashion.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So problem solved, but not really in a way that it should need to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Charles Stirling</p>

<h2>            Computer freezing frequently at random intervals</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Computer Freezing frequently at random intervals (Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.256 most likely culprit)</p>
<p>Hey guys. So I am not in the habit of shutting my laptop down and I even restart infrequently. Another major issue is that when my laptop comes out of sleep or hibernation Windows Aero turns off and my WiFi is disconnected (the icon that shows up is the
 one that would show up if I disabled my WiFi device). I noticed this either on the night of the 22nd or the 23rd.
<br />
<br />
Here is what has happened in detail:<br />
<br />
On the 22nd (10:44pm) I decided to restart. I don't remember why I restarted so I am unsure if it was because of the Windows Aero and Wifi issue I&nbsp; was talking about or just computer sluggishness. As soon as I restarted an Adobe Flash Updater (or... what ever
 the official name is) popped up alerting me to update to the latest version. At the same time windows update told me that I needed to select and choose what updates to get (since I have that option picked). I decided I would update later that night so it could
 do what ever it wanted and I closed it (i.e. I did NOT update windows at that time but I did update my flash since it wouldn't require a restart). How ever since that my laptop has been freezing and just awfully slow.<br />
<br />
My first suspect was flash so I removed it but this did nothing. So I had to look else where. My restart before that one was on the 1st of this month (I know so because I have a program which tracks my boot times so I just checked that. It also lists what changes
 where made to the computer). There were no OS changes and just a few programs installed. I didn't think it was the programs fault at that point but my laptop was driving me crazy so I undid all that and restarted. Still nothing. At that point I ran my Avast
 and MalwareBytes and again, nothing. For some reason I decided that maybe I should update my laptop and I started the process. I randomly clicked on update history and saw on the 22nd at 11:53 am Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.256 and that it may require a
 restart. I thought this was it but after searching I found that it could not be removed. Windows finished the update and restarted. One had failed so I redid the update and restarted again. I removed all the security programs, turned off defender and windows
 firewall but when this did nothing I turned off my Windows Updates and it SEEMS to have improved but not by much since the Aero issue is is there. I can't think of anything else so here I am.
<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 64bit and here is a list of installed updates (sorry for the really long list but I really want to fix this ASAP and also the last 15 or so updates are relevant and the rest are just in case.) They are in order of installation.<br />

            <p>You should run chkdsk.</p>
<p><span>Select Start, Run, type cmd and press ENTER. Type "chkdsk c: /f /r" without the quotes and hit ENTER.&nbsp;Make sure you include the spaces indicated.
 Enter Y when asked whether you wish to run chkdsk on restarting the computer. Exit and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Marking off bad sectors on a hard drive takes time so be patient. Marking off does not repair a bad sector. It places pointers on the drive telling
 the system not to read or write to those sectors which have been damaged.</span></p>
<p><span>If the number of bad sectors continues to increase after you have run the procedure above several times then you should replace the drive. If an
 important system file is written to a bad sector you can corrupt registry hives and lose the whole contents of the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand if having run chkdsk you see no more new bad sectors then the drive can work for you for years.</span></p>
<p><span>If you just want a chkdsk report on your C partition select Start, Run, type "cmd" without quotes in the box and press the ENTER key. Type chkdsk
 and press the ENTER key and a report, detailing amongst other things a summary of how the disk space is utilised, is provided. If you want a report on a partition or drive other than C you need to go to that partition. To access F, where F is the required
 partition you type F: and press the ENTER key.</span></p>
<p><span>Copying reports from a command prompt can be tricky. Right click and select Mark. This enables you to highlight selected text and click to copy.
 You then go to an open Word, Notepad or similar file, right click and paste. The selected text transfers from your clipboard to the open file. You can paste directly into a reply message to most forums.</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows 7 you may need to use an Elevated Command Prompt;<br />

    <title>TOTALLY CONFUSED ABOUT SKYPE SINCE MSN BOUGHT IT AND WHAT VERSION - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobk49  say:</h3>
<h2>            TOTALLY CONFUSED ABOUT SKYPE SINCE MSN BOUGHT IT AND WHAT VERSION WORKS ON BOTH MY LAPTOPS</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 laptops that I use at home.Both have Skype Version 7.40.103. On 1 computer it works fine with no issues in signing in,using my password,cam and voice.It also has the Skype sound when loading and under my id all the headings of previous versions-
 Skype Contacts Conversation Call View Tools Help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other computer it does not work.When I sign in with the same id and password it just does nothing and I need to go into Help sign in with my id and then a window pops up and says "yes there is one account with this id" and it connects.Even though
 it is the same version 7.40.103 it is webskype which I hate more than you can imagine.It has nothing like the features I mentioned above,no sound,no headings and other than typing messages cannot use my cam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So not clear why on 1 computer it all works well and on the other it does not.I also don't know why on 1 computer when I downloaded version 7.40.103 it has all the Skype features that I mentioned but when I downloaded it on the other computer it loads as
 webskype with all the issues mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated. I am at the point of ending Skype and using Viber which has no issues on both computers.</p>

 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the sign in page of the Skype application, did you click <strong>Problems signing in?&nbsp;</strong>If you did, then you would be directed to the
<strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics?intsrc=client-_-windows-_-7.36.0.101-_-go-forgotpassword&amp;setlang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Accounts Diagnostic</a></strong> link wherein you will be asked for the account you have issues
 signing in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Skype v.7.40.103 on the affected device, please try the following suggested steps below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quit </strong>the Skype application and make sure it's running in the background.
</li><li>Launch Run command by pressing Windows +&nbsp; keys at the same time. </li><li>On the Run dialog box, type in<strong> %appdata%\Skype&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Locate a file named<strong> shared.xml </strong>or shared if your file extensions are hidden and delete it.&nbsp;</li><li>Click on the folder named after your Skype name and locate a file name <strong>
config.xml </strong>and delete it.&nbsp;</li><li>Rename the whole Skype folder to <strong>Skype_old</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Disable your firewall and anti-virus as they may be restricting your access to Skype.</li><li>Change connection and re-launch the Skype application. </li></ul>
<div>
<p>If the issue persists, please confirm the following the affected device model and check if this is also happening when you try to sign in a different account.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click "<b>Start</b>" button, type “<b>devmgmt.msc</b>” (without quotation marks) in the “<b>Search</b>” bar and press "<b>Enter</b>". Click “<b>Continue</b>” if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, double click to expand "<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Repeat the step b to uninstall all items under "<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>".</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Once done, restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After the restart, your computer will automatically try to install the <b>
Universal Serial Bus drivers </b>using Windows Updates. Once done, check if you face the same issue.</span></p>

<h2>            eMachines model T5020, Service Package 3, crashing issues. - System started crashing after installing updates</h2>
                    <p>I installed a set of updates, after doing so my computer started crashing a lot.. I believe this is due to the updates since it was fine literally 10 minutes before I updated, after I updated my computer crashed not 5 minutes later. I was wondering if it'd
 be possible to know what the set of updates was that was recently sent out for people using eMachines model T5020, Service Package 3, was so I can unistall these updates that are crashing my computer.</p>

            Maybe the updates you got are important security updates or bug fixes that your system really needs.<br />
<br />
Would it not make more sense to figure out and fix the crashing prolbem?<br />
<br />
Just a thought...<br />

There are Microsoft Support Engineers working the forums too - let's see what they suggest!<br />

            What does "crashing" mean to you?&nbsp; That is not much to go on.<br />
<br />
But, the MS Answers forums doesn't ask for any system information when a new question is asked, so if you want to fix what you have, we can probably do that if you will answer some questions...&nbsp; or somebody can help you figure out what updates were installed
 and you can uninstall them if you want.<br />
<br />
If there was a problem with the updates, just think how many millions of people in the world would be screaming right now (and they're not).<br />
<br />
Since I have responded to these kinds of things so many times, I offer this copy/paste explanation (so I will never have to type it in again).:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the time (in recent memory) when there is a problem after installing Microsoft updates, the problem is because the computer was somehow afflicted before/when the updates were installed and the updates merely bring to the surface an existing problem
 that was not obvious before.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is especially an issue when security updates come out.<br />
<br />
If the last thing folks remember doing is installing MS updates, it is a typical reaction to somehow implicate the updates for post update problems when things don't work correctly afterwards and especially on the next reboot.&nbsp; Since the last thing folks remember
 is installing updates, Microsoft takes the heat.<br />
<br />
Another reaction is to try to remember all the updates you installed and somehow uninstall all the updates one by one from the XP Recovery Console until you find the one that is "responsible".&nbsp; Unless you wrote all the update numbers down, that would be more
 challenging, but not impossible.&nbsp; It is not going to be helpful advice in most scenarios, but you can sure try it.<br />
<br />
Security updates sometimes patch holes in XP and when the security holes are patched (and XP is "tighter"), the affliction can no longer do whatever is has been doing, things that used to be allowed to happen are no longer allowed to happen as a result of the
 tighter security, the system now has some new problem (especially when it no longer boots), and it appears that installing the updates broke the system when in fact, it is just a coincidence.<br />
<br />
The problem is always going to be a preexisting condition on the system that you just did not know about.<br />
<br />
Another thing that can happen is that the Microsoft updates will change or update some critical XP system files.&nbsp; Depending on what your antivirus or antimalware software is, those programs may interpret the new or updated files as being a threat or somehow
 infected and quarantine (effectively delete) the files it thinks are suspicious.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean the updates are bad - it means your antivirus/antimalware software is bad (probably out of date).<br />
<br />
The next time you reboot your system, you will have some kind of a problem or you won't boot at all if the files are missing or mismatched.&nbsp; Once again, the problem is not with the updates, it is some other condition on your system with your antivirus or antimalware
 programs you are using (they could not be aware of what the new files from Microsoft look like).

            I use MalwareBytes Malicuious Malware Remover, Avast Free Edition (up to date). Whether the update is useful or not, I want it off my computer because it was running better before hand. And its not exactly crashing, its not blue screening or anything like
 that. Its simply rebooting in the middle of whatever I'm doing after the screen and mouse and everything freezes up for about a minute.

            Having thought about it, assuming that your XP System Restore is not afflicted, you could choose to restore your system to a date prior to the installation of the updates.&nbsp; System Restore does not know or care about any of your personal files/folders but
 it would undo any other XP related changes.<br />
<br />
I have never used System Restore (except for practice), so maybe somebody else will have some more thoughts about that idea.<br />
<br />
From Internet Explorer, you could also choose Tools, Windows Update and review your update history.<br />
<br />
Then you could see the updates that have been installed on the date of suspicious (make a list), go to Add/Remove Programs, click the "Show updates" box at the top of the screen to reveal the KB updates and from there you could uninstall them (from the list
 you made before).<br />
<br />
Before uninstalling them all, you may want to tell us the updates you installed and maybe somebody can help see what might be wrong.<br />
<br />
Windows Update also takes a look at your hardware and sometimes offers driver updates and the like and it is generally not a good idea ot install any driver updates offered by Windows Update and get them instead from your hardware vendor (like your video card
 for example).<br />
<br />
Maybe you got some "bad" driver updates or something.&nbsp; Perhaps Microsoft thought you needed some hardware driver you really didn't need or had already updated some other way.<br />
<br />
If your system is rebooting, it sounds like you should be getting a BSOD and maybe your system is not set up to display that when it happens, but you can change that.<br />
<br />
If you want to try to figure out what is going on, do this:<br />
<br />
Please supply more information about your system.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
msinfo32<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste back here.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
There would be some personal information (like System Name and User Name) or whatever appears to be only your business that you can delete from the paste.<br />
<br />
XP is set up to automatically reboot on some system failures, so you need to disable that feature so the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) information will stay on the screen for you to see it.&nbsp; You should also configure XP to create a small memory dump file for
 each BSOD so you will have a crash dump file to look at later if more debugging is needed.<br />
<br />
If your system crashes later, the information you need will still be on the screen and then you can use the information in the memory dump files to figure out what the problem is and fix it.<br />
<br />
Disable Automatic restart on system error <br />
<br />
XP automatically restarts on a system failure, so configure your system so it doesn't do that, then you can see the error message.<br />
<br />
Configure your system to not automatically restart on system failure <br />
<br />
Right click My Computer, Properties, Advanced, Startup and Recovery Settings.<br />
<br />
In the System failure section:<br />
<br />
Put a check mark in the "Write an event to the system log" box<br />
Put a check mark in the "Send an administrative alert" box<br />
Uncheck the "Automatically restart" box<br />
<br />
In the Write debugging information section, choose:<br />
<br />
Small memory dump (64 KB)<br />
<br />
Set the Small dump directory to:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Click OK, OK to save the settings.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and then wait for the next restart/crash.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 - Upgrade from not genuine, or full install&#63; How to preserve programs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When my ex built my computer last fall, he installed a copy of Windows 7 Ultimate that he got from a friend. It is my understanding that it was supposed to be one of those multiple-use copies (if there is such a thing?). Unsurprisingly, it shows up as not
 genuine. I would like to fix the problem, and am looking for the <strong><em>best</em></strong> way to do that. I am a student, and therefore eligible for some discounts, but it looks to me as though that only applies if you are buying an upgrade from XP or
 Vista. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions are these: </p>
<p>1) Can I buy an Windows 7 upgrade and fix the problem that way, or do I need to buy a full version?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) What is the best way to go about this without losing my programs and settings? Is it even possible?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) I purchased Office Enterprise&nbsp;2007 (the student version) and loaded it on this computer last year, and it works fine right now, but if I upgrade or have to change Windows, will it let me reinstall? I'm worried that it was good for one install only.&nbsp; I
 hope this is clear enough, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My questions are these: </p>
<p>1) Can I buy an Windows 7 upgrade and fix the problem that way, or do I need to buy a full version?
</p>
<p><strong>You need a full version license. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer
 use the software you upgraded from.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A work around, you could purchase a second hand genuine copy of Windows XP Home edition or Vista Home Basic and use it as a base qualifying license with your Student Discount just to get the machine in compliance. You can check sites such as Ebay
 or Amazon.com. Please note, you need a full version of either Vista or Home Basic.
</strong></p>
2) What is the best way to go about this without losing my programs and settings? Is it even possible?
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Your best option would be to purchase a full version of Windows 7 Ultimate, other wise, you will need to backup and do a custom clean install. If you are able to afford Ultimate edition, you can do a repair upgrade over the current non-genuine installation:</strong></p>

<p><strong>or you can try downgrading your edition to Windows 7 Professional, purchase Windows 7 Professional under the Student Discount, then do a repair upgrade.

<p><strong>Yes, you can always reinstall it and reactivate by telephone if necessary. Office 2007 Enterprise is a volume license distribution though, so it should not require activation.

<h2>            Acer Laptop&#58; Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause&#63;</h2>
                    I have an Acer 5516 Laptop that has a Windows Error Recovery. It says:<br />
Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:<br />
1. Insert your Windows installation disc &amp; restart your computer.<br />
2. Choose your language settings, and then click "Next."<br />
3. Click "Repair your computer."<br />
<br />
Other options:<br />
If power was interrupted during startup, choose Start Windows Normally. (then it lists out more options) Safe Mode, Safe Mode with Networking, Safe Mode with Command Prompt, Last Known Good Configuration, &amp; Start Windows Normally.<br />
<br />
I've selected EVERY option, but none works &amp; each option takes me to another page that reads:<br />
<br />
Windows Boot Manager<br />
Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause to fix the problem: etc.<br />
<br />
I went to the technical support at the store I purchased my laptop from, &amp; they told me to buy a hard drive enclosure so I could take out my important files before recovering my laptop.<br />
<br />
I also downloaded the Windows recovery 32 bit from here:(<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vi…</a> because my laptop DID NOT COME with a Vista recovery disc;
 however; my laptop refuses to recognize the disc &amp; I'm back to square one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me figure out how to recover my laptop through another source? I thought I followed the directions that the site provided, but I don't understand why my computer is not undergoing the recovery procedure. )=<br />
<br />
Please help me! Thank you!

<p><span>The computer is no boot situation and you have to boot the computer from Windows recovery environment, but as the DVD/CD

    <title>Hello DISK CHECK is taking forever. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hi im a person.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hello DISK CHECK is taking forever.</h2>
                    <p>A few different problems but im asking this one first.</p>
<p>I have a laptop with windows 7, the hardware is Hewlett Packard pavilion&nbsp;dm4-3050us.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>for the past week or so whenever I restart my computer, which I do a lot because: although I put it into hibernate mode most times, 1/3rd of the time it fails to recover and I have to restart the thing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>whenever I do now for the past week there is the disk check. I have tried it a few times.&nbsp; when it first came up it made almost no progress and I didn't feel like waiting so I restarted and next time skipped it. I have been skipping it since then because
 I haven't had time to sit and wait I figured id do it when I had the time. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>now today I downloaded two programs and then in the next 30 minutes I received a call from the campus computer station saying that they have detected a virus on my computer. they said don't worry just run a scan and then take a screen shot of the final results
 and send it to us.&nbsp; I started the scan but had to go and when I came back I had to restart the computer I don't know if the scan finished or not but I doubt it. P.S. I individually scanned both&nbsp;programs and nothing was found. Norton anti virus also found nothing
 when it scanned them prior to download.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>now I tried doing the scan again, but the computer was freezing up and lagging like crazy so I again had to restart, and the disk check comes up and I try it</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>and it is insanely slow.&nbsp; I cannot tell you exactly what it said because it isn't running but I know it said NTFS scanning or something. on C: drive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It was on part&nbsp;1 of 4, and was 1% through.&nbsp; it would scan the first 54000 or so parts and then would stop and start slowly going up one at a time. it says it is unreadable or something I think I cannot exactly remember.&nbsp; I calculated that each one took about
 13 seconds and if the rest took that long I calculated the scan would take 38 days which is crazy.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So im not sure what the problems are, but I cannot wait 38 days or anything close to that amount because I need to do assignments tommmorow.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So why is this disk check taking so long, what can I do, and is it possibly related to any other problems im having.&nbsp; I am not a computer expert or even close. thanks A lot peoples.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>EDIT: P.S. Each time I run dskchk the number it is stopping at is lower and lower by like 2 to 5 thousand each time.&nbsp; Does this mean this disk is getting more and more corrupted? thanks.<br />
</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t log in to computer with Windows 10, wrong login email coming up for login credentials</h2>
                    I had an unusual problem come up after Windows 10 installed on my computer. I didn't realize that Windows 10 would force me to use it as a login. Also, when the login screen comes up, it has the login user email account&nbsp;misspelled and keeps coming up invalid
 password when I type in password. Yet, Microsoft 10 still recognizes my other email when I reset my password (on the site). So, needless to say, I'm locked out of my computer and can't get back to how I signed in before. Does anyone have any advice? Is there
 a valid tech&nbsp;help line to go to. I talked with someone for half an hour on the support line (800 number), but it didn't resolve anything. I was told to back up files and reinstall Windows 10 with a computer technician. The login screen is not letting me change
 or correct the username, and so I'm locked out of computer. Sorry for the complicated post, but any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

            Hello, thanks for the reply. What I mean by the wrong email address is that I had never had to go through Microsoft 10 to log in before but suddenly after starting up my computer was forced to, but the email they had under the username has the right email
 name but misspells yahoo as yhaoo and I am trying to figure out a way to be able to edit the login username&nbsp;so I can get in (I had set up a profile but somehow they didn't recognize it when I called). I had Microsoft&nbsp;7 before 10&nbsp;but never actually remember
 setting up account/profile etc for Windows 10. Does Windows 10 just automatically install because I never remember actually asking to install. Before this happened, I was being prompted to complete my profile (under my notifications on computer). I'm not sure
 if this is a hack job or what is going on. I used another login to get into computer before. I guess I'm trying to reset my computer to get back to how I logged in prior to Windows 10 and maybe reinstall 10. Or at least s

<p><span>What type of user&nbsp;account was there in windows 7 prior to the update? Was it an admin account?
<br />
I suggest you to try going to safe mode and if you are successful you can back up your data and perform a clean install of windows 10.
</span><span>Safe Mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts
 Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>

 this work? If not, what fix can I do? At the moment, I am back on 8. Thanks!

            Thanks for the help, Krishna, but that's not exactly what I mean. I'm speaking on the update from Windows 8 to Windows 10 through the Microsoft given app. I've heard there are outdated files/drivers on my PC that interfere with Windows 10. I'm more asking
 how to prevent this from happening.
