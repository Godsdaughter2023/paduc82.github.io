<h2>            Problem with my controller.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. Today I bought a new wired black controller. I started playing Halo Reach with it and noticed that the right analog stick (which is used to look around in Halo) seems to be slightly broken. If I push it to the left it works fine. But when I push it to
 the right, my character looks around noticeably slower to the point where it effects my gameplay.</p>

<h2>            How to remove the Windows 8.1 files&#63;</h2>
                    I decided to install Windows 8.1 on my personally built Windows 8 desktop. I tried to update twice but it gave me the error code: 0x80070006 - 0x2000C. Anyways, after trying twice the system reverted back to Windows 8 and both attempted installs are taking
 up 15 GB of my SSD. Is there any method/ pathway people could give me to remove these pesky files?

<p>Guess this is as good a place as any...<br />

I've got a Monitor Audio A100 "integrated amplifier," commonly used as a receiver, which has a simple IR remote. Tried to set it up as a receiver, but despite the Xbox One knowing the Monitor Audio brand, it didn't know what to do with the model. Not sure if
 requests are taken, but if they are, I would like to request that this model make it into the next batch/update for receiver support.</p>
<p>If it helps, emailed Monitor Audio and they said the IR codes are as follows (in the context of setting up with a universal remote)...</p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer continuously stops working and restarts</h2>
                    I have a Dell desktop running Vista Home Premium, 32 bit.&nbsp; I caught a virus from Facebook (the video) last week.&nbsp; I had my system protected with MacAfee VirusScan, but it didn't stop it, nor could it find it to fix it afterwards.&nbsp; So, I&nbsp;used MalwareBytes
 to find and fix it.&nbsp; All seemed well for a day or so.<br />
<br />
I was burning a video and also a LightScribe disc label when my system crashed.&nbsp; A box pops up saying that "Windows Explorer has stopped working", with the 2nd line saying it is checking for a solution.&nbsp; Then, that box disappears and another comes up saying
 "Windows Explorer is restarting...".&nbsp; After about 10 minutes, my DVD software crashed, so I had to reboot.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Everytime I reboot, I get this same thing popping up.&nbsp; It's constant - Windows restarts 5 to 8 times a minute.&nbsp; I can run very few items since every time it crashes, I lose my Start menu.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I tried to restore to a few days before virus, but no luck.&nbsp; I tried a start-up repair, including from my Dell installation CD, but no luck.&nbsp; Have tried using msconfig to shut down all start-up programs, still no luck.&nbsp; Starting up in Safe Mode even has these
 errors constantly popping up.&nbsp; I uninstalled VirusScan, no luck.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp; I thought about a fresh install, but hate the thought of losing everything.&nbsp; I've even considered using this as a time to upgrade to Windows 7 if that might work.&nbsp; Appreciate any help someone can give me.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Which media/audio player are you using to play the file?<br />
2. Is this issue restricted to this particular file or all the mp3 files that you open?<br />
3. What is the source of the file? From where did you download it?<br />
4. Did this file ever played successfully on this computer?</p>
<p>Try playing this file in Windows Media Player and check what happens. May be another third party application is causing the conflict with Windows Media Player.<br />
I would ask you to perform a clean boot to find the conflicting program. Refer to the article below which explains the clean boot troubleshooting.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - Audio Device<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
If your driver shows 06 you have the windows default and that is part of the issue.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and get latest Sound/Audio drivers - Download - SAVE - go to where you<br />
put them - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN - Reboot <br />
<br />
Check the Version on Driver's tab in Device Manager as often sound drivers rollback and then finally install<br />
the current version. Reboot and check after each try, not unusual to have to run the driver 1-4 times or so.<br />
Just make sure the version you installed shows up in the driver's tab.<br />
<br />
Then go to Device Maker's site and look for even newer drivers and repeat install procedure.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After updating driver.<br />
<br />
Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;Disconnected Devices
<br />
and Show Disabled Devices - check your mic - highlight them and then on lower right properties. Make<br />
sure the proper one is enabled and check other settings - on Levels tab make sure MUTE is unchecked<br />
and APPLY / OK changes.<br />
<br />
Also in Control Panel look for some Audio Manager (maybe named after sound driver maker). Mine<br />
is RealTek Audio Manager, yours can be entirely different name if you have one.<br />

    <title>Remote Desktop Users Printer Redirection Not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyhazen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Users Printer Redirection Not working</h2>
                    I recently updated our Win 2k8 R2 server running RDS with no RDG role and now my Remote Desktop Users no longer have the ability to print even though they have access to all of the printers. &nbsp;They are not able to add any devices or printers as well. &nbsp;Printer
 Redirection is also not working and there are not GPO settings and no Local GPO running on this server. &nbsp;This was working previously on Friday 2-26-16. &nbsp;If I had a user to the Adminstrators group, they can see the printers and printer redirection is fully
 functioning. &nbsp;It seems that there is a security/permission issue going on here, but not certain on where this would be for RDS to work. &nbsp;RDG is set to not use, unless I need to create the role and set the permissions due to an update? &nbsp;The client PCs are all
 running Win 7 x64 and this is affecting everyone in the Remote Desktop Users group. &nbsp;

    <title>Has anyone heard of this&#63; Boot and BIOS text is distorted. Random - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roberlenbush  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has anyone heard of this&#63; Boot and BIOS text is distorted. Random characters in BIOS and booting display are off by 2 alphabetically.</h2>
                    After a recent crash, my display is distorted during booting and in BIOS. Random charactersa are replaced by a different letter, i.e. periods are replaced with commas, "Windows" might appear as "Wildous", "restarted" as "reqtarted", and "Networking" as
 "Letuoriini".&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It looks as the characters are off by two alphabetically, C showing up as A, D showing up as B.</div>
<div>At first, I thought it was a video card error, so i updated the driver. I ran three separate Anti-virus programs (AVG, MBAM, and Hitman Pro). Nothing came up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice? I can't post hardware specs right now, as I'm posting via phone, but will provide later tonight.</div>
                </div>

            After much trial and error, it turned out that my graphics card was at fault. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The original crash took place while loading Arkham City,which has always been a bit laggy on my system. As it had been running slower than normal, I installed an updated driver for it. No improvement, except when trying to run anything that used the card
 or its installed engines, (i.e. PhysX, DirectX, or any game more complex than Minesweeper) the system would crash or generate error messages.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I ran several antivirus programs, nothing unusual came up. Biting the bullet, I formatted the drive and reinstalled Windows XP. &nbsp;The computer worked, but needed several programs reinstalled. While restoring it, the distorted letters came back on booting,
 getting to the point of not being able to get into Safe Mode without extreme distortion after starting.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Until the time it loaded with a movable cursor over static/white noise/random color.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had almost given up hope until that showed up. Since the PC started normally, it could not be BIOS or any other hardware.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My secondary fan had come unplugged, and the fan on the graphics card had stopped working. After switching over to the motherboard VGA, the distortion was gone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Final diagnosis: Overheated graphics card.</div>

    <title>Do you think 5GB RAM is enough for Xbox 1 gaming&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smileskybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do you think 5GB RAM is enough for Xbox 1 gaming&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I decided to post this to get your opinions. Last year I decided to get and try Toy Soldiers War Chest on Xbox 1. One day when I played it, Xbox 1's Dashboard brought up a Critical Error message on the screen error code [something] ran out of memory, once,
 when in the middle of a game.</p>
<p>Last year I got a new PC, HP ab222TX with intel core i5 6200U processor 8GB RAM and Windows 10. It can play The Sims 4 on High Settings (with a bit choppy frame rate but I it plays it OK on High settings) and I checked task manager and it uses roughly 4.3GB
 memory. I played Cities Skylines on LOW everything settings and it uses 5-5.8GB memory. And the game developers for Cities Skylines are bringing the game to Xbox 1, though release date is TBA. I decided to get a new PC because late 2010 my old PC even though
 it meet the minimum/recommended specs, kept on crashing when playing The Sims 3 so chose to game on Xbox rather than fork out money for an expensive gaming PC. I just wanted The Sims 4 real bad so went for my new PC.
</p>
<p>But what are your opinions? Do you think 5GB memory which Microsoft allows is enough for future games and games currently, on Xbox 1?, or do you want them to role out an Update to allow 6GB (or if you're really desperate, 7GB) of memory for the console,
 to be allowed for gaming, instead of allowing the system to&nbsp;dedicate&nbsp;3GB RAM, since Xbox 1 has 8GB RAM. Xbox 1 has a faster UI now with the Windows 10 like UI, and I'm on my PC and it's using 2.6GB RAM while doing very little from task manager (I'm just using
 IE on&nbsp;it right now to write this post). I'd say the game developers for Cities Skylines would have to be smart if they're bringing it to Xbox 1 if Xbox 1's operating system only allows 5GB RAM for gaming, when I play it on my PC on low settings and it goes
 over 5GB memory (sometimes it uses 6.2GB RAM but normally it's in the 5s). </p>

<p>If,if,if,if.....I guess, 6 GB won't be enough.</p>
<p>Microsoft is suppose to know what to do and when to do it.They are also in direct discussion with devs and their needs....</p>
<p>What i think ? 5 gb is enough right now,didn't even know or care how much ressources it use.Maybe because i'm a console gamer.</p>

<p>The is a difference between pc and console where ram is concerned. When a dev makes a game for Pc, they are making a game that has to run on many different combinations of hardware, so you are likely to see games use more resources on pc because the game
 isn't optimised for a specific hardware combination.</p>
<p>On console it's the opposite, the devs know exactly what hardware will be used and optimise the game as best they can.</p>
<p>8GB for Pc really isnt enough anymore, for console it's fine.</p>

<p>I think 5GB would be enough too. But I did have an experience when playing one game (see above post) where the Xbox 1 Dashboard brought up an error notification while in the middle of playing a game "Critical Error" ran out of memory or not enough memory.
 Maybe it was a glitch or perhaps the game decided to try and use 5.1GB+ and the OS stopped it or something. It's good there's at least some collaboration with them and game developers and their needs. Maybe it is more resourceful for them to allocate 5GB for
 games and 3GB RAM dedicated for the system. </p>

<p>When we saw the trailers for "Deus Ex" on the XBox 360 many people wondered if the console would be able to run it and question if it would actually look like the advertised trailers.</p>
<p>Just as the ONE was launching they released a "Complete Edition" of the game and the graphics actually look dated.</p>
<p>Don't be surprised if Microsoft Surprise you again.</p>

<p>The amount of RAM available is irrelevant, there is only so much RAM can be used at any one time, Usual around 4gb. Plus with the weak GPU in the xbox you can have as much RAM as you want and it wouldn't make any difference. There is only so much RAM that
 can be pushed through. </p>
<p>On a lighter note AMD look to be Improving the next xbox by using Polaris architecture which will be about x4 better than the *** we got this time round. And i my opinion will launch a lot sooner than people think. &nbsp;

<p>Whatever the limits are, it's not long before the demands placed upon them will exceeds it, and thats fine. Only trouble is. With consoles you can't upgrade anything so games has to maintain the set limits.

<p>Fort that very reason I would have chuckled at you if you'd told me that I would be playing the sequel to "Oblivion" on the XBox 360.</p>
<p>However that's what happened.</p>
<p>Also on it's release the XBox ONE was a less powerful machine than the Playstation 4.</p>
<p>However it has come out that the XBox ONE is able to increase it's processing power exponentially using The Cloud making it the most powerful console on the market.</p>
<p>Even in the face of Microsoft having actually done these things already you've still got people in the forums here and now who seem to think they are impossible to do.</p>
<p>A bit like those young teenagers in Electronics Boutique insisting that the "Soul Calibur" demo running on the TV in store had to be running on a Playstation and even trying to convince the employees in the shop that this was the case.</p>

                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We have seen and read many post and discussion about up coming windows 10 upgrades and clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Question is, how do we obtain the product key after upgrade {in-case we format and need to do a
<strong>clean installation</strong>}?</p>
<p>
</p><p>or, we do not need to enter the product key to activate? will it activate automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, we are told that a copy will be available for those reserved, will the key come along with the download? do we not need to enter the product key while or after installing the windows in order to activate the windows? or what is the whole story about
 this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can some one help me please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also how to upgrade an Enterprise Version?</p>

            VL_mem10----You can keep checking the task bar on Get Windows 10 app or wait for the pop-up notification from the task bar. When I reserved my copy of Windows 10 on July 26, 2015, I got the notification three days later. Not sure if they will be so prompt-to-do-it
 in three days for you, but it happened for me in three days. I just left my computer on for several days until I got the notification. I made sure that for during that time, my computer never went into hibernation and that the display never sleeps, as well
 under Power Options in the Control Panel. Hope this helps.

VL-mem10---As long as the version of Windows you upgraded from was a retail purchase and not an OEM or other non-qualifying Windows version, Windows 10 should transfer its licenses to your new machine or repaired machine. Just make sure that you don't download
 anything or replace a part on your machine without calling the manufacturer to ensure that you are not violating any support or warranty agreements, if applicable.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, when you upgrade and get your system loaded the way you want with Windows 10 upgrade, consider getting Paragon or something like it to create a good, clean image of your machine so that in case anything like what you described happens, all you have to
 do is run the image right back onto your machine without any headaches or hiccups. :)

</p><p>This is the part that I am lost with your answer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a retail Window 7 specifically because I needs the flexibility of&nbsp; upgrading my PC without losing the OS in the same way as those OEM version.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a gamer and upgrading my PC consistently i.e changing the motherboard or CPU or experiencing new
 SSD for the extra frame rates as soon as new one come out.&nbsp; So, if I taken the free upgrade to window 10, meaning that whenever I upgrade my hardware, then I have to 'transfer' the Window 10 OS ?&nbsp; How ? calling the MS support which may take forever long ?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I paid the extra for a retail version of the OS because I want the process to be painless! Can't Microsoft simply gives me a window 10 product key as a swap ?</p>
<p>

            <div>Alex &amp; Chiippy- When you upgrade your hardware, being that you do have a retail license for Windows 7, it will transfer. Doing it the long way, you would have to reinstall Windows 7 then upgrade it to Win 7 with SP1 with Windows Update. Or you can get
 the Stand Alone SP1 download from the MS site. However, it must be reinstalled within the time frame of July 29, 2015 thru July 29, 2016. That's the kicker there.
<br />
<br />
That is why it is important to go to http://paragon.com and purchase their imaging software. Once that year has passed, then it will not be free to upgrade to Windows 10 from 7 if you change your hardware.<br />
<br />
Paragon will make an image of your system with Windows 10 and everything you have installed on it. It must be backed up to an external drive large enough to hold everything on your system. If you have to do another hardware upgrade, especially hardware that
 functions in a Windows 10 environment, then all you would have to do is restore the image back to your hard drive and it would be as if you never skipped a beat. Everything would be restored back to Windows 10 because that is the image that Paragon created
 in order to restore your system.<br />
<br />
This is a much shorter route to restoring or transferring Windows 10 rather than starting over with Windows 7, updating to SP1 and then having to wait again for the Get Windows 10 app. It's a straight shot to restoring your machine again each time you upgrade
 hardware. That is the beauty of Paragon. With each upgrade of your hardware, you would make a new image of your system which will copy Windows 10 and all of your files, settings, programs and apps without any issues.<br />
<br />
Starting again from Windows 7 after a hardware upgrade, will find you reinstalling everything, one by one on your system. If you choose to start over again from Windows 7,&nbsp; you would have to update it to SP1, as mentioned before. Be sure to activate Windows
 7 after reinstallation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or you can&nbsp;use the Media Creation Tool from the MS site to reacquire Windows 10 to reinstall&nbsp;it. It will prompt you for your product key. You will use the product key from your Windows 7 packaging so that it will attach to the new
 Windows 10 installation. Just be sure that Windows 7 is activated before continuing the update to SP1, whether you get the new Windows 10 again from the Get Windows 10 app or the Media Creation Tool.<br />
<br />
I hope this makes sense. Feel free to clarify any answers you need to anymore questions you may have.</div>

            <p>Ok let me see if I got that right.&nbsp; If I want to do a clean install.&nbsp; install&nbsp;a windows 10 from&nbsp; an iso and the key will be good because I have already registered the key with the first installation. Is that correct because I don't have the option of installing
 windows 7 again because it was an upgrade from vista. I was a windows insider and used the unfinished version until It crashed. I tried update from an iso on vista but it said&nbsp;I had the wrong version. So&nbsp;I installed Linux on that machine. So if&nbsp;I reformat
 the C:\&nbsp; drive.&nbsp; Did&nbsp;the preleased version of windows 10 have a legal key registered with Microsoft. If not I need to get my windows 7 back on the machine some way But my windows 7 Is only an upgrade from vista.</p>

                    My Outlook suddenly changed from showing the message to just showing a number. The deleted email is in the same form, but the sent email shows everything as it once was. I can see the message if I click on the email in the viewing box on the right-hand
 side or in a new box. I just can glance at my emails to see which one is which without opening them all up.

    <title>How to access the Clipboard when I am in Windows Explorer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> globalroamer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to access the Clipboard when I am in Windows Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    Like all Microsoft questions mine is extremely simple.&nbsp; After spending an hour with the on-line help, an hour working through the MS Community and getting no where, it seems to be time to ask my simple question.<br />
<br />
I want to access the contents of the Clipboard when I am in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; How do I do that?<br />
<br />
The only restriction MS claims is if I am in an application where I cannot copy/past I can't use clipboard.&nbsp; The clipboard icon is on the status bar.&nbsp; I click on it and select open and nothing happens.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if something worked they way MS claimed it worked.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?<br />
<br />
Many thanks!<br />

            <p>Hello.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows only remembers the last thing on the clipboard however this behaviour is different in different applications (i.e. Microsoft Word).<br />
<br />
The clipboard has evolved somewhat over the years and many applications manipulate it / handle it in their own way. In Windows you get the basic functionaility and it's up to the various applications to expand on this.<br />
<br />
There are utilities out there for example this one <a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/save-and-view-your-complete-clipboard-history-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/save-and-view-your-complete-clipboard-history-in-windows/</font></a> which run in the background and record your clipboard information but none that I know of present by default in the OS.</p>

            Hello Lawrence,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Either I didn't do a very good job of explaining the problem or you need some more experience with MS applications.&nbsp; The clipboard doesn't behave the way you describe.<br />
<br />
In MS Word 2007 the clipboard can hold up to 24 entries.&nbsp; Once an item is copied you can paste any of the 24 items, or all at once.&nbsp; If you add a 25th item to the clipboard it erases the first one and puts the 25th one in its place.<br />
<br />
When switching to different MS applications the clipboard waits on the status bar at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; All other MS applications allow you to OPEN the clipboard and use it, except for MS Windows Explorer.<br />
<br />
You cannot open the clipboard in MS Windows Explorer, but if you copy summary information from a file in MS Windows Explorer it gets to clipboard.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
My problem is that I cannot open the clipboard and use its multiple entries in MS Windows Explorer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            <p>Hello&nbsp;ViP CrIsIs,&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The spending requirement for the VIP boost to your fifth star was $175. Since your spending amount was beneath this, you did not automatically complete the offer. However, after tallying your purchases, we see that you were very, very close to completing this offer, and you can calculate this yourself from the commerce page at (<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com/</a>), keeping in mind that game consumables and subscriptions are not eligible for MyVIP.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>We will adjust your account for the missing change, and you should see your star rank promote by the end of next week. Since your purchases went towards an offer (the VIP&nbsp;Boost), they did not also award payback.</p>

<p>Hi Toothpix,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the Windows apps fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the crucial system files goes corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need at least <strong>1024 X 768 </strong>screen resolution for modern apps to work. The Windows apps will not work in screen resolution less than 1024 X 768. To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least
<strong>1366 x 768</strong>. Make sure that the screen resolution meets these requirements. You can check this by:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Right-click the mouse from the desktop interface and select <strong>
Display Settings </strong>&gt;<strong>Display</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced display </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; settings</strong>. <br />
<strong>2. </strong>Check the screen resolution shown there. It should be at least
<strong>1024 X 768</strong>.<br />
<br />
Also, make sure the <strong>User Account Control </strong>(UAC) is enabled in the computer. To enable the User Account Control on the computer follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Type "<strong>Account Control</strong>" in the search bar on desktop and press "<strong>Enter</strong>".<br />
<strong>2. </strong>In the "<strong>User Account Control Settings</strong>" window, move the slider to the
<strong>default settings </strong>and click "<strong>OK</strong>".</p>

<p>
</p><p>Having an incorrect date/time settings can cause the Windows Store not to work. To adjust your date/time settings, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Type <strong>Date and Time </strong>in the search bar and select it from the results.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Adjust the <strong>correct date and time </strong>and exact
<strong>time zone </strong>depending on your region.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Disable Proxy Connection</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Incorrect Internet settings might also block Windows Store from working.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Right click on <strong>Start</strong> and select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Select the "<strong>Internet Options</strong>" which opens up "<strong>Internet Properties</strong>" window.
</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Under the "<strong>Connections</strong>" tab click on "<strong>LAN Settings</strong>".</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Uncheck "<strong>Use Proxy server</strong>" option and check "<strong>Automatically detect settings</strong>"<strong>
</strong>and click on OK and Apply to </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save the changes.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3: Run the Apps troubleshooter.</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Run the App troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent Windows&nbsp;apps from working properly.</p>
</span>
<p><span>Click </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>here</span></span></span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 download and run the Apps troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<span><strong>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4: Reset Windows Store Cache</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, reset Windows Store to clear the Store cache. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Go to the<strong> search s</strong>creen and type <strong>
wsreset </strong><br />
<strong>2. </strong>Right click and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.<br />
<strong>3. Windows Store </strong>will open. You can now browse the Store for apps. Now try to install or update the apps or
</p>

            Vinodh, none of the solutions you listed above worked for me. I don't want to create a new Microsoft account, because everything I use is linked to my current account. At this point, none of the Microsoft apps that came pre-installed with Windows 10 will
 work. I wasn't able to run the DISM Tool either because just like the apps, it flashes on the screen for a second and then disappears. Is it possible to get rid of Windows 10 and switch back to the Windows 8 that I had before? This is ridiculous!<br />

<p><strong>Safe mode with Networking</strong> starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">below</span></strong> link to Enable Safe Mode with Networking.</p>

</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a <strong>Clean Boot
</strong>to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.

            <p>Starting in Safe Mode with Networking didn't help. I couldn't open anything - I was told that I had to log in with a different account other than the default administrator. That is the only account I have. I just tried the calendar and camera and those seem
 to be working. Others like calculator, photos, maps, and the store still won't. Here is what my "all apps" list looks like. The Microsoft apps are listed under "Other" and nothing happens when I click on them. The same for the icons on the right. Photos is
 between Microsoft Edge and Facebook.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if your user profile is corrupted, you can try to repair it. You will need to create a new profile, and then copy the files from the existing profile to the new one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to create a new user account and check whether this issue persists in new user profile.</p>
<p>Refer below article more information on creating a new user account. </p>

 that "My Documents" is now only called "Documents".)</span></span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, perform Reset the PC and check if it resolves the issue. Resetting your PC reinstalls Windows and keeps your personal files and settings. It also keeps the apps that came with your PC and the apps you installed from the Windows Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the section 'Reset your PC' from below article and follow the steps. </p>

<h2>            Problem opening kindle app on windows 10</h2>
                    I updated my Asus T100 to Windows 10 and now can't open my kindle app. It appears in the tabs bar at the bottom, and when I hover over the icon it shows me what's there but won't open open it into the screen. I tried uninstalling and re-installing the
 app, but this hasn't helped so far.

            <p>Thank you for your reply and suggestions, all three of which I tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't get any error messages trying to open the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the troubleshooter didn't solve the problem and neither did disabling my third party antivirus softward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I followed your instructions for resetting Windows Store I ended up with an MS-dos screen about which I know nothing, so exited from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end I uninstalled the Microsoft app and re-installed the Kindle for PC from Amazon. At the moment this seems to be working fine.</p>

                    <p>I've just updated my HP Pavilion with the windows 10 update.&nbsp; But upon restarting the PC initially it said that there was a problem with the hard drive and we needed to restore, however when selecting various options none of them worked. Then after a few
 attempts at restarting it now goes into the Windows login screen, and the comes up either with a black screen, or with error message that the Desktop location is unavailable.</p>
<p>The only icons showing are the Recycle Bin, Windows start, search, time and date.&nbsp; The Windows start icon does not work when I click on it so I'm not able to start in safe mode.</p>

            Hi Barrbabe, this is not a good sign . ..
<br />
<br />1803 has not been installed correctly on your system, your best and probably only option is to roll back to version 1709
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Ok thanks for your help. I'd already tried the Revert to previous version of Windows when it gave me that option originally, but it didn't work.&nbsp; So I'm now Resetting the PC and will let you know what happens.

            Sorry, this is widely reported currently. Please see the Microsoft's QA on this:

            It's still working through the reset, but once complete will the Windows 10 be up to date?

            Hi Barrbabe, when the reset complete, hopefully you will have a working PC with your files intact, as for being up to date, that last update that caused this issue will not be applied . . .
