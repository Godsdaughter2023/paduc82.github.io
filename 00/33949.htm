<h2>            A clock interrupt was not received on a secondary processor within the allocated time interval</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><strong>Sir,</strong><br />
<br />
From the previous month I have been constantly receiving BSOD's (Blue Screen Of Death), stating that :-
<br />
&nbsp;"A clock interrupt was not received on a secondary processor within the allocated time interval."<br />
<br />
Since the past two years, I had been facing a lot of issues with my PC. I am unable to overclock it for more than 4.1 Ghz and unable to push the CPU clock any further . Its not even stable while overclocked and this piece of hardware is just crafted for this
 purpose only. My intel Processor is capable of being stably overclocked upto 4.8-5.2 Ghz . I use my rig for heavy gaming. I am also unable to run the latest titles on my PC smoothly as the pc mostly freezes when overclocked . Sometimes the BSOD occurs as soon
 as I log into my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying all day to fix it but i haven't got anywhere. I have also scanned my pc for any virus or malware infections , and have already an updated BIOS for my motherboard. I have also disabled the onboard graphics and I am currently only running
 my Discrete Graphics Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also face a lot of problems when I use my Intel Onbard PC Graphics and that too when its not overclocked. Most of the time while utilizing my Intel on-board graphics, my pc freezes and i am unable to do anything on it. Unfortunately, every time I have
 to shutdown my pc directly from the power source. Even if i overclock my on board PC graphics for smoother gaming experience my PC freezes within 2-3 minutes.<br />
</p>
<p>I have also attached the minidump files<br />
Please investigate the issue quickly.</p>

</p><p>I suspect Two things</p>
<p>1-The underlying issue is probably Symantec or VBOX (VBOX was specified in one crash)</p>
<p>2-Your overclock (3502) cannot be supported and the CPU is NOT designed for it and until you stop OC you will continue to crash</p>

</p><p>I tried to verify my drivers using your method but as soon as i rebooted my pc , i am stuck with an infinite loop of PC reboots. A BSOD comes for a second and it just vanishes , I am unable to read the error message and am unable to find out the driver causing
 the problem. I am unable to log into my pc in the normal mode but everything seems to be working like a charm in the window safe mode.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I recently acquired an ASUS laptop as my old Toshiba laptop had broken. I want to update to the newest version of windows 10 but I need at least 8GB of space. I have 29.1GB of space (small,&nbsp;I know!) but I am currently using 24.5GB of space. I've deleted
 every app possible. It previously at full capacity but I managed to whittle it down by a couple of GB. I cannot think of anything to do to try clearer some space! I've got no photos, documents, videos or apps. I've compressed all the files I can, I always
 try clear us some disk space (like recommended) but that only clear around 110MB each time! I don't want to have to buy more storage just for it to be eaten up like the rest.</p>
<p>Currently my System &amp; Reserved is taking up 10.9GB. My Apps &amp; Games is taking up 1.88GB.&nbsp;My Temporary files is taking up 3.05GB (I have repeatedly tried deleting this but it doesn't change even after resetting the computer. There is also 4.63GB taking up
 the space in Other but I can't seem to clear that either.</p>
<p>Please can someone help!</p>

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            Hi Laura, even if you could save that 8GB update to an external USB drive, you still would not have enough space to install it . ..
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Graham, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            build 16299 is Version 1709, not 1803. 
<br />
<br />Code c0000005 is MS's generic way of saying "oops"! There are no specific fixes for it. 
<br />
<br />Have you check in Update History  to see if there is any other error code? 
<br />
<br />
<br />Use the following links to try to find out if your computer builder supports Version 1803 on your specific computer.  If they do, then doing Andre's suggestion of a clean install is probably the best approach

<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that. If you have been making attempts to upgrade without success, you probably need to check the manufacturers website for your computer model to find out if its compatible with the next Update &lt;/snip&gt;

<br />
<br />The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions. Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs. 
<br />
<br />As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

            Is it 3 seconds or 3 minutes.. 
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to login, 
<br />
<br />1. Run Power Troubleshooter
<br />Type troubleshoot in Cortana Search &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &gt; Click Power &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow on-screen direction.
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall / Install Battery Driver (Only for laptops)
<br />Shut down your computer &gt; Detach power chord &gt; Remove battery &gt; Attach power chord &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Batteries &gt; Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System &gt; Uninstall &gt; Shutdown the computer &gt; Remove the power chord &gt; Attach your battery &gt; Attach your power chord &gt; Reboot the computer to automatically install the driver
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Final option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

<h2>            How do I put pictures from file to folder in windows 7</h2>
                    In pictures I want to move individual picture files to a folder. &nbsp;How do I do that in a less time consuming manner than creating a folder then dragging each individual picture into it? &nbsp;400 pics take forever! &nbsp;I am a novice at this computer business.&nbsp;

            <p>Select the pictures you want to move by holding down the CTRL key while you left click on the picture.</p>
<p>If you want them all, press CTRL + A.</p>
<p>Then press the ALT key and a menu bar wil appear. </p>
<p>Select <strong>Edit.</strong></p>
<p>Then select <strong>Move to folder.</strong></p>
<p>Select the folder you want ot move them to and press <strong>Move</strong></p>
<p>Personally, I use <strong>Copy to folder</strong> and then I delete the ones I&nbsp;copied from the&nbsp;original location&nbsp;just to make sure that they are in the new location first.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

                    <p>Good Morning Gentlemen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing a quite annoying issue with my brand new Surface Pro 4 (i7 model).</p>
<p>I plugged my 4k monitor (Samsung UHD U24E590) to my Surface Docking Station using HDMI 1.4 cable (and related Microsoft adapter) but I cannot set any higher resolution than 1920*1080 on my external monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me crazy and - yes, of course, all drivers and Windows Updates are already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone knows why and how to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you could specify what do you mean by asking "<em>how to upgrade my graphic device for windows 10?</em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to a device driver update? Or do you want to upgrade your graphics device which is compatible with Windows 10 and your old Desktop PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need information on how to update drivers in Windows 10, refer to this article:
<p>
</p><p>If you need to know which graphics device is compatible with your Desktop and Windows 10, we need to consider the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which video expansion slot your motherboard supports?</li><li>Which processor <span>does your Desktop PC have</span>?<br />
</li><li>How much RAM does your Desktop PC have?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>

<p>The best you can do is to go to the website of the manufacturer of your graphics card or chip and install the manufacturer's last driver, which will not likely be supported on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that driver works properly in Windows 10, enjoy it for as long as that lasts. If/when the driver no longer works properly, you'll have to replace the graphics card or chip (if that's physically possible) with a model that the manufacturer supports on
 Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Can I use Readyboost to cover up my Sims 3 game&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have a Laptop that comes with a 2gb of Ram but i can only use up to 1.9gb of ram for something on my laptop and the Sims 3 game requires at&nbsp;least 2gb of ram. When i check the Performance score and mine was 3.4 and the required score was 3.5 which is only
 by 0.1 because of having a 1.9gb ram. Will using Readyboost coverup a little of my ram to run the game at&nbsp;the required rate(Faster)? Or can there be any other way to cover up a little of my ram without buying More RAM?

    <title>Upgrade Win 8.1 to 10, revert to 8.1, then clean install Win 10 on new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jegesq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade Win 8.1 to 10, revert to 8.1, then clean install Win 10 on new partition, same machine</h2>
                    <p>Here's the situation: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a valid Win 8.1 install (actually the path I followed was machine purchased with Vista Pro originally installed;&nbsp; then purchased upgrade to Win&nbsp;7 Home, then purchased the upgrade to Win 8 Pro for $39 (I made an ISO and then&nbsp;installed 8 on a separate
 drive).&nbsp; * was upgraded to 8.1 Pro. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Machine is currently dual boot, with Win 8.1 Pro on one drive, and Win 7 Home on second drive.&nbsp; Works great, no issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to use Win 10, but I don't want to directly overwrite my 8.1 (because I really like it and have it set up as I prefer).&nbsp; I'm also on Insider and have been using earlier builds, and have 10240 on different hardware, and I'm not completely sold yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to install Win 10 on my current dual boot machine, make it a "triple" boot, and keep both Win 8.1 and 7 installed and useable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;downloaded&nbsp;the Win 10&nbsp;ISO's&nbsp;from MS&nbsp;last night as&nbsp;soon as it was&nbsp;available,&nbsp; created a bootable CD, and&nbsp;now want to do a clean install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given my circuitous upgrade path,&nbsp; I already know that trying to clean install Win 10 on a newly created third partition (on the drive with Win 7) results in Windows not accepting any of the Win 8 Upgrade Product Keys&nbsp;(I have four of them, can't recall which
 one goes with this machine, but trying all of them says none are&nbsp;valid for this type of install).&nbsp;&nbsp; I know I can just skip inputting a product key, but I'm concerned&nbsp;that will bork my Win 8.1 or 7 install, or that I'll just&nbsp;wind up with a Win 10 that can only
 be activated by purchasing a separate license. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's what I'd like to try:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Upgrade my Win 8.1 partition to Win 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; This should not require me to input a product key and it will tie the machine to the OS, and as I understand it,&nbsp;embeds the activation of 10 directly to code in the bios or elsewhere records a hardware specific
 id of the install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately revert the new Win 10 back to Win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try a "clean" install of Win 10 again on the newly created third partition on the second drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Win 10 ID is thus tied to the specific hardware and once one upgrades a genuine 8.1 install to Win 10, you can thereafter perform a clean install of 10,&nbsp; would this also work to allow me to preserve my existing OS's and just wind up with a new "triple
 boot" situation, with Win 10, Win 8.1 and Win 7?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to contact MS support via chat and via phone, but as you can imagine, given the fact that today is the day 10 has been officially released, the lines are jammed and after waiting almost an hour for a chat, I simply gave up on that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with any ideas as to whether this will work or not? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ok I can help with that. I was facing similar type of problem. But I can help you to resolve that issue.&nbsp;As much as I came to know this far whenever you are upgrading&nbsp;from win 8.1 pro you will be upgraded to win 10 pro. and other versions will be upgraded
 to win 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>*Make sure you have downloaded the same version of windows that you want to upgrade.</em></p>
<p><em>(Home\Pro &amp;&nbsp;32bit\64bit)&nbsp;and created your bootable media.</em></p>
<p><em>*&nbsp;Then you have to turn on your system and insert your&nbsp;bootable usb then MyPC &gt; Bootable usb&gt;setup</em></p>
<p>*<em>Make sure your system should be connect to internet&nbsp;during upgrade process.</em></p>
<p><em>*Then&nbsp;choose the upgrade option and follow the instruction. then relax windows will automatically do the upgrade.</em></p>
<p><em>*Always skip to enter product key while booting* you can activate it later.</em></p>
<p>Then chq your pc whether windows is activated or not. if your pc is activated then your win 8.1 product key is converted to win 10 key.</p>
<p>if in case you are not activated then run the <strong><em>cmd.exe as admin then type
</em></strong><strong><em>slmgr.vbs /ato. </em></strong>you may need to try a few times as the activation servers were being quite hit. this will convert ur win 8.1\win7 key to&nbsp; win 10 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you are set to go. I will suggest you to use windows 10 for 2 - 3 days. then go for clean installation.</p>
<p>You will be able to reinstall windows 10 again in the future on the same pc. But if you change significant hardware changes you need to go for telephonic activation process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*<em>Make sure your win 10 is activated before go for clean installation.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>*If you get any error code(Error Code ;&nbsp;0*C004C003)&nbsp;while activating win 10 that means activation server determined that the key has&nbsp;been blocked. But don't panic it's may due to the activation server being overloaded.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>*<em>Connect to the internet before installation.</em></p>
<p>*<em>Always install newer versions os&nbsp;after installing older versions os.&nbsp;that means don't install win 8.1 after win 10. after upgrading if you need win 8.1 Both&nbsp;and win 10 then you need to install win 8.1 first then try the win 10 installation in a separate
 partition.</em></p>
<p><em>*Linux users always install Linux after windows.</em></p>
<p><em>*Do not upgrade from your win 7 home because you will be upgraded to win 10 home as you have a win 8.1&nbsp;pro version.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>*Theoretically you can have&nbsp;both the os along with win 7 home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have contacted Microsoft and the technical support team said that </p>
<p>"If your mind would change after using windows 10 after upgradation you can roll out to your previous version of windows&nbsp;within 1 month. "&nbsp;And it&nbsp;simply means that I can't use my previous version os windows&nbsp;(i.e win 8.1) after 1 month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is a possibility you may loose to access one of your os or both. So I will suggest you not to take risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using the win10 final release since 2 days&nbsp;and I am sure you will not miss win 8.1 or win 7&nbsp;after intense use of&nbsp;2 days.&nbsp;Its has all features and you will love the new&nbsp;apps.

                    <p>I have now spent the best part of 2 days trying to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many posts on the internet about this and I have tried all of the usual methods using powershell and the diagnostic tools in windows also.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the powershell commands damaged other apps, but fortunately I am now back in the situation of having everything working except Photos.&nbsp; This is immensley frustrating and Win 10 seems to waste huge amounts of my time due to it unreliability. Does
 anyone therefore have any new ideas as to how I can get Photos from being greyed out - unavailable in Apps and Features to being uninstalled so I can do a fresh install from Windows Store.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest that you perform the steps mentioned below and check if the issue occurs.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1: Run App Troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues that might prevent your apps from running, including suboptimal screen resolution and incorrect security or account settings.</span></p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>‘View All’ </strong>on the top left pane.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>“Windows Store Apps” </strong>from the list and follow the on-screen prompts for troubleshooting.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If not, try method 2.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Reinstall the Photo app</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the Photo app. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Press <strong>Windows Key + Q</strong>, and in the search box, type Powershell.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> From results, right click on <strong>Windows PowerShell</strong> and select
<strong>Run as administrator </strong>option.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage </strong>and press Enter.</p>
<p>(This command will output a long list of all installed apps containing lots of information about each app).</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage | Select Name, PackageFullName
</strong>and press Enter.</p>
<p>(This command will show only the name of the app and its PackageFullName information).</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. Select the PackageFullName information of the desired app and copy it.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage
</strong>and press Enter.</p>
<p>(This command is to remove the app from the system, replace <strong>PackageFullName</strong> with the copied information with
<strong>Step 5</strong>).</p>
<p>For example, if you want to remove <strong>Photo app</strong>, the command to remove it will be as following:</p>
<strong>
<p>Get-AppxPackage *photos* | Remove-AppxPackag</p>
</strong>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Wait till completion of the command, and check if the app is uninstalled, if not
<strong>restart</strong> the system and </p>
<p>check.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Note:</p>
</strong>
<p>If you want to uninstall the app from all user accounts, use the following command format:</p>
<strong>
<p>Get-AppxPackage -allusers PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to remove the app from any particular user account, use following command:</p>
<strong>
<p>Get-AppxPackage -user username PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
</strong>
<p>(Replace username in the above command with the correct user account name).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>8. </strong>Launch the <strong>Windows Store </strong>and <strong>reinstall the Photo app.</strong>
</p>

<h3> kta78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Media Center hdmi</h2>
                    
<p>Once tv tuner cards begin to be released with HDMI input will microsoft add hdmi support to their media center for windows 7? I'm amazed they're lagging behind in this as so much has been made for the push to digital HD content. Maybe we can get an answer
 directly from Microsoft on the topic? I'd like to know if there is in the works to add HDMI support for their media center. I know there isn't much hardware out currently with HDMI input on tv tuner pci cards. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I believe that Media Center is already provide HDMI support.&nbsp; It is relying on the tv tuner cards drivers and if the tuner card manufacturer is in integrating correctly into Media Center, not sure what else can be done?</p>
<p>Also, PCI based cards are disappearing.&nbsp; They are now becoming PCI-Express (PCIe) and are not compatible with PCI slots.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 allocating Drive Letters for my External Hard Drives Then Making it Impossible To See Content. Is There A Way I Over looked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I was first introduced to Windows 10 the role played by File Explorer was quite comprehensive and could be seen as in charge of managing all of the computer's drives and storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one wanted to see all the drives, one simply quired This Computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>But things change and the upshot is the files I want to access have already been alocated drive L &amp; drive K and now there is no way I can reach those letters and external hard drives.</p>

    <title>Connect BT Keyboard During Windows 10 Setup &#40;OOBE&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john c pemberton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connect BT Keyboard During Windows 10 Setup &#40;OOBE&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to pair a Bluetooth keyboard (Microsoft Wedge Mobile Keyboard) with my PC during the out-of-box experience. I am at the first screen in the process (language select). I opened command prompt with Shift+F10 and see that BT services are available,
 I just don't know how to pair it at this point. I am hoping that I am not required to have a physically connected mouse and keyboard to set up my PC, but I cannot tell if Win10 attempts to auto discover BT devices similar to Apple's iMac out-of-box experience
 or not. Any ideas?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Skype Video Not Connecting</h2>
                    Hi I have been having problem with Skype. Its not connecting to my Webcam on my laptop. I have been having these issues more than a couple of times now. Its just stating that "Can't start video. Try closing other programmes that maybe using your webcam".
 There are no such programmes in use. Computer has been restarted multiple times and it is still having the same issue. What is happening to Skype? Looks like some others have been having similar issues with Skype now

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s the Skype version that you’re using? Please update your video driver, here’s how:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select the Start Windows logo button, type
<strong>Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards, expand the Display adapters category, right click your graphics card and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select
<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver: Open
<strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to your response.
