<h2>            Mahjong Titans Clasic layout</h2>
                    When starting a new game the top 5 tiles always contains 2 pairs without exception. This has been the case for over 700 times. I have uninstalled the game and reinstalled it.&nbsp; I can restart a new game over and over and there are always 2 pair within the
 top 5.&nbsp; Is this with every version of Vista? I do not know anyone else with Vista to check this. Thank you

<p><span>Hello,<br />
<br />
Here is what you can try:</span></p>
<p><span>First disable the game. Restart the computer and then enable the game. Check if the issue is resolved.<br />
Here is what you need to follow:</span></p>
<span>
<p>1. Turning on or off Windows Vista features can be done from Programs and Features. One of the ways to find it is to search for the word programs in the Start Menu search box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. In the <em><span>Programs and Features</span></em> window, click on
<em><span>Turn Windows features on or off</span></em>. If
<a href="http://www.vista4beginners.com/How-to-disable-UAC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>UAC (User Account Control)</span></a> is enabled you might need to make an additional confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. Now you will see a list with all the available Windows Vista features. Some features are grouped together in folders, and some folders contain subfolders with additional features. To view the contents of a folder, double-click it or click on the "+" sign.<br />
If a check box of a folder is partially checked or appears dark, then some of the items inside it are enabled and some are disabled. If a feature is checked then it is enabled already. The features that are not checked are disabled.<br />
<br />
4. For this tutorial, we will choose first to disable one of the Windows Ultimate Extras. As you can see in this screenshot, both the Windows DreamScene Preview and the final version are listed as installed. We will disable the Preview version as it is not
 needed anymore.<br />
<br />
5. Also, we would like to disable the Windows Vista Games. So we scroll up to the Games folder and deselect it.<br />
<br />
6. You can enable or disable any of the listed Windows Vista features. After you decided upon what to add or remove from Windows Vista, click on
<em><span>OK</span></em>. Windows Vista will perform the appropriate actions.<br />
<br />
<br />
7. Wait until the progress bar disappears. Then, Windows Vista might ask you to restart the computer so that the required changes will be implemented in the system.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Once restarted, enable the game again and check if everything is working fine.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards,<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click on your WordPerfect icon and select "Open File Location"...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then right click on the file that is highlighted and select Properties...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the Compatibility Tab at the top, and then check the "Compatibility Mode" check box...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select Win 7 from the dropdown list....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't help, further down there is a check box to "Run As Administrator"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to get WordPerfect 12 to work this way...</p>
<p>It required that I use XP SP3 compatibility, and Run As Administrator.</p>

            I am having the same problem. I'm also running Windows 8 and trying to run Wordperfect x6 and get the
<br />
Runtime error, "the application has requested Runtime to terminate in an unusual way." I get the same error when attempting to start Quattro and Presentations as well. I've done a "clean boot" and tried it with the same results.<br />

            I just ran into this problem on a Surface Pro 2 running 8.1 and discovered the answer at
<a href="http://www.justanswer.com/software/7qf13-downloaded-wordperect-home-student-office-x6-windows.htmlhttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this website</a>. <br />
<br />
Using the directions there here's what I did:<br />
<br />
Go into the directory<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\WordPerfect Office X6\Programs\Skins\WordPerfect<br />
<br />
and either delete or rename the file Splash.png<br />
<br />
then start your WordPerfect program<br />
<br />
it should run<br />
<br />
when you close it you should get a program update<br />
<br />
That update should fix all the programs in WordPerfect Office X6.<br />
<br />
If you don't get the update you should go to Corel to get it. But in the meantime you can perform the same actions in each of the programs subdirectory under Skins.<br />

            <p>Didn't help 8/22/2015 but Service Pack 1, Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 2 Hotfix, will make WordPerfect suite flow like warm butter. All good for X6 and should be an easy upgrade to X7.</p>

                    <p>Hello, i got a new gaming pc, a couple of months ago and for quite some time, like 3 or 4 weeks now, I have a problem where my wifi keeps cutting off for some reason. It only comes back when i click on the wifi ICON at the bottom right.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes i disable the option "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" and i upgraded the drivers. I even did a factory reset of my pc and it still happens! I have no idea why it does this and its very&nbsp;frustrating!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, i have other little bugs too, but thats not the point of this.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intermittent network connection is one possible cause of this issue. If you already changed the Wireless settings on your computer, and updated the Wireless adapter, but your computer keeps on getting disconnected from the the network, it could be that the
 there's an issue with the modem or router. To isolate this issue with the wireless connectivity of your computer, would like to gather additional details. We would like to know if you already contacted your ISP. Also, have you tried checking your modem or
 router and checked the network configuration?</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 and using Printer Redirection Port RPT1 to Ghostscript - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petercrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 and using Printer Redirection Port RPT1 to Ghostscript 32bit</h2>
                    Hi<br />
When I installed Windows 8.1 it removed a HP Laserjet printer i had manually set up with a redirection port RPT1: using Redmon / Ghostscript<br />
<br />
It then let me re-install the <span>"HP Color Laserjet 4550 PS</span>" printer and then Windows also let me re-add the redirection port RPT1:<br />
I set the RPT1 port to point to C:\gs\gs9.10\bin\gswin32c.exe and also added the required paths to the Windows Environment PATH<br />
<br />
However when I change the port from LPT1 to RPT1 for this printer it throws an error and says:<br />
<br />
"Printer settings could not be saved. This operation is not supported."<br />
<br />
This was all under Administrator level rights as well<br />
<br />
I have tried various things like uninstalling/reinstalling Ghostscript 9.10 and Redmon 1.9 but Windows 8.1 will still not let me select the RPT1: port as the port to use for this printer. I also tried it with other printers, other port numbers for RPT and the
 same problem occurs.<br />
<br />
This was working perfectly in Windows 8 so all I can think is that it is due to updating to Windows 8.1<br />
<br />
Please could you look into this and let me know?<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Peter<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
Ok, think I have fixed it.<br />
<br />
It looks like Windows 8.1 no longer allows you to use any old HP driver or other manufacturer 's printer driver in conjunction with the Redmon redirect port RPT1<br />
<br />
I got it to work by using the Ghostscript PDF printer driver that comes with Ghostscript. This unfortunately is an unsigned driver and must therefore be installed whilst booted in to Windows 8's 'allow unsigned driver mode' (option no 7 in the advanced restart
 tool)<br />
<br />
Once installed and with the redmon port selected for this printer it fully works again in Windows 8.1<br />
<br />
<br />
This still does not explain why Windows 8.1 no longer allows you to use a HP or Other driver to do this but at least it works again now<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Peter<br />

<h3> oemsoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create primary partition from extended partition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I get a HDD 500 GB with 3 partitions A, B, C, and would like to create 4 partition A, B, C, D by splitting C: drive (450 GB)&nbsp;into C (100 B) and D (350 GB),</p>
<p>once I shink the C drive into 100 GB to free space for D drive, which show green color under disk management for extended partition. After creating a new logical partition, it shows blue color, I would like to know if I delete the logical partition, would
 I be able to create a primary partition in this case?</p>

            <p>Disk structure allows for either 3 primary and 1 extended partition or 4 primary partitions. Disk Manager will normally default to the former structure when it makes new partitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Diskpart utility has more detailed control of how you can partition the disk including defining what type of partition is created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a command line utility although it runs its own shell so can be called from the run command. It has a limited help function, the "?" on its own lists the available commands with a brief description of each one. The command followed by ? will give
 more details of that single command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a very powerfull facility however does not have the same level of protections as disk manager so needs to be used with care. Google Diskpart to get links to various articles on the program.</p>

            <p>"<strong>Disk structure allows for either 3 primary and 1 extended partition or 4 primary partitions. Disk Manager will normally default to the former structure when it makes new partitions.</strong>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I simply&nbsp;delete the extended partition within Disk Manger and create a primary partition?</p>
<p>Can it be done this this way? I don't know what advantage&nbsp;having extended partition, if primary partition has bad sectors,&nbsp;would it be&nbsp;higher chance to&nbsp;make&nbsp;extended partition failed? since extended partition is created based on primary partition, on the
 other words, if I create 2 primary partitions, anyone has bad sectors, will it not effect another partition? so will it be advantage having 2 primary partitions instead of primary + extended partitions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Disk manager default to creating a 4th partition as extended that is why you would need Diskpart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a basic disk limited to 4 partitions the only way to have more than 4 drive letters was the extended partition. As older versions of DOS were&nbsp;limited to 32Mb drives disks over 120Mb needed the functionality of the extended partition.&nbsp;DOS on a 800Mb
 drive was a mess whatever way you looked at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;partition is a physical container with a start and end sector, there is no implication on another partition or logical drive when a data corruption occurs in one.&nbsp;Yes there is another layer with a logical drive as this is defined separately to the partition
 itself but this introduces no specific overhead or risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my own experience the main problem with being clever and defining a number of small partitions for different roles is sizing. Unless you know exactly what is being held in each you almost always end up with some full and others empty. The directory structure
 is much more flexible or possible consider virtual disks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disk manger supports the creation of and mounting virtual drive files. They appear as additional drive letters and can be used as disks but are files in the existing drive structure.</p>

            <p>so would it be no difference on advantage between primary any logical partition for the 4 drive?</p>
<p>I would like to know if I delete the extended partition, what will go to happen?</p>
<p>The warning message is about no longer be able to access this partition, will it become free space? so I can create a new primary partition or the partition section will be disappeared and not able to be used.</p>

            <p>If you delete the extended partition (which can only be done once there are no logical drives in it) it becomes unallocated space. You can then create a new partition in that unallocated space but as I have already said Disk Manager will only create an extended
 partition again as it is the 4th partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to use Diskpart to force the 4th partition to be primary however there is nothing stopping you allocating all of an extended partition to a single logical drive so achieve virtually the same effect as having a 4th primary partition.</p>

            <p>If your PC was supplied with 3 partitions I would suspect it also has a System Reserved partition of about 100mb with no drive letter</p>
<p>Win7 only supports 4 basic partitions</p>
<p>Since your drive is only 500gb I stuggle to find any logical reason for creating multiple partitions</p>
<p>A Win Partition of 100gb is likely to be soon filed up, leading to lack of space and failing win components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you need to use your Laptops recovery disks this will destroy any partitions you have created</p>

            <p>Your sys has the following partitions;</p>
<p>1) System Reserved (No drive letter, about 100mb)</p>
<p>2) Windows (C:)</p>
<p>3) PC Makers tools</p>
<p>4) PC Makers recovery drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Win7 only supports 4 basic partitions and you allready have 4, creating a new partition by shrinking an existing partition will convert all drives to Dynamic, then none of your PC Makers recovery partitions will function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your best option is to leave things as they are and dont fiddle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you have created the recovery disks as per your PC makers instructions, if you havent done so you should do so NOW, before you do anything else.</p>
<p>Using the recovery disks will put the PC back to factory condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this particular PC win consumes 137gb and that excludes the Libraries, on another win8 PC with only MS office installed 87gb is consumed (includes 10gb in the libraries)</p>

<p>Some computer makers, including Dell and HP,&nbsp;put a recovery partition on the hard disk of new computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;By pressing a special key combination when the computer starts, you can use the recovery partition to restore the computer to the way it was when it
 was new.<br />
<br />
If that's what your computer has,&nbsp;there's nothing wrong, and you don't have to do anything.&nbsp; Windows 7 has assigned a drive letter to the recovery partition, but nothing in the system will access it, and it doesn't matter that it's almost full.<br />
<br />
I recommend that you remove the drive letter from the recovery partition:<br />
<br />
1. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button.<br />
2. Type <strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> box and press<strong>Enter</strong> .<br />
3. In the<em> Disk Management</em> window, right-click the recovery partition.<br />
4. Click <strong>Change Drive Letter and Paths</strong> .<br />
5. Click <strong>Remove</strong> .</p>
<p>The recovery partition will still be available if you need to restore your computer.</p>

 model, type of processor, amount of memory, disk size, amount of free disk space, etc.&nbsp; Someone should be able to help.

                    I just installed a second monitor on my desktop pc. My original monitor is connected via HDMI. My second monitor is connected via VGA. Windows 10 automatically detected my additional monitor and set it up with the correct settings for best picture EXCEPT
 for one thing. My original monitor has been designated as Monitor 2 and my add-on monitor is now primary (1). How do I change it back so my original monitor is designated 1 and my add on is designated 2?

            Neither method in the link you sent me worked. When I click on the monitor designated as 2 using settings the make this my primary monitor is grayed out with a check mark in it but it is still listed as the secondary monitor when I go to advanced settings
 and it operates as a secondary monitor. I have an Intel graphics card not an invidia. When I go to the settings for the graphics card it shows that the monitor I want to be primary ISD PRIMARY but that does not agree with the settings data. Further I cannot
 get the same screen background to show up on the two monitors i am getting two different images and can't get those to be the same either.

<p>I solved the same problem with my&nbsp;"HP Compaq 2710p" with "lntel(R) Wireless WiFi Link 4965AG" trough these steps:</p>
<p>

<p>3 -&nbsp;I opened&nbsp;Properties of&nbsp;"lntel(R) Wireless WiFi Link 4965A" </p>
<p>4 -&nbsp;Then Power management</p>
<p>5 - At this point I "unchecked" the box from “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power”.</p>
<p>6 - Then&nbsp;I saved everything clicking&nbsp;"OK"</p>

            Another thing to try is to alter the advanced settings of the individual adapter (this worked for me) when you have the network connection properties open, click the "configure" button under your adapter then the advanced tab, my problem was the "radio
 on/off" was set to enabled and this sorted my problem. You may have something similar depending on the driver, or it may be called something else entirely...

<h2>            Upgrade from Windows 10 Home to Pro not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me. I brought an Acer notebook which came with Windows 10 Home preinstalled which worked fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I brought a Windows 10 Pro OEM key but the upgrade does not work. </p>
<p>I followed the usual upgrade procedure (configuration-activate-change key etc...) but nothing happens after clicking "activate" all it says is thank you for activating but no upgrade took place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other ways to upgrade my Windows version with my product key?</p>
<p>Are there tools on the Microsoft web page where I can test my product key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Michael</p>

            Hello Mike, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />As far as I know you cannot directly use an OEM key to upgrade from home to pro, you have to do a clean install to be able to use the key.
<br />Saying that you could try using the default Pro key to activate then enter the OEM key, there’s no guarantee but it’s worth a try.
<br />VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T 
<br />To enter your new key follow this advice from Andre Da Costa:
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt phone activation:

            Unfortunately, the drivers for this wireless adapter are only for Windows 8.1 and earlier. Before you try it though, do the following:
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />Select the Wireless adapter listed
<br />Right click it then click select “Update Driver”
<br />This should give you a choice of drivers - select the oldest one 
<br />Wait a few minutes while it installs the old driver
<br />
<br />If that does not work, install the following driver:
<br /><a href="http://files.ecp.toshiba.com/2016/08/19/0856/52/tc50123500e.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://files.ecp.toshiba.com/2016/08/19/0856/52...</a>
<br />
<br />Still not working...
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi Andrew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt by typing CMD in Start Search, right click result to Run as Administrator, copy and paste or type the following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Complete Guide to Managing Updates after Version 1803: <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If Updates still won't run go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 7 PC won&#39;t Start Windows normally after a crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonjordan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 PC won&#39;t Start Windows normally after a crash</h2>
                    <p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I was playing a number of games of League of Legends. Immediately upon the 5th of these games loading in, my PC crashed. (Screen froze and it just made the same sound nonstop) I left it this way for maybe 2-3 minutes or so, hoping it would just
 calm down or force itself to shut down/restart. (this has happened less severely several times in the past couple years and after waiting a few seconds to a minute it usually is fine) After it did not do this, I held down the power button to force the pc off,
 then turned it back on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to start windows normally after this, the black screen with 4 colored balls turning into a windows logo above "Starting Windows" would come up, but after a minute my screen, keyboard, and mouse would all seem to lose power/connection from the
 pc, almost as if it had shut off, but I could still hear it running. This has happened every time I try to start windows normally since. I've tried leaving it for varying lengths of minutes and up to an hour, nothing ever happens and I have to force shut down
 and try again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to start in safe mode just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't recall the exact order of what I tried, but I have done all of the following without any success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup repair (without disc)</li><li>Startup repair (with disc)</li><li>Last Known Good Configuration</li><li>Ran the chkdsk utility (this took 8 hours and indicated there were no problems)</li><li>Updated all drivers&nbsp;(in safe mode)</li><li>Scan for hardware changes (in safe mode)</li><li>System restore</li><li>MicrosoftFixit.Devices.run.exe (after running this it said something about 'hardware changes may not have been detected' or something like that)</li></ul>
<p>I performed full scans with both Malware Bytes and Trojan Remover (from in safe mode) just to be safe. &nbsp;Confirmed I had no malware/viruses of any kind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my files are backed up, but besides a few system restores (which don't seem to affect whatever is wrong) I have no other form of backup. &nbsp;I have an extensive collection of programs, many of which I can not replace without buying again, or I would
 just perform a clean reinstall of windows. &nbsp;I will not do that unless it is the absolutely only possible option. &nbsp;I've read across various forums a lot of people having similar problems, but are usually solved by one of the solutions I've listed, none of which
 have worked for me. &nbsp;Hoping some one out there can help point me in a new direction. &nbsp;Thanks in advance for any effort to do so!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking that maybe just "updating" the drivers is not enough--maybe i need to completely uninstall them, download, and install a new copy of each? &nbsp;I am just hesitant to do this because among the drivers failing to load are my processor and graphics
 card. &nbsp;I am unsure I want to do that unless someone confirms for me that it won't harm my system to uninstall those drivers completely and that it is actually necessary. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some system info:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium, SP1</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 2600K</p>
<p>8 GB RAM</p>
<p>64-Bit OS</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Jon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing a detailed information on your issue. I appreciate the step-by-step troubleshooting and the pains you took to resolve your issue. However, there are a few more steps that we can try to diagnose the root cause and check your system
 health, in order to fix the issue permanently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have mentioned that your computer works fine in <strong>safe mode</strong> then I would suggest you to perform
<strong>clean boot</strong> and check the status. If computer works fine in <strong>
safe mode</strong> it means that either some <strong>start up</strong> or some <strong>
third party application</strong> or <strong>services</strong> are causing problem which can be rectified by performing clean boot. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><span>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please do get back to us if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hello Jon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us updated about the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have attempted to update the drivers and you receive the error which you have mentioned in your post.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In the complete error after the Stop code there are 4 hex values: {Parameter 1, Parameter 2, Parameter 3, and Parameter 4}.</p>
<p><strong>Parameter 1</strong> specifies the pointer to the internal <strong>TDR recovery context</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Parameter 2</strong> specifies a pointer into the responsible <strong>
device driver module</strong> (for example, the owner tag).</p>
<p><strong>Parameter 3</strong> specifies the error code of the <strong>last failed operation</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>Parameter 4</strong> is not defined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists I would suggest you to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool.</p>
<p>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

</p><p>When running speccy as the link suggested, the following message came up immediately:&nbsp;"CPU dll init failed (error 2)! Some information will not be displayed!" &nbsp;I see it "cannot initialize SPC dll" for several key components. &nbsp;What might that indicate?</p>

<h3> anamb29  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore_Documents_Default_Location.bat  Turned my &#39;Downloads&#39; folder into  &#39;My Documents&#39; folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Win7 Pro, 64bit, SP1 system and I was trying to redirect the 'My' folders from my C: drive to another HDD.&nbsp; I accidentally directed 'My Documents' folder to my G: drive instead of the new Documentz folder ON the G: drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I searched for a solution on how to fix the situation and came across <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/18583-user-folders-restore-default-location.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>and used the .bat file for restoring the 'My Documents' folder (yes, I downloaded/ran the correct .bat) but instead of restoring the 'My Documents' folder, it turned my 'Downloads' folder into the 'My Documents folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to reestablish the 'Downloads' folder by following <a href="http://scottiestech.info/2014/11/11/repair-missing-user-folders-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
these instructions</a></p>
<p>but it did not work.&nbsp; The Downloads folder still thinks it's the My Documents folder.&nbsp; Here are some pictures from the properties menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8736af41-95f8-45a6-a9ae-b99c8a73378f" />&nbsp;
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53fa6b36-9507-4e50-bedb-fd826e173618" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also tried to change the target name on the Locations tab from Documents to Downloads, but I canceled after getting a warning to the effect, that if I proceeded with the change I would not be able to undo it, or restore the folders to a default setting
 , or something like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm hoping that someone can help me solve this issue.&nbsp; Right now things that I download end up on my desktop. I've made a copy of the few items that I had in My Documents and saved them on a different drive and then deleted what was moved by accident
 from the G: drive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ana</p>

            <p>I had this same problem, and it was very frustrating.</p>
<p>When I upgraded my iphone I knew I would have to enter the new password in order to use my personal hotspot. &nbsp;However, my computer kept trying to connect and telling me there was a connectivity problem, but at no time provided a prompt to enter a new password,
 or even recognized that the problem was an incorrect password, and there was no way to enter the new password.</p>
<p>NONE of the overly complicated suggestions helped AT ALL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How I got around it: &nbsp;I changed the personal hotspot password on my new iphone to the same password that my old iphone had. &nbsp;I just changed the password to the old one, since AT NO TIME does the prompt or possibility of entering a new password become possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have access to your old password, I'd suggest you do the same. &nbsp;In the meantime, maybe the BRILLIANT minds involved in programming consider allowing users to change the personal hotspot passwords since we are ENCOURAGED to constantly upgrade our devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            Had the identical problem. The suggestion to change the name of the iPhone would work but there is a better solution: on your Windows 8.1 device, click on the wifi icon in settings, go to "View Connection Settings" and click on "Manage known networks".
 Choose to "forget" your cell phone hotspot and then restart your computer. In the mean time, turn off your phone hotspot and turn it back on after your computer boots. Your iPhone wifi should be visible and when you try to connect, it will now prompt you for
 your new password. MS doesn't make anything easy and they don't even understand the simple things, like this.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi Jennifer, please find below my replies to your queries:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1) When I click on the program icon to get it started it just hangs after displaying the logo with the sentence "please wait while wmdc start,s" or something to that effect and then the logo disappears and nothing
 happens; and this is irrespective of the PDA being connected or not connected when I click to start; the Device Manager and the controller properties claim that the device is working correctly, and, when the PDA is connected, a "Windows CE device" appears
 in the Control Panel under "Hardware and Devices"</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2) I tried to uninstall and re-install several times as I thought, at first, that this might be a problem caused by an incomplete installation of Office or another program causing *.dll issues. Indeed, the first
 couple of times trying to start WMDC brought to the screen messages concerning missing *.dll files (which were not missing, and which I downloaded and re-installed, just in case they had become corrupted) and concerning the need to make "Outlook" my default
 mail program (even though it was already so defined). I found out that there was an incomplete Adobe Acrobat installation that I finished, then I re-installed Office (using complete repair). The messages disappeared when I start, but it now has become impossible
 for me to uninstall both WMDC and the driver update program. When I try to do that from the Control Panel the driver update refuses to uninstall. Uninstalling the WMDC itself is possible, but not "repairing". For WMDC, in both cases I get the message that
 Outlook cannot process whatever it needs to.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3) Given the above, what kind of a screenshot would you like me to send?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for your attention.</span></span></p>

    <title>ACDSee 12 Installation. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john j. christeson  say:</h3>
<h2>            ACDSee 12 Installation. </h2>
                    I have purchased ACDSee 12 to edit photos and cannot install. Their experts have have tried to help, but it appears that it is a Windows 7 problem that prevents installation. I uninstalled Norton 360 and still couldn't install ACDSee 12. What is the problem
 as I am informed that this product is compatible with Windows 7. I have successfully installed this software on Windows XP.<br />
Please advise.

<p>Hello John J. Christeson,</p>
<p>ACDSee Photo Manager 12 and Canvas 12 are listed as compatible on the ACDSee website. I am not sure what version you are using.<br />
Products that installed successfully on Windows XP and other operating systems may not meet the requirements to install on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
What is the error message that you are getting when trying to install? <br />
You might try to go to the setup.exe or .msi right click and select "Run as Administrator".<br />
<br />
When you uninstalled Norton 360 did you uninstall using Control Panel then going to Programs and Features or did you use the Norton Removal Tool?<br />
If you don't use the Norton removal tool some entries can be left in the registry and could be causing a problem.<br />

here for a link to the Norton Removal Tool</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t reinstall Windows 10 -- Key doesn&#39;t work. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mauriciocarneiro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t reinstall Windows 10 -- Key doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>I had upgraded my genuine Windows 7 to Windows 10 in 2015 when it was free to do so. After I moved houses, my hard drive failed, so I had to purchase a new drive and reinstalll from scratch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Windows7 DVD to perform the installation but when I tried to upgrade to Windows 10, I am stuck at the "Product Key" window. I have tried entering my Windows 7 key, but it does not accept that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I lose my Windows 10 because of the hardware failure? I thought the system would recognize my Windows 7 key.<br />

<p>You should use the Media Creation Tool if you are starting from the Windows 7. The reason why you are getting that prompt is because Windows 7 is not activated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>Select the option&nbsp;<span>Upgrade this PC now</span>&nbsp;if you want to upgrade right away, of if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable copy on a USB thumb drive, choose&nbsp;<span>Create installation media for another PC&nbsp;</span>then

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; A new option has been added to the setup screen for users reinstalling Windows 10 on a previously installed and activated system. If your system has a Digital License attached to it, Windows 10 will automatically upgraded:

<p><a href="https://content.invisioncic.com/r266649/monthly_2016_08/57a8a3190727f_Step1-Copy.png.f19ef0ff105fc3330d1327ab33b6f5db.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Enlarge image"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fcontent.invisioncic.com%2fr266649%2fmonthly_2016_08%2f57a8a3190727f_Step1-Copy.png.f19ef0ff105fc3330d1327ab33b6f5db.png" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another option is to perform a direct clean install:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key
</span></span><span><span>you already own</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
