<h2>            win 10 product keys and iso d&#47;l</h2>
                    does anyone know how the product keys for insiders will be sent? email to our MA? or some other? also can we use the same iso to do clean installs on each machine with its own key or do we need to d/l the iso for each machine we have the preview build
 on? tomorrow is the big day.

<p>unfortunately, I am an insider so upgrading through updates is Not what I asked about. I want to know about the key insiders receive for testing win 10 and the d/l of the iso to do a fresh install of the insider previews of win 10, not upgrading from 7 or
 8.1.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I am in the same boat (having the same issue) as willywonker1. I was a participating Windows Insider. I started with Windows 10 Preview fbl_impressive build 10130 and used the 10130 ISO to install it. Even though they had product keys for the 10130 I was
 never asked for it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while I was later updated to 10159, 10162, 10166 then for the last two weeks or so th1 10240.
<strong>My preview versions were all activated.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Today July 29th, 2015 I downloaded the final 10240 ISO and wanted to do a clean install of Windows 10 (final) that was being released to the masses today but remain an Insider.&nbsp; I downloaded the ISO and burned it to dvd using the updated Media Creation Tool
 that Microsoft provided us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After everything was completed and Windows 10 (final) was installed I realized it was the real version of Windows 10 (no Insider/preview build access). So I went to the Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update&gt;Advanced Settings and rejoined the "Get Insider
 builds" section.&nbsp; It took a few times to do this because after the first reboot I was shown the "Fix Me" button and it took two more "fix-me's" and reboots before it kicked in and let me choose "Fast Ring" again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the thing is my copy of Windows 10 is no longer activated and I am unable to activate it anymore and therefore I can no longer personalize my setup anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that when the next build comes down the pipe that after I update to that, that the activation will kick in automatically.&nbsp; I hope this happens else I am S.O.L until Microsoft does something.</p>

<p><em>Windows Insiders running the Windows 10 Insider Preview (Home and Pro editions) with their registered MSA connected to their PC will receive the final release build of Windows 10 starting on July 29th. This will come as just another flight. I’ve gotten
 a lot of questions from Windows Insiders about how this will work if they clean installed from ISO. As long as you are running an Insider Preview build and connected with the MSA you used to register, you will receive the Windows 10 final release build. Once
 you have successfully installed this build, you will also be able to clean install on that PC from final media if you want to start over fresh."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice this part? --&gt; "<em><strong>you will also be able to clean install on that PC from final media if you want to start over fresh."</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If we are running the Insider Preview build and are connected to our Microsoft Account we can do a clean install from the final media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me that implies that as an Insider running the preview builds, that after I was on build th1 10240, that on or after the 29th of July, I can use the final media to do a clean install and afterwards remain in and still be a part of the Insider Program
 with an Insider "Activated" copy as I had before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else interpret what Gabe Aul said the same way I did?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I think Gabe Aul doesn't even know how this whole system actually works because it did not work out like he said nor implied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am supposedly back in the Insider Program set to Fast Ring but my Preview build is now deactivated and I can't do anything to customize/personalize my system now.<br />

<p>Go back and read Gabe Jun 22nd.&nbsp; Everything has happened to was outlined in this release.&nbsp; I have taken a lot of abuse when I simply mention his release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go read it, don't take my interpretation.&nbsp; Here is what he said -</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; You can go from W10 Preview to W10 RTM.&nbsp; That has happened.&nbsp; I just did it..</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabe said that in order to go Preview to RTM that you had to quit Insiders.&nbsp; How is that working for you?</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabe said that you could choose to do nothing on July 29th and just continue as you were on July 28th.&nbsp; You would still get the July 29th download and continue to test W10.&nbsp; How is that working out for you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to sound cruel but I have taken a lot abuse as late as today for quoting Gabe Jun 22nd.&nbsp; It has all happened as Gabe stated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also the 1st to criticize MS as being the Poster child for doing likely the worst pre-launch of an o/s.&nbsp; We have an Insider site with no MS personnel that will answer a question or squash a rumor that is just plain bunk.&nbsp; A canned answer does not cut
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to say.&nbsp; I had a fleet of W8.1 Pro's and took 2 to Insiders and followed Gabe and they are now at W10 RTM and fully swapped for my prior qualifying Product key.&nbsp; These PC's are fully W10 so why would they be in Insiders.&nbsp; I am a 100% W10 user
 and not a tester.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken a W8.1 Pro outside of Insiders and it is now fully a W10.&nbsp; I used the W10 ISO that I downloaded last night on both.&nbsp; This saves&nbsp; bandwidth since now I can just stick a USB stick into a PC and it is a full W10 in about 2 1/2 hours.&nbsp; Just no fuss,
 no fuss.&nbsp; Don't blame the message so much, blame the messenger on this one.&nbsp; I have about 4 more PC's to hit today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day.&nbsp; Perhaps I am seeking revenge for the abuse I have taken for being correct.&nbsp; W10 rocks.</p>

</p><p>I was not updating my Windows 8.1, I was doing a clean install over my&nbsp;previous existing Windows Preview on a different partition as Gabe Aul said we could. Windows 10 even as of today is in the same state as it was yesterday, buggy as hell and missing a
 lot of necessary features.&nbsp; Maybe you are happy with it, but I am not. Windows 10 is not ready for prime-time mass release. This is why I will not update my Windows 8.1 any time soon. I will continue to run test builds until I am happy with their behavior
 then I will update my main Windows 8.1 partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I did update to Windows 10 over my existing Windows 8.1 I would still want a second partition with Windows 10 Insider installed so I can continue to test the newest builds.&nbsp; You apparently don't wish to, but many of us former and present Insiders
 do.</p>

 lot of necessary features.&nbsp; Maybe you are happy with it, but I am not. Windows 10 is not ready for prime-time mass release. This is why I will not update my Windows 8.1 any time soon. I will continue to run test builds until I am happy with their behavior
 then I will update my main Windows 8.1 partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I did update to Windows 10 over my existing Windows 8.1 I would still want a second partition with Windows 10 Insider installed so I can continue to test the newest builds.&nbsp; You apparently don't wish to, but many of us former and present Insiders
 do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take your tone, your negative attiude; and "revenge" (your word, not mine) elsewhere!&nbsp; You are not helpful here in these forums and should go back to Reddit where you probably hail from.</p>

<p>the biggest mistake being made today is trying to do a clean install of win 10 without knowing what the effect will be. I have 3 pcs with 10240, all activated, have seen a couple sites with supposedly final release win 10 isos but have also read that most
 were not valid. the rtms are barely getting to individual pcs, most requiring weeks of waiting before the updated versions are ready to be installed once notification is sent. Gabe may have said insiders would get the rtm first, but what about the key and/or
 iso to do a clean install? neither has been mentioned in regards to a time&nbsp;either or both&nbsp;would be available. my advice is to wait until Gabe or someone else puts a foot in the mouth to clarify matters to far beyond anyone's human or extraterrestrial understanding.</p>

<h3> propertymanagement  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I get message &#34;Recordset is not updatable&#34; not allowing edit as if in &#34;Read Only&#34; mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Problem began when upgraded form Access 207 to Access 2010.</p>
<p>Two tables contain 1000 + records each but can not be edited as if I am in "Read Only" mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tables can be sorted, find activity, and printed, but not changed. </p>
<p>Other shorter tables can be changed, added, and deleted as in prior version 2007.</p>
<p>Why did changing versions cause this problem?</p>

            <p>A million records is getting to be a big table. A thousand is trivial! Nothing about the version should (by itself) block updatability of your tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are ANY tables in the database updateable? If not, might the .accdb file have been marked Read Only in Windows? Have you compacted and repaird the database? How are you trying to do the update: directly in table datasheet view, via a Query (if so post the
 SQL of the query), via a Form (post the form's Recordsource)?</p>

    <title>Documents slow to open in IE 11 when using internal &#40;domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garzajr85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Documents slow to open in IE 11 when using internal &#40;domain connected&#41; applications</h2>
                    <p>I will begin with the fact that this issue is hard to reproduce but we are looking to upgrade to IE 11 and this has many people in our organization (including myself) fearful of the fallout of pushing IE 11 without this issue being resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Issue: When opening Office documents (i.e. Word, Excel, PPT) from our internal, java application it can take up 30 seconds-minute to open the document. Here's what we are seeing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. User clicks on link to Open document</p>
<p>2. Pop-up is received asking the user to "Open, Save, or Save as". Our users would like to click Open to immediately view the doc.
</p>
<p>3. After clicking Open, this is where the problem starts...The document can take upwards of a minute to open.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the troubleshooting we've tried. </p>
<p>
</p><p>-Uninstall/Reinstall IE 11 ---&gt; no change</p>
<p>-Reset IE settings ---&gt; no change</p>
<p>-IE 9 works fine and opening documents does not have any delay</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I might be grasping at straws but was hoping someone has seen this issue and possibly resolved it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help in advane. </p>

<h2>            Windows Instagram Support</h2>
                    Hello all! I am a longtime /microsoft fanboy/user and have stood by their software for a good while. However, as of now I am beginning to suspect there is a lack of care on Microsoft's part regarding their phone division. Mostly the issue I am having is
 with Instagram, which was a very useful and sometimes lucrative creative outlet for myself and many others, unfortunately when I attempt to open up instagram's app on my phone it begins to load the homepage, then crashes. This is a very frustrating problem
 and I am not very well oriented in coding or programming so I do not have the skills to fix it myself. Does anyone have any info/advice that could assist me? Thank you for your time!

            <p>Yes, well unfortunately instagram doesn't offer much support for their windows phone app just the same as the facebook app as they are owned by the same company now. I have attempted to contact their support department and it is quite nonexistent for windows
 users. Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>yes, I have attempted to contact their support but to no avail. There has not been an update for the inst app on windows phone since it was released, which raises some eyebrows. I have removed it and reinstalled it which seemed to correct it for a short
 time however the problem re occurred shortly after. I believe I may just use my iphone from this point on for instagram. It's a shame few developers support windows phones, they're a very nice platform from a user perspective.</p>

            <p>you can always try the 6tag app, I have read the app received an update lately.
</p>
<p>It is made by the famous Windows Phone developer Rudy Huyn.</p>
<p>Maybe it's better to have a good working 3rd party app than a non-working 1st party app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow on mspoweruser.com there was an article 2 weeks ago that the official Instagram app got updated for windows 10 mobile, but is currently only available for test-people...</p>

<h2>            my virgin media email is not being transferred to my hotmail or outlook mail as it was in the past and I prefer to use hotmail for my email account.</h2>
                    Up until about Xmas my main server Virginmedia have always received my emails which have automatically been transferred to my Hotmail or Outlook account (I changed to&nbsp;Outlook to see if it would work better) but recently emails have only come into those
 accounts (hotmail or outlook) very sporadically and do not reflect the number of emails that are in my Virginmedia account.&nbsp; Is there any way of getting back to the old system or am I doing something wrong?&nbsp; Thank you.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue occurs when users want to connect PC for intercommunication. Entourage loses its connections with ports gets inaccessibility of emails and will get an error message “Database Daemon has encountered an unknown error” For us to resolve this, we
 need to restart the database daemon, remove entourage preferences, then, backup and rebuild Entourage database. Kindly check this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/kb/2521652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to see the troubleshooting steps.</p>

<p>My apple was working fine with Entourage until a few days ago. Now when I start Entourage it starts to download a lot of e-mails then after just a few the error message appears.
</p>
<p>I tried the step 1 from the article you directed me to.</p>
<p>item 3 of step 1 says open "Accounts" - the only relevant&nbsp;logo showing was for "Internet accounts" so I opened that.</p>
<p>At item 4 there was no account at all on the left hand side! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Where have I gone wrong?</p>
<p />

<p>No such issues for me..</p>
<p>As its always good to Reset the phone after an Update.. Try a Soft Reset by dialing *#7370# followed by the Security code (Default 12345 unless changed by you) when prompted. Be warned that this will erase all data from the Phone memory. So back-up the data
 first. You will need to Restore the data and MAY have to re-install a few applications. This should also resolve the problem you are facing.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>MyCareCentric Epilepsy is an application that records patients’ data such as sleep patterns, heart rate and temperature, and then compares that information with their medical records and a log of when seizures occur. The records can be supplemented by the
 Microsoft Band and are made available to the patient via the Microsoft Health/HealthVault solutions.

<p>Thank-you for sharing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The feature you asked for is not avaliable in Office365 Business Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For control of desktop policies, you would still need to rely on Group Policy on Active Directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For control of website surfing you will have to setup your website filtering on your firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more advanced capability you may want to have a look at Microsoft365 Business, but that will cost more than Office365 Business Premium.</p>

</p><p>I want to use a resource pool that can fluctuate between shifts. (E.G: Monday dayshift 4 people, Monday nightshift 6 people, Tuesday dayshift 5&nbsp;people and Tuesday nightshift 4 people). I know I am able to change the max units in the calendar to be able to
 accommodate this but I'm not sure how I need to go about doing it shift by shift and if I require a calendar for each shift.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most challenging thing for me to figure out is how to manage&nbsp;a task with a duration of 24hrs&nbsp;that will start say lunchtime on Tuesday and go to lunchtime on Wednesday. The thing I can't figure out is how to allocate resources to this task that will actually
 spread over 3 shifts as it has a fixed duration and is not effort driven.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again any assistance would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks heaps...</p>

            <p>First of all, task type and effort driven has nothing to do with this problem, so that should simplify things a bit.</p>
<p>Also, max units doesn't come into it either. Just go with the default 100%, which represents one full time person.</p>
<p>Assign the 24 hour calendar to the task.</p>
<p>Make a night shift calendar, and make it the base calendar for the night shift resource.</p>
<p>Make a day shift calendar and make it the base calendar for the day shift resource.</p>
<p>Assign both resources to the task.</p>
<p>Check what you got in the task usage view.</p>

            <p>Mucko72,</p>
<p>First of all, is your version of Project fully updated? For Project 2010 and Project 2013, that means the August 2015 Public Update. If they are not, run Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming everything is updated, since your plan is working 24hr per day, you need to set your Project calendar (Project/Project Information/Calendar) to "24 hrs". That will set the stage for all tasks in your schedule. You do NOT need to set any task calendars
 unless selected tasks are NOT on the 24 hr schedule, then you should of course set the appropriate task calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to resources, you need to create a separate resource calendar for each shift group. There are probably various ways to do this, but I suggest you create two shift calendars. These will not be resource calendars, they will be task calendars but
 your resource groups will be assigned those calendars.</p>
<p>1. Go to Project/Change Working Time and create a new dayshift calendar. You probably want to base it on the 24hr calendar and then edit from there.</p>
<p>2. Set the shift hours as necesary</p>
<p>3. Do the same for a nightshift calendar</p>
<p>4. Assuming the resources in each shift group of are equal talent, create a Monday dayshift group, a Monday nightshift group, a Tuesday dayshift group and so on for the full week.</p>
<p>5. Set the Max Units of each group to equal the number of resources in that group</p>
<p>6. For each resource group, set the Base Calendar to the appropriate shift calendar</p>
<p>7. Assign resource group to tasks as you normally would</p>
<p>
</p><p>Caveat, I haven't actually gone through this process to see if there is anything I forgot, but it should give you a starting point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Word documents when opened on different computers will often look different. This is the nature of Word. You can minimize this using wide margins and common fonts. Also, it is important to make sure the document is not set to automatically update styles from
 its template upon opening. See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/sharing/willmyformatchange.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What happens when I send my document to someone else? Will Word mess up my formatting?</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/sharing/willmyformatchange.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/sharing/willmyformatchange.html</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that can make a difference is the printer, the operating system, and the printer driver software.
<br />
<br />
I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />
Regards </p>

<h2>            forcing a save as to always save as a macro enabled workbook</h2>
                    <p>I have a workbook that has a lot of macro's and VBA as part of the workbook.&nbsp; This workbook is saved many time during the day, and then it will be "Save As" in the evening and renamed for use the next day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time that the end user does a "Save As", they have to be sure and save-as a macro enabled workbook.&nbsp; Is there any way to put some code in the workbook (or in a custom UI, which this file also contains) so that it will always save as a macro enabled
 workbook.&nbsp; I'm constantly getting calls from the end user that the buttons on the custom UI ribbon don't work, and it's because when they did the "Save As", they forgot to change the type of file to macro enabled.</p>

            <p>Try adding this to the ThisWorkbook code module in VBA:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim fname As Variant<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancel = True&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cancel the original SaveAs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Get filename (with path) for saving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fname = Application.GetSaveAsFilename(fileFilter:="Excel Marcro-Enabled Workbook (*.xlsm),*.xlsm")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If fname = False Then Exit Sub&nbsp; 'Exit if user hit Cancel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False&nbsp; 'Prevent this event from firing<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '52 = xlOpenXMLWorkbookMacroEnabled = xlsm (with macro's in 2007-2010)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True&nbsp; 'Re-enable events<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Exit Sub<br />
ErrorHandler:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So events are never left disabled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "An error occured during save." &amp; Err.Number, vbCritical, "Error"<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to be slick, you can use the InitialFilename argument of GetSaveAsFilename to suggest the name, e.g. the current file name, modified to include todays date and time (yyyy_mm_dd).</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>
<p>PS. I edited&nbsp;the code above&nbsp;to include a test for if the user is doing a SaveAs rather than a Save.&nbsp; I also added an error handler that sets EnableEvents back to true, just in case.</p>

<p>Letting the user type the filename and then adding the date stamp to fname, like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ThisWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=fname &amp; DateTime</p>
<p>can be tricky, if you want to make sure you don't end up with duplicated date stamps.</p>

<h2>            Problem connecting with yahoo mail</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using N97 mini and I tried to setup my Yahoo Mail using the email setup tool. I can confirm that I supplied the correct username and password but still, it keeps on asking the username / password even if I enter it a number of times already. I tried
 using username with and without @yahoo.mail but I get the same resutls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that I was successful in setting up my mail in the office (IMAP4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help please. thanks.</p>

<p>Yep, I've got the same problem with my N97. I can't access Yahoo (especially IM) via the Nokia chat app or other programs. Email and Web browsing work fine and I've quadruple-checked I've entered my username and password right. I&nbsp; used to use a different
 program to access IM (possibly IM+, I'm not sure since it was a while ago) and later uninstalled it. Now I'm wondering if I still have some leftover stuff from the old program that's somehow blocking me from logging into IM--cookies or something similar? But
 it's odd that everything else works fine but Yahoo doesn't.</p>

            Hi Simon,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your detailed information in PM to help us clarify the situation and glad to know you can delete things now.<br />
<br />
For the first error occurred when you click <strong>Go To the eDiscovery Center in SharePoint</strong>, just as the error message indicates that the default eDiscovery Center may have been deleted. And when we delete a site collection, it is placed in the
<strong>Recycle Bin</strong>, and it is kept for <strong>30</strong> days before it is automatically permanently deleted. You can create new eDiscovery cases in Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center or by creating a new eDiscovery site collection in SharePoint
 admin center.<br />
<br />
For the second error message, I noticed that the affected policy preserving content in
<strong>All public folders</strong> and <strong>1 site</strong>. I would like to confirm the following information to narrow down the issue:<br />
<br />
1. Create a new policy only preserving content in<strong> All public folders</strong> and then delete it when the status in
<strong>On</strong>.<br />
2. Create a new policy only preserving content in the site and then delete it when the status in
<strong>On</strong>.<br />
3. Does the one site has already on hold in SharePoint admin center? To check it, navigate to SharePoint admin center to see if there is a lock icon after the site.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda
