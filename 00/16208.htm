<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote 2016 would crash after opening the package as I was trying to save it to OneDrive for business, I get an error message saying that I needed to sync it first. I would do this and it would become unresponsive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is way to time consuming to fix though. I am going to move all my notebooks back to my personal OneDrive as I wasn't having any of these issues there. We are trialling OneDrive for Business at our school and still have a way to go before it
 will be fully functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your help. It has been very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great weekend</p>
<p>Naomi</p>

    <title>Excel 3D Maps function cannot be launched - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamestharian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 3D Maps function cannot be launched</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded Office 365 ProPlus 64-bit but cannot get the 3D Maps function to work.<br />
</p>
<p>When I click the button in the Insert ribbon, it says:<br />
</p>
<p>"3D Maps encountered an error and cannot be launched. Please check your internet connectivity and try again (Status Code: 901)"<br />
<br />
I am connected to the internet (how else am I posting this?) and I am signed in to Office 365 as I am receiving emails on Outlook.<br />
<br />
I have tried repairing, which seemed to basically redownload the program, and I have the PowerMap for Excel add-in enabled and active.<br />
<br />
Can someone help?<br />

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, we'd like to confirm some information first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Will the problem still persist if you temporary disable your firewall?</p>
<p>2. Please try changing to another network environment to see the result.</p>
<p>3. Please provide the screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>4. We'd like to know the version of the Excel, you can check it in
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have the exact same problem. I haven't used the 3d maps feature for some while. It used to work, but no longer. I found that the problem is due to a Privacy setting in Trust centre.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
To make sure that updates to your device go smoothly, here are a few things to keep in mind:
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><span>Charge your battery</span>. Make sure your device is fully charged before you update. If it's not, you may need to plug it in and wait before you can finish installing the update.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Connect to Wi‑Fi</span>. You'll download updates more quickly when connected to Wi‑Fi. If you need to download updates using a cellular data connection, make sure it shows 3G, 4G, or LTE. If you have a 2G or 2.5G (EDGE)
 connection, you'll be prompted for updates but won't be able to download them until you have a faster cellular data connection or connect to Wi‑Fi.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Free up space</span>. If you don’t have enough space on your device to update it, remove some files you can no longer need.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Try again</span>. If you’re getting an error, wait a bit and then try again.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Restart your device</span>. If your device freezes during an updates, restart it to get your update back on track.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>Contact Windows Phone Store Support.&nbsp; It may be necessary for them to reimburse you the price of the app so you may re-purchase it then install.</p>

    <title>Mac Outlook 15.18 slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carstenvanderputten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mac Outlook 15.18 slow</h2>
                    
<p>Outlook is very slow since yesterday's update:</p>
<ul>
<li>when browsing through my emails in my inbox. It takes a noticeable time to read the email even when the email is just a few sentences long
</li><li>when expanding/collapsing folders inside my email archive. </li></ul>
<p>Outlook worked fine before the update and I have not made any changes to my Mac since then.</p>
<p>I'm running Office on a Macbook Pro Retina 15-inch, Mid 2014 with a 2.5GHz Core i7 and 16GB internal mem. Also have a dedicated GeForce 750M inside.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any ideas to resolve this issue?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Not seeing any similar questions asked, probably this is due to an isolated cause.</p>
<p>Let's do some tests to eliminate possible causes.</p>
<p>1) Restart in Safe Boot mode. Continue the log in to your account in safe boot mode.</p>
<p>Safe boot</p>
<p>* &nbsp;shutdown</p>
<p>* &nbsp;start the Mac and *wait* for the startup chime to sound</p>
<p>* &nbsp;after the sound, press and hold down the shift key</p>
<p>* &nbsp;keep holding and *wait* until the grey  Apple logo appears</p>
<p>* &nbsp;now release the shift key and just wait (it could take a few minutes)</p>
<p>* &nbsp;eventually the login screen appears with the words SAFE BOOT</p>
<p>See this link to see what happens during Safe Mode.</p>
<p>[View:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564]</p>
<p>Mac OS X: What is Safe Boot, Safe Mode?</p>
<p>If this works use the link to look at the items disabled in Safe Boot.</p>
<p>2) Testing in a new User will quickly tell you if the problem is system wide or if it's your User's folder that contains the problem.</p>
<p>CREATE A NEW USER</p>
<p>Go to System Preferences --&gt; Create a New User in Accounts. Switch to the New User by logging out/in or use Fast User Switching.</p>
<p>Drag Outlook to the Dock from Applications. Test the response again</p>

<p>I'm also having poor performance post upgrade. &nbsp;The delayed scrolling and viewing of emails has gotten so bad that I've started to use the office365 version of outlook just to perform basic job functions. &nbsp;A disk and permission check was performed post upgrade
 with no effect on performance. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you DidierDes for your suggestions:</p>
<p>* Before seeing your reply I removed my email account, re-created it and downloaded my complete email archive again yesterday: same result, still slow.</p>
<p>* Tried running Outlook in Safe Mode: No difference. Still slow.</p>
<p>* Ran first aid within disk utility: no errors, thus nothing to fix, thus still slow.</p>
<p>* Created new user account, downloaded complete email archive again today. Seems a little faster but still not real quick.</p>
<p>Expanding/collapsing folders slow:</p>
<p>Then I discovered that expanding/collapsing my folders while NOT having the "Home" tab active (in the ribbon bar) is rather quick again. Thus if I select the "Organize" or the "Tools" tab the folder structure works quick. As soon as I select the Home tab
 expanding/collapsing folders is slow again. After that I went into my normal account (not the test account I created) and the same behavior occurs in my regular account. By the way, collapsing the ribbon bar has the same effect.</p>
<p>Going from 1 email to another:</p>
<p>This seems to be a little quicker in the new test account. But also here, it is much slower again as soon as I select the "home" tab.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Thus my conclusion so far is that as long as the "Home" tab is visible the speed is dramatically slower. The speed is normal again as soon as I collapse the ribbon bar or if I select a different tab (such as organize or tools).</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I'm back into running in my normal user account and making sure that the home tab is not visible.</p>
<p>I am curious if others see the same behavior.</p>
<p>Looking forward to anything that may help!</p>

<p>Thank you so much for this workaround! I have begun to dread going to Outlook, and email is half my work... Opening any other tab except Home definitely works.

<p>Shame on you, Microsoft. This update came with a bunch of problems (such as the missing forward message hotkey... Seriously?) Please do a feature freeze and make Outlook usable.</p>

<p>I fully agree. When Outlook is on the Home tab for email the product is nearly useable. Very slow, pin wheel of death. If you navigate to Organize or Tools it is more responsive and usable but still pretty slow. Buggy release. MS please step up here - quickly

            Good stuff, I've got 2010 and am pretty impressed with it TBH. Great to see you looking to integrate Ovi with it as its a bit alone outside of the MS sphere ;) Hopefully Google will sort out their calendar sync so we don't have to Hex edit the outlook
 exe to get it to work :@ ;)

<p>Dear Kale,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d like to partecipate in the Nokia Ovi Suite Beta test registration group but I cannot, apparently, select an
<strong>alias</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d like, by the way, to use the same string for the username (“adriano.basile”, already registered) and for the alias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where do I edit this field, please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry but I couldn’t find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>(post edited by admin, personal details removed: Your alias is the name that's used on the forum, so yours is "adriano_basile" :)</p>

<h2>            Birthday Calendars in Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I'm the admin for Office 365 Small Business Premium with just 9 users. &nbsp;Each user has created a birthday calendar in Outlook on the web. &nbsp;When creating a new birthday on the web birthday calendar, there is no option available (grayed out) for applying it
 to a specific calendar just the work calendar. When saved, it will not appear on the birthday calendar, only the work calendar. &nbsp;Not what we want!</p>
<p>When using Outlook application locally, the birthday calendar will not allow ANY additions to it and gives this message: &nbsp;"you don't have permission to create an entry in this folder. &nbsp;Right-click the folder and click properties to check your permissions
 for the folder.</p>
<p>Doing so shows that all the permissions are for the work calendar group. &nbsp;Deleting these and adding myself as Owner and then applying and trying to create an entry in the birthday calendar brings up the same message. &nbsp;Does anyone know why this is happening?</p>

<p>Hi Sara,</p>
<p>To better understand the issue, please provide some screenshots about your description:<br />
1. How do you create the birthday in Outlook Web App.<br />
2. "When creating a new birthday on the web birthday calendar, there is no option available (grayed out) for applying it to a specific calendar just the work calendar."<br />
3. "When saved, it will not appear on the birthday calendar, only the work calendar"</p>
<p>To upload a picture, please click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box and then click the<strong> Insert Image</strong> icon.</p>
<p>Regarding the Outlook client wrong message, I can reproduce the issue. However, I need some time to do further research and consult about it.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Hi Louis,</p>
<p>Here's what I figured out--I didn't have any contacts with birthdays in &nbsp;my contact list! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I created one contact with a birthday, it appeared in BOTH the birthday calendar and in the work calendar.
</p>
<p>I didn't want it to appear in the work calendar, so I deleted it and it cleared. &nbsp;But it also cleared in the birthday calendar.</p>
<p>I created a new contact birthday and this time it only appeared on the birthday calendar.
</p>
<p>Now I can create a new birthday on the birthday calendar by clicking on the calendar itself (without using a contact card) and it seems to be working fine. &nbsp;I guess it just needed the first one to be created using Contacts before it would function?</p>

<p>Hi Sara,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I have done some tests based on your description, but can't reproduce the issue. To answer your question, I have to clarify the detailed information:<br />
1. Please let us know where you have done the steps? Always on Outlook client, or OWA (Outlook Web App)? If it's not always on one of them, please elaborate each step was done on Outlook client or OWA.<br />
2. Regarding"created one contact with a birthday", please provide some screenshots of the detailed steps of how to create a contact with birthday.<br />
3. When you mentioned "I deleted it and it cleared", do you mean you delete the contact, birthday in the contact information, or just birthday on the calendar? Screenshots of the steps are preferred.<br />
4. About"I can create a new birthday on the birthday calendar by clicking on the calendar itself (without using a contact card)", please also provide the screenshots of it.</p>
<p>I have sent you a private message to collect the screenshots, please click the link below to access it:<br />

    <title>After closing IE windows iexplore.exe processes are still running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melabe  say:</h3>
<h2>            After closing IE windows iexplore.exe processes are still running non-stop in Task Manager</h2>
                    
<p>I have a problem with Internet Explorer and need help fixing it. I run Vista x32 machine with 2 Gb memory with all current updates. I was using IE-8 for about 3 years without any serious problems. Approximately 3-4 weeks ago my computer started freezing
 with CPU running close to 100%.&nbsp; The only way to get it back was to disconnect power and remove the battery. I noticed that usually at that time I was using IE or closing it. So, I decided to update to IE-9, but the problem still persisted and I started investigate.
 When I open IE, the Task Manager shows two iexplore.exe processes running. If I open additional windows or tabs, more iexplore.exe processes will show up. All that is fine, untill I close all IE windows. The iexplore.exe processes are still running in the
 Task Manager. Well, some of them might close in about 15 seconds, but a few would keep running forever. I would have to end the processes in Task Manager to close it, which works sometimes. But frequently there would be one iexplore.exe process that would
 not close via Task Manager. It would start using CPU &gt;50% to 90% and my computer will freeze. All these appear to be legitimate processes refering to iexplore.exe located in the C:\Program files\Internet Explorer folder.<br />
One more additional detail. When I use Adobe Flash Active X in Internet Explorer and then close the Browser, Adobe Flash Active X process keeps running and does not close - never. Even if on some rare occasion iexplore.exe processes would close upon closing
 IE windows, the Flash Active X would be running in Task Manager. I have to kill this process in Task Manager every time. I have uninstalled the Flash Player (using the Adobe uninstall file), rebooted and installed Flash Player again. No difference.<br />
<br />
What I have done:<br />
<br />
1) Started IE without add-ons: does not help. Did a complete Reset of IE: does not help.<br />
2) Uninstalled IE-9, still the same problem with IE-8. Uninstalled IE-8, IE-7 was actually working fine and very fast. Re-installed IE-8 (from Microsoft site): the same problem. Re-installed IE-9 (from Microsoft site): the same problem.<br />
3) Scanned my computer with numerous AV programs: Microsoft Essentials (my default AV program), Avast, Avira, Emsisoft, Trend-Micro, Malwarebytes, SuperAntiSpyware, Spybot, Eset. Other than a few cookies, which were removed - nothing was found.<br />
4) I ran system file checker toolI (sfc) twice and both times the answer was " did not find any integrity violations".<br />
<br />
Firefox browser works beautifully without any problems. All other programs that I have on my computer do not create any problems. The only problem is IE. Firefox is a nice browser, but I still would like to have IE functioning on my machine.</p>
I looked over the forums, and it appears that a lot of people have the same problem with different versions of IE. Unfortunately none of the offered solutions (if there were some) could help me - like removing Comodo firewall, which I do not use, etc. I think
 it is more like an internal weakness of IE browser, which can be triggered by numerous causes. But where is the location of this weakness and can it be fixed in a more radical way?
<p>Can you suggest any ways to fix this problem?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The symptom is definately, definately a problem with one of your IE Addons....</p>
<p>Try</p>
<p>Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Internet Options, Advanced tab, uncheck "Enable third-party browser extensions". Save you changes and close any open IE Windows.</p>
<p>Important ..... restart your computer.</p>
<p>Start IE.... this time when it starts it will not load any Toolbar or Browser Helper Addons that you have installed. (If you have previously disabled all your IE Addons from the IE Addons Manager, your can go back to the Addons Manager and Enable them all
 again.... you will need Shockwave flash and Silverlight as some web pages may cause IE to crash if you do not have them enabled.) Other types of Addons, like ActiveX and Command Bar buttons and menu extensions are available (unless disabled in the IE Addons
 Manager).</p>
<p>Note: uncheck "Enable third-party browser extensions".&nbsp; is not the same as disabling ALL of your IE Addons using the Addons Manager or running IE in noAddons mode....</p>
<p>If you have the Bing Toolbar installed, go Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Programs and Features, locate it in the list and press the Update button... there was an update available a few months back that addressed issues with Vista and IE8 and 9.</p>
<p>If you want to restart your Toolbars and Browser helpers after doing the update above... just reverse the instructions given above... Note that you have close all Ie Windows and restart IE before the changes will take affect... so use the Task Manager to
 make sure that you do not STILL have any IE processes running (on the Processes tab)... after you have closed all open (visible) IE Windows...</p>
<p>If you have IE9 BETA install still, uninstall it and revert automatically back to your previous IE version...</p>
<p>Remember it is a BETA product.... I found the Vista version to be terrible (there appears to be a number of different versions available for each of the supported windows versions... the Vista version is very, very flakey)</p>
<p>On my computer the tab crash recovery in IE8 and 9 seems to have improved in the past few months... (or maybe it is because I am doing less testing of third-party IE Addons)... but do a Windows Update to ensure you have all of the latest security updates
 and patches from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Well, IE Add-ons were the primary suspect from the very beginning. That is why I tried to start IE without Add-ons from the System Tools menu several times. As I mentioned before, it didn't help. I don't understand how unchecking the "Enable third-party
 browser extensions" option would be better, but I went with it anyway. I tried a couple of times to disable third-party extensions in Internet Options and then enable them again, with restarting my computer in between. It didn't help either.</p>
<p>I don't have any Toolbars installed on my IE, so there is no need to update anything. My Windows Update, however, runs every day, and everything is up to the latest patch. Regarding IE-9 beta: I started having this problem with IE-8. That is why I decided
 to try to update it to IE-9. Then I uninstalled version 9 to IE-8, and then to IE-7. And then installed again IE-8, which didn't solve the problem, and then again went to version 9. Still the same problem.</p>
<p>I will continue to play with different Add-ons trying to remove some, but don't know how successful I would be.</p>
<p>The fact the Adobe Flash/Active X process does not close after I finish with IE also bothers me. I even removed it and reinstalled again, but without any improvements.</p>
<p>Thank you for trying to help.</p>
<p>If you will have any other suggestions, please let me know.</p>

<p>That suggests then that LCIE could be a cause of your problem symptom. &nbsp;You could test that idea by setting &nbsp;TabProcGrowth=0 &nbsp;(to simulate IE7 on XP, which also apparently disables Protected Mode) or TabProcGrowth=1 (which would keep Protected Mode: On but
 might not be as conclusive a test). &nbsp;; )</p>
<p>BTW the fact that No Add-ons mode doesn't eliminate the symptom does not mean that add-ons have been removed from consideration, just that that simple test was ineffective in finding a cause. &nbsp;E.g. now you will have to resort to clean-boot troubleshooting
 techniques to try and find a cause. &nbsp;In that case if you normally rely on third-party security products make sure that you have at least the Windows firewall enabled before trying to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Also, having to disconnect the power and remove the battery to shut down does not sound like something that IE could be held responsible for, so all the more reason to have to resort to clean-boot troubleshooting techniques. &nbsp; BTW I wonder if you made the
 same mistake with Power settings on your laptop that I made with my W7 Tablet? &nbsp;I must have noticed that the battery only settings had Hibernate for all the power off conditions and stupidly made the non-battery settings the same--only later realizing that
 this meant I now had no way to shut down my Tablet when I didn't have a functioning UI. &nbsp;Oops. &nbsp;; )</p>

<p>You are absolutely correct about the fact that because "No Add-ons mode doesn't eliminate the symptom does not mean that add-ons have been removed from consideration". I should add - as well as disabling third party extensions or disabling some add-ons directly
 in the Add-on Manager. I have completely removed from my computer the latest beta version of DivX WebPlayer, and now I can watch CNN videos and open without any problems my Google account with background image. I couldn't do that before, and simply disabling
 DivX add-on didn't work. That is the good part. The bad part is that I still have that major problem with iexplore.exe staying open sometimes after closing the IE window and sometimes overwhelming my CPU and causing computer to freeze.</p>
<p>By the way, could you please explain to me how the battery settings would prevent my computer from completely freezing leaving me with the only option of cutting all power to it (and removing the battery for that purpose). In my Advanced battery settings
 I do have Critical Battery Action set for Hibernation both on Battery and Plugged in. It was a default setting and I never changed it. My understanding was that runaway iexplore.exe process was simply overwhelming my CPU and preventing it from responding to
 any key strokes or mouse clicks. I need to mention that iexplore.exe process does not always go to 100% CPU usage. Very often it stays just above 50%. If I can not close it with the Task Manager (it simply would not respond to "end the process" command) and
 it stays open for several minutes, then my computer freezes. If you would suggest me a way to prevent such freezing, it would be great.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will continue searching for the way to deal with my IE problem. And I do believe that it is specifically related to iexplore.exe process, since it is the only one that causes my computer to freeze.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

So, you just have to find something else that is being loaded and apparently causing that interference. &nbsp;I would try using &nbsp;ProcExp &nbsp;(from TechNet) &nbsp;to help with that.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>

<p>My point is that if you don't have a way of causing a Shut down it is difficult to cause a Shut down. &nbsp;; )</p>

<p>Robert,</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you something. When I open the Task Manager and right-click on running processes there, I see among other options such item as Virtualization. I noticed that most processes do not have the check-mark next to it, but iexplore.exe processes
 do have it checked. Can it be the source of the problem, and what does it mean in the first place? I am familiar with the very general concept of virtualization, but don't know much about details and how it works and where it is regulated in Vista. The reason
 I am asking is: first, Firfox does not have virtualization checked and it works fine. Second, and mostly important, I had some time ago a problem with Adobe PDF maker and Adobe PDF Printer. They would freeze and wouldn't finish printing to PDF. After extensive
 troubleshooting I tracked it to the Acrotray.exe process, which is needed for PDF printing. It turned out that this process also has Virtualization checked. If I uncheck this Virtualization, everything works normally, without any problems. When I restart the
 computer, Virtualization is back in Acrotray. To make it work, I need to uncheck it again. I have no idea why it happens and why both acrotray.exe and iexplore.exe are virtualized and how it effects their performance. Do you have any information on this subject?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><br />
Then you may know more than I about that. &nbsp; My guess is that it has something to do with compatibility mode, e.g. how the IE7 rendering engine could be implemented in IE8...</p>
<p>Oh. &nbsp;Try a search?...</p>
<p>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb530198.aspx</p>
<p>(Microsoft search for<br />
<span>virtualization registry compatibility</span><br />
)</p>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Only for keys that are administrator writeable</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<p>The article also hints that you could use registry auditing to "monitor the status of virtualization" on your system. &nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>I suspect it would be simpler to use ProcMon to trace Vista's use of it.</p>

<p>The problem is still not resolved. I started using mostly Firefox for Internet browsing, going to Internet Explorer only on some occasions, when specific Web sites prefer IE browser. There are, however, some new observations which I wanted to list here.</p>
<p>First, I have found a couple of Web sites, which will always cause the iexplore.exe to hang - 100% of all cases. One of them is: http://www.computertipsfree.com/how-to-change-font-size-in-internet-explorer/. As soon as I go there, the IE becomes unresponsive.
 I still can go back to a previous page and open another tab or window. I can also close all IE windows, but if I look in Task Manager, there will be one iexplore.exe process running and using about 50% CPU. This process is impossible to kill. I used pskill.exe
 and taskkill.exe (both - process name and PID, including /F and /T), PowerShell commands, Registry etc. Nothing works. I looked in several forums on the Web and it appears that this impossibility to kill a hung process is a major problem in Vista and Windows
 7. When iexplore.exe processes are running sometimes after I close the IE windows and they use close to 0% CPU, I can easily kill these processes via Task Manager. However, when iexplore.exe is running and using 50% CPU (as in the case of visiting the above
 mentioned web site), it is hung and impossible to kill. Obviously something in the System is grabbing to it and would not let it go. I usually see 1 thread and about a hundred different handles associated with this process in Task Manager. There is no way,
 however, to understand what exactly is holding this process. Are there any ways to find this out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a very nice little program called Unlocker, which I installed on my computer after I constantly had some problems in my Vista deleting or modifying some files/ folders or removing flash drive from USB port. All programs that I used to work with those
 files or flash drives would be closed, but explorer was grabbing to these files or flash drives and wouldn't let me do anything with them until I reboot my computer. So, Unlocker ( which is less than 0.5 Mb in size) was a life saver. It was showing all handles
 and was capable of removing them (something that should be done in Vista internally, by the way). However, in my current situation I couldn't use it. And here is why. When my untouchable iexplore.exe was running at 50% CPU, I still could use my computer and
 run other programs. I couldn't reboot or close the computer - when I was doing it, computer would start closing and then hopelessly freeze in the middle. If I do not turn computer off, it would still be running, but with less CPU power. However, when I start
 using any program with elevated administrative privileges (which is required for Unlocker) and consent.exe process becomes open in Task Manager, immediately my computer would totally freeze - no mouse clicks, no keyboard strokes. The only way to get out of
 this is hard reboot by holding the power button.</p>
<p>It is interesting that in the Safe mode with Networking, I could open that Web site without any problems. I couldn't figure out though what was creating a problem. The only major installation that I had on my computer in the middle of last December (when
 this problem actually started) was a multiple Windows update via automatic Update Manager.</p>
<p>One more detail. When I use Firefox and go to the same web site - no problems. However, when I use ArmoSurf browser, it would also hang at the same web site.</p>
<p>If somebody has any suggestions on the subject, I would greatly appreciate it (short of re-installing the entire OS, though). It would be also good to know how I can find what is actually holding iexplore.exe and causes the freezing of the computer and what
 is it at that website that is so offensive to my IE.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

            These days almost every Web site uses Flash. I go to many sites that use Flash without any problems - like watching videos on CNN or BBC, etc. (including Flash adds). It is impossible to avoid using Flash. I don't understand how it might be so specific
 to this Web site. But, yes, my add blocker is turned on. It is interesting that I can go to this Web site in Safe mode and it does not create a problem, and I can also play Flash in the Safe mode.

Try these...</p>
<p>A1 = 15-28</p>
<p>=--LEFT(A1,FIND("-",A1)-1)</p>
<p>=--MID(A1,FIND("-",A1)+1,10)</p>
<p>Assumes you want the values extracted as numeric numbers. Note that with this method any leading zeros will be stripped off. For example:</p>
<p>A1 = 01-05</p>
<p>The formula would strip off both leading zeros and return 1 and 5.</p>
<p>If you might have leading zeros and do need to retain them then just remove the double unary minus from the formulas:</p>
<p>=LEFT(A1,FIND("-",A1)-1)</p>
<p>=MID(A1,FIND("-",A1)+1,10)</p>
<p>Those formulas will return the result as TEXT.</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internet Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close error message, but Internet Explorer is not running</h2>
                    
<p>I have been getting the classic Internet Explorer needs to shut down message every 3 or 4 minutes, even when IE is not running.&nbsp; If it is running, acknowledging the message does not shut down IE, it continues to run just fine.&nbsp; I am also getting a random
 'information bleep' not related to any action I am taking.&nbsp; On occassion I am also receiving an audio (sounds like a commercial) that only lasts a few seconds.&nbsp; I do not need to have any applications open for all of the above to occur.&nbsp; I am running xp professional
 and IE 8.</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, turning off add-ons, changing user accounts, running Windows File Checker, and virus scans, with no luck.</p>
<p>Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

            Actually, it would be nice for you to create an "APP" button and "FAVORITE" button next to the "Start" button and make these buttons and functions separate. &nbsp;I believe this would save a lot of the confusion and redundancy--as I do like the capabilities
 in Windows 8.1 that alphabetizes the apps. &nbsp;The &nbsp;"FAVORITE" button would take you directly to a user's customized screen and makes things very easy to find that way. &nbsp;Simple as "1, 2, 3" :)

            <p>Almost, but not exactly.&nbsp; I'm talking about fixed buttons in the tray like the "Start" button.&nbsp; It would make it a clean click toggle switch that would be labeled accurately and not be just a tray icon.&nbsp; Again, labels would be "APPS" and "FAVORITES."&nbsp; The
 one issue that confused a lot of the novice users was the relabeling of Start for the 8.1 menu along with the repetition and placement to toggle back and forth.</p>

<p>Just not sure what you are suggesting.&nbsp; I am a PC user so I like a PC solution.&nbsp; I can make full use of Icons as in the past.&nbsp; I also like some of my Office 2013 icons in the lower taskbar so if I am working on Word with my screen covered, I can just click
 to open Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am 2 clicks away from the dreaded Menu 8 interface if I need it.&nbsp; 1 click to my Start Button and 1 click to get me to the W8 style crappola.&nbsp; I am fully customiszable as to my choice of locations such as Onedrive, Control Panel, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be totally honest, I can see no real benefit at all with W10.&nbsp; I am still doing the same things with W10 as I do with W8.1.&nbsp; I am not more productive.&nbsp; With W8.1, I had an icon for Windows Update.&nbsp; With W10 I have placed an Icon to get me to Windows Update.&nbsp;
 Without the Icon, it is just not as easy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I had to go to search, go to settings or whatever.&nbsp; Not much of an advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find that Start8 is doing such a&nbsp; great job for me that I see no reason to learn or teach W10.&nbsp; Just slip Start8 onto the PC and save a lot of time by not looking at the gripes about the W8 and now W10 interface.&nbsp; I still plan to adopt W10 on day 1 on
 my fleet unless MS strips away the ability of 3rd party to come to the rescue.</p>

</p><p>Access isn't listed among the apps. And even when I disable everything for all apps, the popups in access still make the same noise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Just for the sake of speed and clarity to ensure which pop-ups in Access are being referenced rather then guessing - can you provide an example of a specific pop and any ciode behind it (if relevant)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every popup window has the sound, I haven't seen a popup window that didn't have one. When it prompts you to save the table when you switch out of the design view, when you input the wrong type of data, ... Literally every message has that same sound. Even
 when there are multiple messages in a row, every single one has the sound.</p>

            I think you could solve this problem at the system level, but not just for Access.&nbsp; The Sounds control panel applet lets you set the sounds to be played for various system events and alerts, so you ought to be able (for example) to turn off the "Default
 Beep" sound altogether.&nbsp; However, that would not let you do it for just Access.

<p>This simply doesn't work. It describes turning off sounds in "Office," but MS Access doesn't have the option this talks about. Also, the option this talks about, for some reason, doesn't turn off sounds when the option is turned off.</p>

            <p>I had this problem from the April update. Apparently fixed it today by uninstalling the gmail account, then starting the Outlook Email icon (on my Lumia 640XL phone), then menu (...), then manage accounts, then "Google" as the ISP.&nbsp;&nbsp; From there it was a
 simple entry of user name and password again.&nbsp; After that I was able to send a reply without problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: that it may take a few minutes for your phone to resync the Google account.&nbsp; But I was able to immediately check the Sent Mail version on my PC. That was good, and then a few minutes later the syncing was complete on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It remains to be seen how long this fix will last, but at the moment I am pleased.</p>

<h2>            WM 6 Contact Lookup Large Character</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes when i go into Contacts i have a large letter that i can use my wheel to scroll to any letter. Once i stop scrolling the contacts autmatically move to those contacts starting with that letter. This ability is helpful for times i cannot easily use&nbsp;the
 keypad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is i do not know how to make this function available to me. It just sort of happens, probably by me hitting some shortcut key i am aware of...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how to get this to work whenever i want?</p>

<p>The answer is simple because I dumbed on it too!&nbsp; Just hold your up or down button on your wheel.&nbsp; It will start a slow scroll and then increase and finally go to the large letter.&nbsp; Once you have the large letter
 you have a delay time in&nbsp;which you can scroll up or down in case you missed the letter you were looking for.&nbsp; Once you have your letter stop pushing and after a second or&nbsp;two your contacts will be displayed starting at the letter you chose.&nbsp; You can do&nbsp; this
 anytime while in the contacts directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps...</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, this Answers Community is able to provide support in English only. Select your region from the drop down list and then click the arrow
 button.</p>
<p>You can choose the language in which you want to view the Forums by using the locale selector located at the top-right of the page. If the Forum that
 you want to view does not exist for the language that you selected, you will return to the current language. For example, you are viewing a Forum for SQL in En-us language. You switch to the Fr-fr language by using the locale selector. If the Forum does not
 exist in that language, you will return to the En-us language.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft apps 2.0</h2>
                    Bonsoir<br />
<br />
Mise à jour logicielle me propose d'installer le pack Microsoft apps 2.0 (50 Mo). Il installera Word Excel Power Point pour mobiles compatibles avec la version PC.<br />
L'installation se fera-t-elle sur C: ou sur E: sur mon E7-00 ?<br />
<br />
Cordialement

<p>Bonjour&nbsp;<span>Cabotan29,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C'est vrai qu'utiliser l'espace du lecture E: et bien pratique&nbsp;et qu'installer&nbsp;Microsoft apps 2.0 aurait été plus approprié vu la taille de application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonne journée:smileyhappy:</p>
