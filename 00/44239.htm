<h2>            Windows 10  start button not working</h2>
                    Hello, I am using a windows 10 preview build, the most recent one. Just last night the start menu stopped working, it doesn't work on the keyboard either. If I click it, a loading sign will appear for half a second but It won't do anything. Cortana seems
 to work fine. My antivirus is AVG. I really like a lot of the features of Windows 10 and that's why I would like to buy a license, however the bugs are a problem. Hope a fix is found for this :)

            <p>1. Launch Task manager<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the [Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Del] keys on the keyboard at the same time, or right click the Taskbar, and select Task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Run a new Windows task<br />
<br />
&nbsp; When the Task manager window <a href="http://goo.gl/8Ur2QK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
opens</a>, click the More details option to expand it, then select Run new task from the File menu.<br />
<br />
3. Run Windows PowerShell<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;When the Run new task dialog box opens, type powershell, tick the box for Create this task with administrative privileges and click OK.<br />
<br />
4. Run the System File Checker<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Type sfc /scannow into the window and press the [Return] key. The scan may take some time and will end with one of three results. Windows did not find any integrity violations and Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and repaired them mean
 there are now no corrupt files, but Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some (or all) of them indicates a problem.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this latter case, type (or copy and paste) DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth into the PowerShell window and press the [Return] key. This will download files from Windows Update to replace the corrupt ones and, again, this may take some time.<br />

            As&nbsp;a way out of this problem you can also try my advice: press Ctrl+Alt+Del, then select Sign Out to log out, and enter the OS anew. In some cases, it can solve your problem.

<p>A treatment for the symptom would be to restart Windows Explorer every time this happens. This may allow you to use the Windows button until the next time that it freezes up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-open task manager (alt-ctrl-del or right click on taskbar and choose it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-find and select "Windows Explorer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>-click Restart button on bottom right</p>

<p>It means log out and log back in...will restart Windows services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly don't know how this is still a problem that Microsoft hasn't fixed in Falls Creator edition. Seems like a flaw in pretty basic functionality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm shocked... a YouTube comment fixed this problem with me. I narrowed it down to some conflict between (I believe) Dropbox and the Windows 10 Task Host Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Followed this Dropbox thread here:&nbsp;https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Installation-and-desktop-app/Stuck-on-quot-starting-quot/td-p/88494/page/5</p>

 to push notifications from some corresponding WNS server. I guess that depends on your location. Changing it to 1 makes Windows get it's notification from iCloud servers, 2, 3, 4,...x, I don't know and neither did the tech I talked to. For that you get to
 have access to registry service codes. So either this guy works for Microsoft or just guessed the code because Microsoft had no answer as to why entering 4 worked. If you type in the registry key directly into the search engine bar, you will get results for
 that service but not the codes and how they repetitively affect the system. I hope this helps.</em></span></p>
<p>No idea why this widely reported issue isn't fixed yet with a proper Windows Update. Seems pretty easy to recreate.

<p>Ok I found another way to fix Windows 10 Start Menu / Search problems</p>
<p>although this process fixes the issue of some results not showing up when searching, it might help with other issues as well.</p>
<p>So If restarting computer and Cortana (By right clicking Cortana process in task manager and ending task) don't fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run CMD (Command Prompt) AS an Administrator and paste the following lines,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CD /d "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy"</strong><br />
<strong>Taskkill /F /IM SearchUI.exe</strong><br />
<strong>RD /S /Q Settings</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing so will force Cortana to rebuild the settings and get rid of its unexpected behavior..</p>

    <title>Cortana In Windows 10 Education - Can&#39;t Set Reminders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webmaster2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana In Windows 10 Education - Can&#39;t Set Reminders</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently started using Cortana in my Windows 10 install so that I could take advantage of the reminders feature. To my disappointment, the reminders feature does not work. I can set cortana to start a reminder by typing "remind me to" and then going to
 the reminder setup page. However, it does not save the reminder. It simply tells me "Sorry, I couldn't save that reminder." or "Sorry, I couldn't save that. Please try again later." Furthermore, when I click on the reminders tab, cortana crashes instantly.
 I've reinstalled cortana with powershell many times and tried the XML start menu registry tweak with no luck. I am running ENGLISH (US) and the United States supports cortana. I am using the latest Windows 10 update. I am not ready to reset my PC to try and
 fix this problem. Can anyone help me out with this? I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also disabled many features in group policy. Can anyone tell me which features could affect cortana this way?</p>

            <p>Out of curiosity what group policies did you change, as both the Stable and Fast-Insider (weekly build) versions I am running do not have this problem. Also, is the Outlook/Cortana Notebook account (MS/Xbox) from a region that supports Cortana, I read in
 other posts that someone in eastern Europe (both my MS online accounts are US based) couldn't get anything to save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replying with either of these will help track down whats causing this.</p>

            I'm having this problem too! I have Windows 10 Education as well and everytime I click on "set a new reminder", either Cortana just does "Thinking..." forever and ever, or she does a Bing search on "reminder". If I click on the reminder tab and then "+",
 nothing happens....

            <p>I now have Windows 10 Pro build&nbsp;vers 1511&nbsp;and up to date as of 5/31/2016&nbsp;and had same issue, Cortana would set up the reminder, then would tell me "sorry, I can't do that right now, please try again later" or something like that.&nbsp; Hopefully you already have
 this solved, but if not, the post by Simbo2k6 worked easily for me.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Headphones Echo Issue - alternate solution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abrahamboney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Headphones Echo Issue - alternate solution</h2>
                    <p>I resolved an issue where the sound coming through any headphones plugged into my headphone jack would have a persistent echo. It sounded like every thing was being played inside of a cave.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While researching for solutions, I saw several different suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Swapping headsets</li><li>Going to the <strong>Playback devices</strong>, speaker <strong>Properties</strong> menu and turning off all
<strong>Enhancements</strong> <br />
</li><li>Going through the <strong>Troubleshoot sound problems </strong>process</li><li>reinstalling sound drivers</li><li>restoring windows to a previous state</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't tried any of these methods, let me refer you to a post that addresses these in more detail:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/audio-plays-serious-echo-effect-after-windows/5b1b42ee-32cc-4bb5-bc0a-0b8fae133273">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/audio-plays-serious-echo-effect-after-windows/5b1b42ee-32cc-4bb5-bc0a-0b8fae133273</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those solutions work for you, try this, because you may have the same issue I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My issue was in the <strong>Recording devices </strong>menu. The shortcut to this menu is to right click on the speaker icon in the task bar and click on the
<strong>Recording devices </strong>tab.<strong> </strong>Once in that menu, select the
<strong>Stereo Mix </strong>device and click <strong>Properties.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Once in the <strong>Properties</strong> menu, click on the <strong>Listen </strong>
tab and make sure the option <strong>Listen to this device</strong> is <strong>not</strong> checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0b3b8a0-b3c2-42f5-852a-f562614c45ec?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0b3b8a0-b3c2-42f5-852a-f562614c45ec?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I did this prior to reinstalling drivers or restoring, but I did try the other suggestions. I don't know how common this particular problem is, but this solution worked for me.

<p>well you are on wrong tab. Recording is for MIC and not playback. Only a plugged in playback device like a MP3 Player. This is not what you are using so disable it.</p>

</p><p>select the playback tab&gt;&gt;select speakers&gt;&gt;Properties&gt;&gt;Enhancements</p>
<p>some of these will make echo sounds and such, disable them</p>

<p>
</p><p>maybe disable these.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd57837f-ecd7-417b-af78-601a0e082dea?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd57837f-ecd7-417b-af78-601a0e082dea?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now back to your post. You are selecting record and not playback for headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your jack may be a dual MIC Headphone jack, like an ASUS laptop I have and when plugging in an app pops up to select when you want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you may need to disable the MIC or configure it anyways</p>
<p>select the recording as you have shown, then select the MIC not that stereo mix that is for recording and then select properties and configure your MIC like Disable it if need be</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a687dd4-f0a9-4e93-a908-8430b87b6b53?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a687dd4-f0a9-4e93-a908-8430b87b6b53?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I believe that there is&nbsp;stereo mix in&nbsp; the playback settings also, I would like to see that. Set those for mixer in playback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But back to MIC, the image you show to "listen to this device" in recording, stereo mix and mic, you need to disable it and I believe your issue will be gone.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb5216a5-0399-42fa-886e-74b27830d25b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb5216a5-0399-42fa-886e-74b27830d25b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and disable the MIC and MIXER enhancements for recording</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73020712-a103-4282-a0b0-2e371caacb84?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73020712-a103-4282-a0b0-2e371caacb84?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Well bud, I do not know how it is possible to resolve feedback in the headphone on a playback device using the recording settings. I find that Impossible, especially when that setting is only for MICS&nbsp; and plugged in media devices such as a MP3 player.&nbsp;Then
 no settings were shown for playback. Anyways have a good one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see that you edited it after my posts and now shows in photo, the box unchecked in yellow circle as it was checked and circled before.</p>

<p>The app store definitely allows use of a discover card.</p>
<p>I would be surprised if you cannot use it everywhere.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've setup everything like it should be. The audio from skype should come in on the standard playback communication device but instead it comes in on the main speakers. When i test it with the build in audio test it responds on the playback communication
 device but still when someone calls it chooses for the speakers. the outgoing audio however works like it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test it further i installed another app with the exact same settings and it works like it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has any idea how to solve this?</p>

            Hi James.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sounds like it's signed you into a Temporary Account. Sometimes when a Windows or Version Update fails due to a corrupted account it will create a temp one to sign into.
<br />
<br />You should be able to leave the password box blank to sign in to the temp account.  
<br />
<br />Check at C:\Users if you can see your old account with its files intact.  If not check at C:\Windows.old to see if files were archived there during a version install that fails.  
<br />
<br />If so copy the files out externally so they are safe.  Files should always be backed up if you value them at all.  You can copy or drag them to an external USB flash or hard drive, or into Onedrive (up to 5gb free) or Google Drive (up to 15gb free).  
<br />
<br />Try restarting the PC a few times to see if it will start into your account.  If so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then from the temp account can try to repair the old account using one of these methods:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-youve-been-signed-temporary-profile-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-y...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-w...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can try to create a new Admininstrator Local Account to see how it works:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-local-account-in-windows-10/95097c32-40c4-48c0-8f3b-3bcb67afaf7c">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>.   
<br />
<br />If necessary to try to repair the old account or create a new Account you may need to enable and Sign into the Hidden Administrator account used only for emergencies, using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>.
<br />
<br />Once the new account is created: sign into the new account, move your files over, test that all programs run.  If you decide to keep it then you can delete the old accounts when ready. in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and other Users.  
<br />
<br />If the install is too corrupted for even a new account to run well, then see if you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can run a Repair Install which reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place,  by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will solve most problems and also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If those fail then you can do a Reset:  <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi James, this is not a good sign . ..
<br />
<br />1803 has not been installed correctly on your system, you can try rolling back to 1709, but honestly your best and probably only option is to reset Windows 10, while keeping your files and apps . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h3> randolphpaul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too many useless applications and programs come with windows 10, End User should have the CHOICE to add&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I was under the impression that this was the site to communicate feedback to Microsoft on the Windows 10.&nbsp; As a user of a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">desktop computer</span>, I am voicing my concerns of all this useless garbage that is included with windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For each user and the users needs, the purpose of the computer, laptop, tablet and phone may be different.&nbsp; There should be different application of windows 10 for each users purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox - I personally do not play video games (xbox), if I did I would buy an xbox or playstation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype - If I want to talk to somebody, I use a phone. I'd have a microphone and camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana - If I wanted to talk to my desktop (cortana), I'd have a microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bing - I do not like bing, nor do I trust it.&nbsp; It loads too much trash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge - I don't like or trust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google - Sell out to the government and marketing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groove Music / iHeartRadio - I can turn on a radio, or play a cd/mp file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care to have all these internet programs that burn through my data usage limits, nor do I care to leave my computer open to these tracking applications that reports what sites I visit, what products I show interest, my location (all this stuff for
 marketing).&nbsp; Furthermore, I do not trust that any personal data is safe from being hacked.</p>
<p>
I understand that microsoft purchased all these companies and want to make them available to their customers, but don't force them down the end users throat if the end user has no desire, use or need for these programs.
</p><p>
</p><p>I just want a computer to use as a tool, not a toy.&nbsp; Make a version that is geared for desktop computers, business users, students, researchers, info. geeks, etc...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are more programs that create greater weakness in the security of your computer.&nbsp; Leaving greater openings for hackers to access your computer, or at least making it easier for them to hack your computer.&nbsp; I often wonder how safe are the applications
 in windows store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>RJPaul</p>

    <title>How to regain access to local account logon process when Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don leizer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to regain access to local account  logon process when Microsoft account is locked</h2>
                    <p>Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need urgent help to enable my friend (non technical) to bypass the Microsoft account logon process since he has lost access to his Microsoft Account and the PC is now inaccessible to him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop was accidentally configured to logo on via MS account (Hotmail) instead of local account (MS tricked us to do so)</p>
<p>
</p><p>New MS account was created as part of this process but the password is not accepted &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Online password reset process and MS support cannot help us because we don't have enough info (the fact that it is a new account which was never used is not taken into account)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't want to crack MS security to gain access to an Hotmail account &nbsp;we want to regain access to our own PC via the local account&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me share with you a nightmare story re locked Microsoft account (i am sure our story is not unique).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend's PC was upgraded to Win 10 without his knowledge or approval (MS changed upgrade process which now tricks people to upgrade their OS without their knowledge or approval).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following this upgrade he found some issues. Trying to fix one of the issues resulted in him creating a new Microsoft Hotmail account (the issue he was trying to fix relates to sending mail so it made sense that he would need to configure windows to know
 from which account to send).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having created this account and upon rebooting his laptop he now found that he can't logon to the unit because it is now configured to logon using his new Hotmail account and not his usual local account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>His password credentials were not accepted so he is now locked out of his computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to reset the password using the usual online form failed since he could not answer most of the standard questions because they were not applicable (there is no option to say "Not Applicable").</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.g he was asked to identify the titles (subject) of any emails he sent from that new account and the email address of any recipients of such emails. He was also asked to describe any folders he may have created in the new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say he cannot provide such info because he never logged onto that account and as such never sent anything from it etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also tried to reset the account password via a phone callback (he only registered the landline phone number so could not request that security code be sent to as a text message) but as we live in Australia this process didn't work. (I eventually found
 out that this service is not available in Australia) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually we managed to get access to the Microsoft support line and were now "chatting" to a human via emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This experience turned out to be most frustrating because all they (there were 5 different &nbsp;individuals) can offer is a suggestion to go back to the online form and try again and add more information &nbsp;(even though we tried to explain each time that the account
 has never been used and as such we cannot add such information).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried the automated online process one more time only to be told that this process is now locked to us and it was suggested that as an alternative we should create a new account into which all our contacts etc can be copied from the old account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This option is of no value to us for we have no interest in the old account data etc (it has none) but we are in need to find a way to regain access to the old local account logon process &nbsp;to which my friend has the password (assuming the local account was
 not deleted by Microsoft when it reconfigured the unit to log via Microsoft account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any of you advise us how to regain access to our PC (i assume we can always rebuild it but that would mean that my friend would lose precious data)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Look, I'm glad to help but I cannot advise you as to where to file your help tickets. Only you can do that,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new account, regardless of method, should not affect other accounts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft accounts are like an extension of Windows - Local accounts are the core identitiy of Windows - like how the basement is the foundation. You can always choose to use a local account. I have never signed into Windows with a Microsoft account, and
 I don't ever plan on doing so. I very much prefer domain accounts, but in cases where that is not practical, such as a single PC, a local account will do just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can use any combination of domain/local/Microsoft accounts you want,</p>

<li>Yes this is the first time I have encountered this issue.</li><li>The battery does not overheat when it drains or when plugged into the charger.</li><li>I haven't used any troubleshoot so far except uninstalling the update.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The update installed again when I switched on my Surface today and it decreases the battery life. So I have to keep uninstalling it.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Thanks for getting back to us. Should you wish to prevent Windows from installing updates automatically, here are the options:<br />
<br />
• You can set your internet connection as metered connection. Windows 10 will automatically download updates when connected to a non-metered network/internet, or when you set it back as non-metered connection. To know more on how to set it as metered connection,

    <title>Windows 10 Speech Recognition Only Performs Certain Commands&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> csmith2013  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Speech Recognition Only Performs Certain Commands&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This speech recognition software worked perfect when I first started using it, but after just 1 week of training my computer and using it to type papers in Word, it's not not performing all the simple commands. The most common commands it won't perform when
 I tell it to is: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Select (word)" </em></li><li><em>"Caps (word)" </em></li><li><em>"Correct (word)"</em></li><li><em>"Spell (word)"</em></li><li><em>"Delete (word)"</em></li><li><em>"Insert tab"</em></li><li><em>"Go to (word)"</em></li><li><em>"Go after (word)"</em></li><li><em>"Go to start/end of (word)"</em></li><li><em>"Select (word range)"</em></li><li><em>"Select that"</em> </li></ul>
<p>Everything else it seems to perform. I don't know what to do!! I'm at the point of crawling into a corner and crying out of frustration!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of this issue? Why might it work fine at first and then stop performing those commands?? CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME?!</p>

<p>The first thing I did when I first opened the software was go through the setup process. I then went through the "train my computer" many times and it's still making these mistakes. I also restarted my computer twice and that had no effect on the problem.</p>

<p>Re-reading your original post it is clear you are having problems issuing commands but not clear if&nbsp;you are&nbsp;able to dictate text without a problem? Once the issue of accuracy with dictation as well as command accuracy is clear, I can offer suggestions on
 proceeding. </p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, what microphone are you using? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Marty Markoe, MyMSSpeech.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can dictate text with good accuracy (of course, with the exception of my occasional mumbling to confuse the microphone) especially, after just starting it last week. It will listen and perform other commands I say, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>"delete that"</li><li>"back space"</li><li>"space"</li><li>"new paragraph"</li><li>"click bold/underline/italic"</li><li>"switch to/open <strong>word</strong>"</li><li>and the usual punctuation commands. </li></ul>
<p>I have even added some words into the speech recognition dictionary and recorded my voice saying the words, so that the software doesn't make its usual mistake of putting something else; and it acts as if I haven't added any words at all. It still continues
 to make the same typing mistakes. For example: </p>
<p>
</p><p>I said "my cat" and the software typed "mao cat". So, I had to go into the dictionary to add "my" and I recorded my voice saying that word and it still makes the same "mao" mistake. I swear it's not my enunciation, because I have often tried multiple times
 saying and going through the "spell it" process, and the software STILL types "mao".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought (as in 3 days ago just bought) a really good Logitech headset microphone. Before using that, I was using the laptop speakers and microphone, and the accuracy was definitely not good. But, as soon as I received my headset microphone, I immediately
 went through several "train my computer" recognition processes. I know it's not the headset microphone, because the recognition software has responded more often. However, even though it's responded more often, that doesn't mean it's doing what I tell it to.</p>

<p>If you've followed the steps above and assuming your microphone is not picking up either background noise or static, * it is unlikely the WSRToolkit will give you the increase in accuracy you desire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Test your microphone by making an audio recording. You can download the free
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/files/latest/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Audacity recording app</a>. The playback should be free of background noise and interference.</p>

<h2>            Syncing conversations across iOs devices</h2>
                    <p>I use skype on different iOS devices (iPhone, 2 iPads). Conversations seem to synchronise correctly across different devices but I keep on losing pictures sent by the other party. Why is this?</p>
<p>I read several articles about syncing problems. The usual advice: use latest iOS, latest Skype, log off/on and use the same account on the different devices. All the conditions are met. tried unnstalling/reinstalling, but i keep on losing received pictures.
 Are they not part of the synced conversations?</p>

            It seems there are some limitations to this and its dependent on all devices, not just yours, but the recipients device also running the latest version of Skype.

<br />If they are not, it seems this makes syncing difficult for Skype.

                    <p>I need a product key to extend my visual basic evaluation period. I went through the motions and picked up a new product key from microsoft but when I enter it in I'm hit with a message box "This key can not be used to extend the use of this product."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't even know where to begin to even look for help with this. Is there a number to call? has this happened to other people? And more importantly how do I fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other information: the last time it asked me to renew my product key everything went off with out a problem. Could it be I can only re new product keys so many times before I have to buy the product?</p>

&nbsp;I have just a couple regular Skype contacts, and they show up on my laptop. &nbsp;But one doesn't show up on my Android phone. &nbsp;Because my phone is all things Google, and every device I have should be synced, I don't understand why my Skype contact is missing.</p>

<p><span>Hello CandiceKohl,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please be advised that your
<strong>contacts and credits are tied to your Skype account</strong>. These are saved in the cloud / Skype's servers and you'd be able to access them across different devices and platforms if you are
<strong>logged on your correct account.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is possible that you are signed in to another account.
<strong>Sign out from the Android app and sign in using the very credentials you used to create the account.</strong> If you used a Skype name, sign in with it. If you used an email address, use the same email address.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To check if you have other accounts, kindly refer to this link:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
