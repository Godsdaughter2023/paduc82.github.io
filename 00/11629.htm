<p>
</p><p>I am receiving the following error when attempting to connect an Excel workbook to Azure Analysis Services:</p>

<h2>            Nokia E71 Software update failed - ALL SOLUTIONS TRIED &#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello guys!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first time im dealing with software update on my Nokia E71 device. And here is everything:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>my current firmware verion is:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>100.07.76</p>
<p>08-06-2008</p>
<p>rm-357</p>
<p>nokia e71-2 (236.01)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>i have installed <em>pc suite</em> version:</strong> &nbsp;7.1.26.0</p>
<p><strong>i have installed <em>nokia software updater</em> version</strong>: &nbsp;1.7.3 en</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restarted my pc.</p>
<p>turned off windows (Windows XP SP3) firewall.</p>
<p>I have not installed antivirus, antispyware, or ANY other software that may block user actions</p>
<p>i have an ADSL connection of 5 MBs perfectly working.</p>
<p>my cell phone is in "Normal" profile. and everything is on.</p>
<p>The phone has nothing encrypted.</p>
<p>is connected using USB cable directly to my PC without using any usb hub, and is using "PC suite" USB mode.</p>
<p>Using PC suite i can do EVERYTHING on my device, the only problem is updating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When start the NSU, it identifies the cell phone, and it also identifies that THERE IS an update available, which is: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia E71 (RM-357)</p>
<p>Firmaware Version</p>
<p>Current: 100.07.76</p>
<p>Update: 300.21.012</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I accept the conditions before clicking on "update"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Preparing installation...."</p>
<p>" Updating software, please wait"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RIGHT THERE, it just goes to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>" Software update failed</p>
<p>For iptimun connectivity, your USB ....</p>
<p>Nokia Software Updater has attempet.... three time... &nbsp;bla bal bla bla"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same error 4 times, on three different computers....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have searched and googled 2 days, with no solution... hope you guys can give me a hand here!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>it's not your problem.&nbsp; nokia themselves is missing the file for download.&nbsp; so it's your connection or settings, the file is simply not there for download.</p>

<p>I've been experiencing the exact same problem. Have tried on two different computers, etc etc. It's driving me crazy. I can't understand how something that should be so simple can be so hard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone had any luck updating their firmware? Can we just download an installation file directly to our phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help....please!!</p>

            if you read the other threads, you will see that there is no solution to it as nokia has not fixed this problem on their side.&nbsp; it's not our problem for not being able to update the firmware.

<p>Same problem as others have posted on the E71 Firmware upgrade to300.21.012&nbsp; (from 200.21.118)</p>
<p>v1.7.3en = installed the latest newest version of NSU.</p>
<p>Firewall not an issue or should not be, disabled Norton Internet Security on one PC, tried update on another PC.</p>
<p>If requested by&nbsp; your FW, NSU needs the following files:&nbsp; nsl_host_process.exe&nbsp; and nsu_ui_clien.exe.</p>
<p>As a previous post mentioned, s/w files are not there (at Nokia's site ...)</p>
<p>Nokia, PLEASE notify when files are available etc...</p>

            i was able to upgrade my firmware by just downloading the NSU and using that instead of the PC suite...&nbsp; maybe I am late in the game in upgrading?&nbsp; since I did not have any problem with the errors in downloading and stuff.. right now, I honestly don't
 know what improved on my phone.. the facebook icon is just a shortcut to the default web browser... youtube is nice though.. but is it faster and more stable than the firmware 200? i don't know and I cannot tell...

                    <p>With the newest version of Office 2013 that we have in one of our classrooms, there is an issue when displaying PowerPoint presentations and using Hyperlinks. The issue is that when there is a presenter showing a slideshow in presentation view and they want
 to open a hyperlink to a website in IE or Firefox, it only opens on the Instructor's computer and not on the external display (Projector, TV, etc..).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a workaround or a setting that can be changed in order to allow this to happen? Office 2010 didn't used to do this and it's been a very frustrating problem to try to resolve as there is very little information about resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, switching between presentation modes will not work for this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jack</p>

            <p>PPT 2010 did the same thing depending on the Windows and PowerPoint default settings, but you may have had things set up in such a way that it didn't happen for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try removing the check next to SLIDE SHOW | Monitors | Use Presenter View in PowerPoint. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you prefer to use presenter view, try opening the browser first, moving it onto the second monitor (assuming you've got windows set to Extend Desktop). &nbsp;If you do this before starting the presentation, you should see the browser window on the projector

I'm not sure what your saying.&nbsp; I reinstalled windows, restored my backup files, and then installed Office. I then setup outlook for my email account and the inbox loaded. However, my personal file, contacts, etc. did not appear.

            The question is whether or not you saved and restored the .PST file containing your contacts, etc. Your post would indicate that you originally had more than one of these, or that you're using the default .PST file that Outlook 2010 created when you installed
 it and have not reconnected the one you originally backed up. How did you go about doing the backup to the external drive? What files were saved? When you install and launch Outlook, it creates a new, empty .PST file; configure Outlook with your email account
 info and it will use this new file, but you won't have any of your old data, contacts, calendar, tasks, etc. When restoring the old .PST file, care must be taken to not overwrite the new one, or the Outlook profile can be corrupted. If the old .PST file was
 restored properly, without overwriting the new, default file, then it must be <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/reconnect-your-old-outlook-data-file-HA001077114.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reconnected to Outlook</a>. Once this is done, it can be set as the default.<br />

            OK, I think I'm starting to understand. I used windows system backup to create the system image on the external drive and that where I restored it from. When I go to open files in outlook, its not there unless I select all files. Then I see a file that
 has a BAK extention which looks to be the saved file however I can't open it (not an Outlook data file). Any further ideas and thanks for your patience.

            <p>.BAK files can be any type of file. If you have used an application to take a backup of data, then it is required to install the application first on the computer and then
 restore the data from the application. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a work around you may try to locate and rename the .BAK file extension to .PST and then try opening in Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Outlines and Numbering</h2>
                    <p>I apologize if this has been answered as I have not found it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought older versions of Word (now on 2010) were set up that if I had a multilevel numbering scheme applied to a document and worked in Outline mode the Outline Level and List level were directly linked. &nbsp;That is if I added text and set the Outline Level
 to 1, it automatically assigned List level one. &nbsp;If I demoted the text to Outline level 2, it automatically changed the list level to 2 also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>201 does not appear to work this way. &nbsp;Am I incorrect in the way it worked or did it get changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to make it work like this or do I have to set the Outline and List level separately?</p>

            <p>Outline levels, as seen in Outline view, are not linked to multilevel lists; these are two different things. However,&nbsp;you can create a&nbsp;link yourself by setting up a multilevel list of headings, so that Heading 1 is linked to the level 1 numbering of a multilevel
 list, so that Heading 2 is linked to leevel 2, etc. See <a href="http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html</a>.<br />
<br />
You may also have noticed that there are some built-in numbering schemes that include headings. Look at Home tab | Multilevel List for schemes whose previews contain "Heading 1," "Heading 2."</p>

<p>Thank you for the response. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this gets me much closer but I still think it worked differently in older versions. &nbsp;I think what I believe has changed is more how the Outline function worked. &nbsp;Keep in mind it has been years since I have tried this but I thought that when you promoted/demoted
 a paragraph the paragraphs below adjusted also moving up/down as needed. &nbsp;It does not appear to do that now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe a setting I am missing?</p>

            <p>I believe you are referring to promoting and demoting paragraphs in Outline view, which applies built-in headings. This is the same as it used to be back in 1997.<br />
<br />
What has changed is the interface for outline lists, or multilevel lists as they are called now (since Word 2007).<br />
<br />
To promote and demote headings in Outline view, or multilevel lists in Print Layout view, you can use the same shortcuts: Tab and Shift+Tab.<br />
<br />
For instructions on setting up multilevel lists, see <a href="http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html</a>. The article uses the built-in headings as an example, but obviously you don't have to use those styles.</p>

            I don't recognize that specific symptom, so all I can do is provide you with some generic trouble shooting procedures to try. Off the top of my head I would first suspect an external program or addin, but do work through the trouble shooting process<br />
<br />
<div>
Trouble Shoot Word
<div>
A General Starting point when Word does something unexpected
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word “menu’ go to Tools and then Options, in Word “ribbon” go to File then Options, and study all of the various options,
 both turned on and off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may even get lucky and find some other settings that you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you’re wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time the answer
 was, “I’d use a Word table.” By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
A good, simple quick fix is “Boot your computer”
<p><span>The simplest fix is shutting down your computer normally and restarting it. Often subtle “corruption” happens to create unusual effects. Shutting down and restarting the computer resets all of the
 loaded software, often clearing up strange problems.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><b><span>NO</span>TE:
</b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
Don’t Assume ANYTHING!
<p>Don’t assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesn’t apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just aren’t aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too
 easy to have an unwanted app installed if you don’t carefully read every screen.
</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
Uninstall Recent Software
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Word 2013 Crashes “All the time” - PS CS3 Fonts not compatible with Word 2013: Found out after many test that there’s an incompatibility between Adobe PS CS3 and Word 2013 fonts causing the Word to crash. No clue about a solution except
 not using Adobe fonts on Word.</p>

<p>As well, I just saw this problem and solution:</p>
<p>It started off just affecting the Outlook program, crashing before even opening the data store (OST file). &nbsp;I removed and readded the users' email account to no avail. &nbsp;I then attempted
 a quick office repair, followed by a full repair when the quick repair didn't work (I then had to re-activate Office for some reason...right before Word crashed). &nbsp;Now, after a restart, everything crashes a few seconds after opening with the below report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem signature:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Problem Event Name: BEX</p>
<p>&nbsp; Application Name: WINWORD.EXE</p>
<p>&nbsp; Application Version: 15.0.4535.1507</p>
<p>&nbsp; Application Timestamp: 52282a74</p>
<p>&nbsp; Fault Module Name: unknown</p>
<p>&nbsp; Fault Module Version: 0.0.0.0</p>
<p>&nbsp; Fault Module Timestamp: 00000000</p>
<p>&nbsp; Exception Offset: 0026d778</p>
<p>&nbsp; Exception Code: c0000005</p>
<p>&nbsp; Exception Data: 00000008</p>
<p>&nbsp; OS Version: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.48</p>
<p>&nbsp; Locale ID: 1033</p>
<p>However, I was able to fix it by (and this makes no sense) removing the Epson XP 800 printer software.&nbsp; After talking with the user a bit more after lunch, he informed me that he installed this printer on his personal computer
 and that it also killed his Office pack.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After fully uninstalling all Epson software that would uninstall and a full regedit to remove the parts that wouldn't uninstall I was able to get his Office running again

<p>Another place to look for “interference” is 3rd party tools that use global / windows wide<span>&nbsp;
</span>shortcuts. One of the common classes of this tool is screen capture. Snagit has been identified explicitly by a couple of people, but it is not alone.</p>

<h2>            Multiplying data between query tables with missing values&#47;different sizes</h2>
                    Working in Excel 2010 with PI ProcessBook Datalink.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to multiply numbers between two query tables in Microsoft Excel.&nbsp; The tables are sorted by date, one set of values for each day.&nbsp; I'm trying to put the table information into arrays using VBA to perform further calculations.&nbsp; The tables at the bottom
 shows an example of the data.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first table contains a full list of data over an 8 day period.&nbsp; The second table has a missing value for 4/6.&nbsp; These queries come locked as is in rows and I am unable to put in dummy rows with empty values.&nbsp; I want to be
 able to multiply the values 4/1 by 4/1 etc. and be able to fill a one dimensional array in VBA with 8 values using a 0 to fill in for the element corresponding to 4/6.<br />

<p>I upgraded to V201 and the only difference is that the phone is slower and the battery life reduced. If it was not such a hassle, I would go back to V110. After the upgrade the phone was inoperable for a long time (I eneded up giving up and left it overnight).
 The next morning it was OKish. If the SW needs such a long time&nbsp;to initialise, someone should tell the users about it when you start the upgrade software. Generally dissappointed and sorry that I upgraded.</p>

            <p>I too had the same issue. I figured out how to solve this by going to the Microsoft Edge settings (clicking on the three dots at the top right corner)&gt;settings&gt;view advanced settings&gt;optimize taskbar web search results for screen readers(make sure its turned
 off).</p>
<p>hope this helps..</p>

<h2>            office 365 login redirect</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp; I have Office 365.&nbsp; I stay logged in and the Office 365 site is my home page in IE.&nbsp; Yesterday, I couldn't log in; I kept getting an error message.&nbsp; I finally logged in on someone else's computer, and then when I went back to mine everything worked
 fine.&nbsp; Today I was spontaneously logged out of it.&nbsp; I logged in again, and after entering my password, I was redirected to a website URL bay179.mail.live.com and I was asked if I wanted to create an alias???&nbsp; I said no, then was sent to an Outlook.com page
 with another, empty&nbsp;Outlook Inbox that wasn't my Office 365 account.&nbsp; I closed it all down and went to login.microsoftonline.com to login again.&nbsp; This time the correct page opened (my Office 365 Outlook page) but I noticed the URL said pod51030.outlook.com.&nbsp;
 Usually the URL is outlook.office365.com and so on.&nbsp; I restarted my laptop and started all over and so far things look okay, but what is the deal with this?&nbsp; I can't find much information about these sites and I don't understand why I am being redirected.&nbsp;
 A scam, or phishing site?</p>

<h2>            Outlook e-mail is user unfriendly - I&#39;m unable to use Bcc feature and unable to send to Favorites</h2>
                    <p>As has been noted by many others Outlook is not an upgrade rather a downgrade of service. When we attempt to send a new e-mail it is not possible to immediately put addresses in bcc. If we click where it says cc bcc we only get cc with no apparent reason
 and no apparent way to get to bcc. Additionally, our favorites list does not appear so we have to go through our entire address book. Outlook is extremely user unfriendly. Since we use our e-mail mainly for sending e-mails not for SKYPE or twitter or Facebook
 or any of the other stuff we would like a service that works for sending e-mails not this ****. In reading many of the replies to questions already asked we can see Outlook Help plans to give everyone the usual runaround and no help. Gee, thanks for the upgrade.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I will list out my problems here, and with them happening at the same time,</font><br />
<font color="#000000">it is really frustrating and I can only pray someone can get back to me with a solution...</font><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><em><font color="#000000">1. when I want to add an online service to my Account (Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Google, Skype, Dropbox, I tried them all) I am always stuck forever at Checking with the loading icon.</font></em><br />
<br />
<em><font color="#000000">2. when I open up Nokia Store, it is forever stuck with the loading icon. Strangely though, I can download and install the tools for Developer Mode.</font></em><br />
<br />
<em><font color="#000000">3. when I open up the browser, ie: Web, Aurora, I can only load Google Search (mobile) and its results page. links, bookmarks, other URL will not load at all. on Web all it shows is a tiny portion of the loading bar, which then stucks
 there forever.</font></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I tried to find solutions for these problems, including using the Terminal to purge all wifi and proxy settings using the following commands:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em><font color="#000000">gconftool --recursive-unset /system/http_proxy</font></em></li><li><em><font color="#000000">gconftool --recursive-unset /system/proxy</font></em></li><li><em><font color="#000000">gconftool --recursive-unset /system/osso</font></em></li></ul>
<p><font color="#000000">I also tried setting my WiFi network's proxy settings on my phone to No Proxy as well as Manual, with the settings left blank.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I tried rebooting it many times over to no success.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for everyone's information, my N9 is currently running PR1.3 (40.2012.21-3_PR_005) on MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan. I hope someone out there can pinpoint the root of the cause and provide a solution to the above issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks - I have much hope in this community, thank you!</p>

<p>Those two are within my considerations as last resort, which I unfortunately still had to execute.<br />
I reset the phone to factory settings and tried connecting to all my services again...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nope, still not working.<br />
I was exploring my options and decided to open a virtual access point on my WiFi router.<br />
Turns out that got things working now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think it could be incompatibility with my prior WiFi settings.<br />
Not sure where and how, though.</p>

                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 Enterprise, Outlook 2013&nbsp;in an Exchange 2010 SP2 environment.&nbsp; Cached Exchange mode in not enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been unable to flag an item or manually add a new task for quite sometime (several months).&nbsp; I'm finally reaching out for some help as it would be really useful to have the To Do bar working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The flags are visible in the list&nbsp;of emails, yet do not show the To Do list.&nbsp; The text in the To Do list never changes from "We didn't find anything to show here".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried Outlook.exe /resettodobar to no avail.&nbsp; I have tested this on a Windows 7 Enterprise / Office 2010 PC as well with a similar result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Might this be an Exchange mailbox corruption of some sort?</p>

    <title>Microsoft Access 2007 RunSavedImportExport With Fixed Width Text File - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinfriedman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Access 2007 RunSavedImportExport With Fixed Width Text File</h2>
                    <p>I am wondering if anyone has come across this issue with Microsoft Access 2007 Service Pack 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have built an Access application using a split database. I have a form with several buttons that each import a fixed width text file into a different backend database table. I built the application on my workstation. When I built the saved import, I used
 the wizard and pointed to a fixed width text file located in a directory on my hard drive. I created and saved an import specification. I saved the import. I run the saved import from VBA code in the clicked event for the button on the form. It works fine
 on my workstation but when I copied the application along with the text file to a different workstation, the import failed. In debugging the accd file, I ran the saved import manually on the other workstation and I got a file not found error even though the
 file on the hard drive of the other machine is in the exact same directory structure as the machine from which the saved import was created. I suspected that it was machine dependent and created a new saved import on my development machine but this time I
 put the text file for the import on a network drive.&nbsp;In the wizard to create the saved import, I pointed to the text file on the network drive. I saved this import. I then copied the Access application to a different workstation and ran the saved import using
 the VBA code as before. This time it worked!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect, but I can't prove it as I do not have Microsoft's source code for the RunSavedImportExport function, that when you create a saved import for a text file using a text file that is located on the hard drive, that the workstation name is saved along
 with the directory path to the file. Then when you try to run the application from a different workstation, it can't find the import file because it is tied to a different workstation name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am wondering if anyone in the Microsoft community knows if this is what is occurring and can verify it. I'm thinking that it might have to be a Microsoft engineer or ex-Microsoft engineer who has worked on the Access product and would have access to the
 source code for Access.</p>

            <p>Gina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for replying to my post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The path for the first import was:</p>
<p>C:\Accounting\FinPro\Data_Files</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to put it on the hard drive rather than a network drive for speed.&nbsp; The process would run faster if I used the hard drive rather than a network drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any rate, I have found an answer to my original question about the&nbsp;workstation name being stored in the saved import as well as to what was happening to cause the initial error.&nbsp; With the help of someone's post on a different forum which pointed me to
 look at the XML of the saved import.&nbsp; What follows is what I found:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked at the XML for the saved import specification and determined that the workstation name is NOT a part of the path. But I did notice something that helped me understand what the initial problem was. Here is the partial output of the XML for a saved
 import that was not working:<br />
<br />
: XML : "&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;<br />
&lt;ImportExportSpecification Path = "C:\ACCOUN~1\FinPro\DATA_F~2\IMPORT~1.CSV" xmlns="urn:www.microsoft.com/office/access/imexspec"&gt;<br />
"<br />
<br />
You will notice that the path for the import file is pointing to a file on my hard drive. You will also notice tildes in the path and file name. My original file name had dots in the filename, for example IMPORTB461ALMGMT.DTLML.DAT.20131001164553.csv. I had
 done two things to get it to work. First I replaced the dots in the filename with underscores but left the dot before the file extension .csv. I also moved it to a network drive.
<br />
<br />
I had a hunch that removing the dots would be sufficient to fix the problem with creating the saved import with the file located on the hard drive. But that failed. So I then noticed the tildes in the path name of the XML and thought that the tildes might be
 the problem. So I edited the file name in the saved imports screen (in the Access GUI) removing the tildes and putting the full spelling of the path directory. I also left it pointing to the hard drive. This worked. Then I copied the application to a different
 machine and ran it successfully there.<br />
<br />
So now my application works on any machine when the source of the import file for the saved import is on the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in resolving this. Your post put me on the right path (no pun intended) to figuring out what was going on and how to resolve this.<br />
<br />
Two questions remain unanswered and still puzzle me.<br />
<br />
1) Why it worked on my machine to begin with with the dots in the filename as well as the tildes in the path name.<br />
<br />
2) Where does Access store the XML for saved imports? I could not find it in any of the Access system tables. There were two that pertain to saved imports, namely MSysIMEXSpecs and MSysIMEXColumns. Neither of these tables contain the path of the import file
 or the XML. The only way that I was able to see the XML and the path of the import file was through the code which you so kindly shared with me, CurrentProject.ImportExportSpecification.xml.<br />
But where does Access store this information?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't answer one because I can't answer two.&nbsp; I have never even looked for the path because I don't store it I allow the User to select it at the beginning of the import (and I would imagine how it is stored is why it does not behave the same once moved).&nbsp;
 I create a Form, attached to a table I create, that store the *default* path.&nbsp; However, if the file moves the User can specify the new location and make it the new default.</p>

    <title>Office 2010 programs freeze when trying to save - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashellha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 programs freeze when trying to save</h2>
                    
<p>So, I've seen a bunch of posts of people that are having the same problem that I am having.&nbsp; I recently purchased a new PC with Windows 7 64-bit.&nbsp; I installed office 2010 via an online purchase of the Microsoft Office Professional Academic 2010 and did not
 have any office software installed prior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office programs now freezes approximately 40% of the time when I try to save a document.&nbsp; I've had Word, Excel, and Power Point documents freeze with the save window open.&nbsp; It occurs when I am trying to save new documents and existing documents and I do
 not see a pattern that causes it to freeze.&nbsp; It freezes after selecting the location to save and when I start to type in a new name of the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it freezes I often try to wait for it to respond, but it never unfreezes.&nbsp; Then the only way to stop the program is to force my PC to turn off.&nbsp; Task manager does not kill the program.&nbsp; Very frustrating.</p>
<p>Hope someone has a better solution than the answers I've read on the forums thus far.</p>

<p>I assume that you mean COUNTIFS instead of COUNTIF.</p>
<p>Create formulas in another column, say in cell D1:</p>
<p>=WEEKDAY(A1,2)</p>
<p>and fill down. Then add a pair of arguments to your COUNTIFS formula:</p>
<p>=COUNTIFS(B:B,"&gt;8:00:00",B:B,"&lt;17:59:59",C:C,"wish to make a booking",D:D,"&gt;=6")</p>

<p>Assuming that your data is in columns A through C:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For weekday calls before 8am use:</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((WEEKDAY(A:A)&gt;1)*1,(WEEKDAY(A:A)&lt;7)*1, (C:C="Wish to make a booking")*1,(B:B&lt;0.33)*1)</p>
<p>For weekday calls after 6pm use:</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((WEEKDAY(A:A)&gt;1)*1,(WEEKDAY(A:A)&lt;7)*1, (C:C="Wish to make a booking")*1,(B:B&gt;0.75)*1)</p>
<p>Just add them together if you don't want to use helper columns, e.g.:</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((WEEKDAY(A:A)&gt;1)*1,(WEEKDAY(A:A)&lt;7)*1, (C:C="Query on Existing Booking")*1,(B:B&lt;0.33)*1) + SUMPRODUCT((WEEKDAY(A:A)&gt;1)*1,(WEEKDAY(A:A)&lt;7)*1, (C:C="Query on Existing Booking")*1,(B:B&gt;0.75)*1)</p>
<p>My PC is set up so that Weekday 1 = Sunday, but the results of this formula will vary if it is calculated on a PC that has a different day-of-week assignment. To test, pick a cell and enter =weekday(today()).&nbsp;If you do this today (Wednesday) and the result
 is 4, then your PC is set up the same as mine.</p>
<p>For your second piece, looking at weekends only-&nbsp; just change the weekday parameter. In my case, I would set the first one to &lt;2 (to get 1, which is Sunday) and the second one to &gt;6 (to get 7, which is Saturday).</p>
<p>Times in Excel are expressed as a decimal fraction of the day; .5 is noon, .25 is 6am, .75 is 6 pm, and so on. You can enter any target time (7pm and 9am in your second part) and then reformat that cell as a number to see the decimal value.</p>
<p>Note that these formulas are based on exactly what you requested, but I can't help but wonder if you might want to treat things like Monday (weekday) prior to 8am the same as a weekend 'bin'. You can adjust this formula (which days of the week, and which
 times are being included) based on your actual needs.</p>
<p>HTH,</p>

<p>I tried that formula, and put in: (as per my actual database)

=COUNTIFS(Data!C:C,"&gt;18:00:00",Data!C:C,"&lt;23:59:59",Data!G:G,"Wish to make a booking",I:I,"&gt;6")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it came back with a zero value. Will it calculate a complete number of calls received monday - Friday, or just on&nbsp;one day?</p>

    <title>Lost Mini Calendar in Shortcut View of Folder Pane - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fingaluna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Mini Calendar in Shortcut View of Folder Pane</h2>
                    <p>Morning Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first began using Outlook 2013, there was a small calendar at the top of the Shortcuts view in the Folder Pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the process of adding shortcuts, somehow I messed this up and got an error message, and the calendar vanished. I can't remember the message, but I think it was something about an OLE Registration, Outlook not being correctly installed and to run setup
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the "Repair" of Outlook from the Control Panel. Outlook seems to be working just fine (although I really DON'T like 2013~!), but the little Calendar is gone still...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice to getting this back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to do is to have a little calendar, a contacts shortcut and email folders, all in one view in the Folders/Navigation Pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any assistance~!</p>

            Hello Trevor,
<br />I am sorry to say but it is impossible to set your contacts so that only favorites appear there. There is no option to hide your business contacts on the Skype app.
