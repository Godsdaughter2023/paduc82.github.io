<h2>            Help with HTC Tilt Storage Card</h2>
                    I have a 4 GB storage card in use on my Tilt 8925....it is showing little space left. How do I view the files on the storage card and delete files that are not needed.
<br />
And once the purging of the files has been completed, how do I organize the remaining files.&nbsp;

            You can use File Explorer on you device to view and edit the files or you can use a memory card adapter and view the files on your PC (my preference because I find it easier).

    <title>Slow public folders after migrating to O365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank&#40;ca&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow public folders after migrating to O365</h2>
                    <p>Hi -</p>
<p>
</p><p>We migrated to Office365 earlier this year, and ever since we've been frustrated at the delays when trying to search public folders and/or open emails in public folders. Compared to our prior solution (on-premise Exchange server on a VM, nothing terribly
 beefy), the performance of Office 365 is much slower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's sad is that otherwise the migration has gone smoothly, and we are happy to no longer be running our own Exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of size, we have 40-50 public folders, and the larger folders have 15,000 to 20,000 emails. When I opened a public folder just now to check the number of items, Outlook hung for ~20 seconds. This is a folder with ~15,000 emails.&nbsp; A search of this
 folder takes ~10 seconds. Clicking on an email that is returned by the search takes 5-10 seconds. These actions used to take a few seconds at most with our on-premise solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it that Google can search billions of web pages in a second, and it takes 10 seconds to search 15,000 emails in a public folder in Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that we are not alone in this issue (see reference below), and I would have replied to the question but it shows as locked. We already checked the one concrete suggestion from the link below (we confirmed that our DNS settings point to our local ISP,
 rather than to google).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have this problem? Anyone found a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>
<p>-Frank.</p>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to reply to your post here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I thought it was a PF (public folder) migration issue and it turns out to be the Outlook slow performance issue on the migrated PF to Office 365 after I read the whole post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I should say I understand your concern. Secondly, I should say it is really not that tough comparing it with a migration issue. Currently, we can get the following information from your post.</p>
<p>1. You have tens of PFs&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Each of the PF has tens thousands of emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it is known to all that more and more folders and more and more items in the folders will affect the Outlook to be a slower performance. In addition, Outlook online mode will let the Outlook client retrieve the data from the server side with a short
 intervals about several seconds. Supposing you have many folders and each folder has quite a large volume of items, this should cause the Outlook client to be slower than that has the less data (folders, items in folders) of the Outlook client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely, I know you may be using the Outlook cached mode (actually, we recommend our users use Outlook cached mode for Office 365/Exchange). But, the Outlook client performance will also be affected via how many data you cached. For example, you have
 a large volume of data in the mailbox (folders, PFs), you cached the data to be "All". This is no difference comparing with Outlook online mode. It will also cause a slower Outlook performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion, for this scenario, I suggest</p>
<p>1. Make sure you are using the latest Outlook client version.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5</a></p>
<p>2. You are using the Outlook cached mode (and setting the cached mode to "3 months or 1 month").&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-on-Cached-Exchange-Mode-7885AF08-9A60-4EC3-850A-E221C1ED0C1C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-on-Cached-Exchange-Mode-7885AF08-9A60-4EC3-850A-E221C1ED0C1C</a></p>

<p>Hi Alan -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirmed that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) We are using the latest Outlook client. When I go to File | Office Account | Office Updates | Update Options | Update Now, it reports "The latest version of Office is installed on your computer". About Outlook reports "Version 1905 (Build 11629.20246
 click-to-run) Monthly Channel".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) We are using Outlook cached mode. When I go to File | Account Settings | Account Settings | (account name) | Change, the box is checked next to "use cached exchange mode" and the "download email for past" is set to 1 year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should we try next to fix this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>-Frank.</p>

<p><span>Hi Frank,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Appreciating your update.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Previously, as we discussed, Outlook slow performance will be affected by the "more and more folders and more and more items in the folders". So, currently, I think you can try</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. To set the cached mode to "10 months, 5 months...1month" until you find it performs better.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. To reduce the size of the PFs, for example, you can move the data into a public place, ie "a shared mailbox", "an Office 365 group".&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Actually, it is recommended that our customers to backup the data and reduce the size of the mailbox (folders) so that a large volume of data won't affect the Outlook performance. I do understand that some users may not be able
 to do so in considering some special reason. So for your scenario, I can think it over and provide the above suggestions.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Alan -</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>1. To set the cached mode to "10 months, 5 months...1month" until you find it performs better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I'm sure that we could decent performance if we set the cached mode to 1 week, but what would be the point of having searchable folders if they only go back one week? Our typical use-case
 is that an engineer is looking for the history on a ticket, or a customer service representative is looking back at terms for a one-year contract. So shortening the cached mode to "10 months, 5 months... 1 month" is a non-starter for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&gt; 2. To reduce the size of the PFs, for example, you can move the data into a public place, ie "a shared mailbox", "an Office 365 group".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Is there a checklist for transitioning mail-enabled public folders to a shared mailbox? I did a quick search and didn't find anything helpful. Would each mail-enabled public folder need to be migrated to a separate shared mailbox?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Most importantly:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Previously we had Outlook on our desktops connected to (our) Exchange server in an offsite facility, and the performance of public folders in Outlook was acceptable.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) Now we have Outlook on our desktops connected to (Microsoft's) Exchange Servers in an offsite facility, and the performance of public folders in Outlook is frequently terrible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How can it be that Microsoft's Exchange servers provide worse performance than our own Exchange server? That does not seem logical to me :-)</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Frank,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I totally understand your concern.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, as for your mentioned “<span>Our typical use-case is that an engineer is looking for the history on a ticket, or a customer service representative is looking back at terms for a one-year contract” （I know it is an example),
 never mind, to set up "cached mode to 1 week" doesn't affect the search of "history of ticket" or "a one-year contract" as Outlook should still look for all the content in the mailbox while you make a search.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As for your mentiond "<span>Microsoft's Exchange servers provide worse performance than our own Exchange server", this should not be logic for you definitely. We recommend our customers use the Exchange Cached mode.
 But setting up the "cached mode time duration" depends on how many items in the customers' mailboxes. The more items in the mailbox, the less time duration of the "cached mode". And actually, it doesn't affect the search result of Outlook search.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p>Hi Alan -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the followup. I was interested to hear that Outlook will display search results from longer than the cache period, as you state here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;<span>never mind, to set up "cached mode to 1 week" doesn't affect the search of "history of ticket" or "a one-year contract" as Outlook should still look for all the content in the mailbox while you make a search.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to verify this statement with a test, but was unable to do so. Here is what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I confirmed that I am using cached Exchange mode, with "download email for the past" set to "1 year".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I added one of our public folders, e.g. Folder1, to favorites (right-click on the public folder Folder1 | add to favorites).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I waited for synchronization to complete on Folder1 inside Public Folders | All Public Folders | Favorites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I opened Folder1 from the Favorites folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I confirmed that the oldest email present in Folder1 in the Favorites folder is approximately 1 year old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Still in Favorites|Folder1, I searched for a keyword that I know is present in email both younger than 1 year (so should be visible in the favorites folder), and *older* than 1 year (so would not be visible in the favorites folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) The result: Only emails from the past year are shown in the search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) And, when I search Folder1 in the regular public folders, search appears to now be broken. When I enter a term in the search box and press enter, I see the word "searching..." in the main pane, and the 5 sliding dots above it, and it never completes (I
 waited 5 minutes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) Note that I *can* still search in other public folders, and get results. It's only in Folder1, which I added to favorites, that search appears to be broken in the original public folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in summary:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I search a public folder that has been placed in favorites, I *do not* see search results beyond the length of the "cached email" setting. E.g. I suspect that if I shorten the cached email setting to 1 month, I would be limited to searching the public
 folder (in favorites) to one month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) After adding a public folder to favorites, search is broken for the original public folder. I do not know if this is a replicable problem or not - it's just the case in this one example that I tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Public folder performance with Office365 is much slower than it was when we maintained our own in-house Exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your assistance, but we don't appear to be making much progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way we can escalate this problem or should I open a support case to pursue a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>-Frank.</p>

</p><p><span><span>Can you clarify if it is OK in OWA? If so, it should be an Outlook client side performance issue.

<p>Hi Alan -</p>
<p>
</p><p>For security reasons, we typically do not use OWA. So I am not all that familiar with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to add a public folder to my favorites in OWA, but I do not see a way to search within a particular public folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the Search input box at the top and click on filters, I see an option for "Search in", but the drop-down list that starts with "all folders" does not list my public folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible in OWA to search in a particular public folder???</p>

            <blockquote>......but it will only let me do one-one relationships e.g for a buyer could have many property viewings but i can only do one-one</blockquote>
<br />
That suggests that the foreign key BuyerID column in BookedViewings is indexed uniquely.&nbsp; It should be indexed, but not uniquely, i.e.
<i>'duplicates allowed'</i>.<br />
<br />
A few general points:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Don't include spaces in table or column names.&nbsp; Use CamelCase or represent a space with an underscore character like_this.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; As far as possible use plural or collective nouns as table names, e.g. Buyers.&nbsp; This reflects the fact that a table is a set.&nbsp; As far as possible use singular nouns as column names (which you've done).&nbsp; This reflects the fact that a column represents an
 attribute.<br />

    <title>PowerPoint Alters Recording Quality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> levi44  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint Alters Recording Quality</h2>
                    <p>So, I have a USB microphone that I have been recording with for a very long time, and has caused me no problems before. Well, as of today, whenever I use the recording feature in PowerPoint 2016, the audio quality sounds fuzzy and muffled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I recording using the microphone in a program like Audacity, it sounds flawless. I checked in the control panel, and the USB mic is the one that's on, and when I recorded in PowerPoint, I even tapped the microphone to ENSURE that that was the one recording,
 and it was (because at first, I was convinced that it was somehow switching to the built-in mic upon recording, but that's debunked now). I also made sure that the levels were the same in the control panel and Audacity, and they were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort, I saved the audio from the recorded PowerPoint as a media file, AND converted the PowerPoint to a wmv file in order to see if it was only a playback error, but it is even fuzzy in the raw audio and video files. Any suggestions would be
 greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Levi</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Here is a bit of troubleshooting follow-up information:</p>
<p>If I record in Audacity and PowerPoint simultaneously, they still sound substantially different. (Idk how that's even possible)</p>
<p>If I import audio from Audacity to PowerPoint, the quality is the same as in Audacity, meaning the error is in the recording in PPT, not the playback</p>
<p>This change occurred upon updating to the most recent Office; IS there a way to go back an update?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't have any ideas as to what might be causing the problem, but since you mention that the recording works well in Audacity, you might want to try a free add-in of mine that helps you record in Audacity, split the narration into one file per slide then
 automatically insert the sounds into the presentation (at YOUR choice of quality and linked vs. embedded, which PPT doesn't allow on its own).</p>

<h2>            Connected accounts send as instead of on behalf of</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>our customer has Office 365 with Exchange and it is working fine (domain B). They also have external email (domain a)that is not migrated to exchange online yet, but hosted on 3rd part.</p>
<p>They have added this domain A to their Exchange online mailbox in OWA using this guide: https://support.office.com/nb-no/article/Koble-til-e-postkontoer-i-Outlook-p%c3%a5-nettet-Office-365-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d?ui=nb-NO&amp;rs=nb-NO&amp;ad=NO</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they send email from domain A, the recipient sees it as On-behalf of. Is it possible to change it so it is shown without the on behalf of? Like using send as permission?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>

There is no official document about this.<br />

What I can tell is the "Sent on behalf of" shows up for safety purposes since the email provider of the connected account and Office 365 are totally different systems.<br />

            <p>Hi Franky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now done some tests. First I tried to connect Hotmail, Yahoo and gmail as connected account in my Office365 account. I tried setting up using IMAP, but they all fail with "a test connection to that account was not successful. Either wrong username
 or password"</p>
<p>This is not true, since I have confirmed they are all correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then&nbsp; setup my Office365 account in my Hotmail as "connected accounts". This worked fine and if I use smtp.office.com as outgoing server and there is no on behalf of when it is sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why this is working on a Hotmail account but not Office365 account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think for this to work, the out going server, should be where the mailbox is. In our customers case it should be smtp server of their current provider.</p>

            Hi Off2w0rk,<br />
<br />
I’d like to explain that Outlook.com, Hotmail, Gmail, etc. and Office 365 are totally different email systems. Like mentioned above, it’s by-design that the "Sent on behalf of" shows up for safety purposes and it is not feasible to get rid of the “on behalf
 of” for the time being. Thanks for your understanding. Meanwhile, you are welcome to vote for the feature in the following link:<br />

<br />
Regarding you couldn’t add Hotmail, Yahoo and Gmail accounts as connected accounts, as it’s a quite different issue, I suggest you post a new thread with the detailed error message and our engineers will involve in the thread efficiently.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry but that safety issue is complete nonsense. I have been using Hotmail connected accounts for 25 yrs and never had any issue with "safety" or spam messages, was able to send email from my connected accounts and was able to select if "On Behalf
 Of" will appear in relation to my connected account or not.</p>
<p>Since upgrade to new Outlook Email (about 3 weeks ago) the whole system went pear shaped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When people reply to my email sent from connected account in their reply message appears the following line:</p>

</p><p>FROM:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">&nbsp;<em>"My Name"</em> [mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***]&nbsp;</span><strong>On Behalf Of</strong><em>"My
 Name"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And the worst thing is that people area asking me if there are problem with my connected account email, obviously since they can see message was delivered by Hotmail (Outlook) on behalf of connected account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is simply unacceptable!! And I really do not want to hear explanation this is fro "safety" or similar reasons. If your main competitor Gmail allows connected accounts to be set-up in any way I like it to set it up then I would expect that Microsoft
 does the same at least, if not better. But Microsoft decided actually to stop providing one of the basic services related to connected accounts.</p>
<p>Or Microsoft is trying to force all of us who use connected accounts to pay subscription for Outlook.com in which case all of sudden "safety" issue disappear and we can choose to send messages with or without "On Behalf Of".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after 25 yrs of being loyal Hotmail user I am forced to switch &nbsp;to Gmail in order to be able to send emails from connected account where "On Behalf Of" will not appear.</p>

<h2>            Icon &#40;Nokia Lumia 929&#41; Flash LED not working</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried resetting the Microsoft Camera, installing and uninstalling Nokia Camera. I did a soft reset of the phone itself. No Flashlight apps work and there is no physical damage to the camera or LED (I have dropped the phone in the past, but the flash
 LED has functioned since then so I believe this can be ruled out as a cause). I just noticied it the other day when I tried to use my flashlight. Has anyone else had this issue? I have done searches, but I only have seen this with other model phones. I would
 like to avoid sending my phone in or getting a replacement as I use it for work and being without a phone is not an option for me.</p>

<h2>            Hyperlinks to spreadsheets within a workbook on Excel for Mac 2016 not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to create hyperlinks to a specific cell in a different worksheet within the same workbook. &nbsp;When I click on the hyperlink, it does not go to the cell indicated. &nbsp;Rather, it goes to the last cell used. &nbsp;For example, if I hyperlink to cell B4,
 but the last time I was in the file, the last cell I clicked on was D4, the hyperlink just goes to D4. &nbsp;I noticed that this was not an issue in Excel for Mac 2011, so am wondering if this is a bug in Excel 2016. &nbsp;I am currently on Excel for Mac 2016 version
 15.23. &nbsp;If anyone has suggestions, I would appreciate the help!</p>

<p>Hi Samir0618,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, please make sure that you followed the correct steps to add hyperlinks to spreadsheets within a workbook:</p>
<p>1. Select a cell you want and right click on it.</p>
<p>2. Choose Hyperlink option, add hyperlink to the cell you want.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/917f8ae9-a858-4eda-adfc-34debda5ea81?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/917f8ae9-a858-4eda-adfc-34debda5ea81?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/422a8b2c-9823-4fe7-bcb7-a6ec865041d4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/422a8b2c-9823-4fe7-bcb7-a6ec865041d4?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>3. Then when you click the Hyperlink, you will go to the B2 in Sheet2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ab644c7-3464-45f1-8eb1-4e63bf2f2281?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ab644c7-3464-45f1-8eb1-4e63bf2f2281?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the latest version of Excel for Mac is 16.9, we suggest you update your Excel to the newest version.</p>
<p>You can open Excel &gt; click Help on the top menu &gt; choose check for update, then update your Excel.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rosen</p>

                    I have been using Outlook to retrieve mail from my Yahoo! account for years. &nbsp;However, in the past month, it has stopped working. &nbsp;I have been in contact with Yahoo! to try to resolve this, but they have not been able to. &nbsp;I don't know if this is a Microsoft
 problem or a Yahoo! problem. &nbsp;Everything Yahoo! has tried to get this issue resolved has failed. &nbsp;Hoping someone can help resolve this.

            <p>The error code 17897 is an authentication error code. </p>
<p>When this happens there is something wrong with how you are authenticating with the servers.</p>
<p>That is why deleting the profile and recreating it sometimes works. </p>
<p>Here is an article that explains it more fully.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2492901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sending email error "Authentication failed. Error 17897" in Outlook 2011 for Mac</a></strong></p>
<p>If you search the internet for the error code 17897 you will see that authentication is the problem.</p>
<p>When a problem like this occurs and you did not make any changes then it is likely that the Internet Service Provider (ISP)&nbsp;has made changes and it is usually to the outgoing mail server or aka SMTP server.</p>
<p>The reason these sudden changes occur is because of hackers attempting to send spam email through SMTP servers in order to send you and me spam or phishing email or worse a virus.</p>
<p>Internet Service Providers (ISP's), in order to dissuade this activity must constantly either effect changes on SMTP servers such as requiring secure authentication or setting up a port on the server to require Secure Socket Layers (SSL).</p>
<p>If your ISP is insisting that it is a problem with Outlook then I don't know if we will be able to find a solution because every ISP has different settings for their servers.
</p>
<p>I can only suggest at this point that you double and triple check your Incoming and (especially) outgoing email settings for the server.</p>
<p>Oh and additionally, I use Yahoo also but I must have a paid account in order to get it to work with Outlook. The free Yahoo accounts do not work.</p>

<p><span>If&nbsp; the&nbsp;overall&nbsp; performance of the computer is slow then please refer the following methods:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may try to optimize Windows 7 for better assistance and check if it resolves the issue. Refer the following link to do the same:
<br />
<strong><span>Optimize Windows 7 for better performance.</span></strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run a defragmenting the hard disk on the computer and check if the transfer rate is increased. Refer the following link for more information:</span></p>

<h2>            Cannot access email - &#34;this site can&#39;t be reached&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just logged onto my email 15 minutes ago, and it worked fine, but when I tried to go back a few minutes ago to answer something, it was suddenly not working? Multiple attempts just yield the same result, which reads:</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">
<div>

This site can’t be reached
<p>The webpage at&nbsp;<strong>https://outlook.live.com/owa/</strong>&nbsp;might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.</p>
<div>ERR_FAILED</div>

</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>I also temporarily checked on my phone whether I could access Outlook, and it said that it "could not access it because the server did not exist". However, a re-attempt got it working on the phone, yet it still doesn't on the computer. I am using Chrome,
 so I don't know if this related or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping it is as simple as waiting and it will be fixed/that this is just a little error with nothing really behind it, but I'm not sure. I'm seeing some other people having some issues accessing their accounts with similar errors (nothing the same, though),
 but not a large amount, so I'm wondering if this is more of an isolated incident than large like the whole Easter debacle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not even an hour after "solving" this issue by clearing my cache, is this now happening again to me. That, plus the fact that not just I but also you, and presumably a few others due to the "I have the same question" button here, are getting
 this message, makes me think it is something to do with Microsoft and not due to our browsers/emails/etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to bother continuously clearing my cache to temporarily solve the issue, there's no point... The only thing I think we can do is wait for Microsoft to fix it permanently rather than just going with the temporary solution. Hopefully this is
 soon and quickly...</p>

<p>...Inevitably, literally thirty seconds after posting that last reply, it now miraculously works again. Yay, I guess?? This appears to be an on-and-off issue, but at least some comfort can be taken in that it also does not appear to be on anyone's individual
 end - not due to a virus or hacking or browser or computer issue, etc., etc. It's all on Microsoft's end, from what I gather, due to it working one second and then not the next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine just waiting for a bit will allow you to access your email, though it might randomly not work the next time after that. Or if you need to access your email immediately, I would just go with the "temporary" solution of clearing your cache of the
 past 24 hours - that did it for me when I needed to check my email right away, even though it has since gone back to the issue and then resolved itself since... I also imagine that I will continue seeing this problem for a while longer. It's really annoying
 and inconvenient, to be quite honest.</p>

<h2>            Can I install Visio 2007 on a second portable PC for use when out of the office.</h2>
                    <p>One of our users has Visio 2007 installed on her desktop PC.</p>
<p>She's asked for it to be installed on her laptop so can be used when offsite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NB think it's just the Standard version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this 2nd install covered by the licence or do I need to buy another copy of Visio?</p>

            You need to figure out what type of license it is. How was it bought? Look for the Product Key sticker or Certificate Of Authenticity. Look for the 3 character license code. What you are hoping to see is "FPP" or an explicit mention of "Retail License".
 A retail or FPP license allows you to install on a second computer for the use of the primary user.<br />
<br />
Go to the help dialog and find the License Terms. In Word 2007 it is hidden in Office button / Word Options button / Resources option / About button. There is a hyperlink to the License terms.<br />

<h2>            Office 2016 OneDrive for Business - no overlays and bad sync experience</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am facing a very bad user experience on Windows 10 with OneDrive for Business 2016:</p>
<p>1. Every time I sync a new library, a couple of files show up as having timed out and that they should "sync eventually", which they never do. Only fix is to delete them server-side, re-sync, restore from site recycle bin, re-sync. Not an ideal process,
 I must say!</p>
<p>2. After syncing more than just my personal folder, the explorer window ceases to show sync overlays for the O4B folders. Normal OneDrive still shows them correctly.</p>
<p>Anyone else face the same issue?</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<p>And just to pre-empt the previous responses: </p>
<p>Office 2016 is up to date (16.0.4229.1024),</p>
<p>The problem is NOT due to the O4B client not having been started</p>
<p>This happens persistently on new library syncs so repairing / unsyncing/resyncing, etc. will NOT help</p>
<p>The affected files are random (every time it's different files that are affected) with one thing in common: They are usually very small in size. So it's nothing that is caused by the files themselves</p>
<p>Lastly, even though the occurrence is almost 100% on new library syncs, it also sporadically happens when another user adds a large number of files and those files get synced to my machine</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>Since you have narrowed down the issue from some ways, we can see the issue should have nothing to do with the files in the site (but just in case, can you try syncing with another user account or using your account on another sync client?).</p>
<p>Then let’s try to troubleshoot it from the client side:</p>
<p>1. To check if the issue is caused by the corrupted cache, please try clearing OneDrive for Business cache. The "Fix it tool" below can be used to clear OneDrive for Business cache:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627</a>. (if you encounter any error when running the tool, please manually clear the cache as the verified answer in
this thread said)</p>
<p>2. For the second issue, the icon overlays don't appear on synchronized files and folders, it might occur because OneDrive for Business doesn't
<strong>restart</strong> after you install Office 2016.</p>
<p>Would you mind performing these steps to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>a) Manually start the OneDrive for Business Desktop app by using the Start menu.</p>
<p>b) Restart the computer.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> After you restart your computer, you shouldn't have to manually start OneDrive for Business again. The OneDrive for Business Desktop app should start on its own and then sync your libraries.</p>
<p>Also, for the best practice to solve this issue, please open a new thread on this forum if the issue persists after you try the steps above.</p>
<p>You can let me know the updates on the first issue when you have time.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>April</p>
        </p>

<p>OK, so...</p>
<p>The Fixit tool as well as any other method of clearing the cache will not have any impact, since the exact same symptoms happen also after freshly installing Windows 10 plus Office 16 onto a new, blank, machine.</p>
<p>The restart, I thought I had this already covered in my previous email. The client is started and the overlays are absent even after numerous reboots.</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>So, you have tried installing Office 2016 on another Win10 machine but the issue persists. Haven’t you? If this is the case, it will be much appreciated if you can upload some pictures about the sync error and the whole situation. I&nbsp;will check the errors
 and do my best to help you.</p>

<p>hi april,</p>
<p>yes, that's the case - it persists over a number of fresh installations.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7a0e104a-5269-41b9-ab7a-87da29db13fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7a0e104a-5269-41b9-ab7a-87da29db13fb" /></a></p>
<p>the above is the main error dialog - the actual file(s) at which this hits vary but the outcome is always the same. and, before you ask, no amount of waiting and hitting "sync now" will make this go away. the only way to remove this is by going into sharepoint
 online, deleting the file from the server, syncing the client and then restoring the file from the site's recycle bin. after that, it behaves as normal again.</p>
<p>now, the missing overlays look like this (note the missing icon overlays for "sync complete (green tick mark)"</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=053c1bad-5611-49ce-b0ce-87bf4fbc5de8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d053c1bad-5611-49ce-b0ce-87bf4fbc5de8" /></a></p>
<p>funnily enough, when i go into, let's say, word 2016 and hit the file/open dialog, i get this:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a6154a2d-83f1-4a90-87fe-9ae699453d2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da6154a2d-83f1-4a90-87fe-9ae699453d2a" /></a></p>
<p>so it's an awkward inconsistency that only applies to the normal explorer windows, yet not to the file/open dialog of microsoft word.
</p>
<p>note also that when using any app that uses the os-built-in dialogs like notepad, the overlays are gone again. it only works in word or other programs that come with their own open dialogs.</p>
<p>does that help?</p>

            I believe what you're actually looking for may be <strong>Tools&gt; Track Changes - Compare Documents</strong>, which is still in the same place in Word 2016. However, it just takes you to the same dialog as the
<strong>Tools&gt; Combine Documents</strong> command &amp; the <strong>Compare</strong> button on the
<strong>Review</strong> tab of the <strong>Ribbon</strong>.<br />

<h3> gary rosin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting Automatic Footnote Numbers to Custom Numbers</h2>
                    
<p>I have an existing Word document (Word 2003) that has footnotes with automatic numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) of the reference numbers.&nbsp; How can I change the format of the footnote reference numbers to "Custom" using the existing automatic numbers?</p>
<p>I know that I could work backwards through the document, select &amp; copy the footnote text of each footnote, delete the old foonote, insert a new footnote at the same location, insert the number of the old footnote in the "custom" field, and paste the text
 from the old footnote into the new footnote.</p>
<p>But the document has over 100 footnotes, so I need a macro that either does all that copying and such, or directly changes the footnote reference numbers themselves.&nbsp; I've written some VBA macros, but not for a while, so I'm not as familiar with the Word
 2003 Object model as I should be.</p>
<p>TIA,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

Thanks, but so far as I can tell, that just tells me how to insert a footnote with a custom reference mark, but not (i) how to change an auto-numbered reference mark to a custom one, or (ii) what object &amp; properties to use for a macro that runs through the
 index numbers of the Footnotes Collection to make the changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On further experimenting with the document, I see that, in the footnotes pane,&nbsp;I can right-click on a footnote reference mark, and access 'Note Options" and manually change to a custom mark.&nbsp; But when I turned on the macro recorder, I could no longer right-click
 the reference mark.&nbsp; Does that mean that the "Note Options" can't be changed via a macro, or just that the action is not one that can be recorded?&nbsp; Presumably, the "Note Options" for a footnote are stored somewhere, but I can't find it in the object browser.</p>
<p>Update:&nbsp; the manual method lets me inset a reference mark in the note, but does not either (i) delete the extisting reference mark, or (ii) change anything in the main text.</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 Text Effects change line spacing</h2>
                    <p>Applying Word's text effects (glow, shadow, reflections, etc...) to a line of text containing manual line breaks can profoundly change line spacing.&nbsp; Also, different combinations of text effects result in different line spacing values.&nbsp; How does Word calculate
 the new line spacing value?</p>

            <p>I don't know that you (or anyone) can come up with a formula -- or more precisely, you could come up with many formulas, one for each combination of effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, the process is the same as when you insert an inline graphic or change the font size of a single character or word in a paragraph that has "At Least" line spacing. The baseline-to-baseline spacing expands to allow room for the largest object
 in the line. In some cases the additional space is at the top of the line containing the object, and in others (especially Reflection) it's below that line. Glow seems to add much more space than needed, while Outline doesn't seem to add any. With combinations
 of effects, I think it adds as much space as the effect with the greatest size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to measure a particular combination, go into the Paragraph dialog and set the line spacing to Exactly 12 pt (or some other starting amount) and then increase it until the paragraph looks the same as it does with At Least spacing -- that will
 tell you the baseline separation created by the effect.</p>

    <title>Avoid Syncing Contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seaoar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Avoid Syncing Contacts</h2>
                    <p>I am new to Smart phones and have recently bought a Windows 8.1 phone. When I placed my SIM in it,&nbsp;I couldn't see any phone # to call. My friend&nbsp;imported the phone numbers or contacts (I don't know what's the right word for it) from the card to the phone.
 After a while, I needed to use Skype on my phone, and he configured Outlook on my phone to receive the update. After that, I found out that my phone numbers/contacts have been exported into my Hotmail/Outlook.com account. I deleted them all from my Hotmail/Outlook.com,
 and I went to the People app and removed the 2 check boxes that shows contacts from Outlook and Skype, But I'm still seeing some Skype contacts in the phone book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am not sure how accurate the above description is, but I want to have my SIM card numbers which were available in my old basic phone to be available in my new smart phone in the People app so I can edit them (rather than ring someone just for touching
 his or her name in the phone book). However, I want both Outlook and Skype on my smart phone to stop interfering and mixing with my mobile contacts/phone numbers which are available on my old phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help?</p>

            <p>If I was you I'd keep the contacts on outlook.com, it's the same account but if you change your phone or SIM card then you will still have your contacts without having to enter them again.
</p>
<p>If you open people and select a contact you week see a pencil symbol this will allow you to edit the number without accidently ringing them. It would be better having both phone numbers and Skype on your contacts for easier access you can link them together,
 using the link button on each contact which looks like chain so you don't have duplicate names.
</p>
<p>If you don't want this then it looks like you might have a contact on your Microsoft account without any information except a Skype contact.

            <p>I do understand all the benefits of syncing all my contacts and the potential loss of not having it done. And still I want my smart phone to act like my old basic phone with regards to my contacts (I bought it for other purposes). I want to have in People
 only and excursively my SIM card contact like in any basic phone, and I want to keep Outlook and Skype completely away from my SIM like if they were on my PC not on my smart phone. Is this possible? I appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>It's not possible.&nbsp; Other than importing your contacts from your SIM card and making phone calls via the SIM, the SIM card is not used to store any data on a windows phone....in fact, if you make any changes to your contacts after they have been imported
 from the SIM card to the phone's memory, the changes will be made to the contact in the phone's memory, but there's not a way to make those changes to the contact that is still stored on the SIM card......if you add new contacts, you'll add them to the phone's
 memory and not the SIM card.</p>

<p>It doesn't actually mix them, it just displays them together. If you have a source of information about people, Outlook contacts, Skype, Facebook, it will display them all in one place. You cannot prevent the device from being aware of those sources, without
 deleting them, but you can affect what is displayed in People. At the top of the People app, you will see Contact, showing...and a clickable link. Mine says 'some accounts'. Click that and it will provide you the option of selecting which sources are actually
 displayed. It will not delete any information and a search will retrieve entries that are not shown in the People contact list. &nbsp;Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>OK, that makes more sense now. So People is just a place to view whatever I want from whatever I configured on my phone, Outlook, Skype or whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned above I deleted all the contacts that moved&nbsp;from my phone to Outlook. I did it from my PC. And after reading your reply, I connected my phone to the net, synced Outlook, went to the 'Contact, showing...' link&nbsp;in People, and&nbsp;I made sure both
 Outlook and Skype checkboxes&nbsp;are checked. As Outlook contacts have been delete, I now only see Skype contacts in People.&nbsp;Finally I&nbsp;cleared both Outlook and Skype checkboxes, so People shows no contacts now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I go to the phone place, there is an icon that shows saved contacts. When I touch it, it shows a list titled 'CALL A CONTACT'. Now only Skype contacts show there (although I've cleared its checkbox in People). Question #1: Is there a way to remove
 Skype contacts from that area?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question #2: How to show SIM contacts in one or both of 'CALL A CONTACT' and People? They have all disappeared from both places!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question #3: How to edit a contact in the SIM with this phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question #4: How can I make sure no contact will ever&nbsp;go to Outlook again?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Answer: No way, unfortunately :(</p>
<p>Unfortunately after becoming behind in smart phones and tablet computers, Microsoft blindly followed its competitor, Apple, in making rigid systems that do what the programmers and marketers assume
 people will like. Microsoft totally ignored its legacy in attracting users by making programs that gives users options in what they want. I don't understand why they should force someone to back up their contacts online? A direct csv file shouldn't be an option?
 And why do I have to completely discard the SIM card memory?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, I think this is a bad approach to follow without distinguishing between what made Apple take the mobile market (like their foresight when you was busy with Windows Vista) and what made you take the PC market like the flexibility and friendliness
 of you Windows operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to see you building on your originality.</p>
