    <title>Table hugging top margin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hans  l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Table hugging top margin</h2>
                    Hello:<br />
<br />
Darn table! It hugs the top margin on whatever page it is on. And if I add line breaks at the bottom of the
<i><b>preceding</b></i> page (1), when I come to the end of that page (1), and click Enter once again (so that the cursor ends up at the top of the next page (2)), the table is
<i><b>not</b> </i>pushed down one line on that page (2), but is pushed to the next page (3).<br />
<br />
When I look in outline mode, I see nothing unusual. <br />
<br />
What could have happened, and what can I try to get out of this "pretzel hold"?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Hans L<br />

<p>Hi Reggie,</p>
<p>To clarify the situation, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.Which subscription are you using, Office 365 Business/ Enterprise or else?<br />
2.What did “How to forward emails” refer to, automatically forwarding or manually forwarding?<br />
3.If you have subscribed to the Office 365 plan which contains Outlook Web App, where do you want to forward emails, in the Outlook client or in Outlook Web App?</p>
<p>In addition, if you want to automatically forward emails in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a>, you can perform the following steps: login to Outlook Web App-&gt;click the gear icon-&gt;<strong>Options-&gt;Mail-&gt;Accounts-&gt;Forwarding</strong>-&gt;add the email address-&gt;click
<strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Zoey</p>

            Hi sunny&amp;bright
<br />
<br />Did you just copy the CDA files form the CD's into your laptop?
<br />
<br />If so, that will not work, CDA files are just shortcuts to the music on a CD, they are not the actual music files, the audio on a CD is actually stored in hidden wav files . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />Right click one of those CDA files and choose properties - what size is one of those files?

            Good Morning<br /><br />I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news on this. A .cda is simply a directory reference that points to the music file location on the CD. Unfortunately, it is correct that without having the CD you would not be able to complete this action.

<p>
</p><p>One way to have at least one previous version available is to check the box for "Always create backup copy" at
<strong>File | Options | Advanced: Save</strong>. The second time you save a document, the first version is preserved as "Backup of &lt;filename&gt;.wbk," and each time you save thereafter, that file is replaced with the next-to-newest version.</p>

            I don't think there's an easier way in Excel 2003. In Excel 2007 and later you can set the number of items to be retained to None in the interface, but in earlier versions you need code.

<p>Hello Thanos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The contacts on your phone are always synced to your Microsoft account. You can check if it is synced by signing in to the same
<strong><a href="https://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account</a></strong> that you used to your phone. If you want to transfer the contacts to your SIM card, this option is unavailable. You can only export contacts from SIM
 card to phone by going to <strong>People</strong> &gt; <strong>More</strong> ... &gt; <strong>
Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can transfer or save the contacts from your SIM card to SD card using
<strong>contacts+message</strong> <strong>backup app</strong>. This application will help you save all your contacts (in VCF format) and messages (SMS &amp; MMS including attachments) to SD card (in XML format) for later restore to same or another Windows Phone.
 Take note that the backup is stored in the <strong>backup+restore</strong> folder. You can download the application by visiting this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/contacts-message-backup/9nblgggz57gm?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

                    I have installed Outlook.com on a new Dell PC running Windows 10 (as the embedded mail application seemed so lacking). I have added (as connected accounts) Btinternet.com and gmail.com accounts. Everything works EXCEPT I can't send messages using the Btinternet
 address. Using my "old" PC (with Windows 8.1 and Windows LiveMail) absolutely everything works properly. It would seem that something is wrong with the settings in Outlook but despite numerous email conversations with the Microsoft Outlook.com email support
 team I am still at a loss to know what to do.

<p>I started with W10 Mail but found I couldn't send to groups. Also found it very difficult to organise inbox filters. So I thought I'd install Windows LiveMail (which I have on both my old PC and my laptop - and which continue to serve me well) but found
 it was no longer available, with Outlook.com offered instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After help from someone in Microsoft I now have an Outlook address - and I added my Gmail and Btinternet addresses for what I thought would be convenience.</p>

<h2>            Is MS Office XP Pro available to download online</h2>
                    I purchased MS Office XP Professional suite (2003 version CD) several years ago. Already downloaded to my desktop pc and one laptop. Can I download&nbsp;the suite to another netbook (which has no CD facility) in the same household, via the internet,&nbsp;using my
 original 'product key'? Is there a limit on how many PC's can the same suite be downloaded to&nbsp;using the same product key ?&nbsp; Thanks, RM

            <p>Well there is Office XP Professional from 2002 and there is Office 2003 Professional from 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But regardless of which you have, the licensing terms for both are the same with respect to the question you asked.&nbsp; Retail licensed Office XP Pro or Office 2003 Pro can be concurrently activated on two of your computers, usually&nbsp;one being your main computer
 and the other being your portable (laptop) computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you already have it concurrently activated on your desktop and one laptop, you have maxxed out your allowed activations.&nbsp; The retail&nbsp;license does permit you to move one or both of these activations to different computers, you just can't have more than
 two activated at any given moment in time.&nbsp; So you could activate it on the netbook, BUT only after uninstalling it from either the desktop or the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Office "student" product permits three concurrent activations within the same household.&nbsp; AFAIK there wasn't an Office XP student product.&nbsp; For Office 2003 the student product was called Office 2003 Student and Teacher edition, and for both
 Office 2007 and 2010 it's called Office Home and Student <em>yyyy</em>.</p>

<p>You activate in the usual way, via internet.</p>
<p>If you have a netbook, with no cd/dvd drive, how do you plan on recovering that system when it all goes wrong?</p>
<p>You copy the complete installation disk to thumb drive, or network the systems, or buy an external cd/dvd drive in order to install</p>

<h2>            Access 2016 &#8211; using a Form combo box</h2>
                    <p>I am new to Access and so far I have created a database and now a Form for entering new records into my database. In my database I have a heading called Source. I am trying to use a combo box to enter the source of my new record on my form.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand in Design View I can go to the Property Sheet, click on Data, and choose one of three options, (Table/Query or Value List or Field List).
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;set up a Value List but not Table/Query or Field List (this may be the problem?).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I want to set this combo box to list information already listed in the Source previously entered in the database records. I would prefer not to have it set up as a Value List as there are too many sources. How then can I get the Combo box to show
 me previously entered sources&nbsp;from previous records in my database. I am not even sure if this can be done without writing code which is beyond me at this stage. Apologies in advance if this question has already been asked.&nbsp;If it can't be done I will accept
 that at this stage.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            That is not the way sources should be modelled in a relational database.&nbsp; You should have a separate 'referenced' table to model the Sources entity type:<br />
<br />
Sources<br />
….SourceID&nbsp; (autonumber primary key)<br />
….Source (short text)<br />
<br />
In your current table (the 'referencing' table) you should have a SourceID foreign key column of long integer data type (NB: not an autonumber).&nbsp; In a form for entering data into the referencing table set up a combo box like this:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp; SourceID<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT SourceID, Source FROM Sources ORDER BY Source;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
To fill the Sources table with values from your current table execute an 'append' query as follows:<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Sources(Source) <br />
SELECT DISTINCT Source<br />
FROM [YourCurrentTablenameGoesHere];<br />
<br />
Then add the SourceID foreign key column to your current table and execute the following 'update' query:<br />
<br />
UPDATE Sources INNER JOIN [YourCurrentTablenameGoesHere]<br />
ON Sources.Source = [YourCurrentTablenameGoesHere].Source<br />
SET [YourCurrentTablenameGoesHere].SourceID = Sources.SourceID;<br />
<br />
To create the above queries open the query designer, but don't add any tables.&nbsp; Swith the view to SQL View and paste in the SQL statements I've given you above, changing YourCurrentTablenameGoesHere to the real name of your current table.&nbsp; You don't need to
 save the queries; merely run each after entering the SQL statement by clicking the Run icon on the Design ribbon.<br />
<br />
Then create a relationship between your current table and sources on SourceID and enforce referential integrity.<br />
<br />
Once you are happy that the SourceID column in your current table's SourceID has been populated correctly you can delete the original Source column from the table in design view..<br />
<br />
In your form, when you want to enter a new source not currently represented in the database you can do so in the combo box's NotInList event procedure with the following code:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String, strMessage As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.ActiveControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "Add " &amp; NewData &amp; " to list?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO Sources(Source) VALUES(""" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NewData &amp; """)"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox(strMessage, vbYesNo + vbQuestion) = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDB.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrAdded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrContinue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ctrl.Undo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
When you need to add a new source you simply type the text value into the combo box and confirm the addition at the prompt.&nbsp; If you are unfamiliar with entering code into a form's or control's event procedures, this is how it's done in form design view:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Select the form or control as appropriate and open its properties sheet if it's not already open.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Select the relevant event property and select the 'build' button (the one on the right with 3 dots).<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Select Code Builder in the dialogue and click OK.&nbsp; This step won't be necessary if you've set up Access to use event procedures by default.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; The VBA editor window will open at the event procedure with the first and last lines already in place.&nbsp; Enter or paste in the code as new lines between these.<br />
<br />
It goes without saying that before undertaking changes like the above to tables it is imperative that you back-up the tables first.<br />

<p>Access is not like a lot of programs where you can just jump in and start using it. There is a learning curve for Access and you need to do your homework before you start. Part of that homework is understand relational database design and normalization.
 The foundation of a well run database is a properly normalized table structure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken describes that in his response. The Source field (divisions in a table are called fields, not headings) sounds like it needs to pulled from a lookup table. Lookup tables in Access are the same as any table, but they are defined by the way they are used.
 A lookup table typically has the structure that Ken suggested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now you can use the NotInList event as Ken described or you can simply add Sources to your sources table when the combobox won't let you type in a value not in the list.</span></p>

<h2>            Word &#40;Office 365&#41; ruler is displaying as grayed out</h2>
                    <p>Would like an opinion about what is causing this and how to make it stop. I am editing a document someone else created in outline view. I am working in page layout view. The ruler looks like this:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Although I can set tabs and so on, this is difficult to see and work with. In some areas of the doc it behaves like a table, but there is no table (or columns) defined.</p>

<p>Hi Dora,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the weekend I quit Word and let it sit idle. When I opened the app this morning, the problem with the ruler display had gone away. I'm chalking it up to typical Word weirdness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The doc was created by someone else using Outline view.</p>
<p>2. They emailed me the doc, and I worked with it in Page Layout view.</p>
<p>3. In Page Layout view, at first the ruler looked normal, then after some editing, it appeared to be all gray and with vertical markings that reminded me of table columns.</p>
<p>4. Initially when quitting and restarting Word, nothing changed.</p>
<p>5. After Word sat for 2 days without being opened, the problem seems to be gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was with the way the ruler displayed in Page Layout view. It was not a menu item issue. The screen cap in my initial post shows this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone for your ideas on solving this.</p>

                    After a new build I'm asked to re-enter the network key when I try to reconnect. This time I wasn't asked fir it. &nbsp;When I select my network the PC simply tries to connect and fails. There is no way to tell it to forget that network or to re-enter the key
 since that network doesn't show in the known networks list. Non-secure networks connect fine, and networks I didn't use before ask me for the key.

            <p>Hi Linda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing up this issue to our attention. I understand that you are having issues viewing the emails received in your account using a double click. I'll do my best to assist you on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For starters, I need you to confirm if your issue is about viewing your emails in the email client Microsoft Office Outlook or in the Outlook.com web interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your issue is with Microsoft Office Outlook, please try reconfiguring the account and if the issue persists, post an inquiry in this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=unable+to+view+emails+using+double+click+on+the+subject+line&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Office&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=officeversion_other-outlook&amp;askingquestion=true">
link</a> for further assistance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your issue occurs when using Outlook.com's web interface,&nbsp;a single click on the subject line when viewing the message list of your folders should suffice to open&nbsp;the message. If you are not able to do this, make sure that your browser is free from any
 cluttered information that might be causing the issue. To do this, try <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
optimizing your browser</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I need you to try other <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-wlsettings/which-browsers-are-supported-by-skydrive-people/63a2884f-99d9-4d21-806a-156c1b185b44">
supported&nbsp;browsers</a> for Outlook.com&nbsp;and other computers to check if the same issue will happen. Also, try accessing other Microsoft accounts on the computer you initially had this issue with, to test if the error will continue to occur for other users. Please
 give us details of the results afterwards. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your cooperation and prompt reply will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You. </p>

            I developed the same exact problem today in Outlook 2013. Everything worked fine, I can see the email in my inbox and read it in preview pane but I cannot open it. I just spent 3 hours on the phone with Microsoft support and they basically gave up. They
 could open the emails remotely but I still can't. After trying to sell me an extended warrantee for $149 he said to just call back if I continue to experience the issue. Well I still have the issue and have contacted support 4 times (fortunately within my
 90 days) for different issues. Yes I still have the problem and feel insulted that I was offered to buy extended support "by a highly trained professional" when this same "highly trained professional could not fix my issue after 3 hours.

            I fixed mine! Despite 2 hours with a "trained highly skilled professional" from Microsoft who did NOTHING yet wanted me to buy an extended warrantee. I went to control panel/mouse went to settings and slowed down my double click speed. Somehow it got set
 so high that I couldn't possibly click that fast. I don't know how it got set that high by itself. If any "highly skilled Microsoft professionals" would like to pay me $149 a year I'll be there for them.

    <title>Restart problems with Acer E15 laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greybat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restart problems with Acer E15 laptop.</h2>
                    <p>I have been struggling with this problem since I acquired my laptop last January. I have been testing Win10TP, and am now on the latest build, but the problem persists. The problem does NOT occur with Windows 8.1<br />
<br />
My computer (Acer E15 (or E5-511-P8C8) hangs on restart after awaking from sleep, hibernation or even after powering off and powering on again. (In this latter case, the next restart will hang.) I have to manually power off, then power on again to start the
 machine again. This allows the machine to work normally, until the next restart. However, in one instance, this solution does not work. That is when installing an update to a new build via Windows Update. As usual, the first restart hangs, but, on powering
 on again, the error code 0xC1900101 – 0x20017 is thrown. This seems to be because the system failed to "restart" in the proper mode required for a system upgrade.<br />
<br />
This error (0xC1900101 – 0x20017) was a repeated cause of problems when Windows 8 was released (according to Goggle searches!), which leads me to believe that the problem is either BIOS related or driver related. However, it occurs so early in the restart process
 (before attempting to reboot from any device, because the restart will hang even if a bootable flash drive is present), that it is impossible to determine which driver is the cause. If Boot Log is enabled, maybe it starts to get recorded, but it will be overwritten
 after the restart hangs, and the machine is restarted from scratch again.<br />
<br />
I have also tried a clean boot, but this has no effect.<br />
<br />
I have, however, stumbled upon a workaround that seems to allow restarts to occur normally.<br />
<br />
Workaround steps:<br />
<br />
1 Start: Following normal power on, all seems fine, but next restart hangs (usually very early, before Acer screen appears)<br />
2 After power off and on, start msconfig (Windows Key + r, enter "msconfig" in dialog, then Enter). Set "diagnostic start" and restart. This restart also fails a bit later - after Acer screen appears and rolling dots start but quickly stop. (Sometimes the restart
 hangs before the dots appear.)<br />
3. Power off and on again. (You may see "Unknown Hard Error". This is due to the disabled services.) Run msconfig again.&nbsp; Check the Services tab. If all (or most) services disabled, enable all and restart. Restart is successful.<br />
4. Restarts continue to be successful until system is shut down or sleeps. Next restart after this will fail. Then go back to step 1.
<br />
5. If system enters sleep mode (or suspend or hibernate), after the system recovers itself, restarts will fail thereafter and steps 2,3,4 have to be repeated.<br />
<br />
I have only tried this on the laptop connected to A/C power (since, with sleep etc. disabled, the machine would run out of power). This workaround also allows upgrade install of new builds to work (avoiding the 0xC1900101 error referred to above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else is experiencing the same issue, I would sure like to hear about it, and also whether my workaround works for them!</p>

<p>Build 122 update.... Basic restart problem not resolved - workaround slightly more complicated!<br />
<br />
Change needed to step 3 of workaround (quoted above). In build 122, instead of " Unknown Hard Error" dialog with an OK button that dismisses it, a new Critical Error message appears indicating "A critical error has occurred in the Shell Infrastructure Host........".
 The OK button is replaced by a "Sign Out Now". Clicking this signs you out, and it is not possible to run msconfig again from Win Key + r. Instead, it is possible to create a shortcut to msconfig on the desktop, and execute that while the Critical Error message
 is still displayed. Again, re-enable all services in the Services tab, and next restart will work.

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your interest! It seems not too many other people (if any!) have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the status is that I still have exactly the same issue, and have had it in every fast track build since 9926, with one small variation in the latest build (10166). In this build, at step 3 of my workaround, I do not see any error message (i.e. "Critical
 error.....) after doing the diagnostic restart. I still have to follow the diagnostic restart with opening msconfig, re-enabling all services, and one further restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will study the other link you sent me later today (hopefully), but there are some obvious differences with my situation, primarily in the "Conditions to reproduce the issue". For me, sleep/hibernate and shutdown (from start menu or shutdown.exe /s) are
 definitively the issue. Doing any of these things creates the issue, which will then persist through every subsequent restart until I run my workaround.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of other observations::</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Fast Restart doesn't seem to make any difference. Although it gets turned on by default with every new build install, I always turn it off. I am actually suspicious that this IS the cause of the problem, and that it doesn't matter whether Fast Restart
 is turned on or not in the Power Options, in Win 10, it happens anyway. The reason I suspect this is that the problem seems to be related to what happens during sleep, and, by extension, during hibernate, and thence to shutdown. From other threads I have read,
 relating to the shutdown process, it seems that some form of hybrid shutdown takes place in Win 10 whatever controlled method is used. (By "controlled method", I mean anything other than holding down the power button, something I haven't tried except when
 the restart hangs!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. This is not a Win 8.1 issue for me. When I first started dealing with it (back in March, I believe), at one stage, I did a complete re-format, re-partition, and re-install of Win 8.1, and I had no issues with sleep/hibernate/shutdown at all. Whatever
 this is is unique to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I contacted MS Support (through the Contact Support app in Win 10) last week. Once they understood the issue, they said it was too specific to my situation, and they could not help me. This did not come as a great surprise, since, as I mentioned earlier.
 no-one else participating in these forums seems to have had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Obviously, I cope with this issue by not allowing the computer to sleep/hibernate, and not shutting it down. I do turn the screen off after 10 minutes or so, and I turn the HDD off likewise. Neither of these things causes any problems. I could also simply
 allow sleep/hibernate to happen, and just avoid restarting the computer unless absolutely necessary, and then, when it hangs, turn it back on via the power button. The only reason this is a bad solution is that installing new builds fails if the computer doesn't
 begin the install process (after the download is complete) with a proper restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that I am going to have to live with this until after Win 10 Release, and then, if the problem is still there, I will get in touch with Acer support and report the problem to them, and see if they can offer any assistance by way of new drivers, for
 example. If I look to them for help now, I suspect they will say I'm testing a beta system, and they cannot help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your interest!</p>
<p>

            <p>I have spent some time looking over the link that you quoted. I looks as though using Procmon or xbootmgr might be a promising avenue to explore. However.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I can't get Procmon to "Enable Boot Logging". I get a persistant message, "Unable to write PROCMON23.SYS. Make sure that you have permission to write to the %%SystemRoot%%\System32\Drivers directory." First of all, the PROCMON23.SYS file is already present
 in c:\Windows\System32\drivers", and secondly, I'm confused by the double "%" characters. Doesn't look right to me for an environment variable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I ran xbootmgr with some suggested flags, but I have no idea how to interpret the results, or even to guess what appropriate flags would be in my situation. I have tried the Windows Performance Analysis tool with the ETL files created, but its no help
 to me, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I guess I will continue to wait until the final release is out, and then see if I can get any help from Asus.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Oops.&nbsp; I ran into this too.&nbsp; I thought the message was bogus because I could see PROCMON23.SYS in Drivers but I guess I must have gotten confused and been looking at it under W8.1.2.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like that driver doesn't normally exist anywhere until it is needed.&nbsp; So it must be extracted from something associated with the main module.&nbsp; In any case, under W8.1.2 I have now generated it again, so I can try seeing if we can copy that instance
 to W10.&nbsp; Otherwise perhaps we should try installing ProcMon in compatibility mode?&nbsp; E.g. W8 or W7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately presently I am severely restricted by what I can do with W10 because my VM is still being blocked from communicating.&nbsp; At least it can work as a Homegroup and it works with the ClipBoard, so I should be able to test my idea of copying the W8
 instance to the W10 Drivers directory.&nbsp; TBD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or of course we could try using ProcMon to diagnose this error, e.g. by removing the filters which normally inhibit&nbsp;its own&nbsp;trace events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had started researching this before and found that in other circumstances this had been seen and a reg hack workaround had been devised, so I could try looking at that possibility too.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In fact, I think we are now supposed to be using WPRUI instead of xbootmgr for generating the trace but you're right WPA is a mystery to me too.&nbsp; One thing I have found useful instead of WPA is NetMon 3.4 with extended parsers for Windows events.&nbsp; That at
 least makes .etl data readable even if we can't take full advantage of the traced data.&nbsp; Before I found out about that option I had been resorting to using SysInternals strings.exe to at least make the doublebyte Unicode strings into chunks of readable text.&nbsp;

</p><p>I posted my issue on the Acer Support forum. They immediately advised updating the BIOS. That fixed it! I probably should have tried this months ago, since I was 6 releases removed from the latest BIOS available for my machine. Ah well, live and learn!</p>

<h2>            6100 - how do I find out my security code&#63;</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I want to reset my Nokia 6100 to factory settings, but it asks for a security code.<br />
<br />
From searching this forum I found that it this code is usually preset as 12345 but this does not work. I cannot remember if I ever changed the code myself or maybe my someone else did, but I cannot remember it!<br />
<br />
How do I find out this code?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.

            If the default code is not working then it has definately been changed.<br />
You cannot read the code so you will need to take the phone into a Nokia Care Point and get them to reset it for you.<br />
This will also delete all info on the handset.<br />

<p>Hi Bobo_14,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, you had to add a different SPF TXT record to your custom domain if you were using SharePoint Online. This is no longer required. This change should reduce the risk of SharePoint Online notification messages ending up in the Junk Email folder.
 Update your SPF TXT record if you are hitting the 10-lookup limit and receiving errors that say things like, "exceeded the lookup limit" and "too many hops", as described in&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn789058(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set
 up SPF in Office 365 to help prevent spoofing</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should use DKIM in addition to SPF and DMARC to help prevent spammers from sending messages that look like they are coming from your domain. DKIM lets you add a digital signature to email messages in the message header.</p>
<p>

<h3> denise at flw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a pivot table&#47;pivot chart with multiple tables in Microsoft Access 2007</h2>
                    I have a series of tables for various fiscal-years in my database. They have the same data for different years, i.e. 2005, 2006 etc. The column headings are identical in placement for each table, such as budget codes, item descriptions, and quantities.
 I would like to create pivot charts showing the yearly data, broken down into appropriate categories, so that trends can be shown from year to year. I&nbsp;have not found information telling me how to do this with more than one table as the data source.&nbsp;Am I limited
 to using one table to create a pivot table or a pivot chart?&nbsp;

UNION SELECT *, 2006 FROM TableFor2006<br />

UNION SELECT *, 2008 FROM TableFor2008<br />
UNION SELECT *, 2009 FROM TableFor2009<br />
UNION SELECT *, 2010 FROM TableFor2010</p>
<p>Substitute the correct table names.</p>
<p>Use this query for your pivot table/chart.</p>
<p>(Personally, I would use a single table for all the data)</p>

            A couple of additional points:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Use a UNION ALL operation, not a UNION.&nbsp; A UNION operation suppresses duplicates, but as in this case there can be no duplication by virtue of the constants in the computed FiscalYear column, that will merely have an adverse effect on performance.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; More fundamentally, having separate tables for each accounting year is&nbsp; poor relational database design.&nbsp; It is 'encoding data as table names'.&nbsp; A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle.&nbsp; This requires that all
 year can be derived, e.g. a TransactionDate column.<br />
<br />
You can easily move the data into a new empty table of the same structure as your current tables (plus the FiscalYear column if necessary) by using an 'append' query based on the UNION ALL query.<br />
<br />
If your accounting year is not the calendar year, you can return the accounting year from a TransactionDate column in a query using the following function:<br />
<br />
Public Function AcctYear(DateVal As Date, MonthStart As Integer, DayStart As Integer) As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dtmYearStart As Date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MonthStart = 1 And DayStart = 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' accounting year is calendar year, so return single year value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AcctYear = Year(DateVal)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get start of accounting year in year of date value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmYearStart = DateSerial(Year(DateVal), MonthStart, DayStart)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' if date value is before start of accounting year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' accounting year starts year previous to date's year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' otherwise it starts with date's year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If DateVal &lt; dtmYearStart Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AcctYear = Year(DateVal) - 1 &amp; Format(Year(DateVal) Mod 100, "-00")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AcctYear = Year(DateVal) &amp; Format((Year(DateVal) + 1) Mod 100, "-00")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
So for an accounting year starting 1 April say, you'd add the following to the 'field' row of a blank column in query design view:<br />
<br />
FiscalYear: AcctYear([TransactionDate],4,1)<br />
<br />
This will return the accounting year in the format 2010-11.&nbsp; If the accounting year is the calendar year you can simply use:<br />
<br />
FiscalYear:Year([TransactionDate])<br />
<br />

<h2>            Pixels to Inches</h2>
                    <p>I heard the other day that when in ppt &gt; Design &gt; Custon Slide Size and you enter pixel dimensions, such as 600 px, ppt would auto convert to inches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I tried it, ppt did indeed convert 600 px to 6.250 in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried again later to have it auto convert 600 px, it returned 5 in.</p>

            PowerPoint factors in your screen resolution when calculating size from pixels, so different resolutions get you a different final size in inches.
