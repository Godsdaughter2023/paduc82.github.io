<h2>            Xbox One, I just can&#39;t anymore.</h2>
                    <p>Whenever xbox one came out I didn't have the luxury of getting one right away. While everyone was playing the new console and games, I was playing my xbox 360 still. Ive owned every xbox and gaming is a favorite past time of mine and i looked forward to
 upgrading and rejoining my friends on the next gen console and games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I finally got an xbox one and that's when Microsoft really started to decline, in my eyes. Within less than a year of buying it, the disc drive stopped working. I could no longer play the disc copies of games I bought. So, I was forced to go strictly
 digital. I'd like to add that this wasn't the first version released either. I got my first console as an xbox one s, so I would think they had worked out some kinks, hardware, and such. Other problems started to arise such as the controller refusing to sync
 after it's been perfectly fine. Every controller did this and was such a pain trying to get reconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me Microsoft has become extremely greedy. Multiple times I've been locked out of my account. I just wanted to pay my live and get back on but they seemed content on making me jump through hours of hoops just to regain control of my xbox. Forget
 trying to play your digital copies if xbox live is off they will not let you access your owned games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Today my xbox officially broke. It won't play discs, won't sync controllers, and won't display images. Enough was enough so I trashed it. I'm pretty bummed out, but there's nothing I can do. I really want to continue my games and with friends, so I was contemplating
 buying a new one, which is financially unwise to me, but I just thought, why? What is going to be different? Microsoft has let me down big time, their greed seems to be rising, and I won't waste more money on them without guarantee of something better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which brings me to my last thought, maybe I should just become a ps4 guy. I've always liked xbox and don't know much about ps4, but I cannot continue with this low level of manufacturing, service, and greed that I've experienced with xbox. Could anyone give
 me some insight and if I should cut my losses with Microsoft and switch to Sony and their playstation?</p>

<p>Sorry you're having such a number of troubles with your gaming experience. It's meant to be fun.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll only say that a company can't be greedy because that's a human trait, and that all businesses are going to want to make money. That's just how it goes. Switching to another console only to lose all your digital titles seems like more financial cost
 than what might be $199 or less for a new one if you find a deal.</p>

<p>So...umm...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you buy used?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchased new and it failed within a year it was under warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the disk drive wouldn't read games did you notify support? Did you see about a drive replacement?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same when the controllers stopped syncing and it stopped displaying an image, did you file a ticket? Do any troubleshooting at all, or did you go straight to the atomic solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have well gotten a bad unit, but unlike the 360's the One has a very low failure rate.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear you're having issues with your console. It sounds like you have built a community of friends on the Xbox, I'm sure they would be sad to see you go. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to leave and move to another console is your own.</p>

<p>I have to disagree. A company isn't just some magical entity that sells products on it's own accord. People make things happen. Whether it's one person or a group. A company is people so it can be a greedy one. You can manufacture better, put less restriction,
 or be reasonable or honest with people and still make a ton of money. Why would they not let me access my games when offline? Greed. Why block my account not letting me be able to do ANYTHING unless I paid this prison lock charge? What was all that talk before
 xbox came out where you couldn't sell or buy used games? Greed. Microsoft is becoming more greedy and petty to make themselves more money by screening people over.</p>

            You can play your games offline as long as you have your console set as your Home console (Playstation works the same).&nbsp;

            I bought brand new. After the disk drive happened I didn't react right away and believed I lost warranty. When other things happened I thought I was sol so I opened my xbox to check wiring, soldering, dust build up, etc. Further voiding warranty. It still
 worked for some time, but after the image stopped and controller wouldn't connect, I just threw it away. I still have my original xbox and xbox 360 and they both still work, having been played longer than the xbox one.

<p>Look we have all been there, at one point or another a Console or "Series" goes wrong for us. I myself went through roughly 3 Xbox 360 S and 2 E series consoles due to similar issues (majority of the time I bought the 2nd or 3rd used to chase the parts more
 than anything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the original Xbox One (both new and used), the One S (Used) and now have the One X (New), I have not had any major issue with these consoles apart from a few update errors at best! If your console had all these problems within the first year,
 why not get in touch with Microsoft Support? Did you buy the console used? if so, you are taking a gamble (as with anything used) that it is either perfectly fine or has had some minor issues that has led to the previous owner to unload it before it finally
 died.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, should you pack up and bail on Microsoft? in my own opinion, no! again it's my own opinion, my experience with Sony and PlayStation has not been the best. Their customer support is nothing but a game of keep away, I had an issue with my PSN account being
 hacked during one of their many breaches throughout the last few years, it took 5 months of being bounced around customer support before I got my account back, by that point I had moved completely to Xbox/PC and left the PS4 where it belongs, in a dark cupboard
 collecting dust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue that took time with Microsoft Customer Support was a duplicated payment for an Xbox Live Gold Subscription where it took 3 days to be sorted and as a good will gesture I was credited the extra time due to the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stick with Microsoft, it pays off way more in the long run. In the end its the small things that keep me with a company, whether its easy customer service and a vibrant community or minor bonuses and extras like the discounts and options for Subscription
 based Gaming.</p>

            Thank you for replying. It helps me a lot. That playstation mishap would probably make me do the same. I still wonder how PS would actually be. My xbox staying broken is my fault, but didn't expect the whole thing to&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed- Inappropriate]</strong>&nbsp;out.
 It was bought new and had a very small life span compared to my other consoles. I still like the xbox itself, but I've had them double charge me also, like you did, took them two phone calls and hours to fix. ( first time was lied to and they did absolutely
 nothing.) I've been locked out of my account twice forcing me to pay the charge they wanted (couldn't even select other options) and on top of it all not being able to play my games when my internet failed. I just want to play my games without all the bs,
 blocks, errors, and having to contact customer support for hours. I just wonder if PS would be better, I used to hear they would give free live and tons of free games, already making them seem more honest and user friendly in my eyes.

                    <p>Hello everyone i hope someone can help me out, I have read many many forum tips regarding fixes for this issue. But before that let me explain what my situation is and then i will go onto what i have tried.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OKAY.. so I had Windows 7 64 bit installed for a while, then i decided to make the jump to Windows 8.1 when i found it on sale online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Windows 8.1 64 bit to a USB boot drive, but saved that for later and installed Windows 8.1 from the desktop as an "Upgrade" from my current system.</p>
<p>Then after installing all drivers and setting up my Windows Profile everything was perfect no issues, gaming was awesome, overall the system was great as it should. BUT one day (about 3 weeks after installation) i was playing League of Legends and my screen
 went black mid game. I reset the computer and from there on out I have been getting the black screen and have been unable to install the Latest and/or previous Nvidia Geforce Drivers(337.50) and every time I've had to Reboot in Safe Mode to uninstall the current
 drivers and or disable the "Video Adapter" to be able to access the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1st method:</span> I tried everything from preventing Windows Update to install anything, and then downloading GeForce Drivers going into safe mode with not network access then installing from there but the installer
 would reach the "restart to install updates" then upon restart the black screens would occur. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2nd Method:</span> Tried to allow windows to install drivers on It's own and it did install the "Officially" drivers 335.23 but they failed to install just as the previous method did.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3rd Method:</span> Removing Re-seating the RAM, and Video Card and checking cables and fans making sure everything was functioning properly. after removing and re-seating the Components I tried methods 1 and 2 a few
 times with no success.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>

<h2>            skype not ringing for incoming calls on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I'm using skype on both windows 10 laptop and on android.</p>
<p>On the android phone it works as expected.</p>
<p>But on the laptop, skype 12.9.604.0 is not ringing. Making calls works just fine using the skype.</p>
<p>I think that the setting ar ok:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a72fe2ea-3d79-4107-9d10-a29bf7d8967c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a72fe2ea-3d79-4107-9d10-a29bf7d8967c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the same laptop, using the skype web interface works without problems.</p>
<p>Is there anything to be modified to make skype ring on incomming calls?</p>

    <title>Why does my USB webcam take 10 minutes to appear after boot&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> althernai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my USB webcam take 10 minutes to appear after boot&#63;</h2>
                    I have a 2 year old Compal JFL92 laptop which I initially bought with Windows Vista and I recently upgraded it to Windows 7. Everything works fine, except that the built-in webcam is not immediately available after turning the machine on or waking it from
 sleep -- it takes somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes to show up. Prior to this, it is not visible in the "Devices and Printers" and the "USB Composite Device" which it calls itself in Device Manager is also missing. Once it does show up, it works without any
 problems.<br />
<br />
I have tried uninstalling all USB controllers and rebooting to make Windows reinstall the drivers for everything. If I do that, the webcam is there immediately, but on the next boot it again takes 10 minutes to show up. I have also tried installing the latest
 USB drivers from Intel, but that didn't help either. The laptop has various other USB devices, both internal (e.g. Bluetooth) and external (a mouse) and none of them exhibits this behavior. Has anyone ever seen something like this before or know how to make
 it load with everything else rather than in 10 minutes?

            Getting support from Compal is a feat akin to drawing water from a rock (or maybe one just has to speak Chinese). And while practically any computer problem can be solved by buying new hardware, in this case it would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater
 -- the webcam works and 95% of the time it is fine even in the weird state. I only recently noticed this issue because I needed to use it immediately after turning the computer on.<br />
<br />
In any case, I believe I have fixed it. The solution is to install the newest Intel chipset drivers, but not by using the setup executable that they come with (that's what I did the first time and it did not work for me). Instead, one needs to scroll all the
 way down in the readme.txt file for these drivers and follow the instructions for installing them with Windows 7 already installed. The device that appears to have needed updating to fix this is the System Management Bus (SMBus) or something of the sort, but
 the drivers that come with Windows 7 are from 2006 so one might as well update everything.

<div>The hard reset will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings, etc will be removed from the phone. If backup is turned on under Settings, you can restore
 your apps and settings after performing a hard reset (as long as you initialize the phone with the same Microsoft Account). Note that resetting your device will not remove any OS or firmware updates. You will remain on the same version of Windows Phone after
 the reset.</div>

            <p>Hi Sharon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History regularly backs up versions of your files in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the
<span>OneDrive</span> files available offline on your PC. Over time, you'll have a complete history of your files. If the originals are lost, damaged, or deleted, you can restore them. You can also browse and restore different versions of your files. For example,
 if you want to restore an older version of a file (even if it wasn't deleted or lost), you can browse through a timeline, select the version you want, and restore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you have described, it looks like the file history storage drive is full. I would suggest you to try the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open the run command.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>control </strong>and press <strong>enter </strong>to open control panel.</p>
<p>3. Click "<strong>file history</strong>". If you don't see file history, change the "<strong>view</strong>" option to "<strong>small icons</strong>" which is at the top right of the window.</p>
<p>4. In the file history window, click "<strong>advanced settings</strong>".</p>
<p>5. Change the "<strong>save copies&nbsp;of files</strong>" to "<strong>daily</strong>" and "<strong>keep saved versions</strong>" to "<strong>until space is needed</strong>" from the drop down list.
</p>
<p>6. <strong>Save </strong>the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Addition, refer to the help article below for more information:</p>

<h2>            Windows update 1079 Freezes</h2>

<p>i5-3340s CPU @ 2.8GHz</p>
<p>4 GB RAM</p>

</p><p>The recent update would get so far and freeze. The spinning icon would stop and the machine would not respond. After switching off an on a few times the machine restored the last version of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the update trouble shooter. This seemed to identify some registry problems. This deleted the last update. Downloaded it fresh. I then went to restart now and the update started (I left it 4 hours) and came back to 100% complete but the screen was
 frozen and the had to do the switching off and on again bit and I'm not back to the restored version.</p>

<p>Hello Radney,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I tried this I had to wait for&nbsp;2017-12 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4053580) to install. A similar problem with this. It stalled at 30% but after switching off an on the update continued and has apparently
 been installed successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the repair upgrade as suggested via&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&nbsp;</p>
<p>I selected the Windows 10 installation 10 tool rather than the Fall Creators upgrade as I assume the idea was to repair windows 10 prior to upgrade. Anyway. After many hours it was all looking promising. Blue screen with progress going steadily. It then
 stalled. [Blank screen no response to keyboard mouse] After switching off an on a few times due to other repeat stalls it has now restored previous version of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also popped up in updates&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another installation is already in progress. Complete that installation before proceeding with the install.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Let's try a different approach, we recommend that you run<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>System
 File Checker </strong>and see if it helps. Follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Press&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Windows
 + X</strong></span><span><span>, and then select&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></span><span><span>.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>

 /</span></strong><span><strong>Scannow</strong></span><span><span>&nbsp;on the prompt, and then press&nbsp;</span></span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong><span><span>.
 This scan will repair system files.&nbsp;</span></span> </p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have third-party anti-virus software, we suggest that you disable them first or uninstall them before trying to update Windows 10.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I am not currently running third-party anti-virus software. However I had a Post Windows 10 file from an old version of Spybot hanging around as a start-up file. Deleted this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran the update troubleshooter again to download the windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>Spend a long time going through the recommendations on the link. Unfortunately while trying to install windows 10 my pc went back to it's factory version of Windows 8 which was installed on a partitioned drive. I'd forgotten how horrible windows 8 was. Anyway
 after all these hours I lost patience and took it to a professional. They had similar issues and apparentlty my hard drive was faulty. Anyway, new hardrive and windows 10 now succesfully installed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It doesn't expire. &nbsp;The offer is a free upgrade for the LIFE of the system that is upgraded. &nbsp;That means you could upgrade/activate this week and then roll back in less than 30 days to your old OS for the next couple of years on that system and then decide
 to upgrade to WIndows 10 again - all at no cost on THAT specific system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no 'expiration' on the license after you upgrade to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can use the November 2015 or later installation media created from the Media Creation Tool to install Windows 10 cleanly using your Windows 7 or 8.1 product key.</p>

            <p>Nope.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>General practice is to fill up the form before you scan it to your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After scanning the image of the form, it becomes an image file and there is nothing you can do about it, unless of course you consider adding the text manually using a 3rd party image/photo editor.&nbsp;</p>

                    Hello, I recently removed one of my laptops from my list of devices connected to my Microsoft accounts. The account currently has no Microsoft account attached to it anymore and for some reason, one of my past user accounts is now the new administrator
 account. I have since forgotten the password and cannot log in to the device. If possible, how do I find my device history and reconnect the device?

<h2>            Windows 10 digital licence and Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have a full business internal domain (Active Directory) and all the associated things to go with it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we really don't want to add Microsoft accounts to all our Windows 10 installations to be able to recover the digital licence activation in the case of a major hardware change. So this raises some questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>in relation to this document <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>How many activations can be in one account, as the Microsoft accounts&nbsp;will&nbsp;be 'dummy' Microsoft accounts, created only for this purpose?</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the Microsoft account is removed from the device will it remove the device from the Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>...You reached the limit on the number of times you can reactivate Windows on your device. - What is the limit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>...Your device is managed by your organization and the option to reactivate Windows isn’t available. For help with reactivation, contact your organization’s support person. - Nice, none of the organization’s support people here,&nbsp;can find answers
<strong>BEFORE </strong>things go bad. is there any real Microsoft documentation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>another&nbsp;unhelpful moderator...&nbsp;is this not in the Community group - Windows, Windows 10, Download, install, &amp; activate, PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>and how is the question not relevant to the group?</p>
<p>
</p><p>the question is asking for info on the activation process/retrieval NOT available anywhere else, which relates to both personal and corporate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>normal people can have more than one MS device and will probably have only one MS account,&nbsp;with hardware upgrades over the years in the future... my question stands</p>
<p>
</p><p>and surly Using the 'Activation troubleshooter' after a significant hardware change is designed for home users who took advantage of the free upgrade... as we did in our company.</p>

            <p>With Windows 10, the device limits have been reduced to 10:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/4959/ask-paul-what-are-the-windows-10-device-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/4959/ask-paul-what-are-the-windows-10-device-limits</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Digital Licensing is not attached to the Microsoft Account, it is attached to the hardware with the qualifying operating system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as long as those systems are activated with Windows 10, Microsoft Account or not, it earns a digital license.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/how-to-use-digital-license-to-manage-and-activate-windows-10-anniversary-update-licenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>http://www.groovypost.com/how-to-use-digital-license-to-manage-and-activate-windows-10-anniversary-update-licenses/</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>More information:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">For anyone else, including those with local or domain accounts, this step is optional. In any case, it applies only to those who have a Windows 10 digital license. That group consists primarily of those who took advantage of the
 year-long free upgrade offer that ends on July 29, 2016.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">This new feature doesn't change the fundamental way that Microsoft's activation servers work. The process of activating Windows relies on a unique installation ID, which is based on a hash of information taken from the hardware on
 which Windows is installed. That hash is reportedly not reversible and is not tied to any other Microsoft services. It identifies a specific device, not a person.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but you didn't answer ANY&nbsp;of the questions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we really don't want to add Microsoft accounts to all our Windows 10 installations to be able to recover the digital licence activation in the case of a
<strong>major hardware change</strong>. So this raises some questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>in relation to this document <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>How many activations (devices) can be in one Microsoft account, as the Microsoft accounts&nbsp;(if we need to use them) will&nbsp;be 'dummy' Microsoft accounts, created only for this purpose?</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the Microsoft account is removed from the device will it remove the device from the Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>...You reached the limit on the number of times you can reactivate Windows on your device. - What is the limit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>...Your device is managed by your organization and the option to reactivate Windows isn’t available. For help with reactivation, contact your organization’s support person. - Nice, none of the organization’s support people here,&nbsp;can find answers
<strong>BEFORE </strong>things go bad. is there any real Microsoft documentation?</p>
<p>

<h2>            WMP 12&#39;s &#39;random play&#39; not really random, is it&#63;</h2>
                    this one might be an easy fix, or it might be something i'm going to have to live with... i have the 'shuffle' and 'repeat' functions turned on for the media player on my computer (when practical, it's nice to have music playing, and with over 800 songs
 in the library, it's like a huge juke box)... my question is, when i hit 'play', the first song i hear is ALWAYS the first one on the playlist?&nbsp; i had wmp11 on my previous computer, same play options, and it would start playing any song it wanted to... can
 i do anything to tell it that it's okay to start playing from anywhere in the playlist of choice?<br />

<h2>            USB F Drive has 0 bytes of media, sometimes shows in disc management, directory name is invalid when given &#39;format&#39; message, and windows can&#39;t access it</h2>
                    <p>My usb is a Tobisha 64GB Transmemory MX black drive. Last September-ish I had a password software put onto it and it was working as a regular usb up 'til now. The irregular change happened when I took the usb to another computer to print something. When
 I did that I wasn't prompted with a password and the USB was still working. The USB was still working when I took it back to my computer, but a couple days went by and I noticed that the usb f just displayed F: and didn't display the memory like windows explorer
 does for the other drives. I've tried a lot of things since then (yesterday), and would like help in recovering my USB.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB also has about 22 GB on it already. At first, when I would plug the USB in and out a couple times, I would &nbsp;get to see the files in the USB but when I would click on a file or try to move before it get's weird again it would freeze and then say it
 doesn't exist on the USB anymore. I tried changing the letter of drive and inserting into other usb slots, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many 'fix USB' programs I've downloaded in the past 24 hrs can't recognise it. I've seen peoples problems on the web but my case seems more drastic. What's happening and how to fix? I will reply ASAP.</p>

PROCESS_HAS_LOCKED_PAGES (76)<br />
Caused by a driver not cleaning up correctly after an I/O.<br />
Arguments:<br />
Arg1: 0000000000000000, Locked memory pages found in process being terminated.<br />
Arg2: ffff96871e932080, Process address.<br />
Arg3: 0000000000000003, Number of locked pages.<br />
Arg4: 0000000000000000, Pointer to driver stacks (if enabled) or 0 if not.<br />
Issue a !search over all of physical memory for the current process pointer.<br />
This will yield at least one MDL which points to it.&nbsp; Then do another !search<br />
for each MDL found, this will yield the IRP(s) that point to it, revealing<br />
which driver is leaking the pages.<br />
Otherwise, set HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory<br />
Management\TrackLockedPages to a DWORD 1 value and reboot.&nbsp; Then the system<br />
will save stack traces so the guilty driver can be easily identified.<br />
When you enable this flag, if the driver commits the error again you will<br />
see a different bugcheck - DRIVER_LEFT_LOCKED_PAGES_IN_PROCESS (0xCB) -<br />
which can identify the offending driver(s).<br />

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nearly, all bugchecks are caused by an incorrect driver. Outdated and incompatible device drivers are known to work against the methods that Windows 10 follows. In most cases, this issue can be resolved by just obtaining the latest version of that driver
 from the device manufacturer. Check if your device drivers are updated, and if they're not, we suggest that you download and install the latest version of the drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also follow the set of steps provided on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft article</a> to troubleshoot blue screen errors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you wish to have a clue to what likely caused the problem, you might need to use a debugger. A debugger is a program designed to help detect and correct errors in another program. For more information, see the following article on the Microsoft
 TechNet blog: </p>

    <title>How do I change the audio level of the microphone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emerogork2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the audio level of the microphone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a head set that gets daily use therefore it is always plugged in.&nbsp; When I am not using the headset and I increase my speaker levels for other reasons I get feed back from the mic.&nbsp; It was that I could click on an icon in the task bar right to get
 to the mixer and then select record or playback.&nbsp; In record I could change the audio level for the mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I not clicking in the right place or has this been "Featured" out?</p>

            Those are the steps to change the level (input gain increase).&nbsp; If all you want to do is switch the recording device, you can stop at step 2 and just change the device there in that box by selecting the device and clicking the "make this the default device"
 button.

            I'm not familiar with any mic mixer in Windows.&nbsp; This volume mixer should be identical to the one in Windows 8, 7, and Vista.&nbsp; Vista was the last time the audio stack received any updates.

<p>Maybe the last of any concept of a mixer faded out after XP.&nbsp; It was extremely easy in 95.&nbsp; I guess that was the end of any form of creativity in Windows for the user. After that it all seems to be some idea of "You do it our way or not at all."</p>

            <p>Maybe. Somewhere on the MSDN Channel 9 (from years ago, back in Vista so around 2006) there is about a 30 minute video with the guy (just one guy!) that re-built the audio stack and talked about how he built the new ability to control per-application volume.&nbsp;
 In Windows XP you only had one output level, but in Vista+ you can set different levels for every application in their own channel.&nbsp; The original intent of it was so you could have modern style "ducking", whereas your video player would turn down to 15% when
 an incoming phone call or other conference was beginning.&nbsp; It was pretty revolutionary at the time, remember this is back before even the iPhone came around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had more than one microphone in any computer I've owned, so I never even knew that XP could have different levels for different microphones all controlled from one volume mixer.</p>

            <p>I have always wondered why Microsoft remains so close yet so far away from being a creative medium...<br />
Yes, I do have the need for multiple recording controls and they have to be readily accessible, not multiple clicks away from usefulness.&nbsp; I guess the discussion is just not happening here in this forum as it is in others.</p>
