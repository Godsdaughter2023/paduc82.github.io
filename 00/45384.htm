                    <p>Some of the updates that have Failed to install ( or just hang)- on my PC &amp; Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For note I had been away for while, came home and decided to start updating my PC and Laptop.</p>
<p>This post is after several days of attempting to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fails to install &gt;</p>
<p>- 2017-07 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4025339)</p>
<p>- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7 for Windows 10 Version 1607 and Windows Server 2016 for x64 (KB3186568)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried numerous fixes, without joy. None of the previous suggested fixes have worked, for me!</p>
<p>Will try a clean install as a last ditch attempt; but boy have I had to put in some hours for this. I am so angry that little or no real help on this is forthcoming given it is a known issue affecting many people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have put Linux Mint onto my laptop, confident that it will allow me secure internet access and a secure OS. I do not want to do this with my PC, but, as it stands, it is looking highly likely that this will have to be the case. I need a reliable OS, secure
 and stable - currently this is not the case with my PC running Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft, what are you playing at?</p>

<p>MS gets dumber and dumber every day. Millions are reporting update problems, but MS states, to press, that the users are not installing the updates. Look at it this way, they made the system, didn't do ample testing, put out an update to fix a problem they
 created and know the update fails to install, but it is the user fault, even though the error code is unknown to them and the user is actually trying to install it? That's like me blaming my cars manufacture because I never put gas in the car and it ran out
 of gas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what you try&nbsp;KB4019472,&nbsp;KB4022715 and&nbsp;KB4033637 will fail 100% of the time; reinstalling your OS will not help at all. You can download the offline update from the MS KBA page to install (1GB each), and this will fail as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at the event viewer, you will see the error code is the same for each error. The error code is however, unknown to MS! MS doesn't include any message as to
<p>
</p><p>Why not simply explain what and were the update failed at? Example, "Update XYZ filed to install because file ABC is version EFG and we expected IJK." And perhaps even offer, "Do you want to overwrite this file with the new file and continue installing?"
 Would make it interactive, and explain what is going on so that the end user can actually get the system and updates running! not to mention actually help the user and people supporting them (BTW: MS provides absolutely no technical support, if you buy extra
 support, and call them, you land in some call center in some country, and that agent is not an MS employee, never has been, never will be, he or she cannot provide the help needed. They create a ticket that MS may or may not look at. Unless you happen to personally
 know someone from MS, you will never be able to speak to someone from MS to get the errors looked into).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reported the error codes in the forums, and on the MS KBA pages, but MS refuses to react to it. Their position is, and remains, the is no error, the end user is the problem. We will not address this unless we absolutely have to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a pathetic OS and at the rate it is going, will soon be the worst one ever put out. I have used all versions of Windows since 3.0, and Windows 10 is the absolute worst when it comes to updating. Windows XP and Windows 7 were, and still are,
 the best versions of Windows ever put out. But MS refuses to support those, in fact you can't even download the updates for them to install anytime. This is their idea of perfect end user support. They force all users to move to a poorly designed and unstable
 system, then blame the users for the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS elected to destroy themselves when they put out Windows 8, virtually every user complained about Win8, and there were many new articles covering how bad the system is, and yet they continued with their abusive and ignorant behavior towards the end users,
 with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What MS fails to understand is, that WE, the end user, can put MS out of business simply by not installing or buying Windows or any MS product. There are plenty of alternatives out there that are better, just not getting enough attention, Linux being the
 best alternative and for an office product? Simply go with LibreOffice. Both free and guess what? Fully supported!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a final note, it has not been confirmed or denied, however the 'hackers' that are exploiting the problems that MS is creating the patches for, appear to actually work for MS &nbsp;and there is strong indications of it, the exploits are tests to check the system
 and end users. Within the updates, are changes to open doors to allow MS to spy on the end user. These same open doors are what these 'hackers' (rouge staff) are using, MS simply closes the door and opens a new one.</p>

            Didn't work, same result as always with several update packages: hours of "working on update..." and "couldn't install...undoing."&nbsp; Update Troubleshooter helpfully reports errors with update database, "did not fix"; so what??!!&nbsp; Best solution I have found
 is to avoid downtime by&nbsp;ignoring restart notices&nbsp;for days.

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why you are having challenges updating your Windows 10. Before we proceed, we would like to confirm if you’ve already tried manually downloading the update using the Microsoft update catalog as suggested by PA Bear on July 21,
 2017. If yes and you’re still getting the same error message, you can run the DISM command. This will help you fix damaged system files that prevent you from installing the update. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on <strong><span>Start</span></strong> (<strong><span>Windows icon</span></strong>).</li><li>Select <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></strong>.</li><li>Enter your Administrator credentials if prompted.</li><li>Click <strong><span>Allow</span></strong> or
<strong><span>Yes</span></strong>.</li><li>Type <strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></li><li>Press <strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</li><li>Type <strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></li><li>Press <strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</li><li>Close the command prompt once done, and then run the <strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong> again.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take note that the command operation might take several minutes to complete. The DISM tool uses the Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix the corruption. If the Windows Update client is already broken, you have to use a running installation
 as the repair source. To perform it, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on <strong><span>Start</span></strong> (<strong><span>Windows icon</span></strong>).</li><li>Select <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></strong>.</li><li>Enter your Administrator credentials if prompted.</li><li>Click <strong><span>Allow</span></strong> or
<strong><span>Yes</span></strong>.</li><li>Type <strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</span></strong></li><li>Press <strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</li><li>Type <strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></li><li>Press <strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</li><li>Close the command prompt once done, and then run the <strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong> again.</li></ol>

For the last 3 days, Microsoft technicians have been working for endless hours trying to resolve this issue with my machine via remote access. &nbsp;My case was escalated 2 days ago. Still no resolution. &nbsp;Everything typed above was tried by the technician as I watched
 what they were remotely doing with my machine. &nbsp;Still, nothing. &nbsp;The above scans revealed nothing. I believe this is a huge issue, since most of my computer science classmates are experiencing the exact same thing. The technician working on my laptop remotely
 will try again in a few days. &nbsp;I'm not a happy windows user anymore. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have become a Linux person now since I cannot afford to have my laptop hijacked for endless hours. &nbsp;Microsoft really messed up this time.</p>

<p>If you are referring to my latest post, my issue comes from the update listed at the end of the list on the very first post in this thread. &nbsp;The&nbsp;2017-06 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4022725) &nbsp;is the one causing all
 of my headaches by continually trying to update, reboot, &nbsp;and fail. Rinse. Repeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before this, it was the 2017-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4020102) that did the exact same thing. &nbsp;It has been going on for a few months now, and I discovered that I am not alone in this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After spending 4 hours yesterday on this, the technician had to leave. &nbsp;Not before uninstalling my antivirus and trying again, which also failed. A manual install failed as well. &nbsp;Even a Windows 10 repair done by the tech failed. This was the third day of
 attempting to resolve this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised none of the techs checked the event viewer for the error logs, which stated a critical error when trying to update two apps, Groove Music and Microsoft Photos, both of which I never even care about or use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to be enlightened more, I suggest looking up any notes there may be for the escalated service request: SRX1392741909ID&nbsp;</p>
<p>which still remains unresolved.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How can I download Windows 7 OPK Disk&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray valdes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I download Windows 7 OPK Disk&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am regisered but every time&nbsp; try to download the OPK image, it takes me to a site saying that the link was not found. I have 24 copies of the OEM system builder DVD's I may just have to throw away, since they are non returnable and I can get no help from
 Microsoft in downloading the image. I have been taken to link after link and they are all locked with the little lock next to the link. I can sign n on the partner site, but once I get to the site where I can download the image, I am not allowed to do so.
 I have emailed Microsoft numerous times with no reply, I would ba happy to purchase the DVD if necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the OPK disk necessary to install the OEM System Builder software? If not, I will just install it on the machine and register to my client it before I give it to him.</p>

            <p>You have to be a registered Microsoft Partner to obtain the OPK. The OPK disc is not necessary to install unless you are a certified system builder which I am beginning to think you are not.
</p>
<p>OEM licenses are to be installed by professional system manufacturers only. Under Microsoft's OEM License Agreement, they are not to be sold to end-users under any circumstance, and are to be preinstalled on a computer using the OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK)
 before shipment to the customer, and must include at the very least the manufacturer's support contact information. They are, therefore, designed for installation only on a single computer and are not transferable, even if the original computer is no longer
 in use. This is not usually an issue for users who purchase new computer systems, because most pre-assembled systems ship with a preinstalled operating system. There are few circumstances where Microsoft will allow the transfer of an OEM license from one non-functioning
 system to another, but the OEM System Builder License Agreement (SBLA), as well as the OEM End User License Agreement (EULA) do not contain any allowance for this, so it is entirely up to Microsoft's discretion, depending on the situation</p>

</p><p>No, that did not work because if you choose the 'keep your files' option it requires a login.</p>

<h2>            Defrag Files Large Than 64 MB</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>How can I get the defrag.exe command line utility to defrag files larger than 64 MB? I seem to remember that this was possible in Vista.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Noel,</p>
<p>The <strong>/W</strong> switch didn't seem to work. I never got an error message when I started defrag.exe, but it finished saying "File fragments larger than 64MB are not included in the fragmentation statistics."</p>
<p>I first thought that it would have done a full defragmentation, but it finished so quickly I don't think it would have had time to defrag the many files that are several gigabytes each.</p>
<p>I'm guessing Windows 7 has removed this feature, then?</p>

<p>It looks like the <strong>/W</strong> switch was deprecated (not removed) so that batch files written during Vista wouldn't break while running in Windows 7.</p>
<p>On another note, I accidentally typed in the <strong>/B</strong> switch, and defrag started defragmenting my boot files. Must be an undocumented switch.</p>

<p>cShane, I'm curious:&nbsp; Why is it you feel you need to run the defrag command?&nbsp; Are you seeing specific performance degradation?</p>
<p>Keep in mind Windows 7 regularly (once a week) runs its own defrag in the Task Scheduler by default.&nbsp; Notably the command they have set up to do this is:</p>
<p><strong>%windir%\system32\defrag.exe -c</strong></p>

<p>I see.&nbsp; I was just wondering, since I've not perceived any bottlenecks in my file system since I set up Windows 7, but I do have a top-of-the line workstation with Raid, so this computer is the fastest I've ever used.&nbsp; I've really just not had to wait on
 anything at all so defragging hasn't been on my mind.</p>
<p>I think I read a solution for that Task Scheduler problem somewhere that involves opening up the permissions on certain folders and keys so that you have full control.&nbsp; I don't think they identified the reason for the problem, but apparently somehow the
 ACLs get at odds with the user, and it looked like the solution worked for a lot of folks.&nbsp; Do some searches for "Task Scheduler Registry ACL" or similar and see if you can turn that up.&nbsp; From what I recall, the person who fixed it created a little procedure
 that can be run by virtually anyone.&nbsp; I'll see if I can turn up the thread.</p>

<h2>            windows hello option not showing even after Digital Persona 4500 fingerprint reader</h2>
                    <p>I am posting regarding windows hello features which is still not showing after attachment of Digital Persona 4500 fingerprint reader . Many kind hearted people replying me with different solutions. But still I am unfortunately not able to see HELLO setup.
 My DELL XPS L502X laptop&nbsp;installed with&nbsp;driver from manufacturers website and also from digital persona website. Driver Version 4.0.0.143. Digital Persona 4500 fingerprint reader detected in device manager and and also Connected Devices as Biokey 200 fingerprint
 scanner. But I cannot use it because Windows Hello not showing in sign in&nbsp;option to set up fingerprint. &nbsp;Digital Persona 4500 fingerprint reader is a Microsoft Certified device to work with Windows 10 Home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think someone have to see my laptop remotely to solve this. I requested for ph. numbers to call. Before next reply kindly go through the previous suggestions which I have already tried.</p>

<p><span>2. To setup a PIN, you will need to login to Windows 10 with a Microsoft Account and add your PIN to your MSA profile. Enter your password in the field provided and then select Sign In.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Next, you need to set up a PIN and confirm it. Then select OK.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Next, select Set up under Windows Hello.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Select Get started.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Run your finger over the fingerprint scanner until the setup app reports completed. You can now optional add more/different fingers.</span></p>

            <div>Hi Santanu,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and welcome to <strong>
Windows 10</strong> family.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand that you are unable to sign-in into Windows Hello even after attaching a Bio-metric fingerprint reader. We will certainly help you with this.
<div>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate you for trying all the basic troubleshooting steps to check. Let’s check with different option to fix this.</p>
<div><br />
Sometimes, you may not be able to sign-in into Windows Hello if there is any account corruption. So, we request you to
<strong>create a new Microsoft account </strong>and check if it works. </div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts</span></a>
<div><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: You’ll be able to sign-in into Windows Hello, only if your PC has a fingerprint reader or a camera that supports it. So,
<strong>please check if your system recognizes the fingerprint reader that you have connected&nbsp;</strong>before trying to sign-in.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. For any further assistance on Windows, feel free to post your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>

<h2>            How do I restore some old environment variables&#63;</h2>
                    I installed some piece of software last night that messed up both my system path variable and my user path variables. Maybe some other variables as well. I want to set the values of the variables back to what they were before the installation. How might
 I do this? I have never used System Restore, so please do not suggest that.

            <p>If you cannot or do not want to use System Restore then you will have to edit and enter them manually in the System Properties applet found in the "Advanced System Settings" or edit them in the registry, the user variables are at the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment
 key and the system variables are at the <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question now is how will you remember the variables that were in place on your machine?</p>

            <p>NTFS is the file system, there are no previous versions in the file system, once changes to files are committed and flushed to the disk that is it.&nbsp; Perhaps you mean the Last Known Good Configuration at the advanced boot menu, that is only good until you
 reboot and logon to the installation, after a successful boot the Last Known Good Configuration is replace with the current successfully booted configuration.&nbsp; The Last Known Good Configuration only works on the Control Set, it doesn't do or restore anything
 else in the registry, it doesn't work for User settings.&nbsp; If the system was not rebooted after the problem occurred you could reboot the machine to the the advanced boot menu (tap the F8 key before Windows starts to boot) and boot to the Last Known Good Configuration
 and this would revert the system variables to the state they were when you last logged on to the machine, you would then only need to address your user variables.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore is really the best way out of these kind of snafus, if you have never used system restore I suggest that you familiarize yourself with it, either that or restore from a system state backup.&nbsp; If you had a backup of the registry or keys in question
 you can restore these.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can copy the variables from another clean Windows 7 installation but any software that you installed which added its own variables will (may) not work properly until you restore those.&nbsp;

<p>You could load the backed-up System hive (c:\windows\system32\config\regback\system) as an off-line hive, then restore your environmental variables from this key:
</p>
<p><em>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment</em></p>
<p>However, the process is involved and requires a high degree of skills at a maintenance level. It would be far easier, as John mentions, to use System Restore. Just because you have never used the mechanism before is not really a good reason to dismiss it.
 It is designed for non expert users and it works most of the time. When it does not work then it has no effect on the current state of Windows.</p>

            <p>There seems to be a need to clear up some fundamental misunderstandings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Well, no, I can't because these are Registry export files.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; The files in the folder c:\windows\system32\config\regback\ are not export files. They are actual registry files that could be used to replace the existing files in the folder c:\windows\system32\config.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I want to be able to view their contents, but Registry Editor does not provide a facility for doing so.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; The registry editor lets you view any registry file in the folder c:\windows\system32\config\regback if you know how to.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If I import them, which I have to avoid, then it will screw up my system.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; When you view them then you load them as separate hives. As such they have no effect whatsoever on the current system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Also, I can't use System Restore is not relevant here because I have not used it to backup anything.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; System restore is automatic and completely independent of your backup mechanisms. It is the ideal tool to fix a damaged registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However . . . restoring registry files from the backup folder is no longer an option. By waiting 4 weeks with your reply you basically "missed the bus". The files usually get overwritten within a week or so. Whether you still have a useable System Restore
 Point is uncertain. You need to invoke System Restore (rstrui.exe) to find out.</p>

<p>I have an old registry file that contains the data I need. It is not in C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack. How can I view them such that they are not imported?</p>

            Usually upgrade failures are due to either some driver acting up or an application conflict.
<br />Try to do the upgrade in a clean boot environment:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/929135...</a>
<br />See if there are corrupt system files.
<br />Do a System File check and run DISM tool and post back the results in the next reply:

            Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1709 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:
<br />

<br />
<br />You have one of a few options to consider here:
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Backup and perform a clean install - you have exhausted everything thats reasonably possible. Sometimes, your system has some unknown underlying issue that creates a blocker for upgrades. Save yourself: time, frustration and just perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />Yes, its a chore, but this man made stuff and it ain't perfect and it will never be. 
<br />
<br />Its better for you to have your data and go through the annoying convenience of reinstalling apps and drivers. 
<br />
<br />Backup:

<br />
<br />Option 2: Don't bother with the upgrade.
<br />
<br />My recommendation to users going forward is not to pounce on every new Windows 10 Feature Update that is released. If your system has been working just fine with the current version, wait it out a while or skip it all together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just to keep doing the same thing. 
<br />
<br />If you look at whats considered the flagship features of Windows 10 1709, they are aimed at newer generation devices like the new Surface Book 2. Otherwise welcome features like Story Remix, which you have to upgrade to 1709 to get, could be supplanted with third party alternatives.

<br />
<br />Option 3: upgrade to another release such as Windows 10 1703 
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

<h2>            How to transfer Windows 7 download from one laptop to another&#63;</h2>
                    I have 3 laptops;<br />
<br />
(1) A new laptop with a fast processor and Linux Distro.<br />
(2) The laptop that I'm currently using, with Windows 10 and is the only connection I have to the Internet.<br />
(3) A laptop which had Windows XP, and was fast but it died from overuse. However I have acquired another hard drive with Windows XP dated around 2001 and IE dated around 2007 but it is too old particularly for getting passed the Robot Security Check.<br />
<br />
I have downloaded Windows 7 from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/windows/ in No (2) laptop and have tried to copy the zipped folder and the unzipped folder to a DVD but it ruins the disks to being unusable. I need to copy onto
 a DVD to be able to get Windows 7 into No (1) laptop. And I'd like to install the same into No (3) laptop.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help?

            <p>You will likely need to purchase a new full version license.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>

    <title>Protection Fault Windows 10 HP 4511 Network Printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duanenewtondaddy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Protection Fault Windows 10 HP 4511 Network Printer</h2>
                    <p>I am getting a protection fault dialog box when I click on the Printer Properties button in a MS Excel spreadsheet. &nbsp;Once I close down the dialog box, it freezes up the MS Excel Spreadsheet I am in. &nbsp;This also happens when I am in MS Word. &nbsp;I have researched
 the problem but reloading the HP Printer software and driver does not help. &nbsp;I have also run a Malware scan on the laptop (Dell 5000 Series) with no bugs id'd. &nbsp;Prior to this problem, when I sent a document to the printer (HP 4511 Network printer), I noticed
 it was not printing colors. &nbsp;Both cartridges have ink, they're aligned, &nbsp;and cleaned.. &nbsp;The crazy thing about all of this is if I send the spreadsheet document to my Iphone, and then send the doc to the printer, it prints in color. &nbsp;If I try to print from
 the laptop, it's only in black and white. &nbsp;When I noticed the color printing issue, I found that clicking the Printer Properties button caused the protection fault. &nbsp;I have also turned everything off (printer and laptop) and turned them back on, and the protection
 fault still persists.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Duane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A protection fault is a type of interruption initiated by ISA-defined protection mechanisms in response to an access violation caused by some running code, either in the kernel or a user program. To get more closely to the root cause, we need additional
 information regarding your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you send us the specific error message you're getting?</li><li>Is your device completely up to date with the latest version of Windows? </li></ul>
<p>

<h2>            How can I restore damaged  .RTF file to a previous version without FILE HISTORY enabled&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday,&nbsp; while saving a [RTF] file,&nbsp; I accidentally unplugged my power cord.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, upon accessing the document, I was able to open it but a HUUUUUGE chunk was missing.&nbsp; However, the file size [53MB] still shows that the contents are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI,&nbsp; The FILE HISTORY feature for Windows 8 was disabled.&nbsp; Is there another way I can access a PREVIOUS version of this from earlier that day?&nbsp; I started editing around 1:30pm [EST] and the last revision STILL shows 5:34pm [EST], which is the version I
 desperately need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help I can get to restore this precious file would be ENORMOUSLY appreciated!!!&nbsp; THANK YOU!!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Previous versions are either copies of files and folders created by Windows Backup or copies of files and folders that Windows automatically saves as part of a restore point. You can use previous versions to restore files and folders that you accidentally
 modified or deleted, or that were damaged.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right clicking it &gt;previous versions&gt;select date of last known good document&gt; click restore&gt; open the file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note: This option will work , only </span><span>if the system protection is turned on, Windows automatically creates previous versions of files and folders that have been modified since the last restore point was made.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 updates mess up random drivers - no solution or help offered by Microsoft - users left to fend for themselves</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>I realize this is a crazy question before even asking, but any chance the new updates, before forcefully pushed to all Windows 10 users, be tested by, I don't know, QA? Like I said, a crazy question, right? So far, I encountered this twice: first this:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/update-kb3081424-created-problems/1c89feaa-ab2c-4e76-84cb-5dc86f2b8383
 &nbsp; , where I had by myself figure out that it's and audio driver update that rendered my computer unusable. The only help to any posts to this forum is "we're looking at these issues and will get back to you soon". Damn that's good support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>More recently, after one of these updates (which never list any details about what exactly is being updated, or why), the processor fan became inoperable. All of a sudden, I noticed that the laptop is running super hot. It took me some time to finally start
 troubleshooting, so not sure how much damage my brand new $1000 laptop had received (M$ care to throw me a few bucks if it goes caput so I can buy a new one LOL?)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I downloaded the drivers off the laptop manufacturer's site, reinstalled and voila - works. I don't see some grandma doing that though, so I guess she can just go cash her SSI check and get another laptop as the sacrifice to the great M$.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow, I hope somebody got a promotion for this cost-cutting approach to software development.</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are your games installed to the Hard Drive or are you playing them straight from the disc? Sometimes the Xbox performs better all around when high-taxing games, like racing games or FPS, are installed from the disc to the Hard Drive. You may want to give
 that a shot to see if it helps with your freezing troubles. To do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install a game on your hard drive</p>
<p>1.Insert the game disc into the disc drive.</p>
<p>*Note After you insert the disc, the default action is to automatically start the game. If this happens, exit the game and return to the Xbox Dashboard.</p>
<p>2.From the Home hub, select the game in the drive tray, and then press X on your controller.</p>
<p>3.Select Install.</p>
<p>4.A progress indicator appears while your game is being installed on your hard drive.</p>
<p>*Note Installing an Xbox 360 game might take 12 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some things to consider and remember for this process:</p>
<p>•Installing an Xbox 360 game on a hard drive requires between 4 and 8 gigabytes (GB) of free disk space.</p>
<p>•After installing a game on your hard drive, you still need to have the game disc in the disc drive when you start the game.</p>
<p>•Installing games on your hard drive improves load times and minimizes game disc access.</p>
<p>•You can install games to a USB flash drive or to an Xbox 360 4 GB console. However, some games will not play correctly.</p>
<p>•Original Xbox games cannot be installed on an Xbox 360 Hard Drive.</p>
<p>(Reference: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/audio-video-setup-and-use/install-play-delete-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../install-play-delete-game</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps you out. Let me know if doing this doesn't solve your problem, and we may have to venture a bit further to help resolve this!</p>

<h2>            Display Driver not working properly... &#40;Code 31&#41;</h2>
                    I am operating on Vista.&nbsp; I got a new game, played it the other day fine.&nbsp; I try to play now and I get the menu screen but once I click to play, the screen flickers and goes black for a second and flickers again.&nbsp; The game does not start.&nbsp; I checked the
 device manager and it said that display driver isatap is not working properly because windows cannot load the drivers required for this device (Code 31).&nbsp; I played the game the other day and this is very confusing to me.&nbsp; Can someone please help me?

<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been brought to our attention that some Skype accounts experiencing unusual behaviors like cannot send instant messages. We are aware of this and&nbsp;are now working to fix this issue, but do not have a time estimate of when it will be resolved.</p>

<h2>            Remote Assistance on Windows 7 - OfferRA not working</h2>
                    <p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Can anyone help me resolve a long running issue regarding Remote Assistance on Windows 7?</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>We have recently upgraded many of our PCs from XP to Win7 but our Helpdesk are no longer able to use Remote Assistance on the Win7 PCs so I've been trying to get it fixed. I’ve read dozens of articles
 on various forums and&nbsp;tried a wide range of suggested solutions - I’ve dug into the registry, tweaked DCOM settings, modified GPOs, messed around with Teredo and PNRP settings, amended firewalls and changed permissions – all to no avail!</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>This is my test setup:</font></font></font></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Windows 2003 corporate domain</font></font></font></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Helper and target PCs both running Windows 7 Professional 32-bit. Both PCs on same subnet (actually on adjacent desks)</font></font></font></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Offer Remote Assistance GPO setting enabled and helper is a member of the listed group</font></font></font></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Firewalls on both PCs have default Remote Assistance rules enabled</font></font></font></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Target PC has Remote Assistance enabled and the Offer Remote Assistance Helpers local group is populated as per the group policy</font></font></font></span></div>
</li></ul>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>So far, so good.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Now, <strong>Remote Assistance works fine when the target PC user solicits help through an invitation file or email</strong> (Easy Connect option not available though). However,
<em>offering</em> remote assistance has never worked. </font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>This is the scenario:</font></font></font></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Helper runs MSRA.EXE /OFFERRA and is prompted for the name or IP address of the target PC</font></font></font></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>On entering the address and clicking OK receives the message “Offering Remote Assistance: Connecting to the remote computer to get the logged in users…”</font></font></font></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>At this stage Event Viewer on the
<em>target</em> PC shows raserver.exe as running (which I thought a little odd as Windows 7 uses msra.exe for remote assistance). Nothing else appears on the target PC, i.e. no RA prompts</font></font></font></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>After 15secs or so an error message is displayed on the Helper PC “Your offer to help could not be sent. Check the following: Do you have the correct permissions on the remote computer [I have].
 Is the remote computer turned on and is it connected to the network [Yes and Yes]. Is there a network problem [No]. “</font></font></font></span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>In the event viewer of the Helper PC the following events are logged:</font></font></font></span></div>
</li></ul>
<font color="#000000"><font><span>
<p><font><font><span>Event id 9 - </span><span>There was a problem interacting with COM object 833E4010-AFF7-4AC3-AAC2-9F24C1457BCE.<span>&nbsp;
</span>An outdated version might be installed, or the component might not be installed at all.</span></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><span>Event id 13 - </span><span>Remote Assistance started with:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>/offerRA<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>as the command line parameters</span><span> </span>
</font></font></p>
<p><font><font><span>Event id 41 - </span><span>Diagnosis Repro Attempt resulted in a failure.</span></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><span>Event id 44 - </span><span>Remote Assistance troubleshooting has confirmed the problem: Remote Assistance Easy Connect isn't available.</span></font></font></p>
<p><span><font><font>Event id 30 - Remote Assistance has ended.</font></font></span></p>
</span></font></font>&nbsp; <font color="#000000"><font><span><span>
<p><font><font><span>This has been driving me crazy. Why is&nbsp;a supposedly simple admin tool&nbsp;so difficult to implement? Anyone found a solution for this yet?</span></font></font></p>
</span></span></font></font>&nbsp;

<h2>            Any keyboard input causes all programs to stop responding</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 10 tonight and it seems no matter what I open if I try to use any keyboard input at all (doesn't matter if it's physical keyboard through USB or ease of use keyboard) every program stops responding. Clean installing is not a
 solution the only thing I can think of is reverting back to Windows 7. This unresponsiveness includes cortana search bar, start menu, chrome, edge, all applications...&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the&nbsp;delayed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be due to incompatibility of "Bluetooth Tray Application" with the Keyboard. So if you don't use it then you can either disable it or uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can&nbsp;also re-install it back and check&nbsp;or check with the Manufacturer.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>In future, if you have any issues related to Windows, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Window 7 pro -64 it - UAC issues with iTunes, some programs, and home network backups</h2>
                    <p>I have Win 7 Pro 64 bit on an HP Pavilion laptop that is about 4 years old. &nbsp;I've upgraded the hard drive and memory, and all software is up to date. &nbsp;I also run viruscan software with continuous protection, multi-scans per week, and malwarebytes scans deep
 twice a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My UAC has started asking for permission when I manually start iTunes via a desktop shortcut that has "run as administrator" checked. &nbsp;iTunes will no longer start automatically when I connect my phone via USB even though I've uninstalled all apple products
 and reinstalled multiple times using "run as administrator". &nbsp;Other programs that I try to start manually also ask permission to run. &nbsp;It also seems to be affecting my automated backup program that writes to a home network drive (via wireless access) causing
 the backups to fail for not having permission. &nbsp;At first I thought that my backup software had issues, because it would crash during the night (when backing up) with a program exception, so I got another backup software and it keeps a log that is telling me
 that it is having permission issues. &nbsp; I do not want to turn UAC off for obvious reasons, but I &nbsp;lowered the permission as low as I am comfortable with to level 3 (not-recommended) but that did not help, so &nbsp;I put it back to level 2 (recommended). &nbsp;As part
 of my attempting to fix this, I've tried to give my network drives permission for ALL to be able to have total access, and that fails as well. &nbsp;I've had the backup software for 2 years, and the network drive for almost as long with no backup problems until
 this UAC issue started. &nbsp; There are no other "users" on my computer, and I have admin level access. I can access all of the files on the network drive just fine from my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped as to how to fix this.</p>

            <p>- I uninstalled my original backup program that was crashing with a program exception, so I do not know what the error was. &nbsp;I am reinstalling and setting the program to run auto backups again to try and recreate the error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I have not made any significant changes, but I do have windows set to run updates automatically.</p>
<p>Itunes:</p>
<p>- I turned off "run as administrator" for my desktop link, and now when I double-click the icon I get "<strong>The folder "iTunes" is on a locked disk or &nbsp;you do not have write permissions for this folde</strong><strong>r</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f6bef55-6c86-45ae-aa51-fd63b4358a02" /></p>
<p>- I turned "run as administrator" back on, and iTunes starts after the UAC box comes up asking for permission.</p>
<p>- the link in the instructions "<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-run-an-application-once-with-a-full-administrator-access-tokenWhat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-run-an-application-once-with-a-full-administrator-access-token"</a>&nbsp;does
 not exist.</p>
<p>- I followed the steps to turn off "start iTunes automatically" per the instructions, but the box that is supposed to come up which asks "do you want itunes to start automatically when you connect this iPhone" did not appear. &nbsp;I have tested this, and iTunes
 still does not start when I connect my iPhone via USB.</p>
<p>- I tried to follow the instructions "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Find iTunes in your applications folder. Right-click (control-click) on iTunes and select "</em></span><em>Show package contents</em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>".

 your computer and check if that solves the problem.</em>" but right clicking on "C:/program files (x86)/iTunes.exe" does not have the "show package contents" option. &nbsp;There is a file "itunesHelper.dll" in the ITuneshelper.resources file. &nbsp;Is this the correct
 file?? &nbsp;What is the "accounts login items" list??? &nbsp;I searched my c: drive and could not find any such file.</span></p>

    <title>Burning DVD from WMM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ctrain22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Burning DVD from WMM</h2>
                    I made a movie in WMM using photos of my trip. I added music also. It plays great within WMM and Windows Media Player. I saved the movie and burned the disc with Windows media Player. The movie is 58 minutes long, 5.56gb. I used a dual layer DVD+R disc.
 When I play it in my DVD player, only half the movie plays, then stops. The whole movie plays great in the computer, but only half on a dvd. Any suggestions? I even install Cyberlink Media Suite 10 to try to burn it there. But when I use that, it won't burn
 a dvd saying some of the files are corrupt or missing.

            <blockquote>I made a movie in WMM using photos of my trip. I added music also. It plays great within WMM and Windows Media Player. I saved the movie and burned the disc with Windows media Player. The movie is 58 minutes long, 5.56gb. I
 used a dual layer DVD+R disc. When I play it in my DVD player, only half the movie plays, then stops. The whole movie plays great in the computer, but only half on a dvd. Any suggestions? I even install Cyberlink Media Suite 10 to try to burn it there. But
 when I use that, it won't burn a dvd saying some of the files are corrupt or missing.
</blockquote>
===========================================<br />
You do not need a dual-layer DVD for a 58 minute movie <br />
if you burn a Video DVD using Windows DVD Maker or <br />
any other DVD Authoring software. <br />
<br />
Windows Media Player can only burn a Data DVD not a <br />
Video DVD. Many if not most free standing DVD Players <br />
will not recognize a Data DVD.<br />
<br />
If you are running Windows 8 and do not have Windows <br />
DVD Maker...your Cyberlink software should work on a <br />
Single Layer DVD. (Cyberlink will not recognize your WLMP <br />
project file...you will need the .WMV or .MP4 video file).<br />
<br />
Yes, the 5.56GB video file will fit on a single layer DVD <br />
because Video DVDs are encoded based on Duration <br />
and not file size.<br />
<br />

            <p>I have Windows 8.1 (upgraded from Windows8). The file format the movie was saved is MP4. From Windows Media Player, I just opened the movie and clicked "burn". Told it I wanted to burn as a movie on DVD.

=====================================<br />
I understand that you used Windows Media Player <br />
to burn the DVD...my point was that Windows Media <br />
Player will only burn a Data DVD and not a Video DVD <br />
that would be compatible with all free standing DVD <br />
Players.<br />
<br />
You could check the directory of the DVD and see<br />
if it has a VIDEO_TS folder that contains VOB files...<br />
if not...it is definitely not a Video DVD.<br />
<br />
IOW...it may be a DVD that contains video but may<br />
not be encoded as a Video DVD.<br />
<br />
Personally I use DVD-R but either should work...<br />
might be a good idea to check the documentation <br />
for your burner to see what it is compatible with.<br />
<br />
Yes you have choices when saving in Movie Maker.<br />
You can save the WLMP Project file for re-editing <br />
purposes.<br />
<br />
And you can save in the MP4 or WMV video formats.<br />

How to save as movie in Movie Maker 2011, 2012<br />
Previously Posted by&nbsp; Leonard_Su<br />
<br />
1. Open Movie Maker and open the project file you have (.wlmp)<br />
<br />
2. In the program window, press these keys on your keyboard ALT + F + select<br />
Save Movie and choose Recommended for this project.<br />
<br />
3. After that choose your preferred destination where you want to save the<br />
movie.<br />
<br />
4. Edit the movie file name and the file format of the movie. (You can<br />
choose .WMV or MPEG-4 if you are using the latest version of Movie Maker<br />
2012. If not you can only choose .WMV)<br />
<br />
5. Click Save button.<br />

Often they get stuck in technical items, whereas we are real life people who have met lots of real life problems and talk real life language........... which all helps. Glad you are back working.<br />

<h2>            Microphone not working... therefore I cannot use Cortana</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just had Windows 10 re-installed on my laptop - DELL Inspiron 1545 which has a built-in microphone next to the Power light.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get the microphone to work. When I troubleshoot the problem, it tells me that the microphone or headset is unplugged (but the microphone is built in).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I test the sound functionality - playback and recording, the speakers work but not the microphone does not.</p>
<p>Is my microphone broken or any ideas to a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there there anyway I can do a verification check to be sure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else realted to audio is working fine.</p>
