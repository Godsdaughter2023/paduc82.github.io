<h2>            Cascading&#47;Synchronized Combo Boxes in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hopefully someone can help with this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a&nbsp;form in Word 2010 that is utilizing comboboxes of Make and Model and I want them to cascade/synchronize.&nbsp; For example, the first combobox has three options for Make:&nbsp;Nissan, Honda, or Toyota.&nbsp; In the second dropdown if Nissan is chosen then only
 Altima, Murano, Sentra appears.&nbsp; If Honda is chosen then only Accord, Pilot, Civic appears, etc.&nbsp; I was able to populate the&nbsp;Make combobox(Combobox1) with the code below but cannot figure out how to populate the Model combobox(Combobox2) with values that are
 dependent on the selection made in Combobox 1.&nbsp; I looked all over and only see code for Access or Excel.&nbsp; I need to use Word and I am not that familar with VBA.&nbsp; I would appreciate any help i can get (sorry if long winded, tried to be detailed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code used to populate Combobox1 (Make):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub ComboBox1_DropButtonClick()<br />
ComboBox1.List = Array("Nissan", "Honda", "Toyota")<br />
End Sub</p>

            Thank you for responding.&nbsp; I checked the webpages and while they have useful information I am a noob at VBA so its a little over my head.&nbsp; I tried taking the procedure listed for Cascading Listboxes in the 2nd link and replace ListBox with ComboBox however
 it did not work.&nbsp; I am not using an external word table so I am not sure the code for this.&nbsp; Thanks again

            Actually I tried again and using the second link I was able to create the cascading comboboxes!!! However, it seems that I have to execute the code after I open the document (then VBA) instead of having it execute on its own.&nbsp; Is there a way to do this?&nbsp;
 Looking up auto run macros gives&nbsp;me the syntax but&nbsp;not where it is supposed to go.&nbsp; Thanks again&nbsp;

            The first link would give you that information.&nbsp; You need to put an AutoNew macro in the Template to call the userform when a new document is created from the template.

            <p>AutoNew macros run when you create a new document based on a template.&nbsp; AutoOpen macros run when you open a document or template containing the macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at your code, ComboBox2 is a two column control.&nbsp; Provided the data in the control is correct, the code runs fine:<br />
<br />
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()<br />
&nbsp; With ComboBox2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ColumnCount = 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .AddItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .List(.ListCount - 1, 0) = "Some data"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .List(.ListCount - 1, 1) = "A" &amp; vbCr &amp; "B" &amp; vbCr &amp; "C"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .AddItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .List(.ListCount - 1, 0) = "Some data other date"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .List(.ListCount - 1, 1) = "X" &amp; vbCr &amp; "Y" &amp; vbCr &amp; "Z"<br />
&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
Private Sub ComboBox2_Change()<br />
&nbsp;Dim myArray As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Use Split function to create an array of data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; myArray = Split(ComboBox2.List(ComboBox2.ListIndex, 1), Chr(13))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Populate listbox2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ComboBox3.List = myArray<br />
&nbsp;End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Results in A, B, C listed or X, Y, Z listed.</p>

            <p>Thanks, when using the document on my PC its ok&nbsp;but,&nbsp;if&nbsp;I send it to someone and they open it the&nbsp;error "Compile error: Cannot find project or Library" when they use the combobox appears.&nbsp; I have no idea what that means.&nbsp; It only happens when someone else
 uses the combobox on the form not when I open it.&nbsp; The&nbsp;debug selects the code "Private Sub ComboBox2_Change()"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I keep getting a "Runtime error 381: Cound not get the List property. Invalid property array index."</p>
<p>whenever i type into or delete something in Combobox 2.&nbsp; The debug selects this code below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"myArray = Split(ComboBox2.List(ComboBox2.ListIndex, 1), Chr(13))"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help, this will be the last question as I do not want to continue pestering.&nbsp; I feel&nbsp;I am almost complete with this form and&nbsp;i dont want to give&nbsp;up&nbsp;</p>

            <p>When you use the VBE menu Tools&gt;References, what references do you see listed and which of those is missing for the other user?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said, based on the code you posted, your combobox2 appears to be a two column control and it works with the code I provided.&nbsp; However, if some types something in the box (that is a change) but one of the listed items is not selected.&nbsp; That is why
 you get the error.</p>

            <p>The Tools&gt;References option is greyed out on the other users desktops, and I canlt see what is there.&nbsp; Also there are way to many users to have to change those settings as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code you provided works great and the AutoOpen works as well.&nbsp; Its only thie weird error when other users open thats the issue.&nbsp; I think I will just use the dropdowns and hope users are smart enough to select them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Emails disappeared from my inbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I organise my emails into many sub-folders. Last week, when I logged into outlook.com (I've always logged on using outlook.com), at least 300-400 emails disappeared from my mailbox. The disappeared emails were from my main inbox but also many of my sub-folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example, some of my sub-folders now contain no emails where there were emails before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a reason why my emails have disappeared and how can I recover them? I definitely did not delete them, and the emails are not in my deleted folder or in the "recover deleted emails" section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Antony Gal</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I was just browsing my email as normal before it happened. Next time I logged on many emails disappeared.</p>
<p>- I have tried different browsers and the missing emails are still not there.</p>
<p>- I have not tried the Outlook app as I do not have this app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recovered my deleted emails in the Outlook web app, however, the missing emails are still not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi DocDir</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion. Unfortunately I am using email through outlook.com and I can't seem to find a view tab?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is, when I last logged in even my main inbox had 1000+ unread emails. Next time I logged on, the numbers of unread emails went down to 650 (and I had not read any additional unread emails).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just weird that so many of my email went missing overnight.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked and there are no rules in place to automatically delete emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using an email client to access my email and POP settings under account settings has been disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can do to recover my emails? Note that in the past week I have not lost any emails. It appeared to be a once-off event a few weeks ago.</p>

            Thanks for all the comments.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I have now found some of my emails (not the folders) by simply going to deleted items and then recovering deleted items&nbsp; which brought up a pile of emails from some of my folders.&nbsp; How they were deleted is still
 a mystery - I certainly did not delete anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;Found Microsoft most unhelpful.

<h2>            IE 11&#58; Can&#39;t open links in a new tab</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed IE 11 in Win7 Ultimate x64 sp1.</p>
<p>Links will not auto-open in a new tab. I have to manually cut &amp; paste links in the URL field to make them work.</p>
<p>Also, Microsoft's support links do not work at all.</p>
<p>This seems to be known in the community as the "about;blank" bug, but none of the answers I've found have helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any fix for this without wiping my install &amp; returning to IE8?</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to effectively assist you in your concern about opening links in a new tab using Internet Explorer, you might want to check the post of Don Varnau from this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-iewindows8_1/how-to-force-internet-explorer-11-to-open-any-link/1e89aedd-bd49-4530-8bc1-e8c507080a70">
thread</a> for the steps that you can do for that option. As for the other issue about opening Microsoft's support pages, what is the exact error message you're receiving? Are you using Internet Explorer as well? Have you tried to use a different browser and
 see if it's also occuring? Using a different browser would help us to isolate the issue further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us and if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to post back.</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;Jomel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding to my request for help but I already tried your suggestions and they did not work. Links that open in the same tab do not cause trouble. Links that open a new tab either open a blank page with no URL or a blank page with the URL
 of the page where the link was posted. Clicking a GO button in a pop-up produces the correct animations but does not execute the needed response. &nbsp;Clicking&nbsp;on Microsoft's support links&nbsp;produces the correct animations but does not execute the needed response.
 No error messages are ever produced. Also, my ISP thinks I am using an older outdated version of IE that they do not support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet options are set as recommended and changing them has no apparent effect.</p>
<p>Right-click&gt; open does the same thing.</p>
<p>Right-click&gt; open in a new tab&nbsp;does the same thing.</p>
<p>Right-click&gt; open in a new window&nbsp;does&nbsp;nothing.</p>
<p>Middle-click does the same thing.</p>
<p>Ctrl + click does the same thing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click&gt; copy shortcut &amp; manually paste as URL in blank page is the only thing that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear about this, if I find a browser that works I will quit using IE. Microsoft should be ashamed they haven't fixed this after having 4 years of opportunity to do so. And TBH, I'm offended you gave me a link to a page about links that don't
 work.</p>

<p><del>Issue resolved.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I was doing a clean install, I went ahead and bought a new hard drive. I checked my Administrative Events log and discovered an extraordinary number of anti-malware errors labeled as update failures none of which produced an error message and Windows
 Update explicitly stated all updates were successful. It seems apparent there was an undocumented conflict between Security Essentials and Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Win7, I installed SP1 &amp; IE11 individually before Security Essentials was installed and there were
<del>no</del> unresolved errors. All additional updates automatically installed without incident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not surprised Microsoft botched this update. I haven't forgotten the time they automatically updated my system with the Sasser Worm. It has become my policy to lock all of my settings when they are working correctly and turn off Auto Update. I can't
 tolerate Microsoft trying to fix problems I don't have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; I've started getting random intermittent error messages saying IE11 doesn't support MSN's video format. I don't know if it is unique to MSN or if it will also happen elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Update: Secondary issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I traced my video problems to a failed driver update.&nbsp; I deleted the new drivers and reinstalled the OEM drivers and IE11 seems to be working correctly now.&nbsp; The only problem left is the original complaint.&nbsp; My ISP still thinks I'm using IE8 and they are
 still threatening to block access to my account if I don't update my browser.&nbsp; I have no way of knowing why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the process of cleaning up this mess, I rediscovered the reason why these updates are not installing correctly.&nbsp; Many of them require a full cold reboot before they will register correctly but the update process only does a warm restart.&nbsp; I've been on
 the internet nearly 30 years and this isn't the first time this has happened.&nbsp; It's one of the reasons why I stopped using Auto Update.&nbsp; If Microsoft doesn't understand the problem and can't find a way to fix it, they deserve every irate comment they get.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can set the music + volume bar only to dark and light configurations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On the home screen, swipe left, and tap settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Go to theme and set the background to light or dark</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If incase you wanted to remove the active song from the music + volume bar, you may take a look at Stop the Music! app at Windows Marketplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for bringing this up, and sorry about the long delay. Regarding the issue, Windows Defender will be silent when there's another Antivirus installed - especially when the said antivirus is enabled as default protection software. You can still perform
 scans with the Windows Defender, but is only allowed manually. <br />

 If you do not understand the explanations, please, there try to re-state what you understood and try to elaborate more about what part you did not understood, yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each product code is a firmware variant, each firmware variant comes with a limited set of languages, for example your 059F7M7 came with Bangla. Now you updated to V 07.37 (why?) and you changed the product code again. Because of that, your set of languages
 changed, too. However, now you have a big problem because you do not have the tools to change your product code again because that would be a downgrade.</p>

 One of your issues happened because of the product code change: The Nokia Care Centre had to flash the latest version for that product code – and that version (not the variant) removed some of the applications you were used to. Anyway, you extracted those
 applications already. What else do you face?</p>

<p>As stated earlier, please try to explain and state what you have understood already. That makes it easier to answer you, because one knows which parts are missing and/or not understood yet! Now I have to give you an assumption of explanation, the very big
 picture which is a long story:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia created several variants of each firmware version, for example code 059F7M7 for version 07.36. As you see, the variants are identified by the product code, in this example code 059F7M7. Your phone was targeted for a different market, therefore the
 label on your Nokia 311 (and its initial product code) was 059G914. Correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we have issue number one: Each firmware variant comes with a limited set of languages. I do not know why Nokia does this, but they do. Therefore, some firmware variants come with Chinese, some with Bangla, some with Thai, some with German, ‥. Consequently,
 here in Germany my product code is 059F730. Although I have version 07.36, I do not have Thai, although the same version is sold in Thailand—the difference is the product code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the reason for not having Bangla on your phone right now: You flashed to a product code which does not have Bangla included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution would be to go for the product code you had before. Now we have issue number two: The product code with Bangla did not get version 07.37. Again, I do not know why Nokia does this. Anyway, it is common practice at Nokia that some minor updates
 are not rolled-out globally. Still, the ‘engineers’ increase the version number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the reason for not having Bangla on your phone right now: You flashed to a product code for France which does not have Bangla at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution would be to downgrade the version. Now we have issue number three: Nokia Care Tools, those which are public and available at the lower level Nokia Care Centre do not allow to downgrade firmware files. Again, I do not know why Nokia does not
 allow this. Anyway, it is like it is, officially nobody is able to downgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, you are stuck at 07.37. Consequently, you are stuck at a product code without Bangla. The easiest solution is to sell that Nokia 311 and go for a Nokia 311 with firmware 03.81, 03.90, or 05.92. With those firmware, you can can change the product
 code and go for a firmware which has Bangla and version&nbsp;05.92.&nbsp;With that version, you still have all the apps you desired so much—except the Nokia Maps app, at least you stated that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am an end-uer like you. I do not know all firmware variants and what is included in each. Perhaps you find a combination of Bangla and with Nokia Maps. Or you go for your old strategy and use that firmware version, to extract all these Java apps. Then
 you go for 07.36 and re-install them. Anyway, you cannot go for 07.37 because you are stuck without Bangla then. Therefore, it might be much easier to go for a Windows Phone. There you have Nokia Maps = HERE Maps and you are able to install all languages dynamically

<h2>            Are Non-Billable hours considered the same as Actual Work&#63;</h2>
                    In Project Online, are Non-Billable hours considered the same as Actual Work and stop the PWA Portfolio Analyzer tool from allowing the project Start Date from being changed during "what-f" analysis? We're looking for a way to track pre-project work (business
 case development) without locking the project's Start Date in the Portfolio Analyzer tool when actual hours are keyed.

</p><p>What your consultant told you is totally true.&nbsp; Tracking pre-project work in the actual project is going to prevent you from changing the Start date of the project in a Portfolio Analysis.&nbsp; Once the first task has an Actual Start date, the system then sets
 that date as the Actual Start date of the project, which effectively locks the Start date so it cannot be changed.&nbsp; Non-billable work is Actual Work, which triggers the process your consultant told you about.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I was not clear enough. It is not the email address, it is the Displayed name in front of the email address. Also I do not use Outlook as my domain. I use Hotmail.com. So here is my example of what I see&nbsp; WAYNE KAUFMAN &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use to use the Hotmail connector in Outlook, but that no longer work, so now I have an exchange account and only an exchange admin can change the "Displayed Name". I have correct the displayed name online at my Outlook Profile, but that does not help because
 only an admin can change it in exchange. So how do I email the admin?</p>

Thanks.&nbsp; I guess I won't be holding my breath waiting for this to be fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to switch to using microsoft for email, because Verizon email isn't that great...but apparently I guess Verizon isn't alone in not being that great.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp;&nbsp; :)&nbsp;

            <p>UPDATE:&nbsp; This solution WORKED!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; Go to outlook.com and sign in.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; do this on a computer, NOT a mobile device.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; In the upper right corner you see an icon (the one that when you click on, it shows your name and email address, as well as your status such as 'away' 'available' etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Click on that icon. &nbsp; A drop-down menu will appear. &nbsp; Choose Edit Profile, and change your First Name to just your first initial (but lowercase). &nbsp; Change your last name to just your last initial (but lowercase).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; You'll notice that after you save, and you click on the SAME icon again IN THE OUTLOOK MAIL PAGE. ,&nbsp; it will STILL show your First and Last name in uppercase letters.&nbsp;&nbsp; (That's because the change you just made doesn't get fully integrated into the system
 right away)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5)&nbsp; Eventually (likely sometime during the next day)&nbsp; the new name consisting of just your first and last initials in lowercase will finally stick (be fully integrated into the system) and when you send out an email that now shows up as your name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp; Go back into the Edit Profile from the outlook.com email page....same way you got to it before.... and change back to your regular First and Last name but not all capitals.&nbsp;&nbsp; It won't stick right away, but&nbsp; it will eventually (maybe not until sometime
 the next day) get fully integrated into the system and you name will now be mixed case when sending out an email.</p>
<br />
<p>7) The key is to first change your name to something other than your regular first and last name, and wait for that to eventually stick (and confirm by sending out emails).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, you just change it back to your regular name, but not be all capitals, .&nbsp;&nbsp;
 If you fail to first change it something else (like your first and last initial)....and fail to wait for that to stick first....then it definitely won't work.
</p>

                    <p>I upgraded to the Win 10 Phone Developer Preview as soon as it was available (mid 2015?) and my immediate experience was good.&nbsp; Over the past 3 months or so, performance has become progressively slower and apps crash regularly.&nbsp; In particular, Cortana takes
 10 to 30 seconds to respond after a few attempts to speak commands.&nbsp; Hard to say for sure but I began to experience problems after updates in Jan or Feb (?)&nbsp; I reboot regularly and have hard reset the phone twice.&nbsp; I can also no longer&nbsp;function without a wifi
 hotspot.&nbsp; As I struggle, my girls use their iPhones to get directions, search and connect.&nbsp; I don't mention that to rant or dig but just to ask a serious question.&nbsp; I need a reliable mobile device.&nbsp; Will this improve or do I throw in the towel?</p>

            <p>Paul, I have the same phone with Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; I've been running it since December 2015.&nbsp; My phone is on the Slow Ring of Windows insider and currently at build 10586.318.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The performance is good and fluid.&nbsp; I would suggest the same as "hphom" by resetting the phone.&nbsp; I have done this 3 times since December (not that I needed to) but did it for a clean install. I do have an app that crashes frequently and that is the MS News
 app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issues I have with the phone on Windows 10 is the same since I installed Windows 10.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can not end a phone call 70% of the time. The screen will become unresponsive.<br />
(Have to cycle the power button to get screen touch back)</li><li>The quick action for Screen Brightness is wrong.&nbsp; Low is High. Medium is Low. High is High.<br />
(This I can live with as it does work properly if you go into the settings bypassing the quick action)</li></ol>
<p>It would be nice if Microsoft&nbsp;started to support these phones for Windows 10 since they are now supporting the ICON which is also a Verizon phone.&nbsp; The Lumia 928 has the specs for Windows 10 (1GB RAM &amp; 32GB storage).&nbsp; These phones are nice phones.&nbsp; In my
 family we have 5 of them and all are in use (2 on Windows 10).</p>

<h2>            Data labels on XY Scatter chart</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I used the VB code (from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/914813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/914813</a>) to create data labels on my XY Scatter Chart and it worked fine, except that when there are two or more labels for a single data point, it overlaps each other and its difficult to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any one help how to separate the labels? I did try formatting labels with "comma separator". It didn't help.</p>

<p>What phone have you got? You could start by making sure battery and sim are properly seated and not loose or moving. Sim could also be faulty so worth trying anyther sim to see if problem persists.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just got my hands on a HTC Touch Pro which has Windows Mobile 6.1 installed. The Phone is fantastic by the way if you're considering one. I have just one problem however..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you send text messages the inbox gets filled with a 'conversation' between you and the other person you are texting, I find this extremely annoying. Is there a way to change the text message inbox and outbox options so you just have received
 messages in the inbox and sent messages in the outbox, without any of the cinverstation type stuff?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rob</p>

<p>I'm not sure what device you are using but if by chance it is a Windows Mobile 6.1 device then here is a solution from Nick Cornaglia from MoDaCo (&nbsp;<a href="http://www.modaco.com/content/windows-mobile-news/271937/hack-disable-threaded-sms-in-winmo-6-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.modaco.com/content/windows-mobile-news/271937/hack-disable-threaded-sms-in-winmo-6-1/</a>
 )</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I'm personally a big fan of Threaded SMS. But I'm sure there are some out there who are not. For those uninspired few, I happened across a Registry Edit to disable threading on 6.1 devices. (The author claims it works on both Professional
 &amp; Standard devices (PPC &amp; SP).<br />
<br />
In your registry editor....Simply navigate to:<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Inbox\Settings\OEM\<br />
<br />
Under the registry key, create a new DWORD value with value name as SMSInboxThreadingDisabled and set it value
</em><a href="http://www.modaco.com/content/windows-mobile-news/271937/hack-disable-threaded-sms-in-winmo-6-1/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>data</em></a><em>
 to 1. (then restart your </em><a href="http://www.modaco.com/content/windows-mobile-news/271937/hack-disable-threaded-sms-in-winmo-6-1/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>phone</em></a><em>)<br />
<br />
Obviously...if you come to your senses eventually, you can change the value to 0 to revert back to threaded messages, or delete the dword entry entirely. (then restart your phone)<br />
<br />
Click the credit link to also download a cab file to do this automatically. (Note that the .CAB file will also install the registry key to force enable the Sent SMS notification bubble.)<br />

            <p>You have got to be kidding. This is the final post to the moderators on my thread about my problem that you have since previously not been helpful on, and now are ignoring,&nbsp;under the question "I have to consistently sign into my hotmail account."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Finally someone has taken the time to actually deal with a whole problem rather than relying on just the last post on a thread. Thank you.
</p>
<p>But now the problem that I'm experiencing is being dealt with as a<strong> "well it's free so what do you expect" (</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Please bear in mind that this is a free account which anyone can use. From business owners
 to students, to those who want an email account just so they could join sites over the internet).</strong>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And the attitude that <strong>"well it's not that big a problem so why are you complaining (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We understand that the seconds it takes to sign back in means a lot you.)</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You don't take into account that the account was safe before the transition. As I previously stated in my previous posts which you have told me you have read, I was never attacked before
 the transition to which you replied once again (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<strong>This means that whatever new features and functions had been carefully designed and planned with security in mind.)
</strong>My account was never at risk until I was down graded to Outlook.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You also are saying<strong> "Oh well put up with it because we forced a feature on you that you can't turn off if you choose not to have it.( The account
 shutting down and having to resign in after a few minutes of inactivity.)&nbsp;Put up with it because we know better than you. (One may find this difficult and unnecessary but we can never tell what may happen in the future. So we did not leave anything to best
 guess and that’s why we have this feature.) </strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So looking at the response as a whole,
<strong>Microsoft as a company is saying through it's moderators that I can "Take it or leave it. We took away what works and given you in inferior program. Tough luck." You seem to have gone the route of most of Microsoft's other programs by putting in a planned

            <p>What a load of claptrap. You are obviously toeing the company line and lying through your teeth for them. The Hotmail program had no security issues for me ever.&nbsp;My &nbsp;outlook program was attacked a few hours after I gave a scathing rebuke to a moderator on
 another thread about this and the only emails were from the Microsoft community. Miraculously it was suddenly fixed, about an hour after I posted this coincidence on the network. ( So much for outlooks supposed security. It was my antivirus that locked it
 up so tight that it took me an hour to delete the emails.) For many years there was not even an inkling of a problem with Hotmail. The outlook program has been nothing but a problem for myself and many others in the community. Nobody can convince me that the
 outlook program is not a program without a planned obsolescence&nbsp;so as to be able to upgrade all the time so as to provide the developers and &nbsp;yourself&nbsp;with a job. In your case you probably couldn't make it as a telemarketer so you took a job a few rungs down
 &nbsp;the social ladder. </p>
<p>Don';t give me that stuff about "I understand that you want...." You don't understand anything about what I want. I only want this inferior outlook program fixed or give your customers back the program that worked.</p>
<p><strong>It is not impossible to go back to the Hotmail program. When Microsoft bought them they got the rights to use the program. Microsoft is choosing not to offer the program. They don't care a fig what the customers want. The Hotmail program is, was
 and always will&nbsp;be superior to the outlook program. Microsoft did not give anyone the choice to stay with a good program, they just forced their wants on the customers. Offer the Hotmail program and let your customers choose. Let us worry about security. After
 all the vast majority of us already have highly functional security programs that also scans all emails.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will Microsoft bring out the new and improved email program soon that will bear a stunning resemblance to the Hotmail program for a fee? Guaranteed to be secure and trouble free. A nominal fee is required and a business account for only twice the
 price.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because you have chosen not to try to help anymore with my original problem that is&nbsp;referred to in&nbsp;another thread (The moderators final reply to me has had their points cut and pasted(Which I have bracketed in my previous post on this thread so as
 to make it easy even for a moderator to understand) so there is no mistake&nbsp;about what was said, and I accurately analyzed the moderators reply&nbsp;so any one can understand it and recognize the condescending manner in which it was written. Which even you, a moderator
 should be able to recognize.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Now back to the original question. All it requires is a number, not a discussion.

<p>We know that you want to know how many people would it take to reinstate Hotmail. The thing is, Microsoft has no plans in switching back to Hotmail. I don't want to be rude but&nbsp;knowing the number of people would it take to reinstate Hotmail is pointless.</p>

I've given the feed back page my opinion. Outlook is ****. Not secure despite the bull **** excuses. The feed back is as useful as the forums. They don't really want to listen to the customers so they make the customers think that they are making a difference by giving feed back that will be ignored. 


So what you are saying is that Microsoft does not want to give a good product. If a high number of customers want to go back to Hotmail they are of no concern to Microsoft. They are to accept and take what they are given (or in this case forced to take.) I guess it is pointless to expect working programs from Microsoft. I guess it is pointless to expect a choice from Microsoft. I guess it is pointless to get what we want from Microsoft. I guess we should just take what we are given and not complain when it doesn't work properly. And I guess Microsoft does not want to give the customers what they want. Microsoft does not seem intent on giving the best products to their customers (Hotmail, which i

<h2>            how to backup&#47;restore mail from Mac Outlook 2011</h2>
                    Dear all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Outlook 2003/2007 at Window platform, Mac Outlook 2011 will not store whole email box at a single .pst file. So when i want to backup email/account setting etc at Mac Outlook 2011, how can i do? Need to export the email box to .olm format everything
 and can't like Outlook 2003/2007, just copy out the .pst?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, when i want to restore backup files, import the backup-ed .olm file is the only solution?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank a lot<br />

    <title>Inconsistencies in appointments sent from hotmail to a gmail account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gape49  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inconsistencies in appointments sent from hotmail to a gmail account and viceversa</h2>
                    <p>When&nbsp;I send an appointment from the calendar in my Hotmail.com / Outlook.com&nbsp;(live.com) account to a person using Gmail, I get the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The appointment is sent correctly and the invited recieves an e-mail.</li><li>The invited responds the appointment and the reply is sent back to the Hotmail.com / Outlook.com&nbsp;account</li><li>The Hotmail.com / Outlook.com&nbsp;account receives <strong>the reply but it is not updated in the status summary of who has accepted, declined or tentative</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>The same problem appears when the appointment is sent from the gmail account to a Hotmail.com account</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no problem when the appointment is sent between Hotmail accounts or Gmail accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problema can be replicated very easily and rapidly</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody can help me with this</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you, Gina,&nbsp;for your reply</p>
<p>The problem I'm reporting does not relate to the link you sent.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sending the invite from google calendar but from my Hotmail.com / Outlook.com (live.com) account</li><li>Office 365 is not used</li><li>Ther has been no migration from or to&nbsp;any account. The google calendar and Hotmail.com calendar account are not and were not related.</li><li>The invite is being sent from my hotmail account to another person's google calendar account. The reply accepting or declining the invitation is sent from the google calendar account.</li><li>The Hotmail.com account receives the reply from the google calendar account but still shows that the person has not replied to the invitation.</li><li>I asked a friend of mine to replicate the process and got the same error.</li><li>I reversed the process sending the invite from google calendar and replying from Hotmail and google acknowledges the reply and processes it correctly.</li><li>In summary:
<ul>
<li>Invites from a Hotmail.com account to another Hotmail account work fine.</li><li>Invites from a google calendar account to another google calendar account work fine.</li><li>Invites from a google calendar account to a Hotmail account are processed correctly by google calendar but not by Hotmail.com calendar</li><li>invites from Hotmail.com calendar to a google calendar account are not processed correctly.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>My friend and I got to the conclusión that the problem is in Hotmail.com / Outlook.com calendar that does not processes correctly the .ICS file sent by google calendar.</p>
<p>Your support will be appreciated</p>

<p>Attached are six images with&nbsp;the sequence of events</p>
<p>Hope this will help to replicate the problema</p>
<p>You may want to try also sending an invitation to a yahoo,com account and the problema is the same.</p>

            <p>I followed the steps you indicated although the problem has nothing to do with the OS nor Office. I'm not using Office Calendar to send / Receive the invitations but the web based application in mail.live.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>To verify this I sent an invitation from my iPhone which is configured to use Hotmail e-mail and calendar and the result is the same. In this case there is no Windows and no office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I sent a new invitation from a Hotmail.com to a Gmail.com calendars and the result is the same: The invitation is received in the Gmail calendar, then I accept it and get the reply in my E-MAIL, but when I check the Calendar in Hotmail, it still shows
 "No response". The same as before</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I did the opposite: I sent an invitation from the Gmail.com calendar to the Hotmail calendar and accepted it. The Gmail calendar does not show as if the invitation was accepted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also sent the invitation from my iPhone which is configured to use Hotmail e-mail and calendar and the result is the same. In this case there is no Windows and no office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the same between Hotmail.com calendar and Yahoo calendar and I get the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it Works correctly is if I send invitations from Hotmail to Hotmail calendars,</p>
<p>Or from Gmail to Gmail calendars,</p>
<p>Or from Gmail to yahoo calendars,</p>
<p>Or from yahoo to Gmail calendars</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is when Hotmail is involved in sending or receiving invitations</p>

<h2>            OneDrive not syncing all files</h2>
                    
<p>I have looked at the issues discussed and none match my problems. &nbsp;I have two issues:</p>
<p><br />
1. &nbsp; I save all my files (documents, etc) to my OneDrive folder. &nbsp;These documents sync automatically ... or rather most of then do. &nbsp;There are the odd document that does not sync and I have no idea why. &nbsp;If I look at the sync problems, it tells me to try again
 later or phone the helpdesk. &nbsp;I have done the resetting of onsedrive and it did not work. &nbsp;The odd files just stay away.... I am lost...<br />
<br />
2. &nbsp; I have saved Word documents to my OneDrive folder, but when I look later in file manager, they do not appear in the folder. &nbsp;Yet when I open MS Word and look under the last used files, I find it there with the OneDrive path and can open it. &nbsp;The problem
 is that when I need to email it to someone, I cannot see it in the folder to attach it - yet MS Word tells me it is there and I can edit it any way I like. &nbsp;The crazy part is that if I sign onto Office 365 on the web, I can see the files! &nbsp;SO the files are
 just not available as an offline copy. &nbsp;This only happens to some documents, not all.</p>
<p>Running clean Window 10 installation<br />
Office 365 - including OneDrive for business<br />
<br />
Any help....</p>

<p>hi hansie,</p>
<p>to avoid confusion, let’s solve the first issue in a timely manner and then focus on the second one.</p>
<p>if the onedrive you mentioned refers to onedrive for business and you encounter the issue using the onedrive for business next generation sync client in windows 10, we would like to confirm the points below:</p>
<p>1. the screenshots of the error message.<br />
to upload screenshots, click use rich formatting in this thread and select insert/edit media.</p>
<p>2. what happens if you directly upload the files to your onedrive for business?</p>
<p>3. the version of the client.<br />

<p>i don't know if you will be able to read this.<br />
<br />
i am not sure what you mean by uploading it directly to onedrive for business?&nbsp; is that not what the onedrive folder is for?<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>where do i see that onedrive menu?&nbsp; i don't get a settings option at all if i right click on the little cloud.&nbsp; see below<br />

<p>Ok if I check the normal OneDrive, not the OneDRive for Business, that version is 2015 (Build 17.3.6302.0225), but I guess that has nothing to do with OFB. &nbsp;The normal OneDrive syncs my personal files with my home PC without any problems whatsoever.</p>

<p>Hi Hansie,</p>
<p>1. Based on the error message, here is an article for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3118724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3118724</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. To directly upload the files to your OneDrive for business, you can just drag and drop as the video shows. With the results, we can identify if the issue is related to the files.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-Upload-documents-to-OneDrive-for-Business-45114744-6d42-45cd-8975-f9617819bdeb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Video-Upload-documents-to-OneDrive-for-Business-45114744-6d42-45cd-8975-f9617819bdeb</a></p>
<p>3. From your screenshots, we understand that you are using OneDrive for Business sync client not OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client.
<br />
For the differences, please refer to the article:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba</a></p>
<p>If you currently only need to sync the OneDrive for Business library, you can try using the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client. The capability of SharePoint Document Library sync will be added in future releases.</p>
<p>Go through&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get started with the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client in

<p>hi hale</p>
<p>1. does not help me at all.&nbsp; i am no closer to a solution<br />
2. i have uploaded the files, but it was a mistake as i will not know if the syncing actually starts working.&nbsp; the manually uploaded files still show a red x so i suppose that still shows that it is not syncing automatically.</p>
<p>3. i did the download and ran the upgrade to next generation, but it was nothing like the instructions.&nbsp; i got a message that said "welcome to onedrive" which then disappeared and that was it.<br />
4. all the instruction lead to me geting to an upgrade of tghe onedrive for business service.&nbsp; i downloaded the upgrade, but get the following messag ewhen i run it
<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=aab4fe0c-c82b-4568-8656-fce5864ddb19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3daab4fe0c-c82b-4568-8656-fce5864ddb19" /></a></p>
<p>5. just as a matter of interest, the status of my onedrive for business has not changed.&nbsp; it is still looking like it is busy syncing, stating that it has 762 files remaining....have no idea where that number comes from.<br />

<p>hi hansie,</p>
<p>thanks for your information.</p>
<p>1. about "the manually uploaded files still show a red x", does it appear in your onedrive for business or the synced folder in your pc? you can send us a screenshot about it.</p>
<p>in addition, please check if the files meet the&nbsp;restrictions and limitations:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. i notice that you have the consumer onedrive client on your windows 10. given the situation, you already have the new onedrive for business sync client. please follow the steps below to see if you can start the app:<br />
<br />
1). in windows 10, select the onedrive desktop app.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b0cee044-4eac-4ba3-b4cb-1e1855e1e20e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db0cee044-4eac-4ba3-b4cb-1e1855e1e20e" /><br />
</a><br />
2). in the taskbar navigation area, right-click the white onedrive cloud icon and select settings.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=959a49ff-3db4-444f-a9e4-85ad0165d4bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d959a49ff-3db4-444f-a9e4-85ad0165d4bb" /><br />
</a><br />
3). in settings, select account, and then select add a business account.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=93f317d2-5b41-4612-8183-4fac595bdc29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d93f317d2-5b41-4612-8183-4fac595bdc29" /></a></p>

<p>hi hale</p>
<p>below the screenshot.&nbsp; you will see all the files are synced except the one (highlighted) that i manually uploaded.&nbsp; i save all my files directly to onedrive.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=76d6fc0b-64fc-4d09-9fb2-1ebf54c28b5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d76d6fc0b-64fc-4d09-9fb2-1ebf54c28b5d" /></a></p>
<p>now just to clarify..do you want me to add the business account to the normal onedrive although there is also a onedrive for business running as well - the one that installed with the 365 installation?<br />
<br />
that will then mean that i have two onedrives syncing the same folders?<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Hansie,</p>
<p>We would like to explain that the latest release of the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client is faster and more reliable syncing of your OneDrive for Business files. So we suggest you use that version.</p>
<p>To avoid syncing the same OneDrive for Business with the two different clients,&nbsp;please stop syncing your OneDrive for Business with the old OneDrive for Business sync client and use the latest one.<br />
<br />
