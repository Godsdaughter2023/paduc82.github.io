            thanks for your reply.i was hoping that would not be the answer<em>. since i have paid good money for these windows products i dont fell like spending my money again to buy
</em>these products again when microsoft could help me out if they really wanted to.(and should put warnings on the label of the xp and windodws 7 discs that the licence key is on the packaging and is needed to install.as i have never installed a windows operating
 system i was not to know i need a lic key that is on the packaging. putting key on the disc itself then it cant be lost.(i guess at microsoft the all mighty dollar and profit comes before customer service) since i wrote my question i have been looking what
 else is available out there and there are a few alternatives to microsoft.so i will use linux puppy or linux mint operating system in the future.i will not forget microsoft customer service (or lack off) not wanting to help.and this is the first time i have
 asked for help from them and have spent a lot of money buying different products from them over the years eg office programs and windows tablets.my only regret is i wish i had known alot earlier what the customer service is like.eg just buy it again.well i
 learnt from my mistake but i'll make sure in the future that microsoft does not get one more cent of my money ever again and give my money to companies with better customer service.sid<br />

            <p>No one here works for Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand you paid money for it, but you put it in the rubbish.&nbsp; The key is what you pay for.&nbsp; If you toss it out, then you'll have to get a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have your credit card or store receipt from where you bought it, you might be able to go back to that store.&nbsp; But since they don't know if the key was used or not, they are unlikely to replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never heard of a company giving out free replacements when you throw the product in the trash.

            <p>My experience with trying to get technical support out of human beings at Microsoft is that I rarely get a resolution to my issue or anything close to a useful answer in just one call.&nbsp; I have to make multiple calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chances of you talking to the same person on subsequent calls is probably pretty slim and if you are persistent and can find the right person in the right mood with a helpful disposition, you can usually get what you want - even genuine bootable XP installation
 CDs and product ID for free:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/721912f1-9590-4ff8-9116-6a736b4c6d6f" height="245" width="327" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I called and pretended I didn't have an installation CD, lost it, scratched or whatever (and that I needed one for a reinstall)&nbsp; just to see what they would do since so many "experts" around here say that you can't get one - even from Microsoft.&nbsp;
 I have never believed that to be the case so tried it for myself to find out for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You just have to talk to the right person and they nearly insisted that they are going to send me one anyway whether I needed it or not.&nbsp; I did get turned down a few times, put on hold, transferred around, but eventually got to the right guy who could understand
 and speak English.&nbsp;&nbsp; They even called me back a couple times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not give up on getting a license key.&nbsp; I would call back again and again and plead your case as pathetically as possible, tell them what happened and you might end up finding the conscientious person that will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine that is is not a very big deal for them to generate a new XP license key for your installation... if you can get the right person on the other end (or maybe somebody that doesn't care about making a few clicks to generate a key for you).</p>

    <title>Xbox one performance decreasing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liam orr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one performance decreasing</h2>
                    <p>Lately my Xbox One's performance has been decreasing. This is the third one I've had and I've had it for a year. Games either constantly freeze or don't start. The home freezes sometimes. One time I got an error message saying the home couldn't load. How is that possible?? Games I used to play everyday now freeze up. The overall performance of my Xbox has gone down the drain. Is there anything I can do to remedy this or do I have to get another Xbox?</p>

<p>Dear Danida,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I want to make a sound test, I click on "Make a free test call" and then you should hear a message "if you can hear a message saying if you hear your message everything is ok otherwise you have
 to check your connections".</span></p>
<p><span>After clicking on the link "Make a free test call" there is no message. After 34", the test is closed. I can't record a message.</span></p>
<p><span>If, during the 34", I click on "call quality guide", it's mentioned "your microphone seems to be working fine", "your speakers seem to be working fine", "your computer speed is fast", "the connection
 speed between you is unknown".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your help.</span></p>

<p>I had this exact problem (latest Skype 8 and Win 10) and solved it&nbsp;<span>by experimenting with the audio settings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of audio sources: "default, speakers, video recording, realtek audio"--something like that. At first it was set to something that was not working. I had it changed to 'default'. The audio test was working
 but not the test call. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was to change it to 'speakers' (although I have a headset, not speakers, but we can't expect the PC/Windows to be that user-friendly, can we). The calls started working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think whatever logic tries to pick the sound device by default fails, and even when I set it to 'default' in audio settings, where it works, it still fails during calls. So, set it explicitly.</p>

            <p>Hi Cheryle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can imagine that this would have been frustrating. Let's investigate this for you. Help us verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you signed in as administrator of the device?</li><li>Does it happen to all programs? If not, what program are you trying to uninstall?</li><li>What changes were recently made to your system?</li><li>Have you tried running a full scan using Windows Defender or your antivirus software? This tell us if a malware is keeping you from removing the program.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, let's see if you get the same behavior in clean boot environment. This is to eliminate any software conflicts that might have caused the issue. F<span><span>ollow
 the steps in this<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>article</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span><span>: After troubleshooting, make sure to start your computer
 normally by referring to<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>section

<p>Hi troNima,</p>
<p>Did you start a new game and save after this happened? I would suggest deleting your local saves, and trying to restore your game from the cloud. If you did a sync with no game data, then it may be gone.</p>
<p>To delete your local save:</p>
<ol>
<li>On&nbsp;<b>Home</b>, pull the right trigger&nbsp;, and then press&nbsp;<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;to open&nbsp;<b>My games and apps</b>.
</li><li>Highlight the game, press the&nbsp;<b>Menu button</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;on your controller, and then select&nbsp;<b>Manage game</b>.
</li><li>Scroll to the right, highlight the saved data for your gamertag under&nbsp;<b>Saved Data</b>, and then press&nbsp;<b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;on your controller.
</li><li>You'll be prompted to confirm deletion of this game save data:
<ul>
<li><b>Delete from console</b>&nbsp; </li></ul>
</li></ol>

    <title>How do I reinstall Windows 8 Pro&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rocket_pc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I reinstall Windows 8 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; I had Windows XP on my computer and recently upgraded to Windows 8 Pro, by purchasing and downloading from the Microsoft website.&nbsp; I didn't know that Windows 8 Pro had its own antivirus and installed McAfee.&nbsp; Instead of trying to figure out how to uninstall
 McAfee, I would like to simply reinstall Windows 8 Pro.&nbsp; This seems to be the best choice to me since I haven't installed any programs or files on the MS 8 Pro that would need backup.&nbsp; Can somebody tell me how to uninstall and reinstall Windows 8 Pro on&nbsp;my
 computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> terryfabbri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my PC auto-installing 2nd Mouse Driver - makes my mouse crazy &#33;</h2>
                    <p>After this most recent Win 10 Update - my USB mouse started going Crazzy - roaming/jumping around - opening apps on it's own - all sort of weird stuff !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tracked it down to three Mouse Drivers in Device Manager - deleted all three - rebooted and auto installed fresh/one Mouse Driver - one driver all AOK - so it's all good right ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well - now once or twice a day my Mouse goes Crazzy again - I check back in Device Manager - and somehow a 2nd mouse driver gets installed - causing new conflict - have to go back and delete that new/added driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Updates are set correctly - and "should not" be auto downloading/installing anything in my mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to overcome this problem ? The mouse gets so crazzed makes it a chore to get back in and delete this added driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Muich appreciated !</p>

<div>Hi niveshandnisheeth,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You try the following steps and check if that helps</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Adding and Connecting a Bluetooth Device</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Open your Windows Control Panel. and select the Hardware and Sound link. Choose the Bluetooth Devices link in the Hardware and Sound window. The page that opens should be blank without any devices added.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
Configure your computer for adding a new device or creating a network. Click the Options tab in the Bluetooth Devices box and go to the Options page in the Discovery group box. Check the box labeled "Allow Bluetooth Devices to Find This Computer."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to the Connections group box and check the boxes labeled "Allow Bluetooth Devices to Connect to This Computer" and "Alert Me When a New Bluetooth Device Wants to Connect." Check the "Show the Bluetooth Icon in the Notification Area" box to help you
 find the most useful commands.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Access the Add Bluetooth Device Wizard by clicking the Add button on the devices page of the dialog box. Check the "My Device Is Set Up and Ready to Be Found" box and click Next. Select the device you want to add from the list that appears and click Next.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choose a passkey for the device as the wizard suggests. Select "Use the Passkey Found in the Documentation if your device has a preset passkey. Otherwise, have Windows create a passkey with "Choose a Passkey for Me" or create your own with "Let Me Choose
 My Own Passkey."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow any more instructions the wizard gives you related to the passkey. Click "Finish" when the "Completing the Add Bluetooth Device" screen appears to complete the connection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Repeat all the above steps for a second computer to make it a bluetooth device also. This will be the home computer, which you will send the signal from. The previous device is the target computer, which will receive the signal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Establishing a Bluetooth Network</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to the home computer and click the Bluetooth Devices icon in your notification area. Select "Join a Personal Area Network" from the menu to bring up the Personal Area Network Devices dialog box. Select your target computer from the Devices list box
 and click the Connect button.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choose the Start Network option to open a Network window. You should get an Information Bar saying "Network discovery and file sharing are turned off. Click to change." Click on this bar and select "Turn On Network Discovery and File Sharing." After authenticating
 yourself to User Account Control, click the button in the next box that makes your network a private one.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Click on the icon for the target computer that should now appear, meaning the computer is connected to the network.</div>

<h2>            decrease touchpad sensitivity nextbook 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please tell me how to decrease the touchpad's sensitivity on my nextbook?&nbsp; I have no idea how I manage to go from one screen to another while just typing....&nbsp; I am somehow touching the mouse pad 'telling it to do a function' without me realizing
 it....and when I try to repeat the issue so that I know what NOT to do while typing, I cant figure out how I keep doing it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>all tips appreciated,</p>

            <p>Thanks for getting back to me people. &nbsp;I would have to message the same problem to nextbook, as they don't have any information on their website regarding this at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have discovered one thing on my own though - Fn + F9 turns the touch pad on and off. &nbsp;There is a little symbol on the F9 button coloured in blue, which resembles the touchpad. &nbsp;It is so minute that I near needed a magnifying glass out to see it. &nbsp;But I
 tryed it, and it does turn it on and off. &nbsp;However, this does not resolve the sensitivity issue. &nbsp;Perhaps, my own suggestion here, is to purchase/use a wireless mouse(or carry a usb mouse), turn the touch pad off, and use that instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>Original title: Windows 10 Lockscreen :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Windows 10 this summer and I'm really enjoying using it, however I have a few issues with my lockscreen. I have changed my lockscreen once before and have no problems at all, but when I tried to change it a few days ago it came up with the message
 'Try a different photo. We can't use this one as the lockscreen'. At first I thought it was to do with the picture size, but I tried setting the lockscreen as a picture I have used before (so I know it works) and even that one came up with the same message.
 It does this with any picture I try to set as the lock screen now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Thanks!!</p>

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC recently started crashing. First I didn't think much of it because it happened maybe 2-3 times the week it started. The screen and everything else that was running just stopped and I had to restart. Everything was fine afterwards. However, yesterday
 my PC bluescreened and said "WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR". I looked it up and saw that it could either be hardware problems or windows problems, so I scanned my windows and it told me that my windows had corrupted files in it. I tried using&nbsp;<strong>Dism /Online
 /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong> and tried the sfc scan again but nothing changed. What do I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: The bluescreen itself only happened when I started the game CS:GO. The other times my pc just completely froze. I do think these two types of &nbsp;crashes are related, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PSS: My pc is only 7-8 months old now.</p>

<p>You may not have the correct permissions or ownership of the media onto which you're trying to do the backup.&nbsp; Here are some instructions on how to give yourself Full Rights permissions and also Take Ownership (if necessary).</p>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file/drive, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what
 permissions you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></a>.
 In this csse be sure to grant yourself Full Rights permissions and also check Advanced for Special permissions (including inherited permissions)&nbsp;that may override that entry to limit your rights and fix them as well.</span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders or drive, take
 Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for
 replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; You can now change them from read-only (even if the main folder says they still are read
 only - you can have access yourself as the owner).&nbsp; You can keep them as read-only for other users and guests and even administrators (though they can take ownership themselves and gain access if they so desire and there really isn't much you can do to stop
 this except protect the folder with a password using a 3rd party product.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/</span></a><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.</span></span></span><span><br />

Good luck and I hope this helps!</span></span></p>

<p>Yeah, this was pretty tricky for me, too. It is just A and LT trigger, but it seems to work better if I ran, then really quickly tap A, followed by the trigger. Might just take some practice, but it does work!</p>

<p>I have had a lot of problems with this as well. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it seems that the challenge is glitched. &nbsp;I was able to get Lara to swan dive off the first platform into the lower waterfall ok. &nbsp;After a few tries, I even got her to do the swan dive i to
 the well for the achievement. &nbsp;I got her to do a number of swan dives off various ledges etc. in various caves and tombs and such when it was not necessary.</p>
<p>Then I went back to finish the challenge and she will not swan dive from any of the other challenge points, no way, no how. &nbsp;I have tried everything. Some people have had success if they jumped just to the side of the red diving platform, as if the platform
 is the glitch, but for me this did not work either. &nbsp;When I hit A + LT, she just crosses her arms across her chest and crosses her legs and goes straight in feet first. &nbsp;Aaaarrghh.</p>
<p>I really wanted to 100% this game, but I have run into a few things like this and I'm wondering if it is possible right now. &nbsp;I really, really hope they fix this stuff. &nbsp;I suggest everybody go to the Square Enix Tech Support forums for Rise of the Tomb Raider
 and make your voices heard. &nbsp;They ARE listening- they just fixed an issue I posted about the other day. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi William</p>
<p>I got a little tip that helped on the 360 version, and I've used it on the Xbox One version whenever she wouldn't do the dive properly.</p>
<p>Go to just left of the red platform. &nbsp;A running start helps, then press A + LT. &nbsp;There is a definite bug in the 360 version which seems to be solved by this, and it may also help on the One version.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>I managed to get the glitched dive on the Xbox One by pressing jump (A) and then B button, instead of the Left Trigger. &nbsp;It DOES also work better if you dive off the left side of the platform. &nbsp;I'm talking about the platform at the very top of that village
 that is very hard to get to. &nbsp;The Left trigger dives worked on the other platforms, but on this one, the B button did the trick.</p>

<h2>            Internal error 2738 when uninstalling Biztalk 2006 on Win 7</h2>
                    I have a win 7 32 bit laptop which has Biz Talk 2006 R2 installed. When trying to uninstall the Biz Talk 2006 R2, I am getting an error "Internal Error 2738". I have tried registering the vbscript dll using&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(204, 0, 0, 1)">regsvr32
 vbscript.dll</span>&nbsp;but that also has not resolved the problem. I tried looking up various blogs but I am not able to find a solution for this problem.

I was able to resolve the problem. Apparently, the problem was not with the vbscript.dll not registered. The issue was with the vbscript dll being registered as a User instead of the machine. When the dll is registered as a normal user, it is registered under
 the USER in the registry settings. Removing the registration using the following command resolved the problem and I was able to uninstall Biz Talk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Command: "reg delete "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{B54F3741-5B07-11CF-A4B0-00AA004A55E8}" /f"</p>

<h2>            X360&#58; Impossibile avviare gioco&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Salve. Io e mio fratello giochiamo sulla stessa xbox. Lui ha il gold con il suo account, io no. Fino ad ora, tutti i giochi da lui scaricati con il Games with gold funzionavano anche sul mio profilo. Quando ha provato a scaricare crysis 3, con il suo profilo
 il gioco si avvia, mentre col mio mi da un errore, "impossibile avviare il gioco". Le licenze sono impostate sulla console, non ho mai avuto problemi di questo tipo. Come posso risolvere?</p>

<p>Forse Crysis richiede un abbonamento Gold attivo anche per la modalità campagna (se ce l'ha, io l'ho scaricato ma ancora devo provarlo)</p>

<p>Potrebbe darsi che alcuni contenuti non sono legati alle licenze? Alcuni dlc (skyrim, dark souls 2) non mi andavano, altri si.</p>

<p>A questo punto sì, penso che sia la cosa più logica, ovvero che alcuni contenuti siano strettamente legati all'utenza dalla quele sono stati scaricati, mentre altri no.</p>

    <title>Cannot play MW2 on my Xbox One S - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ftr cervy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot play MW2 on my Xbox One S</h2>
                    <p>I was playing MW2 yesterday with no issues, now today I can't get online to my 360 profile. I go to multiplayer and it says "You need to be connected to Xbox Live to play online" so I try to connect and it then says "Your connection to Xbox Live has been
 lost. Please sign in again." and it does that over and over. Hard reset did not fix it, and I'm connected to my Xbox One profile just fine it just has problems signing in to my 360 account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also worth noting that it's not doing this for Halo Reach. I can get on multiplayer on that game no problem it's just doing this for MW2. After doing some searching I found a couple other people having the same issue. Any ideas how to fix?</p>
