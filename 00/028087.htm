<h2>            I get this error message&#58; There is a problem signing in, when I sign into my account.</h2>
                    When I log into my account it's telling me there is a problem signing in, I've also been booted out of my mobile e-mail which now says account sign-in failed without me having changed my password or anything else. Has this ever happened to anyone else????
 I need help/suggestions on getting back in I need it for work. Thanks

    <title>MS Project Custom Field Formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philcuddy  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project Custom Field Formula</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i am trying to get to grips with custom fields in MS Project. I am a long time excel user, so am familiar with excel nested if formulas, but the following has me stumped:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switch([Summary],"",([% Complete]=0) And ([Scheduled Start]&lt;Date()),"Overdue",([% Complete]&lt;100) And ([Scheduled Finish]&lt;Date()),"Overdue",([% Complete]&lt;100) And ([Scheduled Start]&lt;Date()),"In Progress",([% Complete]=0) And [Scheduled Start]&lt;Date()+7,"Due
 soon",True,"")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to show the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>0% complete and scheduled start is before today, return text "overdue"</li><li>&lt;100% complete and scheduled finish is before today, return text "overdue"</li><li>&lt;100% complete and scheduled&nbsp;start is before today, return text "in progress"</li><li>0% complete and scheduled start is in next 7 days, return text "overdue"</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I only want to show the text for tasks, not summary bars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above formula is not working, it is showing text on summary bars, and also showing overdue for summary bars in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to how to fix the formula above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS is there a site with plenty of explained examples of MS Project formulae?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
                </div>

            <p>philcuddy,</p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of the Switch statement, nor am I a fan of complex formulas but I think the following formula will do what you want:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IIf([% Complete]=0 And [Scheduled Start]&lt;[Current Date] Or [% Complete]&lt;100 And [Scheduled Finish]&lt;[Current Date],"overdue",IIf([% Complete]&lt;100 And [Scheduled Start]&lt;[Current Date],"in progress",IIf([% Complete]=0 And ([Scheduled Start]&gt;=[Current Date]
 And [Scheduled Start]&lt;=[Current Date]+7),"due soon","")))</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I question your logic. First, just because a task hasn't started and it was scheduled to start before the current date, I wouldn't necessarily consider that task as overdue. It could be a fixed duration task wherein the resource won't actually start
 on it until a couple of days in. Second, in Project, formulas only apply to the current task line. Unless you specifically select to use formulas for &nbsp;calculation of task and group summary rows (this is an option on the Custom Fields window), nothing will
 be show for summary lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for reference, have you looked at the Status field? It already does what you want although the criteria is slightly different.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi John, many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears there is a bug in my mpp file / ms project. I used your formula and it caused the same error as mine (showing overdue for future summary rows). On the custom fields screen i then selected 'formula' for 'calculation for tasks and group summary
 rows' and the formula worked as expected. I then undid this option and things continued working correctly. Strange behaviour...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the use of the switch statement, what alternative would you suggest. I am very much a beginner in ms project formulae and am very interested in learning best practice, but find very little information online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding logic, i see what you mean, but i would like to highlight tasks that should have started or finished, there may well be a good reason, but i still think highlighting tasks that i would consider overdue as being a function of my role as a planner
 working alongside the PM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>philcuddy,</p>
<p>I can't explain why you had to set and unset the formula option for summary rows. It's possible your file has some corruption. You could try saving the file as XML and then re-opening in Project. That normally clears corruption but you will lose any custom
 formatting, so I'd only do it if you don't have custom formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a fan of the Switch statement simply because I never use it. I find the "If" construct to be more useful but it's strictly a matter of preference. I also mentioned that I'm not a fan of complex formulas. They are difficult to enter correctly, difficult
 to troubleshoot when they don't work, and can be easily lost (i.e. not saved in the Project Global like a VBA module). Also, be advised that in Project nesting of "If" statements is limited to 15. I don't know if that also applies to the Switch statement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might not have made it clear that formulas in Project are much more limited than in Excel. As I said previously, a formula can only operate on data on the current task line. For example, you cannot take the Start date of task ID 3 and use it in a formula
 for Task ID 4. Some Project level data is available (e.g. Status Date, Project Start), but that's limited. That's why I use VBA much more than formulas in custom fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you take a look at the built-in Status field? It takes a little learning to understand exactly what it uses for criteria, but it does essentially provide the information you are attempting to get with your formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this answered your question, please mark it as answered.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was just wondering how I can give members in my Microsoft family some of the money on my microsoft account.</p>
<p>I can see the user that I want the funds to go to, I click add money and the default method is Paypal. I click other options and my microsoft account is there, but grayed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;How can I give these funds using my Microsoft balance and NOT pay through my paypal?</p>

    <title>Help with syncing to a new PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help with syncing to a new PC</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My PC crashed and burned about 2 weeks ago, and I just got my new Dell in the mail yesterday.&nbsp; I installed Activesync on the new PC, but when I connect my smartphone to it and perform a sync operation, none of the data from the phone shows up on the computer
 - basically nothing syncs.&nbsp; I checked the sync center and mobile device centers, and it appears as though the problem is my phone thinks I can still sync to my old computer and for some reason will not let me change any of my sync settings to the new computer.&nbsp;
 When I try, the button to let me select the new computer is greyed out and I can't do anything with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked all over both the smartphone and the mobile device center on my PC, but can't find any way to either delete my old PC, or at least make the new PC primary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My old PC was on Windows XP, and the new one is the lovely Vista, so I don't know if there's a problem there or not.&nbsp; I desperately want to get all of my contacts/notes/etc. from my phone to my new PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Ahhh .... I see what is happening.&nbsp; I was under the impression you were running Outlook.&nbsp; Outlook mobile ONLY works with Outlook for your PC..&nbsp; Years ago, device vendors would ALWAYS supply a copy of Outlook on a CD with devices but they no longer do that
 ... cost cutting measures I guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to purchase Outlook to sync with your device.</p>

    <title>Is 3110 Classic is compatible with 3G network technology &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> basab111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is 3110 Classic is compatible with 3G network technology &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Three days back I have migrated from 2G to 3G network of BSNL (Bharat Sancher Nogam Limited), the 2G &amp; 3G Operator. Before applying for migration to 3G, I sought advices &nbsp;from the Officer-on-Desk, BSNL. He querried that&nbsp; my 3110 classic handset, can I surf
 internet ! On my affirmative response,&nbsp;he suggested me for migration to 3G. I have done and now am &nbsp;a participant in 3G network of BSNL. My question is - (i) is 3110 classic&nbsp; handset is compatible to 3G network technology ? (ii) So far media is drum-beating
 about efficient and speed available in 3G compared to 2G networ,&nbsp;I do not find,&nbsp;after migration to 3G network&nbsp; &nbsp;any signicant magic in performance in internet surfing. Hence I am in doubt that&nbsp;I&nbsp; may be paying higher tariff in 3G compared to 2G when 3110 Classic
 is not compatible model ? If the model is not compatible to 3G network, I would revert back to 2G network as before.</p>

            its better not to migrate to 3g cos' its more expensive. As of now you have chance to access 3g network even if you are in 2g if your handset support 3g

    <title>WMDC crashes after I plug in Blackjack II. and it won&#39;t open if - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gloves off  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMDC crashes after I plug in Blackjack II. and it won&#39;t open if the phone is plugged in. ahhh&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I've been having nightmares with this program! I've searched online all over for solutions but to no avail. Let me describe my problems.<br />
<br />
I bought my Blackjack II on Friday. I had all of my contacts in Outlook, so I was ready to sync it up. So I downloaded the latest version of WMDC from microsoft.com. English, 32-bit. We're gettin' there.<br />
<br />
I plugged in my device. I plugged it in, and Windows did the usual "installing your device" thing. Then it said "your device is ready to use." great!<br />
<br />
Next, I went to install WMDC. Double click. It opens. At this point it says "Please wait while Windows configures WMDC Update. Time Remaining: 0 Seconds" for about 2 minutes. Odd. But okay.<br />
<br />
Then that goes away and something pops up in the bottom corner, "installing device drivers". Okay.<br />
<br />
Then it goes back to "Please wait while Windows configures WMDC driver. Time Remaining: 0 Seconds" for about a minute.<br />
<br />
Then nothing for about a minute after that window goes away. It didn't say it was complete, but it looks like it... I guess?<br />
<br />
So now it's apparently installed, and I go to open the program. I get the Licensing Agreement window. I agree and click Yes. Next screen.<br />
<br />
A green box pops up like it's about to open, and then boom, I get "WMDC has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available." I have the option to Debug or Close
 program. <br />
<br />
But! <br />
<br />
If I don't click anything, the program continues to open like normal! So I just move that box to the side and continue to set up and sync my stuff. After I finished syncing for the first time, I just pretend like the problem didn't happen. I go ahead and click
 Close program and forget about it.<br />
<br />
Now, the next time I go to sync up after I've updated my Calendar in Outlook 2007,&nbsp; I plug my phone in, and go to open up WMDC. A green box pops up like it's about to open, and then boom, I get "WMDC has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop
 working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available." I have the option to Debug or Close program.<br />
<br />
But this time!<br />
<br />
I doesn't continue to open. Nothing else happens. I'm stuck. I close it. <br />
<br />
Out of curiousity, I unplug my Blackjack II. <br />
<br />
Now I try to open WMDC again. It opens! I think "sweet!" But as soon as I plug in my phone, it crashes again! Same message. It won't let me do anything. It just crashes again.
<br />
<br />
When I click Debug, it pops up the same "WDMC has stopped working" window again, except without the option to debug again.
<br />
<br />
According to the instructions on http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/wmdc/debug/index.htm , I have a couple of debug logs to share.
<br />
<br />
Can anyone look at these at help me out at all? I went ahead and put them on my server so the logs don't take up 20 feet of your screen.<br />
<br />
First one, wmdc.log: <br />
http://matthewnelson.net/temp/wmdc.txt<br />
<br />
Second one, wmdhost.log:<br />
http://matthewnelson.net/temp/WmdHost.txt<br />
<br />
Also, I've uninstalled and reinstalled everything probably a dozen times. I've removed my device from Device Manager and let it reinstall a dozen times, too. I ran CCleaner and Abexo Registry Cleaner to delete anything left by previous installs. I've shut down
 all firewalls and security programs. <br />
<br />
Sorry if this is long-winded, I just wanted to provide as much as I could about it all. Thanks for any and all help!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above might be the cause of your problem. You connected the device before installing WMDC. Always install the software first, then connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Uninstall your device in Device Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Open Activesync on your Smartphone and Delete the partnership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Reboot&nbsp;the Blackjack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Use Control Panel on your PC to uninstall WMDC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Reboot the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Reinstall WMDC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Connect your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps.</p>

            okay. I plugged my device in, and waited for WDMC to crash. It did. So then I went into Device Manager and deleted it, and unplugged the USB cable before the device could reload into Device Manager.<br />
<br />
I went in and deleted the partnership on my phone, and rebooted it.<br />
<br />
Uninstalled WDMC and rebooted. <br />
<br />
Installed WDMC. It still hung up at 0 seconds, for about 3 minutes or so. <br />
<br />
The program booted. As soon I plugged in my phone and Windows started installing the drivers for it, WDMC crashed, saying the same errors as before, and it said "WDMC is now being restarted" like before, and I was able to sync up again like before as long as
 I didn't acknowledge the pop up saying that WDMC has stopped working. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I wouldn't mind having to just ignore the error pop up every time, but in order to still be able to sync, I have re-install WMDC every time. Otherwise WMDC won't even open beyond a green screen, and then it'll tell me WDMC has stopped working, and
 I'm stuck. At least I can sync up sometimes, but it's such a pain to do the whole process in your post every time I need to sync, which is a daily occurance.<br />
<br />
So now, any suggestions?<br />

<p>Thank you @Abi99.<br />
My problem is not solved,none of the tips from the other topic helped. The streaming in 2G network(Vodafone) is working fine but with poor quality, only in wifi network is not working. I guess is something about streaming settings on wifi, but i don't know
 what setting should i make. I can only download videos from youtube,but with very low quality. My nokia is on firmware v06.09 and nokia xpress browser is v5.0.5, my phone does not have an youtube icon on his menu.<br />
<br />
By the way, i live in Romania and i use Vodafone and Orange as cell network.</p>

            Yes on first question.<br />
Settings in Nokia ¬ª Menu ¬ª Settings ¬ª Configuration ¬ª Personal- is empty. I can only activate configuration on SIM1 or SIM2,these configurations is from network operators i guess.

<h2>            Embedded object disappears</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating a newsletter to be sent by email as the main body part (not pdf attachment) and I need to insert several objects such as word files, ppts, pdf, in it to be displayed as icons.
</p>
<p>My problem is that although when working in publisher, everything seems to be fine, when sending the email (or previewing), the only things left are the icons as pictures and there is no object linked any more.</p>
<p>The procedure I follow is:</p>
<p>Insert-&gt;Object-&gt;Create from file and I browse the file I want, ticking the box to be displayed as icon.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong or is this some kind of bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Of course I do have Word, Acrobat Reader, and PowerPoint installed in my PC so all these files can normally be opened.</p>
<p>Only, in my newsletter email, they are not objects any more but merely icons.</p>

</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows Symbol and type any of the missing apps name Ex: Video.</li><li>You might be seeing Video app in the top left corner, right click on it and click Pin to start from the bottom taskbar.</li><li>Now check the missing apps in the Start screen to see the video app. In the same way get all the missing apps.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Perform System File Check to fix corrupted System files.
</p>
<p>Follow the steps: </p>

            <p>Hi Annu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, I did not uninstall anything myself - I have been running Windows 10 since January :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realised that in one of the recent builds Microsoft has merged Music (Preview) with Music, which explains why Music Preview is no longer there (but the tile was still there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Store (Beta) is still not working after your suggestions - and the old Windows Store is not allowing me to download any apps.</p>

            The way I 'fixed' this in the end was to add another account to windows, delete the account that was having problems, then re-add that account. I had to reinstall a few things after for that account but otherwise now seems to be fine.

    <title>E90 Browser Hangs Up&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mobilover  say:</h3>
<h2>            E90 Browser Hangs Up&#63;</h2>
                    I got my E90 a couple of weeks ago and updated the os right away to V07.24.0.3. The browser has been a bit slow from the beginning but now when I starts browsing as soon as it downloads something like 100kt it hangs up and dies every time.<br />
<br />
I've already tried: rebooting few times, removing battery, gprs and wlan, removing all private information like temp files, only text -mode, disable site preview and previous page, empting cache folder.<br />
<br />
I don't want to reset the device because backing up my files to computer or microsd isn't working properly. Is there anything else I could try?

            Yes I seem to have this problem as well. Browser now does not respond at all and it just shows 0%. I need to close the page and re-open then everything went back to normal. If I exit and re-open browser, same problem happens.<br />
<br />
Because of this issue, my search program --&gt; browse feature does not work anymore.<br />
<br />
What a shame...

            Hy,<br />
<br />
I have experienced the same with my E90, and after a hard reset(*#7370#) and memory restore was everuthing perfect.<br />
Plus I've got around 100 MB extra internal memory after this procedure.<br />
<br />
I think thisi s the obly way to solve this problem.<br />

    <title>Outlook 2010 Junk Email not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don ritter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Junk Email not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Outlook 2010 on my Windows 8.1 laptop (both 64-bit versions). I have one POP, two IMAP and one Windows Live accounts set up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The POP, Windows Live and one of the IMAP accounts have working Junk, Send, and Trash folders. However, the one IMAP does not have a Junk folder, just the Sent and Trash (they both work).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried the "Outlook/ResetFolders" option, but still no Junk folder. Have also tried setting the Root Folder Path to "Inbox" in the account's Internet Email Settings. This creates a subset of folders under Inbox with Junk, Sent and Trash folders, disabling
 the per-existing Sent and Trash folders. However, selecting an email and trying to make it junk or trying to delete has no effect. Sent emails do not go the the new Sent folder either. Essentially none of them work with the Root Folder set to "Inbox".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've enclosed images of the two scenarios. Thanks for any suggestions.</p>
<p>Don</p>

            <p>As a follow-up to my first email, I've noticed that emails I've marked as "junk" are being copied to my Windows Live Junk email folder (see image below). However, the emails are not moved from their location in the particular IMAP folder, nor are future
 junk emails from the same sender being blocked.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion TeK. I setup a new account profile and created the specific IMAP account. Upon loading, it shows the same configuration; that is, working Sent and Trash folders, but no Junk folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BYW, the new account profile was a local account (for my laptop only), rather than a Windows account, which would have synced with my desktop, tablet and phone. Don't know if this is relevant, but wanted to share it.</p>

<h2>            Moving or copying sheet</h2>
                    <div>
<p><span>When I‚Äôm copying or moving a sheet I get a message as follow:<br />
"A formula or sheet you want to move or copy contains the name ‚Äúbutton-Area_1‚Äù which already exists on the destination worksheet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Do you want to use this version of the name?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To use the name as defined in the destination sheet, click Yes.<br />
To rename the range referred to in the formula or worksheet, click NO, and enter a new name in the Name Conflict dialog box.
<br />
[YES] [NO]" so when I select yes nothing happen but when I select no other windows open saying "named conflict dialog".
</span></p>
<p><span>Could you help me with this issue because I cannot make copy of&nbsp; my previous version in this office.</span></p>

            <p>The dialog means you are trying to copy a button onto a sheet that already has a button with the exact same name as the button you are trying to paste.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Renaming the button before you copy it would solve the problem if you are not able to resolve it using the conflict resolution dialog. Or, you might rename "Button-Area_1" on the destination workbook. As long as the names aren't the same you won't get the
 conflict message.</p>

    <title>Microsoft office 2016 compatibility with 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft office 2016 compatibility with 2011</h2>
                    <p>A couple of days ago I installed Office 2016 on my mac running Sierra. Previously I have been using 2011. This problem affects at least word and powerpoint, but not excel, at least not in the same way. When I edit a word file created from 2011, it initially
 comes up in compatibility mode and says it is readonly. If I click on 'Duplicate' it tries to write a new file but then says it is read only again- I get stuck in a loop. It has in fact created a file with zero bytes which is perfectly writable. This means
 I can't use Office 2016 on any old files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I open an old document&nbsp; (so I am in compatibility mode) and then I click on file/properties the program crashes! This applies to word and ppt but not excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both the new file and the old file have acquired the extended attribute com.apple.quarantine - However I am not sure if this is significant because</p>
<p>(1) editing old Excel files also sets this attribute but it still works OK afterwards - I can edit and can save changes.</p>
<p>(2) I can still edit the old files with Word 2011 that have acquired the attribute.</p>
<p>(3) If I create a new word file&nbsp; and type some text then save, it also acquires the com.apple.quarantine attribute but I can still reopen, make changes and save again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see com.apple.quarantine either on the directory with the new file or anywhere&nbsp; in the Microsoft Word app directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, I tried to contact Microsoft support but I can't get to either live chat or phone. It just loops and says there were too many authorisation attempts. I can't see what that problem is either as I am already signed in with my microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help anyone can give me, either with the Office 2016 problem or with access to microsoft support.</p>
<p>

<h2>            I want to infect my PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to test a vmWare environment an antivirus consultant set up for me with their latest AV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**** are turning out to be much more secure than people would leade us to believe - no viruses to be found</p>
<p>Downloading everything I can find from random 'free program' websites is simply filling my downloads folder with crap software - no viruses</p>
<p>I can't go to torrent sites as they're blocked by the consultant - no go</p>
<p>Test viruses already have their signatures recorded and running them is too easy for the program to pickup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I might be able to infect my pc with a live virus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT - '****' was a common word used to describe an adult video website (fyi)</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT - I feel foolish now, but I should have stated more clearly that I'm after a zero-day infection. Live virus in retrospect could mean anything, but I wanted to be pointed to maybe a site that saves infectious viruses for lab environments or if someone
 knew how to get passed the search providers and access sites that have been blocked due to it having a known infectious code.</p>

 to remove them.</p>

</em>That's what security specialists/analysts do. We don't need to know that in order to know how to remove them. Additionally, there are malware specialists who are&nbsp;</span>specially-trained to do extensive malware removal. They didn't need to obtain and study
 them, in order clean the infections.</p>

</p><p>True, and I didn't expect you or anyone to be a specialist/analyst here, and yes, there are specialists who do this sort of thing, but it's not uncommon to find those individuals surfing these forums during their leisure. In the very least, it's worth the

If your intention is to infect a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>not all malware will work</strong> in that environment by intention. Malware writers have been able to create malicious files which can detect if it is running in a VM. When detected as such, the malware is able to change its behavior by not running
 any malicious code which can infect the operating system. This is a deliberate technique to make analysis/detection more difficult for security researchers who use VMs to study infections in order to understand the attack methodology used and develop disinfection
 solutions. So just because you test a program in a VM and it does not behave maliciously...that does not necessarily mean it is not malicious.

</p><p>The first thing needed is to fully understand the testing scenario, since even the few major AV testing groups have significant difficulty finding malware that bypasses the Windows 10 built-in protections, exactly as you've discovered.&nbsp; From your descriptions
 so far, I'm assuming you have created a Windows 10 virtual machine with at least the Creators Update from spring of this year and patched it up to the current date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, you've already installed the most secure version of Windows ever created, which though few understand what's truly "under the covers" inherently contains many security protections that don't require the use of Windows Defender to enable.&nbsp; For example,
 here's an excerpt from&nbsp;a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/threat-protection/overview-of-threat-mitigations-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mitigate threats by using Windows 10 security features</a>&nbsp;document that discusses the many built-in security features for that earlier Creators Update and which are enabled or require configuration in a business environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In recognition of this landscape, Windows 10 Creator's Update (Windows 10, version 1703) includes multiple security features that were created to make it difficult (and costly) to find and exploit many software vulnerabilities. These features are designed
 to:<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">+ </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities</p>
</li><li>
<p>Break exploitation techniques</p>
</li><li>
<p>Contain the damage and prevent persistence</p>
</li><li>
<p>Limit the window of opportunity to exploit</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The following sections provide more detail about security mitigations in Windows 10, version 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't try to cover these mitigations here, so brief the document for more, since what's already included within Windows 10 is far more extensive than most people understand.&nbsp; Also note that the Fall Creators Update has additional improvements so deal specifically
 with the ransomeware and other classes of malware that have still proven difficult to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/10/23/stopping-ransomware-where-it-counts-protecting-your-data-with-controlled-folder-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Stopping ransomware where it counts: Protecting your data with Controlled
 folder access</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that, the core applications included in Windows 10 which are most often involved in malware attacks have been greatly improved as well, with the Edge browser security an excellent example of this.&nbsp; Along with a much simpler interface and operation,
 which greatly reduces the attack surface, the security features built into Edge are again far more extensive than in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/11/microsoft-edge-building-a-safer-browser/#UOSWGw1YSOpIAIKp.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Edge Building a safer browser - Microsoft Edge Dev BlogMicrosoft Edge Dev Blog</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So though the malware&nbsp;threats are still out there and changing more quickly then ever, the protections within the architecture of Windows 10 are far more resilient as well, with the ability for the malware to exploit any actual&nbsp;vulnerabilities much reduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't mean that no malware can successfully get through, but it's highly unlikely to succeed without help from the user via social engineering.&nbsp; What I've seen in my own use of&nbsp; Windows 10 is that I've almost never seen any true malware detected by
 Windows Defender, since in all but one case of a browser hijack, the malware had either been blocked by the Internet Explorer&nbsp;browser I was using or by some of the later mitigations mentioned in the article above, which I have personally configured more securely
 than the Microsoft consumer defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, the built-in protections now so often block the ability of most malware on a well configured system, that only with the direct aid of someone less capable are these typically able to enter a Windows 10 system.&nbsp; If this is your problem then
 better detection by antivirus might reduce the potential for a successful attack, but that's only likely if the attack itself isn't a zero-day, since then the issue becomes one of whether your specific AV vendor happens to either already have a signature for
 that item or at least good enough heuristic or behavioral detections to block the attack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases the better technique is to train your personnel, since with the speed at which new malware is created today, the greatest risk is these&nbsp;zero-day socially engineered&nbsp;attacks, so only by stopping the tendencies for this risky behavior is the&nbsp;real
 problem truly resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt; EDIT &gt; BTW.&nbsp; I perform almost exactly the same type of testing you are attempting with an older desktop system that was upgraded from Windows 7 to 10.&nbsp; This means it has only the protections available that any Windows 10 system might have and nothing that
 would require the additional features like TPM, Hello&nbsp;or other enterprise hardware&nbsp;security enhancements might enable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In multiple years of testing, I've never had anything&nbsp;worse than the browser hijack,
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=SupportScam:JS/TechBrolo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SupportScam:JS/TechBrolo</a>&nbsp;"infection", actually just an HTML document, detected by either Windows Defender or manual&nbsp;follow-up Malwarebytes scans.&nbsp; Even this would have been blocked by the new Controlled Folder Access protection in the Fall Creators Update,
 since it was dropped into the AppData folder, which is one of those intended to be protected by that new addition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, FYI, I'd been doing this same sort of testing going back several years with that same desktop using Windows 7 and MSE, which though&nbsp;MSE more often detected various malware exploits attempting to enter the system, was still never successfully infected.&nbsp;
 Note that I had only used current versions of&nbsp;Internet Explorer and enabled both their earlier Enhanced Protected Mode and Windows Data Execution Prevention for all applications, since I had no 3rd-party software that couldn't tolerate these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These last two items I mention were early versions of the types of enhanced sandbox and other protections now built into Windows 10, so what I used to need to configure is today inherently built into the operating system.&nbsp; That's why I don't feel that&nbsp;"better"&nbsp;AV
 than Defender&nbsp;is required since there really isn't any and even if there were, it's still a c**p-shoot as to whether it might be able to protect better than the exploit protection already built into Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/05/08/antivirus-evolved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Antivirus evolved ‚Äì Windows Security blog</a>&nbsp;article describes near the beginning, traditional AV is basically dead.&nbsp; That's why I use all Microsoft security products, since I know that their designs are taking into account the security improvements in each
 iteration of the Windows 10 operating system, as well as providing the layered protection that still makes sense.</p>

    <title>how do i print 4 A6 documents one A4 page&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordonmackay  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do i print 4 A6 documents one A4 page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>i have made a landscape A6 flyer. when printing, i wish to fit as many as possible on one sheet of A4.</p>
<p>on the print window if i use '1,1' in the page range and '2 pages per sheet' in the zoom box, no scaling it will print 2 A6 flyers side by side using one half length-ways of the A4 sheet. there is obviously a spare half A4 sheet in which a further 2 A6 flyers
 could also be printed, bringing the total to 4 A6's per A4 sheet. however, no amount of changing things in the page range or zoom box seem to get the desired result. all i get are 4 flyers of ever-decreasing sizes printing on my A4 and noteably, they are always
 in the opposite orientation than when i get it to work with only 2 A6's&nbsp; on my A4 sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it is so obvious that there is plenty room for this process to be done but i'll be b******d if i know how to do it.</p>
<p>any help/suggestions would be most appreciated and of course may help others out there with the same issue.</p>
<p>thanks for any suggestions in anticipation.</p>

            <p>So "4 pages per sheet" and 1,1,1,1 doesn't work?</p>
<p>Well, it wouldn't, of course, because you don't want to shrink the document. Why not create an A4 document and paste the content of your A6 flyer four times (using a 2x2 table or two newspaper-style columns)? Or, better still, in an A4 document, choose "2
 pages per sheet" under "Multiple pages" on the Margins tab of Page Setup. Then paste the flyer twice on the first page (which will be A5) and print pages 1,1.</p>

    <title>Add to group call Skype 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexgoldie_79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add to group call Skype 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2 weeks time Classic Skype will no longer be usable.&nbsp; I use it to allow people not able to make meetings to dial in and still hear it.&nbsp; With Classic Skype if an incoming call happens while I am already on a call I get the option "add to group call", this
 option doesn't seem to be there with the Skype 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something or has the "add to group call" functionality been dropped from Skype 8?&nbsp; Is there another way to do so that the active call doesn't get put on hold while the incomming call is being picked up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if makes a difference, but I'm using Windows 10 and most of the calls come in through the Skype number that we have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
