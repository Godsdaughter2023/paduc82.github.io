<h2>            outlook 2007 not syncing</h2>
                    <p>Hello </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My pc updated to the latest windows 10 the other day, and now I have a problem with outlook 2007, before the update I had two hotmail accounts one I changed over to the exchange server, but I could not change the second hotmail
 account over, so I accessed the second one through MAPI and it worked fine until the update, then I could not send emails from my second account (MAPI) when I clicked on send, it would go to the outbox of the exchange folder and will not send it just says
 “this message has not been sent”…this message will be sent via XXXXX (XXXXX being my second email account).</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After looking online and trying different things, the last thing was delete the second account then reinstall it though outlook connector, which seemed to work, but now it will not sync at all with hotmail I get sync error :-</p>

<p>Hi Dean,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you set the format of the cell to display as date or as General? If it is General then it can get converted into the 5 digit number as Dates are internally represented as that. Can you attach a screenshot so that we can better understand the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            When I Send&#47;Receive Sometimes I receive this error message.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have an LG GW825 (IQ through Telus in Canada). The phone has Windows Mobile 6.5.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when I try to Send / Receive email on the phone I get the message, "<span><span>Messages cannot be downloaded to your mobile device.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make sure you are connected and that your email account settings are correct. Then, try to download messages again."<br />
<br />
I've checked and the settings are correct and there is mobile service / I have a connection.<br />
<br />
This is an intermittent problem as sometimes things work normally. When it works normally the send / receive works quickly.<br />
<br />
When&nbsp;the error message appears the phone seems to have taken a long time trying to connect and ultimately fails.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions to fix this frustrating situation?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Phil</span></span>

            When you have this issue with e-mail do you know if your internet connection is active?&nbsp; When checking for e-mail can you pull up a webpage in your browser?&nbsp; The issue could either be related to the e-mail provider or the cellular provider.&nbsp; Do you also
 experience these issues over WiFi?

deepthiumesh</a>. I understand your getting an error message "Microsoft account service currently unavailable" when you try to download app from the store. For this, I would like you to do manual sync and see if there will be no problem. Go to Settings&gt; Email+
 accounts&gt; tap and hold on the Microsoft account and sync. If there is error, kindly provide us the error message. If no error, log in to
<a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a> using the phone's web browser.&nbsp;<span>Use WiFi connection.&nbsp;</span>Try to change Microsoft account password. If the same error encountered, Hard reset the phone and try other Microsoft account.
 Hard reset will delete everything on the phone. It is best backing up personal data to avoid data loss. Please check on the link below for the instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Message Blocking is active</h2>
                    
<p>I had an unlocked Nokia C3-00 with Wi-Fi. I use T-Mobile and also pay for text message. So when I first try to send a message, it reply in five seconds. The message was from the one I send, but the contain is like an error message. It said: "Free Msg: Unable
 to send message - Message Blocking is active." So how to disable this Message Blocking so I can send text, or it is a problem from T-Mobile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This message is related to your operator. Sometimes operators block certain commercial numbers, check with them why you're unable to text to certain numbers. They are also able to disable this feature, so definitely give them a call.</p>

<h2>            Transferring windows 7 phone Micro SD card pictures</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div>I am helping my mother-in-law with an issue with her micro SD card. She had a Samsung focus Win7 phone, she recently traded it out for a newer phone but kept the micro SD card that she had in the phone. She is now trying to get the pictures she took on
 her old win7 phone on her win7 pc. I tried using a PNY micro SD card reader. When I click on the drive it says to input something in the drive. I am guessing this is because of the format of the micro SD card being set to a win7 phone.</div>
<div>is there any way to get the files off the mciro SD card and onto the PC?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello AaronC1985:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having getting pictures off an SD card.&nbsp; It looks like it is unlikely that the pictures on the SD card will be able to be covered from the card.&nbsp; Please review this article that discusses how
 SD cards work with the Windows phone, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831</a>.&nbsp; As you have discovered and confirmed by this article, the SD card will not be able to be read by a PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am unaware of any work arounds or tricks to bypass this limitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing you might want to do is check any PC that was used by your mother-in-law to sync this phone.&nbsp; When a Windows 7 phone is connected to a computer with the Zune software and the sync relationship is not guest, pictures will automatically sync to that
 computer.&nbsp; This may be the best bet to find the pictures and ultimately move them to the PC your mother-in-law is now using.&nbsp; If you cannot find the pictures by going to the Zune software picture collection, you can do a full search of the computer by going
 to start &gt; typing *.jpg in the search box &gt; pressing enter &gt; review all picture files for the ones that had been taken on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

    <title>Office 365 &#40;Excel&#41; buggy and slow on new Mac&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phoxyphotog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 &#40;Excel&#41; buggy and slow on new Mac&#33;</h2>
                    <p>January 2017...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a brand-new iMac 21.5” Retina (2015 model) running Sierra with upgraded specs for my photography business (3.3 gHz i7 processor, 16gb RAM, 1 TB SATA drive). I upgraded from a 2012 Macbook Pro with a 2.5 gHz i5 processor and 16gb RAM (the RAM was
 upgraded by me aftermarket). On the MBP I had an old copy of Office 2008 for Mac, which was working just fine albeit lacking new features. I installed it on my new iMac and to my dismay it was not compatible with the huge Retina display (pixelated UI) so I
 reluctantly purchased Office 365 download version. I uninstalled and deleted all Microsoft files from the 2008 version before installing the new one on the iMac. When I finally got it installed, I loaded up my financial record spreadsheet to do my taxes, which
 is about 6 pages long and one page worth of columns. It has no complicated formatting besides some currency cell formatting, and no formulas (Office 2008 for Mac did not support formulas). As far as spreadsheets go it is fairly simple. I never had issues with
 this file or any Excel files on my MBP. I was running an older OS X (10.8 Mountain Lion) on the MBP because “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.” Anyways, I had my spreadsheet in Page View and scrolling up and down is a nightmare. The entire sheet goes blank white,
 it has a several-second delay when trying to scroll, random parts of the grid lines disappear, I can’t click and select certain cells though can usually use the arrow keys to get there, all the buttons on the menu ribbon are slow to react to a click, and some
 of the cells and grid lines randomly turn a highlighted yellow color! It’s nearly unusable. I resorted to using pen and paper to add up my values. What I did NOT yet try was switching it to Normal View (instead of Page View). I will try to play with it tonight
 as I see that seems to fix it for some people on another forum. I asked some friends who said they use the same program with Sierra and they use it in Normal view with no problems. I did go on Microsoft’s instant chat with a tech person and he said supposedly
 there is an issue with Office being slow on OS Sierra and they are “working on it.” I am naturally skeptical. I briefly tried Word and it seemed just slightly slow but not jumpy and buggy. Thankfully I did not uninstall Office 2008 from my MBP so I can still
 use that when necessary, but I paid $100 for the multi-device license to Office 365 so I’m angry. My computer specs should be plenty for all my apps to run seamlessly and my hard drive is nowhere near full.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time I decided to update my MBP to Sierra, and am sort of regretting that. It looks funny and is slower. I'll see if the speed improves after a few days since it's probably still re-linking for Spotlight. But it doesn't look as clear and sharp
 as Mountain Lion did. I updated it because Office 365 said it isn't compatible for OS versions earlier than 10.10 and wanted to install it on the MBP too but now I might not unless this buggy issue is fixed.</p>

            <p>I have been trying to use Excel 2016 for over a year now and I find it difficult to provide genuinely constructively feedback because I am still struggling with interface issues that are so fundamental (e.g. trying to select columns or select a cell with
 the mouse when writing formulae) that my assessment is this: Excel 2016 for Mac is a TRAINWRECK and should still be in beta. I am fortunate to have a copy of Excel 2011, upon which I can rely for my work. I really want to being able to use the latest software
 but it just isn't ready yet (more than a year after coming out of beta).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This begs the question of whether Microsoft is still actively engaged in squashing bugs? These very obvious and fundamental problems have persisted for so long now that I find it difficult to believe they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using latest updates through 365 Personal, a recent Macbook Pro with the latest MacOS Sierra updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE tell me how I can help you take this version of Excel to beta quality and then full release quality.</p>
<p>

            <p>This is primarily set up as a user-to-user forum. Your primary audience here is fellow Office users, although Microsoft employees do visit regularly now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ways to send feedback directly to Microsoft. From your comments, i deduce that you may wish to participate directly in helping to identify bugs that should be fixed. If that is the case, you should go to the Help menu in Excel and choose Check
 for Updates, which opens AutoUpdate app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In AutoUpdate choose the Insider Fast option. This puts you into the actual beta program. You'll get weekly builds of Office and have the ability to directly provide feedback to the Microsoft developers in the Insider forum. I have seen literally hundreds
 of bugs fixes in XL 2016 for Mac, and there still more to identify and fix. If you are in the beta program you will be the very first to experience fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some trade-offs when you join the beta program. You will not be able to use regular Microsoft support, as they are not familiar with what is going on within beta builds. The downloads are large and weekly. Once in a while you will get to experience
 a brand new bug, which, of course, you would be encourage to submit reports about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can tell you unequivocally that I have not seen a time when Microsoft was as dedicated to getting rid of bugs in Office for Mac as in the past year. I can also tell you that there are some very exciting improvements coming to Office for Mac in the near
 future. Among them: new cell formulas and a new Visual Basic for Applications editor. You'll get to use these new features months before they are generally released.</p>
<p>
With regard to speed - they are working on fixing several different aspects of speed. One is Page Layout view. Another is problems when working with workbooks saved on network drives. When these fixes come out, Fast Insiders will get them first.</p>

<h3> bsullyok  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 hangs when trying to access contacts when composing email</h2>
                    <p>Running Office 2016 on Windows 10.&nbsp; When trying to create a new email, I click on the "to" to call up my address book.&nbsp; The address book does not come up, and it hangs incessantly until I either close Outlook or restart it.&nbsp; I've tried repairing Outlook
 (a frustratingly long procedure), and have tried some solutions I found that sort of matched my problem, but to no avail.&nbsp; I can open my whole contacts list, and at first couldn't even open an individual contact without it hanging again.&nbsp; Just now, I was able
 to open an individual contact, and from within that screen, click "email" and address it to that email.&nbsp; But if I try to close the contact, it hangs again and I'm forced to close Outlook.&nbsp; Then I tried again - same thing - and was able to send the email before
 closing the individual contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I can work around it, apparently, but I want to be able to start a new email and simply click the "to" button to access my address list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas out there?</p>

            <p><em>(for the good news first, see below)<br />
</em><br />
According to the online Microsoft Store sales person I spoke to...there is&nbsp;NO trial version of InfoPath 2010.<br />
<br />
InfoPath 2010 is&nbsp;ONLY shipped in the Office Professional PLUS suite which is ONLY offered as a volume license (+5&nbsp;users... for a visual reference&nbsp;see...<br />

</p>
<p><br />
<strong>THE GOOD NEWS<br />
</strong>A stand alone copy of InfoPath 2010 can be purchased by calling the <strong>
Microsoft Store&nbsp;@ </strong><span><strong>1 877 696 7786<br />
</strong><u>OR</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You can also purchase InfoPath 2010 via the online Microsoft Store via this link...</span></p>

<p><span>The cost is roughly $229 + tax &amp; SH. If you need InfoPath in a hurry you can request a
<br />
DOWNLOAD be made available. I also, recommend purchasing the CD of the software<br />
for safe keeping. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you must un-install Office before installing the 2010 trial version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the trial version expires in 60 days.&nbsp; In order to install your other version of Office, you must first remove the 2010 trial version.&nbsp; So... you can try InfoPath 2010 if you are willing to jump through enough hoops.</p>

            It is not possible to sync SIM card contacts. Only the contacts that are in the device memory will move across. And yes, the sim contacts are stored on the SIM. Therefore they will still be there when you switch to another phone.

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although not directed at your precise question (Cyber covered that), I sense you are seeking ways to increase space on drive C and improve performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my little blurb on improving space and speed in Vista or Windows 7 systems – and some can apply to XP as well but the reference articles and procedures will be different but you should be able to either figure out how to do what is suggested on XP
 or search Bing for an article which addresses that topic for XP or an equivalent program that works with XP (and it also suggests other things of value that you can consider or ignore -the choice is entirely yours). All of this is your choice, actually - I'm
 just presenting some options that may help and that have helped many others (and that I pretty much use myself though sometimes I do procrastinate I'm sad to admit and there are some things I won't do no matter how beneficial - for example, I refuse to delete
 my cookies (but that's a personal choice as I prefer the benefits of having them when going to previously-visited web sites over the limited amount of space recovered and speed gained given their small size)). Much of this should be part of normal maintenance,
 but that includes some other things (like creating periodic system restore points - probably at least weekly as they don't necessarily improve speed, space or performance and may in fact even do the opposite in some cases) not addressed here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system. There are ways to handle this (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course
 the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at
 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM (well, almost 4GB, more like 3.5 actually) and the 64-bit version can use even more). If space
 is the issue, replace your hard drive with a larger one, add a second hard drive (if it is a desktop system), or add an external hard drive. Those are hardware answers (which cost money). We'll now discuss software solutions (which are mostly if not entirely
 free - at least the options presented here -there are 3rd party programs that provide additional options but they really aren't necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster or Enhancer, or Repairer or Fixer software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you have thousands of errors just to get you to download
 and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause). Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install
 to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise). Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
To improve your speed and space, do Disk Cleanup using: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</a><span> in Vista or </span>
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/818-disk-cleanup-open-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Disk Cleanup - Open and Use - Windows 7 Forums</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will
 harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files. If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then
 that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</a><span> in Vista or
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Optimize-Windows-7-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Optimize Windows 7 for better performance</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Do all of the options (or at the very least, consider
 them -many can help a great deal).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least once every month or so, run CCleaner <a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.piriform.com/</span></a> with as many options as you choose to delete (but be
<strong><span>careful</span></strong> because this program if not used properly and with caution and with you paying attention to what you are doing can delete important and even critical files that could cause a great deal of trouble).<span>
</span>Uncheck anything in the Registry section and in the Application Section, uncheck Microsoft Antimalware.</p>

<p><span>Clearing out your temporary files can also save you much space and improve performance and while some of the above will clear a lot of the temp files, they won't cover them all. This will. I recommend running it every month or two. It is TFC by Old
 Timer </span><a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/TFC-Temp-File-Cleaner-OldTimer-file187.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TFC - Temp File Cleaner by OldTimer - Geeks to Go Forums</span></a><span> and you should download and save it to your desktop. When run,
 it will close everything else, so be sure to save anything you're working on and basically close all your programs. If it asks (and when done even if it doesn't ask), reboot to complete the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced. It's a trade-off. The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points you will be able to retain -but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough to
 save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them). Here's the procedure:

Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears. Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup. That will probably be the majority of items there - if
 not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient). This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup). When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary,
 I noticed startup was quicker, response times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster. Better still, download Autoruns
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you
<strong><span>can’t</span></strong> delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which
<strong><span>MUST</span></strong> not be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system). If unsure, leave it alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources). Windows Defender is a good AS program. The free Microsoft Security Essentials
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a>is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well. If you're using MSE, you don't really
 need Defender and MSE will deactivate it when installed (but you would with many other AV programs - though some of them also deactivate Defender). I would also suggest downloading<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a>and
 running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            You don't have to do that, since when new update will install it will add to older database and it is not like that you have multiple copies, but you have one copy of each signature. To free up space, you could run disk clean up, it will help you to remove
 unnecessary things.

            None of the above address the problem and the first two are about the account it self and accessing my account. &nbsp;I don't want the account that is the issue. &nbsp;My hotmail account worked perfectly before Microsoft account took it over. &nbsp;The issue is how to
 separate the 2. &nbsp;I don't want to have to log on to Microsoft to get access to my hotmail. &nbsp;I have seen on you tube how to do this via a PC, but I use a Mac. &nbsp;Its about a internet account versus local account, and how to get this back to how it was before

            Firstly can I say that when I said that I have a phone, it is actually my wife's but she leaves me to deal with all technical matters. I hope you don't object to me raising these issues on her behalf.
<div><br />
<div>The two accounts (or maybe I should say versions of the same account?) are shown on the apps screen as Outlook.com and Outlook.com2. As soon as the second version arrived it was shown on the start screen. I removed that thinking that was sorted.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To access her account she uses the single Outlook on the main start screen, however the two versions are still shown on the apps screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The emails are repeated, and the calendar, but if you go to calendar settings both calendars are shown separately as Outlook and Outlook 2, with Outlook 2 also including the facility to add birthdays and UK holidays!</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only Outlook account address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. She has her domain address too. Do you need that?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help.</div>

<br />
Your&nbsp; wife's account might not be properly synched in&nbsp;the mobile device which results to what you are experiencing. I suggest that you un-sync and then re-sync your wife's Outlook.com account in the mobile device and see if the issue still persists. You may
 refer to this <a href="http://mobile.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> for the steps. </p>

            Thanks for this. I have looked under email accounts and now see what there is. She has Outlook and Microsoft account 2 Both are for Outlook.com. &nbsp;If I try to delete the Microsoft account there is no facility to delete it. There is delete facility on the
 Outlook.
<div><br />
<div>If I delete Outlook first, will I be able to delete Microsoft account 2, because I read on the link you gave me that I cannot delete the first live account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't want to do what you suggest unless I can have your assurance that I can re-syn and end up with the one Outlook account!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry but as what is being provided on the link, the first account that you set up can't be deleted from your phone. You'll need to do a hard reset for you to completely remove the first and any account that has been confirgure on your mobile device.
 Please contact your original equipment manufacturer for further assistance on how to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Glenn, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to prevent your&nbsp;work addresses&nbsp;from being tagged as spam accounts and you can rest assured that we'll do our best to help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Kindly&nbsp;ask&nbsp;your clients with&nbsp;Microsoft accounts&nbsp;to add your work addresses to their
<strong>contact list</strong> and then to their <strong>Safe senders list</strong> so your emails will not be delivered to their Junk folder and&nbsp;the system will recognize&nbsp;them as legitimate messages.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps and let us know if you have other questions or concerns regarding Outlook.com, we'll be more that happy to accomodate.<br />
<br />
Best regards.</p>

    <title>Searching Notes field in Contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craig german  say:</h3>
<h2>            Searching Notes field in Contacts</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Office 2016, and I no longer see a way to search within the Notes field of a Contact in Outlook, nor do I see a way to scroll the Notes.&nbsp; It appears that you now only have the ability to cursor down in the field.&nbsp; Additionally, I used
 to be able to see the Notes and other info in the same view, and now you have to click the Notes tab separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know if you can:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Enable scrolling in the Notes field?</p>
<p>2) Search the Notes field (not at the macro level, but within the actual Notes text to find instances of the text)?</p>
<p>3) Change the view to show Notes in the same view as the rest of the fields?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Word Draft Scrolls To The Right Far Past Margin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markdlehmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Draft Scrolls To The Right Far Past Margin</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just got Word 365 for Mac and use Word a lot.&nbsp; In Draft view, when scrolling up and down, the view constantly moves towards the right and I can no longer see the text on the left margin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The horizontal scrolling appears to go way past the right margin, so far that I can't see any of the text on the page. This is super annoying b/c when I scroll up and down, the text constantly moves left and right, so I can't focus on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop horizontal scrolling to the right margin? I've never had this problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See screen shot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want the scrolling to go left and right. In Print mode this doesn't happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>

            Before anything else your installation of Office 2016 is in serious need of updating.The posting you refer to is from September of 2015 &amp; the Office version you cited (15.18) dates back more than 2 years. Version 16.10 is the current build for the general
 population. I can't guarantee that updating will resolve the issue but it would be fruitless to chase symptoms evidenced in obsolete software... A multitude of changes have taken place in both Office &amp; the operating system(s) since early 2016.<br />

<h2>            Harmon Kardon Invoke Not Allowing Calls</h2>
                    I purchased the Invoke today and after setup when trying to make calls it says I need Skype credit, however, according to HK and Skypes websites that's not the case.&nbsp; I found a FAQ saying it may take up to 90 minutes for it to work, but it has been over
 4 hours.&nbsp; I tried working with Skype support but after a bit they stopped responding.&nbsp; My Skype account is part of my Microsoft account that was used to setup the Invoke.&nbsp; Any thoughts?
