<div>12:47 a.m.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Shashank C <br />
Could you please tell me, since when you are facing this issue?</div>
<div><br />
12:48 a.m.<br />

<div>12:48 a.m.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Me <br />
that's the big difference</div>
<div>12:48 a.m.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Me <br />
to be honest looks like an atyom or windows atom support prob. like i said it works in linux</div>
<div>12:49 a.m.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Shashank C <br />
Yes, that could be a reason as both Windows and Linux has different configurations, and some hardware compatible with Linux are not compatible with Windows.</div>
<div><br />
12:50 a.m.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Me <br />
but i was sold machine as hdmi windows 8.1</div>
<div>12:50 a.m.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Me <br />
so who is responsible</div>
<div>12:50 a.m.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Shashank C <br />
Yes you are correct.</div>
<div>12:50 a.m.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Me <br />

<div>12:51 a.m.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Shashank C <br />

&nbsp; <br />

&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; <br />

z3740 doesn't work well with hdmi windows 8.1 and 10<br />
Can a bug be submitted to the developers<br />
01:06<br />
Me<br />
I have duplicated this problem on 2 different systems carrying this CPU SOC<br />
01:07<br />
Me<br />
In accordance with my previous tech support conversation, I installed all updates but have not resolved the problem<br />
01:08<br />
Me<br />
Oh and it works in Linux.<br />
01:08<br />
Greg H<br />
I am sorry to hear about that. By the way, I have checked your case number and it is blank. For that, I will have to create a new case number for this issue<br />
Greg H<br />
Have you updated your windows to 1607?<br />
01:21<br />
Me<br />
yes<br />
01:22<br />
Me<br />

01:23<br />
Me<br />
here is 2nd transcript<br />
01:24<br />
Greg H<br />
If that is the case, that only means that its a hardware issue. And you are right, Intel Atom z3740&nbsp; with windows 10 is not compatible with hdmi<br />

                    <p>Original title: what office prog will be best for me?<br />
<br />
Hi I have just upgraded my computer system (Medion bought from Aldi) and with it came a trial of Office 365&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">&nbsp;it has stopped working.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">how do
 I licence my trial version of office 2013,</span><font color="#454545"><span>&nbsp;I have not received any reminders or details of what to do to licence the programme. I also am not sure it is the right prog. for my needs it is very complicated and my needs are
 very simple some basic word processing, simple &nbsp;spread sheets and some posters. &nbsp;Previously I had word 2000 and publisher of a&nbsp;similar&nbsp;age. We have 2&nbsp;computers&nbsp;in our&nbsp;household&nbsp;and the cost of Office 365 would seem excessive for our needs. &nbsp;Any advice would
 be helpful. &nbsp;Thanks Colin</span></font></p>

<p>It's free, and you can install it on as many machines as you like with no licencing or activation problems.</p>

    <title>Outlook.pst file locked - thus can not be copied - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickneilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.pst file locked - thus can not be copied</h2>
                    <p>The file “OutLook.pst” (and only that file – problem does not occur with any other file) is locked, and thus cannot be copied.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Whenever ANY Office application is opened (no need to open a file or do anything – just open the app) “Outlook.pst” becomes locked – IFF, no Office application has been opened within the last minute.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>Whenever ANY Office application is opened (no need to open a file or do anything – just open the app) “Outlook.pst” becomes locked – IFF, no Office application has been opened within the last minute.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If any Office application has been opened within the last minute then the file is not locked and can be continually copied until a pause of more than a minute.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When Microsoft create bugs they are beauts! <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It took me about 2 weeks and many hundreds of tests to be able to describe this fault accurately.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The fault first appeared on 23 May 2019.<span>&nbsp; </span>After trying many possible fixes – like those that suggested the fault related to a “damaged” “.pst” file that required a ($163.00) repair - I recognized that at about the same time I had
 been “given” an Office “upgrade” – so I restored the original version of Office – and, problem fixed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Hope this is of use to someone. </p>

            FWIW, any .PST file connected to Outlook will be locked while Outlook is open and will remain that way until Outlook fully closes.&nbsp; This is normal .PST behavior and has been for ages.&nbsp; This file lock should only happen when an Outlook process is running,
 not the rest of Office - Word, Excel, etc.&nbsp; If the file is locked when, say, only Word is open, My suggestion would be to check Task Manager to see if an Outlook process is also running.

<p>I'm seeing the same problem.&nbsp; Opening <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
any </span>office application seems to create a file called ~Outlook.pst.tmp (in my case, where my Outlook file is called Outlook.pst) in the same directory as the .pst file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have also noticed that when an Office application is opened (as you say, no need to open a file or do anything) when it is closed it often leaves a background process running (you can see it in Task Manager).&nbsp; If you end that process, it seems to free up
 the Outlook.pst file for copying, but leaves the temporary file there; the temporary file is removed the next time you open and then close Outlook. These background processes seem to be persistent across re-boots of Windows, and when I re-boot I now get several
 empty Word and Excel files opening automatically.&nbsp; This only stops if I delete the processes before closing down Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this started at about the same time as your problem, with an automatic update to Office 365. This is a real shambles!</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, there is never an Outlook process running after Outlook is closed, it is definitely Word, Excel, etc that is causing the problem.</p>

<p>I haven't reverted (RI said he had). For the moment I'm still using the latest version downloaded of Office 365 (Word says it is Version 1905 Build 11629.20246 Click-to-Run Monthly Channel). Yesterday I did an "online repair" of Office, but the problem persisted.
 Also, running Word (the office application I use most after Outlook) directly with the /a option to disable add-ons, etc does not correct the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just had a look using the TASKLIST command and the background processes left behind after closing Word have a "Window Title" of HardwareMonitorWindow - does that give a clue? Needless to say, no window is visible for these processes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in the lucky position of not having to meet a deadline at the moment, so I will stick with this version of Office for a while so I can produce diagnostics and/or try solutions/workarounds.</p>

<p>Thanks for offering to help investigate.&nbsp; This morning our escalation engineers were able to identify the bug.&nbsp; We are getting this escalated for a fix.&nbsp; It should be fixed in the next major update for Monthly Channel.&nbsp; I would guess a week or so out.&nbsp; If
 you get blocked you can revert to the prior major build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This KB has the revert steps,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2770432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2770432</a>.&nbsp; We are supposed to recommend the Office Deployment Tool to revert but you can use these old steps work too:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a Command Prompt and type or copy/paste the commands below and press Enter after each.&nbsp; That will revert you to the build we suspect the bug started.</p>

            Gabriel, thanks for the prompt attention to this. I'll revert if the problem gets too annoying or the fix does not arrive in a few weeks. Meanwhile I can live with the issue now I know how to work around it by ending those background processes.

<p><strong><span><span>Issue recap:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The Excel team has made a change in the behavior of certain file types to increase security. This change came in the security updates KB3115262, KB3170008, and KB3115322. Previously, when you
 tried to open an HTML, XLA, or XLAM file with an .XLS file extension from an untrusted location, Excel would warn about the mismatch between the file extension and content, but would still open the workbook without Protected View security. After the security
 updates Excel no longer will open the workbook because these files are not compatible with Protected View and there is no warning or other indication it was not opened.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Workarounds for .xla and .xlam files:</span></strong><span>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for your patience and input—community suggestions drove our decision to change this behavior in a way we hope will be much better for your workflows!</span></span></p>

TMO Wing running Mobile 6 w/ / latest Tmo update.&nbsp; Vista 32 / Mobile device center.&nbsp; I may have inadvertantly accepted a pocket pc program and never went to install it as best I can recall.&nbsp; in any event every time I plug in to sync I am presented with the
 add / remove screen. I have reinstalled WMDC&nbsp; and done a hard reset on the phone and still no joy .&nbsp; Much appreciate all suggestions.&nbsp; This is annoying.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Went to google and searched a number of variations of this issue and came up with :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The problem: Every time you plug your phone into your PC to sync it, a stupid add/remove programs box pops up.
 Just started one day perhaps after an install and now, it won't go away.<br />
<br />
Had this annoying problem and searched the net and found some attempts at fixes, tried em all, and they failed. Then, I played around with it for several hours and finally fixed it. We'll go over all of them here for the benefit of those who found this post
 through google. Try these in order. Each solution below is a complete solution, not a step. If one fails to work for you, try the next one.<br />
<br />
(1) Uninstall and reinstall anything that you recentely installed on your device. The true nature of this problem afterall is that something went haywire during an install.<br />
<br />
(2) Delete your partnership with the device on your PC in sync center, restart your machine and phone, and reestablish the partnership setting all the preferences the way you had them.<br />
<br />
(3) Delete your partnership with the device on your PC in sync center, uninstall mobile center, restart, reinstall mobile device center, restart, reestablish the partnership with your phone setting all the preferences the way you had them.<br />
<br />
<strong>(4) With your phone unplugged, go into regedit and go to the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows CE Services/AutoStartOnConnect and look for an entry in the right pane that says appmgr.exe . If it's there, remove it. Do you see anything
 else there? If you do, it's not the cause of THIS problem but, sometimes other stuff that you don't want gets there like neromobileadd which unless you use it shouldn't be there. If nothing else is there, navigate to the top of your registry (back to root)
 and search for Windows CE Services . The reason is because there will be other instances of it like in KKEY_CURRENT_USER and in other keys. If you find the Windows CE Services key elsewhere, go into StartOnConnect and repeat the</strong> same check you did
 above removing appmgr.exe if you see it. When finished, try syncing your phone again.<br />
<br />
(5) This is the one that I had to do. Unplug your phone from your PC and delete it's partnership from sync center. Now, open regedit. Go to the top and this time, just search for Windows CE Services and repeat the following process every time you find it in
 a folder on the left. (If it's an entry on the right, just search for the next key.) In all instances of Windows CE Services that has an AppMgr key, click it. In each AppMgr key, if there is an Apps key, click it. In every Apps key you find under Windows CE
 Services/Appmgr, look to the right pane. Other than the entry at the top named Default, you should see app names that look familiar. Delete them. Remember, don't delete the entry called Default, just all the others. When you are finished, you can exit out
 of regedit. Now, sync up your phone. If you did this correctly, FINALLY, that annoying add/remove programs box will not come up anymore!</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>The regedit fix worked.&nbsp; I had stray programs listed under both keys that were never deleted so every time I synced it was looking for them.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Great solution.</span></p>

    <title>Unable to revert Windows tablet back to Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to revert Windows tablet back to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently running Windows 10 Technical Preview (Build 9926 with the latest updates) on my HP Omni 10 tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, its touchscreen stopped working (yes, I know it wasn't the best decision to install the tech preview on a touch-only device). The PC now refuses to acknowledge any touch/pen inputs for the display , though PC Info used to previously&nbsp;detect a 5-point
 multi-touch input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to reinstall the preview ISO. (Did it using USB keyboard and mouse.)</p>
<p>When even that didn't help, I though I'd reinstall the original Windows 8.1 build using the recovery media (a microSD card) that came with my device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I go to settings and choose to reset my PC, it says some files are missing and will be provided by my recovery media. When I remove and insert the SD card again, it says the recovery media is invalid. I have previously used it to reset and
 refresh my (while still running official 8.1) a number of times. Never had any issues then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to start manually reset using UEFI firmware settings in BIOS. But it throws error 0xc0000428, saying the digital signature of file "\windows\system32\winload.efi" couldn't be verified. And again asks me to&nbsp;use recovery tools&nbsp;from my&nbsp;installation
 media (which doesn't happen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried creating a separate installation media (from <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a>). Chose English (UK) as the language (same as the one currently on Tech Preview), Windows 8.1 as operating system and a&nbsp;32-bit architecture.</p>
<p>I have my product key. I entered it during installation (and it got accepted), but after accepting terms and conditions I got yet another error: "Something Happened. Setup has failed to determine supported install choices."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not exactly keen on going back to Windows 8.1. I'd love&nbsp;to stick around and help find more issues in the Windows 10 tech preview and help make it better. However, I will need to get my touchscreen working for that. I'm gonna go to&nbsp;the HP service&nbsp;centre
 some time for this. But I still wanna know why I'm unable to revert back to Windows 8.1, and how I can fix these errors my PC keeps throwing at me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me (and anyone else who might face it) solve this problem. Thanks! :)</p>

            <p>Hi Pratham,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to revert back to earlier windows operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the Windows 8.1 Bootable USB you can boot from the USB select repair my computer and from there access the refresh and reset options and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow the same procedure using the Windows 10 Technical Preview ISO file make a bootable USB and then try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the Windows 8.1 is unable to recognize the Windows 10 Technical preview installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the touch screen not working it is advice to contact the service center and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and please keep us updated.</p>

            <p>Hi. Thanks for writing back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried those options. As I have mentioned in my post, my PC declares the installation media invalid, for both refresh and reset options.</p>
<p>I tried using both the media that came with my device and a new one created through the procedure given by MS on their website (find the link in my post).</p>
<p>
I even created an ISO file and tried to install through it (the way I got Windows 10 installed) but it gave the same error (Setup has failed to determine supported install choices).</p>

<br />
Looked at the links and then noticed the discussion about the 64bit system issue.<br />
<br />
As I am running 64 bit on my machine I tried compacting on a 32 bit machine instead and guess what ??<br />
<br />
It worked - yippee<br />

Thanks for help<br />

    <title>Ribbon Changes During Excel Updates - How To Best Manage&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael.hutchens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ribbon Changes During Excel Updates - How To Best Manage&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed that Microsoft has started making changes to the content within ribbon tabs during
<em>non-major</em> upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when Excel 2016 was first released, the Data tab contained a group called
<strong>Connections</strong> (ID: Connections), as shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d79b69fc-99f4-4b61-a4ca-ec744e1eef57?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d79b69fc-99f4-4b61-a4ca-ec744e1eef57?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after a recent automated upgrade to Excel 2016 (I'm currently running version 1802 (Build 9029.2167 Click-to-Run)), this group has now been replaced with a very similar-looking group called
<strong>Queries &amp; Connections</strong> (ID: GroupDataQueriesAndConnections), as shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9324b114-bd65-4a4f-ac38-1bb6fc32b334?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9324b114-bd65-4a4f-ac38-1bb6fc32b334?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that this is Microsoft's new approach - i.e. somewhat randomly making changes to the Excel UI (and other things) during minor upgrades, rather than only changing these things on major version upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is fun from a Microsoft engineering perspective, but potentially a nightmare from an external developer perspective. For example, my company's Excel add-in amends the Connections group when it is loaded to add more functionality, but after this recent
 change by Microsoft the Connections group is hidden and the Queries &amp; Connections group is displayed, thereby breaking our add-in's UI as our amendments don't appear in the Queries &amp; Connections group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>As developers how do we manage these somewhat random changes to the ribbon UI, when they are now occurring within versions?</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent a lot of time looking at this specific example, and it appears that when both the Connections and Queries &amp; Connections groups are included in a tab using ribbon XML code, only the Queries &amp; Connections group is visible. To demonstrate this, here's
 some basic ribbon XML code:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;tab id="Test" label="Test"&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;group idMso="GroupConnections"&gt;&lt;/group&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;group idMso="GroupDataQueriesAndConnections"&gt;&lt;/group&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/tab&gt; </p>
<p>
</p><p>And here's the result in Excel 2016 (Version 1802 (Build 9029.2167 Click-to-Run)):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70ae0f48-8b33-4a95-81bf-e3ee1f130a38?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70ae0f48-8b33-4a95-81bf-e3ee1f130a38?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like Microsoft's engineers have implemented a rule in the ribbon drawing code which hides the older Connections group if the newer Queries &amp; Connections group is included in a tab. Or something like that?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all very concerning for me as an Office developer, as it means the rules of the game are now changing without notice (or documentation) on a regular basis. We've had many challenges over the years managing changes to the ribbon XML
<em>between </em>Excel versions (e.g. Excel 2007/10/13/16), but they've always been major version-specific, so we haven't had to worry about&nbsp;<em>intra-version</em> changes<em>.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Does the latest round of changes from Microsoft mean that we will need to start looking at specific builds of Excel to reliably know what is and isn't going to be displayed in the ribbon?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any expert/Microsoft input into this area would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance. M.</p>

<p>Thanks Rena, I've now accepted that MS is going to be making ongoing changes to Excel on a regular (potentially monthly) basis, and developers simply have to struggle along trying to keep up with them.</p>

    <title>How do I link to sheets together in Excel so that when I sort one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bro man  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I link to sheets together in Excel so that when I sort one sheet, the linked sheets updates accordingly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a workbook with two sheets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheet 1 includes a list of names that are marked absent or present. Each name has columns for name, and a column for position.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheet 2 calculates the percentage of people marked absent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I link the two sheets, the percentages are accurate until I sort sheet 1. How do I correct this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Ensure that the spelling in range A2:A5 of the Overall % sheet match with the spellings in column F of the Attendance sheet</p>
<p>2. In cell B2 of the Overall % sheet, enter this formula and copy down till cell B5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((Attendance!$F$2:$F$221=A2)*(Attendance!$G$2:$G$221="x"))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In cell D2 of the Overall % sheet, enter this formula and copy down till cell D5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((Attendance!$F$2:$F$221=C2)*(Attendance!$H$2:$H$221="x"))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when you sort column F data on Attendance sheet, the data on Overall % sheet will remain intact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 - &#39;Interface not registered&#39; Error when saving web page to favorites.</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded from&nbsp;IE 10 to IE 11.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;save a web page to the favorites folder, the error message 'interface not registered' appears. If I revert to IE 10, the problem disappears. Web pages already in favorites will load OK.&nbsp;OS is 64 bit version of Windows
 7.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After much fiddling, have found that if I run IE11 as administrator (click on start and input 'Internet Explorer' then run as administrator, the problem disappears. However, am the administrator on this account anyway. All quite puzzling.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Advice gratefully received.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><u>Further Investigation</u></b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Spent some time recently exploring things further. I deleted the Internet Explorer 11, 10 and 9 updates, getting back to IE 8, which is the browser that I understand came with Windows 7. IE 8 did not exhibit the problems listed above, so I was going to use
 IE 8 as my working browser, except that it would not work with an https page that I regularly use. I then re-installed IE 11 from the Microsoft download site and the above problems re-appeared. So, am afraid that the end of the road has been reached and Chrome
 is now my default browser.</p>

<p>Hi HeathAdams1003,<br />
<br />
Firstly, there is an article about a similar error message as yours in Outlook for Mac client. You can try to change the SMTP port setting referring to the article below.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2443563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2443563</a><br />
<br />
Then I would suggest you create a new identity or profile to see if the issue persists. Here are the articles for your reference.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-identities-edc1a942-8242-46bd-8a9b-076553d5494d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage identities in Outlook 2011 for Mac</a><br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage profiles in Outlook 2016 for Mac</a><br />
<br />
If the issue persists after the steps above, I‘d like to collect the following information for further research.<br />
1. Which Outlook for Mac client are you using, Outlook 2011 or 2016? Please click
<strong>Outlook</strong>-&gt;<strong>About Outlook&nbsp;</strong>on the top tool bar, and provide the detailed Outlook client version to us.<br />
2. Which email account are you using in the Outlook client, an Office 365 account or a non Office 365 account like a Gmail account?<br />
3. How did you add you email account into the Outlook client, via Exchange mode or other modes? Please capture a screenshot of the detail
<br />
4. If you are using an Office 365 account, could you also check in Office 365 OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) to see if you can successfully connect to Office 365?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<h2>            Conditional Formatting For Multiple Date Ranges</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to build a report tracker, for reports due every 9 months.&nbsp; There reports are allowed to be due as late as 12 months, but roll into an urgent status at 15 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data in Column B to be the date of the last report.&nbsp; The intent would be for 0-270 days to show as green, 271-365 to show as amber and 365 and higher to show as red.&nbsp; I've attempted using the TODAY with &lt; and &gt; but I have hit a wall.</p>

            <p>I hope the attached image helps. Note that the rules must be in correct order - use the up/down arrows in the manage Rule dialog to fix the order.</p>
<p>I have them as</p>
<p>=today()-B2 &gt; 364 (red)</p>
<p>=today()-b2&gt;270 (amber)</p>
<p>=today()-b2&lt;270 (green)</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;put Cond Form on just the B column but If you select the entire table you can have the row formatted: just be careful not to use absolute references like $B$2 in this case.</p>
<p>best wishes</p>

<h2>            I&#39;d like to choose to stay &#39;invisible&#39; but my account keeps deciding for me to change to &#39;available&#39;</h2>
                    <p>This is still happening.&nbsp; After reading through the comments initiated a number of years ago to find a solution to this problem, it seems Microsoft have done nothing to appease their customers ie&nbsp; the profile at the top right hand side decides for me to
 change to 'available' when it has been manually changed by me to 'invisible'.&nbsp; It didn't used to do this: it used to stay 'invisible' when this option had been chosen, therefore this 'design' decision could easily be changed back, by Microsoft, to the way
 it used to function.&nbsp; It is clear that many people to not like this 'design' decision by Microsoft, where the customer has to constantly check 'invisible' only to become 'available' when using the email.&nbsp; Please update this function to the way your customers
 would prefer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue that you’re having with the status of your account can be due to a software conflict or a browser incompatibility. To help us isolate your concern, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you currently signed in with the same account on another device?</li><li>Have you tried using a different web browser? How did it go?</li><li>Were there any changes made on your account prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll wait for your response.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In response to your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently use the Microsoft browser, Edge, as that is the one recommended for browsing with Microsoft Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using other browsers but the same issue is happening ie When 'Invisible' is checked, this immediately becomes 'Available' as soon as I go to the emails. &nbsp; Added to that there is then no way of changing this 'Available' as the pull down menu
 is not there.&nbsp; I have to sign out, then sign in again, only for the whole issue to repeat itself.&nbsp; It is stuck on 'available'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently signed in with the same account on another device, and, as you may already be aware:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'There is no way to sign out of your Outlook.com email account on a mobile device such as Android or iPhone, the only option is to remove the account from your phone.'&nbsp; This information is to be found on 'howtoaccount.com' under 'how to log out of outlook
 email on mobile'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes were made on my account prior to the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

<p>We’d like to know if you’ve already tried changing the status directly from the Skype website. This can be the cause why it always changed to visible even though it was set as invisible. The original status will still be based on what was already set in
 the Skype website or in the Skype desktop app. To change your status to invisible, please click on this

<p>Just get rid of the extra .Me in that line. In fact, you can get rid of all the Me's, because they're optional in a simple case like this.</p>

<h2>            Lync is not syncing with outlook &#40;e.g. calendar and status&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am facing an issue with Lync (Skype for Business). Since around past one month, the skype client continuously asks me to "Enter Credentials". Though i am able to still chat with other people in my organisation, see their status and join any meetings via
 my outlook calendar. However,</p>
<p>- the calendar in skype does not show any of my events /meetings for the day</p>
<p>- my outlook calendar does not show me the calendar info of other people with whom i try setting up a meeting (not sure if this is related to the problem with skype)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help resolve. There is enough troubleshooting done by my local itics team as well (e.g. deleting the files in the "...\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync" folder, reinstalling skype for business, refreshing my outlook profile) but no success
 so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This is also a random behavior as sometimes (5% cases) it does accept my credentials when i enter the same while in 95% of the times it simply does not log-in successfully.</p>

</p><p>Is the email address same as the primary email address? If yes, please go to the control panel &gt; User accounts &gt; Mail &gt; Show profiles &gt; tick always use this profile &gt; Choose the profile which only include the same SMTP email address account. Then re-installing
 Skype for Business, open Outlook first and then log into your account in Skype for Business to see if it works.</p>

    <title>Installing earlier version of Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rtemmerm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing earlier version of Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I had Office 365 on my MacBook Pro. &nbsp;It would no longer update. &nbsp;Anything I could find on the problem recommended uninstalling Office 365 completely, then reinstalling. &nbsp;I did so, very carefully following all the steps to ensure every single file was completely
 gone.</p>
<p>I then logged into Microsoft, and downloaded Office 365, to reinstall it.</p>
<p>And NOW, after having done all that, I am told my Mac requires a newer version of the OS (which I can't upgrade, as my Mac is a 2009 version) in order to install.</p>
<p>At this point, it seems I have to spend a small fortune buying a new Mac just so I can have Office 365 again.</p>
<p>I'm happy to install an older version of Office 365, one which will still work with OS 10.11.6, if I could only find one.</p>
<p>Does anyone have access to such an Office version?</p>
<p>I'm happy to work with a non-updatable program for a while, until I return home to Canada in April and can go to my local Apple store to buy a new machine. &nbsp;But I HATE having to buy a new machine in Australia just because I followed all the instructions,
 step by step, to resolve the issue I was having.</p>
<p>If anyone has access to an older version of Office 365, PLEASE let me know how to get it.</p>

<p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may say, there is no safety issues, you just need to remember your sign in account and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both the volume license and Office 2016 Home &amp; Student, you need to download and install the Office applications and using the account to activate them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the volume license serializer, you can refer to this article: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/mac/volume-license-serializer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Overview of the Volume License (VL) Serializer</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Gloria</p>

<h2>            Publisher to PDF Conversion&#58; Hyperlinks navigating to different pages</h2>
                    <p>Hi MS Community!<br />
<br />
I've got a head scratcher and hoping you can help.&nbsp; I'm in the process of creating a newsletter for my organization using Microsoft Publisher.&nbsp; Throughout this newsletter I have various links (bookmarks/hyperlinks) which auto-navigate the user to different
 pages within the newsletter (i.e., Link 1 brings&nbsp;you to page 1, Link 2 brings you to page 2, etc.).<br />
<br />
Here's where I'm running into issues.&nbsp; The links work as expected when the file is a .pub (Publisher), but when I convert it to a .PDF, the links for some reason, navigate the user to different pages (i.e., Link 1 brings you to page 2 when it should be page
 1, Link 2 brings you to page 3 when it should be page 2, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody experienced this before?&nbsp; More importantly, does anybody know of a fix?&nbsp; Happy to explore any/all options.<br />
<br />
Here are the software versions:<br />
Microsoft Publisher 2010<br />
Adobe Reader X<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any direction you can provide MS Community!</p>
<p><br />
Cheers,</p>
<p><br />
Rick Mercier</p>

<h2>            Planner Notifications in Teams</h2>
                    <p>We are in the process of trying to move all of our work communication to the Teams app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have set up various Teams and channels, and are happy using Teams to share documents and to chat, via the Conversations tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we have now added a planner tab to one of the Teams and have noticed that all notifications are still sent by email. Is there an option to receive notifications (e.g. new comments on a card within planner) within the Teams app, rather than by email?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on my tests, it is not feasible to receive the notification within Teams. I suggest you create a new vote in the

<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated. </p>

    <title>Office 365 Hijacked My Windows 8 Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judyofthenorth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Hijacked My Windows 8 Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I feel like Office 365 hijacked my Windows 8 laptop! I have the standard Office 2013 Home Premium installed and everything has been fine until&nbsp;today. My Outlook&nbsp;said it needed repairs and couldn't start up. I tried Word&nbsp;and it had the same&nbsp;startup problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 ran the online repair in the Control Panel and all of a sudden Office&nbsp;365&nbsp;starts to download on my laptop. What??!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a single-user&nbsp;with a home business and I do not want&nbsp;Office&nbsp;365 with all its bells and whistles.&nbsp;My Outlook&nbsp;starts up now (thank God) and&nbsp;says "Outlook (Unlicensed Product)" in a red banner at the top. I haven't activated Office 365&nbsp;yet as I'm scared
 it's going to do something else unexpected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a&nbsp;free trial version of Office 365 that's been forced upon me? Will I have to&nbsp;start paying for it after 30 days?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any&nbsp;advice would be appreciated, thank you.&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;stuck not knowing how to proceed on a Saturday, with no&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Support by phone&nbsp;until Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for sharing, Max. As my Outlook was restricted with no ability to reply or forward (only read), I had to activate Office 365 for a full featured version. Now, the red banner "Outlook (Unlicensed Product" at the top of my Outlook is gone and everything
 appears normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I've been reading online, Microsoft wants us all&nbsp;to upgrade to&nbsp;Office 365 for a $100 annual subscription fee. For those of us who don't need licensing for up to 5 PCs and SkyDrive, it includes free upgrades to Office. Big whup,&nbsp;as my standard Office
 2013 does everything I need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Office 365 is working&nbsp;for now but I plan&nbsp;to call Microsoft Support&nbsp;on Monday to figure out why this happened. More importantly,&nbsp;are my&nbsp;Office 2013 products now&nbsp;doomed to stop working in 30 days ... until Microsoft is&nbsp;paid&nbsp;$100 for the next year that I
 don't&nbsp;need or want from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone's interested, here's a PCWorld article that helped educate me:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The adaptor supplier with the computer is a AVASTAR wireless composite device.</p>
<p>

<p>Build 16232 (I am on the slow ring) seems to run okay. Until recently after the 6th restart the screen flashes green and says "KMODE exception not handled". My web searches indicate that this could be a missing driver and it is easy to fix except there is
 no driver/file at the end of the message and since I am slow in more ways than one it is not clear how I would provide a driver file at that stage of the boot.</p>
<p>My first reaction was to run these commands since that seems to be the usual recommendation for failed updates:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">net stop wuauserv<br />
net stop cryptSvc<br />
net stop bits<br />
net stop msiserver</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">net start wuauserv<br />
net start cryptSvc<br />
net start bits<br />
net start msiserver</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><div>Based on web info for code 0X80070643 I downloaded the WU170509 diagnostic tool and run it several times. It now indicates no errors found. At this time C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution is 42.8Mb which is typical for a new folder. The power button shows
 "Update and restart" You can restart all you want it just boots up to the logon screen. Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt;Windows Update says "Windows 10 Insider Preview 16251.0 (rs3_release)
<strong>Status:</strong>Awaiting restart so apparently when WU170509 updated the registry etc. whatever indicates an update is pending didn't get cleared when it cleared the distribution.</div>
<div>How do I force another download?<br />
How do I solve this KMODE exception hot handled issue?<br />
If I download the ISO can I still go back to 16232 if it fails. I think I have a backup. If I create a new one I guess I won't be worse off than I am now but if this build won't update I am afraid the actual release won't install either.<br />
How can I diagnose this problem? Am I the only one with this problem?</div>

<p>Desperate times lead to desperate measures. Since just about every resource on the web indicates that the KMODE exception not handled is a driver issue but no driver is given it the message and my computer is a simple Gigabyte A75M-D2H with an Adaptec 29160
 SCSI III card I decided that maybe the update was not detecting the card and installing the proper driver. The message says exception, not interrupt but as I said I was desperate so I removed the card. No difference, it still didn't work so that was a waste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is what I did. I temporarily stopped updates because the constant failed updates was wasting a lot of time and slowed down my computer. In one final desperate stab I moved an old distribution into the SoftwareDistribution folder and selected "Update
 and Restart", that cleared the pending restart and allowed me to perform a new update cycle. I changed to the FAST ring and ran wu170509, the update diagnostic tool, and said to clear the current software distribution and start another update cycle. It downloaded
 and installed 16273.1000.rs3_release successfully. I have not changed back to SLOW but may.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I CONSIDER THIS SOLVED/ANSWERED BUT I DON'T SEE A WAY TO ANSWER YOUR OWN QUESTION.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ea5f8a24-f4e1-49dc-a08e-40b052a8adf9" title="MariaDeCoster">
<p>
</p><p>Since the migration of Skype accounts to Microsoft accounts, the option to create a unique Skype Name has been
<em>removed</em>. This is because we want to focus on&nbsp;allowing you to login-in with a single sign-in (email or phone number)&nbsp;to Microsoft services with just one password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there's no option to unlink a Skype account from a Microsoft account once they have been linked. Meaning, if you close your Skype account, you will also delete the Microsoft account attached to it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps on how you can close a Skype account are listed on this support article:

            The question is I have linked by mistake my daughter's Skype account to my Microsoft account, and I have my own Skype account unlinked. I cannot even change the username and picture of my daughter's skype account to personalized it as it was mine! Neither
 I can delete my own Skype account (the one unlinked) to only have 1 Skype account out there... it is very annoying! I would appreciate your help in this matter.&nbsp;

<p>Whether a Skype account has been linked to a Microsoft account intentionally or by mistake, there's no option to revert the action.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior January 30th, there is an option to <em>move </em>a Skype account to another Microsoft account in case a Skype account has been merged to a Microsoft account by misstep. But after the said date, the option has been removed. Hence, it's no longer possible
 to change the Microsoft account where a Microsoft account has been linked to.</p>

<p>Thank you for the link, I could change the picture. I had already changed my name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more question: I understood I cannot delete a Skype account, even if it is not linked to a microsoft account. My question is: is it going to be deleted by itself if I never use it? If yes, after how long? I would want that other account to be erased

<p>Actually, before you can close a Skype account which is not connected to any Microsoft account, you need to link it with one. When you follow the steps on the support article
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your query, Microsoft accounts (including Skype) get deleted due to continued inactivity. We do not have any time frame yet when inactive accounts get deleted&nbsp;but I'll get back to you once I got an update.

<p>Hi. I'll appreciate your attention to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused. I thought you said customers&nbsp;<em>cannot</em> close a Skype account once it is linked with a Microsoft account. So if we have an old Skype account that is not linked to Microsoft, and if we want to delete that account, why would we link it to
 a Microsoft account? It doesn't follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like the customer above, I wish to have <em>one </em>
Skype account for myself. (I have one I've used for years, and it's the one all the people I Skype with have. So this is the only one I wish to have.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On account of confusion caused by Microsoft, I'm not even sure what I have right now.</p>
<p>1. There's the account I want to keep.</p>
<p>2. Yesterday, I opened the "Skype" app on my PC. It had my name up there and everything, but I could not find my call history or regular contacts. Someone had told me over the phone that she was trying to reach me on Skype, and it kept timing out; she couldn't
 reach me. It was totally confusing. So it seems Microsoft automatically, without my permission,&nbsp;<em>created</em> a default-kind of account for me. (Can you confirm?)</p>
<p>3. "Skype for Business" also now appears in my PC's apps. I don't need two Skypes. And I definitely hope that yet another account&nbsp;<em>was not</em> created for me in this app. I want to get rid of the whole thing.</p>
<p>4. I have a very old, old-school Skype account. It isn't an active nuisance (like #2 and #3 are). But I'd like it gone, as I will never use it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it unreasonable for a customer to ask for #2, #3 and #4 to be deleted permanently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Fwiw, I don't know if #1 (the account I want to keep) is linked to Microsoft or not. I don't think so. And if I'm correct, then to be honest, even though I use and like other Microsoft products, all the confusion and lack of simple, reasonable user choices
 make me want to stay unlinked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best.</p>

<p><span>Hello stb100,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have reposted your queries (in bold letters) below and the corresponding responses.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I'm confused. I thought you said customers&nbsp;<em><span>cannot</span></em> close a Skype

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A Skype Account cannot be closed once it has been linked to a Microsoft Account because both will be cancelled out. If this linked
 account is closed, you won’t be able to </span><span>sign in to other Microsoft products or services such as Outlook.com, Office Online, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When deleting a Skype account that is unlinked, you will be asked to link it first to a new/unused Microsoft account - which will also
 be closed with it. This is because the process of closing Skype accounts is already integrated to Microsoft. However, since you are linking a newly-made Microsoft account, it can be easily disposed of with the Skype account.
</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The “live:xxxxxx” account that you are seeing was created when you signed in using your email address instead of using the Skype name.
 This account is definitely linked to your Microsoft account. <strong>To use the correct account, always log in using the credentials you’ve utilized in creating them.
</strong>If you used a Skype name, sign in with the same information. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>"Skype for Business" also now appears in my PC's apps. I don't need two Skypes.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You need not use the Skype for Business application, nor create an account with it. You can just use regular Skype. For information on Skype for
 Business, kindly refer to this FAQ:</span><span>
