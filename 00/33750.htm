<p>Back in the early part of 2016 and I was a ambassador for Xbox community level which was the original name for the program I had a year subscription for Xbox added to my account but then I called Xbox customer service and I normally would buy a year subscription
 turn out I found out that I only had 3 months for my they cancelled my year subscription so they could add a month to the year subscription I have asked them I wanted to put on 3 years on my account but for some reason I had the same year that was already
 on my account plus an additional 3 months onto the year that was about to expire when I found out about it in the late part of 2016 in October i was kicked from the ambassador program although my subscription didn't expired it just follow after the year expired
 from the previous subscription I had from before. Your best bet is to call Xbox customer support and look into your account and have them go over the Xbox account with you. Do not do it on your computer call them.</p>

Da es mit der KI einfach unmöglich ist diesen Level zu schaffen suche ich auf diesem Wege einen erfahrenen Spieler der mit mir die eine Level machen würde. Es handelt sich dabei um den Level ''Eine verzweifelte Flucht'' auf Profi. Zwar habe ich es mit der KI
 geschafft es auf Veteran zu schaffen aber für's Profi Level ist die KI echt nicht gemacht worden, sie ist einfach zu dumm

            <p>Sorry for the delay, sometimes typing hurts too much (hence my need for speech recognition).&nbsp; I hope to give you more info in a day or 2.&nbsp; I hope to be able to at least get the guy I bought this from, who supposedly has a store in NJ as well as one in PA
 where I got this, to either give me my money back or trade me for a different computer that actually works on Sat. when he will (hopefully) be at his stand near me.&nbsp; I&nbsp; tried all the self-help-type sites already, and until I know what will happen&nbsp;with the
 yo-yo&nbsp;(and that;s being polite compared to what I want to call him) (Did you know that MY computer "hibernates very deeply" and therefore I have to shut it off without shutting it down?&nbsp; Same guy told me this.&nbsp; Guess he just thinks I am totally brainless.)&nbsp;I
 don't want to do much else so he can't find some way to blame me for something going wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;It just isn't right that I did not get what I paid for and what I did get (the laptop) doesn't even work correctly!&nbsp; It just makes it all worse that he lies as well
 about the speech recognition NOT being included in Windows 7, as well as other nonsense he has told me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>AARRRRGGGGHH!!!&nbsp; I hope he is treated better when he gets ollder (I won't wish a disability on him, but age comes to all who hang in there long enough!&nbsp; Sorry, just frustrated.</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>Thank you for your help, I really appreciate having your response. &nbsp;I will send you the error message I get, his name, etc. asap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I hope you have a wonderful and happy New Year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry, this is a long one, but hopefully will be useful as well.&nbsp; What do the "link"/"unlink" icons at the top of this screen mean?&nbsp; It took ma quite awhile to find my way back to my original question and answers, but I think I have that figured out.&nbsp; I
 avoid Facebook as much as possible for the same reason.&nbsp; At least this is easier to figure out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much, it's amazing to me that anyone is willing to help me work my way through this mire.&nbsp; My degree is in Mental Health, and some law school (which doesn't mix well with psychology, 2 very different ways of seeing and working with the world),
 and neither prepared me for the world of computers.&nbsp; I have only owned one PC until now (a 2002 Dell, old but still going), and I doubt it would be adequate (or for that matter, willing) to support anything but XP and I would be afraid to ask it to let me
 install something like DragonSpeak.&nbsp; That is why I purchased the 2 laptops I did.&nbsp; The first had no disc drive, and issues that Danny McCormack (owner of PC Computer, Brick, NJ, but I can't find any address or info about his company) has had either no answer
 for or answers that simply don't make sense to me.&nbsp; From what I understand, computers do what they are&nbsp;programmed to do, not what they feel like doing, which is what he has tried to use as an explanation for several things.&nbsp; Both are IBM Thinkpads, the one
 I have now is a T-60.&nbsp; Both had the same issues.&nbsp; They would suddenly not allow me to shut them down, and I had to shut them down with the power button.&nbsp; Then they both would hibernate and would not "awaken" .&nbsp; Danny said "they hibernate very deeply" and he
 just turned them off with the power button.&nbsp; The same would happen with sleep.&nbsp; He changed settings, but it made no difference.&nbsp; I did manage to change settings so sleep works now so long as I "wake" it up relatively soon.&nbsp; Both would stay black if I closed
 the lid and reopened it,&nbsp;and he told me never to do that or use "Stand by", but wouldn't explain, and the couple of times I forgot and shut the lid the only way to shut down was again with the power button.&nbsp; It seems to me that "hibernate" is just that, but
 he makes it sound like the computer has a mind of its own beyond any programming and takes some sort of heavy sleeping pill and can't "wake" up.&nbsp; Obviously, from this explanation and a couple other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>comments/explanations he has given, he assumes that I know less than nothing (or perhaps he knows less than he should).&nbsp; When I got the T-60, he said it had Windows 7 Ultimate, which does show on the screen, but when the speech recognition did not work he
 said it wasn't included and I needed to buy it or buy Dragon.&nbsp; I had asked to upgrade to a specific Dell he had for sale, but he 'forgot' and sold it, then said all he had was the one I have now.&nbsp; I provided him with printouts of articles from several computer
 magazines and the Microsoft book which all clearly showed speech was included.&nbsp; Now he pretty much ignores me, is rude, and since I probably only have until this Sat. before his 30 day warranty ends, I don't know whether to return the computer (assuming he
 will let me do that), exchange it, or keep it and keep trying to find a way to get what I paid for with whomever I can find to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I give all this information simply because it always seems to me that the more information&nbsp; I can give from the 'git-go', the less will be needed later, assuming, of course, that you will still be able to assist me.&nbsp; As an&nbsp;added complications, I suffer from
 Post Traumatic Stress.&nbsp; The reason I mention this is two-fold:&nbsp; I work at a "farmers Market" selling high-end crystal, mostly Slavic and European (where I grew up as the daughter of a US gov't father), ceramics, etc. 2 days a week, as part of my PTSD therapy,
 otherwise am in my room, writing or doing other things on the computer when my physical disability (arnold-chiari, syringomyelia, etc.)&nbsp;permit, so my computer(s) are extremely important to me.&nbsp; Many in my family are published writers, and I hope to be, assuming
 I can get this issue resolved and live long enough to get it done!&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, this is where I purchased the computer (how I wish I had stayed loyal to the man I had work on my PC!) after looking at his computers for about a year.&nbsp; I can only hope that he will
 be back this year, since we only pay on a weekly basis and I have no address for his 'store', just a phone number that is not listed so must be a Magic-Jack,&nbsp; I want to write him a letter rather than risk a loud confrontation in front of his customers, but
 haven't been able to figure out exactly what to say since he insists that I don't have speech recognition, the other problems are nothing to do with him but innate to this computer, etc.&nbsp; The ratings I've read on-line have been good for this computer, but
 the computer system itself rates it at a 4.3 on an 8 point scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK.&nbsp; All of that being said,&nbsp; the answer to your questions are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The error message I get is 0x80004005L as soon as I click on speech recognition under the Ease of Access site.&nbsp; I can go no further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The person's name is Danny McCormack, 732-298-7812, Brick, NJ.&nbsp; His email address (I havent tried to contact his via this since I don't know what I want to say/do) is
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I have only changed the sleep setting, the admin password and added games.&nbsp; I have wandered around in search of answers and tried various troubleshooting things, but otherwise always steer clear of doing anything I don't understand (which, obviously,
 is a great deal).&nbsp; I understand more that I should, but not enough to take any action.&nbsp; Luckily, I am old enough to not be too impulsive anymore!</p>
<p>(but not too old to want to fight my way through this and get on to other problems in my life)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would doing a Clean Boot do anything that would cause him to refuse to honor the 30 day warranty (He gave me 60 days on the first one since I am a vendor, but said nothing about that when I made the 'up-grade' to the disc drive)?&nbsp; If not, I will try that.&nbsp;
 You mention the 'article', but I am not sure what that means (added to everything ele is Adult ADHD, and I need specificity....boy, it feels like I am baring my soul to the world with this, but the need for specificity requires I give all the info I can.&nbsp;
 I do apologize to all, and now that it's all said, it won't happen again!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find out that another vendor purchased this same brand from him and after he didn't use it for a couple months it stopped working altogether.&nbsp; He said the battery is fine (he sells stereos and is familiar with battery issues).&nbsp; He avoids confrontations
 even more than I do (I am pretty good at them once I get started), so he has not mentioned this to Danny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also asked Danny if I had to have a microphone hooked up before the program would even open, and he said he didn't know and walked away.&nbsp; If it does, I will gladly go an get one immediately, but since I get the error message immediately, I don't think
 that is the problem.&nbsp; Plus I don't know if I will end up with this computer or another one and if the headset/microphone would have the same 'plugs' for another computer than this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the overly-long response, and I hope I answered your questions to your satisfaction.&nbsp; Again, I apologize to all who have plowed through this.&nbsp;&nbsp; It won't happen again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope I haven't scared everyone away with all of this, but do thank you for the help you have provided to date.</p>

            A couple of point from reading through.<br />
<br />
The IBM T60 is a great machine, however, being a few years old be prepared to replace the battery (there is a reason that they are only warrantied for 1 year)<br />
<br />
You WILL need an external microphone. I'm not near my T60 to verify, but I'm pretty sure from the specs that I found on the Lenovo website.<br />
<br />
There is nothing in the Ease Of Access setting that refer to 'text to speech'<br />
<br />
There is no "hibernate very deeply", it's either hibernating or it isn't. Personally, I'm not a fan of hibernating or stand-by modes. I've heard of others that have had issues with it. Mine are either on or off.<br />
<br />
You would definitely want to make sure that all updates have been applied (if you do "custom" then you will also see if there are any hardware updates).<br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware, Dragon is NOT included (unless there was some Vendor special bundle) and is a program that you would have to purchase (having said that, I don't have Ultimate but Pro). However, if you click Start &gt; type "speech to text" there *is* a program
 included for that. Is that where you are getting the error? I'm pretty sure you would need a microphone before this would be active (I've never tried it so can't say for sure.<br />
<br />
Are you using some sort of Anti-virus program? (and update it daily)<br />
<br />
A clean boot (as previously suggested) should not void a warranty as it is built into Windows itself for trouble shooting purposes.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just some thoughts.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I know I will need a microphone/headset once I get the speech recognition to start.&nbsp; It is under "use the computer without a mouse or keyboard" which takes you to the program, but I get the error message immediately before I can get
 to the tutorial, set up the microphone, etc. portions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer is set up, not by me, on custom, and I have no clue how to do any updates.&nbsp; My Pc (xp) does them automatically.&nbsp; The guy&nbsp;I bought it from has Malwarebytes abti-virus, told me the updaqtes were automatic, but it appears that that is not the case.&nbsp;
 I try to update, and sometimes am successful, sometimes get informed I don't have that so I can't updaqte it.&nbsp; He said "thatq shouldn't happen", which was unhelpful, then walked away to talk to his computer buddies (standard behavior many of us encounter from
 him if we are computer-savvy.&nbsp; I do know I would have to purchase Dragon, but one main reason I wanted Windows 7 is that it has the speech recognition program included.&nbsp; Except mine is not, hence the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He told me he offered tech support, but has yet to help me with any questions, as the ones stated above (updating anything, where is the program I paid him for, etc.)&nbsp; Great support.&nbsp; And telling me my computer "hibernates very deeply" was simply because
 he didn't have an answer and though I was dumb enough to accept his.&nbsp; I don't want to use it, it just happens, even when the settings say "do nothing" under the hibernate part.&nbsp; I would like to be able to close the lid&nbsp;while working on something and get interrupted
 so my cat doesn't walk on it, or it "hibernates" and so I can continue to work when the interruption has ended (phone call, someone at door, etc.).&nbsp; How can I know so much about so many other things yet be so darn stupid ab</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how to do the clean boot, but if I can figure it out before Sat. maybe I will be able to try that before SaT.&nbsp; I don't know what "article" was being referred to in earlier reply yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; The error message included wording An unexpected error occurred linking to the Speech Recognition Control Panel".&nbsp; I neglected to include the wording in my earlier reply to Nirmal S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            A couple of things that I notice from your response.<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes is not an Antivirus program, but an anti-malware removal program. The free version does not update automatically (http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/). If you are running it without any antivirus, then chances are your machine
 has already been compromised. <br />
<br />
You should be able to change the settings for what happens when you close the lid. Click Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Power Options . If you need to walk away and don't want to worry about your cat, you can just lock it (Press the Windows Logo Key + L) Should be
 to the left of the space bar.<br />
<br />
I wonder if the error you are getting is because of not having any microphone attached before the setup.<br />
<br />
Have a look at this site for some great information and instructions for virus/malware removal.<br />

            <p>He told me I had anti-virus.&nbsp; How do I check to find out if I do?&nbsp; I did do the Power Options (after I watched him do it and nothing changed) and managed to at least get it to wake up if it goes to sleep.&nbsp; But, if I don't get back to it in time,&nbsp; no matter
 what the Power Options are set at (eg., "do nothing"), it hibernates and nothing wakes it up and, like he did, I have to turnn it off using the power button instead of properly shutting it down.&nbsp; I will try the locking, but won't I end up with the hibernation
 problem anyway?&nbsp; Or will I be able to come back and go back to work?&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now I am so confused by the computer, 2&nbsp; very old vehicles that are having separate but very problematic issues, all the disabilities and undiagnosed auto-immune disease (I am on
 SSI, 700.00 per month, and on Medical Assistance which gives me only a resident, not an actual physician), letters that have to go out by tomorrow but I don't think I can last that long and have to work 10 hours tomorrow with no heat and 12 hours Sat. (it's
 colder inside where I work than outside and all there is for a huge area is a small propane heater) that I am getting overwhelmed.&nbsp; Thank&nbsp; you so much for the lock thought, I will try it after I try to start my van and work on that in the dark before the place
 I live has it towed since I've had 2 vehicles parked here and only 1 is permitted) and my neighbor needs me to do his shopping (he's severely disabled).&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to learn about all of this, but I have to decide about what to do with the laptop by Sat., so
 that is a problem.&nbsp; I have the step by step for Windows 7, but right now even that seems to be beyond me.&nbsp; How the heck did I do so well in law school and not even know how to find out if I have an anti-virus or not?&nbsp; I know I can learn, but where and from
 whom?&nbsp; The classes I may have access to are about things I know, and trying to get the Windows 7 to work is the more immediate problem because of the laptop deadline.&nbsp; I hate being confused!&nbsp; AAARRRGGGHHH!!&nbsp; Thank you for all your time and help, I appreciate
 any input I get and can understand!&nbsp; So fat the battery has been fine, but I am clueless as to what happens when it dies....is that somethng I have to try to find and buy?&nbsp; Sorry, I'll shut up now....</p>

Subject: RE: I get an error when I try to set up speech recognition.<br />
Date: Sat, 5 Jan 2013 13:22:48 -0500<br />
<div>I still don't know which, if any, anti-virus program I have, but have been running malware regularly and no problems have showed up.&nbsp; I have AVG on my PC (free version) and it's been fine.&nbsp; Had a couple trojans that wouldn't go into virus vault, but after
 some wandering (which I am not afraid to do on the PC, just on this laptop), I managed to get them into the vault and gone.&nbsp; I don't want to talk to the guy I bought this from, but will email him and ask him for info.&nbsp; The&nbsp;lock works great, but haven't found
 out if it will go into hibernation and quit yet or not.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I bought a decent microphone/headset (one beter than the clerk has that she uses&nbsp;with speech reconition), but haven't tried to see if that will open the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it doesn't work, then I am worse off than I was.....then again, I have a microphone and headset
 as well as new things that don't work on Windows 7.&nbsp; .<br />
&nbsp;<br />
New issue that&nbsp;is showing up is that I had two warnings from windows about virus protection, but get an error message that&nbsp;Action Center&nbsp;can't&nbsp;turn on windows defender, and I don't know if this is somehow related to the error message I get when I try to use
 Speech Recognition.&nbsp; If Windows is sending me the warnings, why can't it connect to it's own program?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for&nbsp;the help, still hoping for solution to Speech problem and now why&nbsp;Action Center can't turn on Windows Defender.&nbsp; The updates for Windows 7 are&nbsp;coming through, I just don't get notification like I am used to on XP.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Robin</div>
<div>(Jan 8, above is Jan 5)</div>
<div>I sent&nbsp; this, &nbsp;but don't know if it made it into 'thread'.&nbsp; Watched video for Defender, did what they said, but keep being told it can't be found, go to same site I've been going to fo help and know the video by heart.&nbsp; I did try other help sites, to know
 avail.&nbsp; If I am getting 'warned' by Windows and advised to use this, why can't I?&nbsp; Als, went from Action Center to Maint. and did problem reporting.&nbsp; Got the following:&nbsp; Problems connecting to Windows Eror Reporting Service "some of thhe reports could not
 be uploaded to the Windows Error Reporting Service.&nbsp; Please try again later"&nbsp; I've had this on other items I've tried to do to figure all this out, incl. problems connecting to Action Center, please try again later.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I realize I probably scared everyone off with my 'too much information'.&nbsp; Bad habit, but none of it means that I am not doing all I can on my own to figure these things out, reading your reponses over and over, hoping for more, reading books, etc.&nbsp; I go
 to every troubleshooting site I can, and the ones I can figure out well enough to do, I try.&nbsp; I am so lost in why nothing about Windows 7 that is most attractive to me works, even though it is supposed to be a part of the package.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please don't give up on me, the problems are multiplying, always some issue about not being able to do any fixing because of some inability on computer's part to connect to Control Panel, Action Center, etc.&nbsp; The flag at bottom still has the red "X", and
 I can't do anything it tells me to do.&nbsp; I isn't all my ignorance.&nbsp; I have fixed other things on my own.&nbsp; I did send email to vendor, but he hasn't responded.&nbsp; Can't say I'm surprised.&nbsp; Do I resign myself to being swtuck with a computer that won't run Windows
 7?</div>

<h2>            Ajuda com Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Bom dia, poderiam me ajudar? Teve semana passada promoção do Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls para Xbox one por 99 reais. Blz. Eu comprei, mas assim como todos os jogos, sempre escolho a linguagem do console em inglês, e o jogo veio em espanhol, sem legendas nem
 nada em inglês. E na hora da compra não dizia nada sobre somente estar em espanhol ou algo do tipo, eu compro para jogar em inglês e depois em português, odeio jogos em espanhol (opinião minha), e agora como faço??? Se eu não conseguir que tenha em inglês,
 será que consigo o dinheiro de volta? Na verdade eu queria o jogo em inglês, não o dinheiro. É só falar com o suporte da microsoft??? Muito obrigado</p>

<p>Pera, a linguagem do seu console é inglês, e no jogo tá em espanhol? Sua live é o que, brasileira?</p>
<p>Eu tenho o Diablo 3 normal, não é a Ultimate Evil Edition nem o Reaper of Souls, por isso não posso te ajudar muito.</p>
<p>Porém, dei uma olhada na marketplace, e se a live é brasileira, a versão digital só oferece o jogo em PT-BR, se a live é americana, oferece em inglês, estranho vir em espanhol.</p>
<p>Tenta trocar a linguagem do console pra PT-BR, só pra fazer um teste.</p>
<p>PS: Sua live é brasileira?</p>

            Hi Jacob, 
<br />
<br />Let’s try to troubleshoot the store, and then Win Update Cache. 
<br />
<br />Let’s run through this list to see if we can get the store functioning properly. 
<br />
<br />App troubleshooter - <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/Appsdiagnostic10.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F2...</a> - download and run and see if it finds anything wrong with the store. 
<br />
<br />Next, let’s clear the cache - Hit the windows key + r, then type “wrreset.exe” and hit enter.  This will clear the windows store cache. Let’s check the store again to see if you can download MineCraft. 
<br />
<br />If no luck, 
<br />
<br />click start and type cmd, right click and run as admin. Type:
<br />“net stop wuauserv” and press Enter. 
<br />
<br />Click start, type control panel - file explorer options - click the view tab, and make sure “show hidden files...” is buttoned off. 
<br />
<br />Once done, navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download and delete the content of the Download folder. 
<br />
<br />Click start again, type cmd, right click and run as admin, type:
<br />“net start wuauser” and hit enter.
<br />
<br />Reboot, check for updates (let them install and finish if they are out there) and then check the store to see if you download MineCraft. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            Hmmm, can you download other apps/games, or do they bomb out the same way? Can you test this for me. This would tell us if it’s a store/system problem, or potentially just a problem with the mincraft download.

<h2>            Outlook express downloading old read emails as new unread emails whenever it is opened</h2>
                    I have switched on my PC and re-opened Outlook express after a 2 week break. Under send/receive I am receiving ALL my retained emails as new unread emails as well as the new unread emails from while I was away. This is around 3000 emails every time I open
 Outlook express. How can I restrict send/receive to receive only those emails sent to me since OE was last opened?

            <p>What Steve said, but I'll elaborate on it a bit.</p>
<p><br />
Tools | Accounts | Mail | Properties | Advanced. Uncheck: Leave a copy of messages on the server. Then delete the Pop3uidl.dbx file. You will get the messages one more time, but that should be it.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>With OE closed, find the Pop3uidl.dbx file and delete it.&nbsp; A new one will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>
<p>General precautions for Outlook Express:</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about a 300MB max for
 less chance of corruption.</p>

<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs and account setting changes. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently.

    <title>KB958488 fresh install of win 7 pro, no publisher listed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melmum2020  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB958488 fresh install of win 7 pro, no publisher listed</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Pro, Dell XPS &nbsp;Intel core i7 CPU, fresh install(wiped the drive, including all patricians).&nbsp; After install completed I installed WebRoot, after that I opened a network connection and downloaded 139 Windows updates with all the restarts etc.&nbsp;
 Then I installed the last ??&nbsp;win update&nbsp;including Sp1, I now have KB958488 with no publisher listed, which is a problem to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have uninstalled KB958488, which caused issues to the point that I reinstalled Win 7 Pro.&nbsp;and went through the 139+ updates again only this time when I installed SP1 I got a Cancelled in the log and rebooted tried again and was successful, at least it
 says SP1 in the Control Panel.&nbsp; I have tried the FIXIT, which says everything is ok, I have uninstalled it and downloaded it from the web and installed it and the same thing it doesn't show a publisher.&nbsp; With the other installs I was running NIS 2013.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does KB958488 show up as not signed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How dangerous is this?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

            Hi Lyle.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What works most is to go to Mail Settings (gear icon at bottom of Inbox) then Manage Accounts, then choose the problem account(s), then Delete the Account.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC and retrace that path to add the account back.  Make sure the Sync settings are as desired for how far back you want mail Downloaded from, whether to include Calendar and Contacts (People app).  
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then Reset the Mail app at Settings &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Modify &gt; Repair, then Reset.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br />Finally if nothing else works reinstall the Mail and Calendar app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have broader performance problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            No, Lyle, I didn't say that.  I gave you the steps to get the Mail app working again after it stopped working for too long for you and probably needs one of those steps to get it working again.  These are very common fixes that get it back in action quickly.

            Your email is never gone.  Windows 10 Mail is a sync service only.  Your mail lives in its online mail service (Yahoo, Outlook, AOL, etc) or Office Outlook mail.  
<br />
<br />You can remove it from Windows 10 Mail any time and add it back if need be to get it working again and it will load up the folders you've told it to save for as far back as you specify in Mail Sync Settings.

            My emails and the program returned today. The windows update came this morning, after doing the update it was all back to normal. The phrase "<span>It should be ready to use again shortly" is such a bad statement to make when it is down for a
 24 hour period. Thanks for all your help, even though I didn't use it- its nice to know people like you are out here in the community helping out.&nbsp;</span>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Wi-Fi adapter cannot switch access points - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaygourley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Wi-Fi adapter cannot switch access points</h2>
                    <p>This is an old problem. &nbsp;From reading other threads, I believe it affects a small but significant number of Surface Pro 3 and 4 systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem description: </p>
<ol>
<li>On startup, the Surface Pro 4 typically connects to a recognized wi-fi access point as expected. &nbsp;It maintains that connection. Throughput is good. &nbsp;No errors or problems.</li><li>Using the systray icon, the user asks Windows 10 to switch to a different access point.</li><li>Windows 10 shows that the adapter is checking network requirement.</li><li>But instead of connecting to the new Wi-Fi station after a second or two, the "checking network requirements" continues for more than a minute or two (until I assume it times out).</li><li>Then Windows reports no Wi-Fi stations available. &nbsp;The Windows Settings Wi-Fi on-off switch is unresponsive. The adapter in Device Manager shows that the adapter is functioning normally.</li><li>Wi-Fi remains unavailable. &nbsp;The problem usually does not self-correct even after several hours. &nbsp;Until...</li><li>If the user disables and re-enables the adapter (or restarts Windows), the adapter returns to life every time and connects to the new access point
<p>
</p><p>With one exception, this problem occurs in all locations, on all access points, every time in every environments where I normally work. &nbsp;My usual environment includes old N and new AC access points, both secured and unsecured, on both 2MHz and 5MHz bands,
 and regular wi-fi stations and those guest access points that require web log-in. &nbsp;The one exception is at my university, which has a distributed Wi-Fi system, the Surface Pro 4 will sometimes switch wi-fi access points successfully there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the problem is at least partly software related and probably not related directly to the Wi-Fi driver software. &nbsp;Following are my reasons for this belief:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>The problem is intermittent. &nbsp;Sometimes my Surface Pro 4 will go for several weeks without exhibiting this problem. &nbsp;During these periods, it switches access points normally and quickly. &nbsp;Then the problem will return and it will fail consistently for several
 weeks.</li><li>One time, I asked the local Microsoft Store to copy my C:\drive image onto a known good Surface Pro 4. &nbsp;After doing this, the known-good Surface Pro 4 exhibited the same problem described above. &nbsp;It would not switch access points without resetting the adapter
 and worked fine otherwise.<br />
</li><li>The problem sometimes disappears when Windows is reinstalled from an .iso using the option to preserve apps. &nbsp;I think this is what some Microsoft people call "refreshing" Windows. &nbsp;Once or twice this did not work the first time but did work when the process
 was repeated.</li><li>From reading support forums, it appears this problem is not unique to me but affects only a small minority of Surface Pro 4 users.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting: Uninstalling and reinstalling the Marvell wi-fi adapter has no affect on the problem. &nbsp;System File Check (SFC) indicates no corruption. &nbsp;Windows Defender shows no malware. &nbsp;The problem existed in pre-1511, 1511 and 1607 builds. &nbsp;Even though
 I believe this probably has something to do with my set of applications and/or Windows settings, I don't do anything exotic with my Surface Pro. &nbsp;It mainly browses the Internet, runs Office 365 applications, stores data on OneDrive and runs a few common applications
 like Quicken and Texas Instruments math software.</p>

            <p>Same issue here.&nbsp; This happens on boot up at times when a network is available.&nbsp; Definitely does not automatically&nbsp; recognize a new connection point when one is turned off and another is turned on.&nbsp; Even when the connection point has already been connected
 to in the past.&nbsp; I get a strange icon on the tray with a red "x" on it.&nbsp; Sometimes if I troubleshoot when it doesn't connect, it will say that its turning on the WiFi adapter (even though I never turned it off).&nbsp; Really a pain in the neck - rebooting usually
 resolves the problem, but I can't restart the machine every time I change network adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issues started after the Anniversary update, and still exisits.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has escalated this case. &nbsp;The engineer assigned is studying the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Version 1607 Cumulative Update (KB3194496) does not appear to have any effect on the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An addition to the 7-point description of the problem:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. From the time the user asks Windows to switch access points until Windows declares no access points available, Windows functions that access Wi-Fi adapter will hang.</p>

<h2>            call to OS function failed</h2>
                    after installing Microsoft updates my laptop doesn't want to start up. I called to Toshiba support, they suggest that I will take the battery off and plug it back then start the laptop again, it did work this time, BUT when I was shutting down the laptop
 from start menu-&gt; shut down, I got an error message: "call to os function failed". Sounds not good :-( What should i do now?

<p>1. Yes, it was purchased on Amazon.com and came new/sealed.</p>
<p>2. Not sure about this maybe.</p>
<p>3. I uninstalled Norton from Control Panel -&gt; uninstall program</p>
<p>I did run the laptop from the safe mode, however there were 157 updates (Microsoft+Kaspersky+Toshiba). Since safe mode did not show me the dates, I can't figure out which ones are the latest updates. So, I have decided to restore the system to previous point
 (before January 25) :-) - so far&nbsp; it's running smooth....:-)</p>

<p>Ideally you would never, EVER use System Restore to "undo" an update, Service Pack, or IE upgrade! Instead, uninstall the update, Service Pack, or IE upgrade &amp; reboot.&nbsp; If that doesn't correct the problem,&nbsp;<em>then</em> try System Restore.</p>
<p>[I think your problems will return&nbsp;very soon.]</p>

<p>Well, now I know, but to do that I need the computer in working condition, mine was half-dead, can't even start Windows normally (after that OS Microsoft update on January 25, 2011)</p>
<p>How to uninstall an update if it's not in program's list /control panel? Just in case.</p>

            <p>Thankyou for your thoughts. I am not very well educated with computers. I am not sure what operating system is on my computer.
</p>
<p>I am presently backing up my photos onto my computer but am disappointed that they are doing so completely out of and date sync. Apparently I still have to make folders for them and then drag whatever I choose into the appropriate folders. A lot of hours
 and a lot of work. </p>
