    <title>How do I stop Windows 10 popups&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I stop Windows 10 popups&#63;</h2>
                    I want Windows 10 to stop popping up and closing my program when I don't want to update it.<br />
I have 2 computers. On one a pop-up keeps showing saying that I need more disk space to download updates, which I won't do so it doesn't install something I don't want.<br />
The second computer keeps stopping my programs to tell me there are updates available which is also something I want to stop popping up since I don't want to download those.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How do I stop these from constantly pestering me?<br />
<br />
I also think this/Windows 10 keeps restarting my computers in vain to try to make me get them since they act like their starting up for the first time when I return to them after I occasionally leave them in sleep mode.<br />

            Hello Xaessya - 
<br />
<br />I don't recommend disabling Windows Updates as it leaves your computer vulnerable. 
<br />
<br />However, you can disable the Windows Update service which should stop the pop-ups.
<br />
<br />To do so:
<br />
<br />1. Press "Ctrl + R" to open the Run command.
<br />2. Type in "services.msc"
<br />3. Scroll down until you find "Windows Update"
<br />4. Right click "Windows Update" and select "Properties"
<br />5. Click "Stop" to stop the service from running.
<br />6. Under the Startup Type, select the dropdown box "Disabled" to prevent it from starting again.
<br />
<br />When you're ready to run updates, which I encourage, do the same thing but under Startup Type, select "Automatic."
<br />
<br />I hope that helps!       
        </p>

            Controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro version, Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.

<p>That does not help, any time I do that, it turns itself back on anytime the computer turns off.</p>

    <title>Linx 1010b tablet trouble - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Linx 1010b tablet trouble</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody!</p>
<p>I've bought a Linx 1010b tablet on eBay which was advertised as a new one. It still has plastic on screen, and really looks like a new one. It was delivered an hour ago. I tried to turn it on but it doesn't work. I put it on a charger- the red light is on
 so that it charges. When I press the power button, appears Linx, then disappears, and nothing else -blank. So the screen is black. After I hold the button for about 10-11 sec.-s it turns it off. Have you got any idea, what's the reason that it doesn't work?
 Thank you for your answer. Regards</p>

<br />It seems your tablet doesn't has any S.O installed
<br />
<br />I suggest to you contact with the seller and explain the issue or Return it, I think Ebay has a Return Policy that it would helps to you

<h2>            Minecraft cloud problem</h2>
                    THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED! I was playing minecraft and I made a new map, and when I finished it my other map "dungeon immortal" mysteriously disappeared but the map I just finished was copied even though i didn't copy it. I went on my cloud storage
 and it said that it was pending sync or something, then it disappeared like it doesnt exist anymore. This is the second time it happened and no one seems to help me. If someone can give me a solution or help to what is going on i'd appreciate it!!&nbsp;

I'm wondering if it's pending upload/sync and that's why it's not showing up as available.&nbsp; I would try setting your Xbox as offline, then reconnect it online and to Xbox Live.

<p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>In your storage section where it says Upload pending are you able to press "A" on that to see if you can manually initiate the upload? There is a chance that your consoles hard drive may have become corrupted. Can you try removing it and then plugging in
 a USB flash drive and giving it another try? Let us know with a&nbsp; reply how it goes.</p>

            I'm not able to view the upload pending on it sense the map like literally disappered from the "my cloud storage" &amp; My Xbox 360 does not have a hard drive sadly. It has a memory unit but I do have a flash drive and in the memory unit, it still contains
 a lot of Cloud Storage Cache. The file size is 512MB(SYSTEM ITEM) I'm not sure if the data is still located in it. Also when I saw the map in cloud storage "Upload Pending" I tired moving it and copying it because I knew this is what happened last time when
 my last map disappered but it wouldnt let me perform the action.&nbsp;

"Game saves in the cloud requires 514 megabytes (MB) of local storage space to store saved games before they are uploaded to the cloud."</a>&nbsp;Your memory unit will not work since it is only 512 MB and is reserved for system apps and settings.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Rename Desktop Icons</h2>
                    <p>I am currently installing a Windows 10 on a virtual machine. I've figured out how to get the PC, User's Files, and Control Panel icons to display on the&nbsp; desktop. I want to rename "This PC" to the computer's network name, and change name on the User's Files
 icon. I can do this on any other version of Windows. However, there is no "Rename" item in the icons' context menus. How do I go about changing these names.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A computer name can be easily changed through the Settings. Before doing so, keep these things in mind:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The name may contain the numbers 0 to 9, uppercase and lowercase letters from A to Z, and the hyphen (-) character.</li><li>The name cannot consist entirely of numbers.</li><li>It can't have spaces. </li><li>Special characters (&nbsp;` ~ @ # $ % ^ &amp; ( ) = + [ ] { } | ; : , ‘ “ . &lt; &gt; / ?) aren't allowed.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've decided on the PC name that you want, make sure you're signed in as an administrator before following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Settings</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>About</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>PC name</strong>, click <strong>Rename PC</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Restart now</strong> if you're ready to restart your computer or
<strong>Restart later</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For the user folder name, a five-character abbreviation is used by default if you use your Microsoft account when you first sign in. If you want a different user folder name, you can override this by creating a new local user account with the user folder
 name that you want. The steps for creating a new user account can be found <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. The steps for changing the account type to an administrator account can be found there as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've set up your new local user account, remove the Microsoft account association of your old user account by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Settings</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Accounts</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Your info</strong> on the left side.</li><li>Choose <strong>Sign in with a local account instead.</strong></li><li>Enter your password and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Type a user name, password, and password hint, then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Sign out and finish.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, you'll need to sign in to your new user account and associate your Microsoft account with it. Here are the steps to do it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Follow steps 1 to 4 above.</li><li>Choose <strong>Sign in with a Microsoft Account instead.</strong></li><li>Enter your email address and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Enter your Microsoft account password and click <strong>Sign in.</strong></li><li>Enter the password for your local user account and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After following these steps, check if the user folder name is the name that you want and let us know if you need more assistance.

    <title>CD-ROM compatibility problem with 64-bit computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christine5432  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD-ROM compatibility problem with 64-bit computer</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having trouble running a CD-ROM on my Windows 7 computer. It's an interactive CD for a class I am taking. This CD used to work on Windows Vista but when I try to run in on Windows 7 it says it cannot run due to incompatibility with 64-bit versions of
 Windows.&nbsp;Then it says "Not enough memory". I tried troubleshooting using different versions of Windows, but gives the same result. The school does not offer 64-bit versions of the CD-ROM. Am I out of luck?</p>

    <title>New Start Menu suggestion for 8.2 - Make it Snap - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hvac0120  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Start Menu suggestion for 8.2 - Make it Snap</h2>
                    Okay, we get it, Microsoft. You don't want to give us the traditional Start Menu. Well, then how about giving us a SNAP version of new Start Screen that works very similarly to how the traditional Start Menu used to work?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The biggest issue I have with the Start Screen in Windows 8 id that is consumes an entire screen. This is unnecessary and inefficient in most cases.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 8.1 will create inconsistency in the OS in order to add a Start Button to the desktop. Adding insult to injury, this will simply launch the Start Screen - meaning the issue that everyone is complaining about is not being addressed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a suggestion that is both consistent with Windows 8 design and an extremely useful implementation of the traditional start menu.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The top left corner is a hot spot for multitasking. The top right corner is the hot spot for the Charms menu.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Make the bottom-left corner a hot spot for a Start Button that will be accessible from any app (Metro [...er...Modern UI] or Desktop). If the user clicks on this Start Button, a Start Menu snaps into view on the left (re-sizing the current full-screen
 app). This could behave similar to having multiple apps open and snapped next to each other.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This Start Menu will have Windows 8 styling, but will work similarly to the Windows 7 Start Menu. I promise you that an implementation like this will be much appreciated by the community; especially those people who are dissatisfied with the updates being
 added to the 8.1 release.</div>

            My bad for posting in the wrong place.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I won't waste my (figurative) breath explaining to you why Windows 8 fails in many ways to provide a Start Menu that people actually want to use or why 3rd party software is not a solution to a deficiency with a new operating system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All of your suggestions and recommendations are to work around the inherent issue with the Windows 8 interface. I understand the existing interface and what my options are and I am not happy with the current options.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Instead of relying on 3rd parties (or writing my own solutions) I will just opt to skip over Windows 8 wherever possible. I will also continue to recommend Windows 7 over Windows 8 for people who I feel will suffer from the deficiencies created by the
 touch-focused interface of Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your attempt to provide a justification for bad design decisions on Microsoft's behalf is an insult to the entire development community.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Enjoy that MVP status. Apparently it comes along with being a PR agent... You could have just informed me I was in the wrong forum instead of assuming I don't know how to use the OS or attempting to justify the current design.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe this thread would be a good discussion point for developers who use Windows 8?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW - why don't you actually provide me with a website or an email address to which these suggestions could be submitted? That would have been much more helpful than your current response.</div>

<div>The biggest issue I have with the Start Screen in Windows 8 id that is consumes an entire screen. This is unnecessary and inefficient in most cases.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows 8.1 will create inconsistency in the OS in order to add a Start Button to the desktop. Adding insult to injury, this will simply launch the Start Screen - meaning the issue that everyone is complaining about is not being addressed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a suggestion that is both consistent with Windows 8 design and an extremely useful implementation of the traditional start menu.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The top left corner is a hot spot for multitasking. The top right corner is the hot spot for the Charms menu.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make the bottom-left corner a hot spot for a Start Button that will be accessible from any app (Metro [...er...Modern UI] or Desktop). If the user clicks on this Start Button, a Start Menu snaps into view on the left (re-sizing the current full-screen
 app). This could behave similar to having multiple apps open and snapped next to each other.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This Start Menu will have Windows 8 styling, but will work similarly to the Windows 7 Start Menu. I promise you that an implementation like this will be much appreciated by the community; especially those people who are dissatisfied with the updates being
 added to the 8.1 release.</div>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been an overwhelming amount of ranting about the new Start Screen and the removal of the Start menu and button. Contrary to popular opinion, Microsoft did not do this just to frustrate their customers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'why' questions were all answered several years ago in articles that were written by the Microsoft Windows 8 Developers, when Windows 8 was still being developed..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not many users have taken the time to read these articles, but they are a good read and they explain the way that customer feedback and real world usage metrics are considered before making any changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are links to those articles.</p>

hvac,<br />

I agree that removing the Start Menu was one of those oops moments by Microsoft. I also like your snap idea of a start menu. I know lots of users that cant stand the fact the traditional start menu is gone. Just give us the option at least to add the traditional
 start menu back into windows without having to use a 3rd party program.<br />
<br />
As for the documents out there for the regular consumers to read ? haha!, they barely know what a start menu is, let alone get them to read Microsoft articles, or give suggestions.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the development team at Microsoft should develop a relationship with the PR team at Microsoft, there might not of been such a flop of a release and you might convince techs like myself to sell it to my customers.<br />
<br />
Bring back the traditional start menu please, or atleast give me the option to have it.

                    <p>I have a Dell Optiplex GX280, Windows XP Pro 32bit, AVG Free antivirus. I have been trying to get internet to the computer with USB tethering. I tried a couple of things and got it to work, but now if I plug my thumb drive in it causes my computer to immediately
 crash. I have an 8G thumb drive, 64G thumb drive, wireless USB mouse, and USB keyboard. All other USB devises including the 8G thumb drive work fine.

<span>&nbsp;</span>The two things I tried are tetherxp.inf, and Microsoft ActiveSync V4.5. I had trouble following instructions to manipulate tetherxp.inf and eventually just right click the file and chose install from the menu (a progress hourglass appeared). I
 then proceeded to install ActiveSync. It installed ok so I plugged in my phone and established an internet connection. I don’t know what is causing this but I think it is a driver issue. I decided to undo the two updates so I uninstalled ActiveSync. That went
 ok but I don’t know what drivers were changed or if the uninstall rolled back any of the changed drivers. After the uninstall I still have internet when I tether my phone. I didn’t realize it but teterxp.inf must have worked. I don’t know how to undo the tetherxp.inf
 file. I think from what I read it configures the drivers to make USB tethering work with XP. I don’t know how to reverse that. The only other thing I know to do is use the systems restore to roll back to a previous good state before I made the changes. I don’t
 know if that will roll back any of the driver changes that were made. If you have any ideas on how to fix this that would be appreciated. Here are some links to the tetherxp.inf download and the ActiveSync.</p>

            <p><span>Just a little update. I booted my computer in safe mode and tried the 64G thumb drive and it crashed just like before. I opened the Device manager to monitor what was happening
 as I connected deferent devices. This is what I see. First, I plugged in my LG Android phone. It shows up as a Portable Device with G Flex2 as a sub category and no warning symbols. Second, I turned on USB Tethering in the settings menu for the phone. It shows
 up as Other Devices with sub categories CDC Serial, and LGE Android Phone with a yellow? warning symbols. While this is happening the Found New Hardware Wizard comes up and of course all I can do is cancel out. After I cancel out I see in Network Adapters
 sub category called Windows Mobile Based Internet Sharing Device with no warning symbols and I have internet connection to my computer. Third, I disconnect my phone (no internet). Then I connect my thumb drive. I have to watch fast because the computer will
 crash. It shows up as a Human Interface Device with sub category USB Mass Storage and a yellow! warning symbol. If you need more information let me know.

            <p>OK here is another update. After I installed XP I used a free program to backup all my drivers. I have found and can restore all the drivers I backed up. I don't think that is going to remove any drivers that have been installed after the backup but there
 is a list of those drivers. Maybe I can use the list to restore all the USB drivers. I also installed another program to update all my drivers. The program scans all my drivers and gives me a list. I found the 64G Staples USB Device and the Portable Device
 G Flex2 driver. I thought about uninstalling the 64G USB driver and see if windows will reinstall it. If you think that good to try let me know. I haven't found anything in the list for Other Devices Sub CDC Serial, LGE Android Phone. I also haven't found
 anything in all the Human Interface Devices that indicate anything that reads USB Mass Storage. I hope this can be a simple fix but maybe not. just let me know.</p>

            <p>Maybe your going to have to help me with your recommendations. As far as networking I'm not having any trouble with my modem. If I plug the Ethernet cable in I get internet just fine. I'm not having any trouble booting any Medea. The only time I have any
 trouble is if I plug the 64G thumb drive in. It makes my computer crash and gives me the described messages, but if I select Ctrl, Alt, Delete It will boot just fine. About the MB chipset drivers, they are up to date. If you want me to reinstall them just
 let me know. About the Phone Internet Connections. I am having trouble finding all of this. In anything I have found I see no internet options, connections tab. I'm not sure what to edit it to but it seems to work just fine even though it's not so post to
 be supported in XP. I don't have multiple networks running at the same time I always unplug the Ethernet cable before I connect the USB&nbsp; phone tether. I'm not complaining just need a little clarity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Again&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I'm not sure that ActiveSyc is the problem. It may be but I am concerned about what tetherxp.inf did and how to reverse that. If you think I should re update my chip set drivers let me know and I will. I also can see in Device Manager with the phone tethered
 Other Devices, CDC Serial, and LGE Android Phone with yellow? symbols. I could try to uninstall those drivers. That would brake my USB Tether internet connection. If you think it might fix it I will try it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            I have more information. I was able to plug the thumb drive in and pull it out before the computer crashed. What popped up was under Human Interface Devices. I was able to double click on USB Mas Storage with a yellow! before it disappeared. What came
 up was HP Panel Minidriver on USB. Date 7/15/2014 Version 7.2.52.13. I think that belongs to a HP printer driver.&nbsp;

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi Surendra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the Bluetooth connection between Nokia Lumia 730 phone and computer does not stay stable. Let me ask you;</p>
<ol>
<li>Were you able to connection both without any issues before?</li><li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>Did you recently upgrade the operating system from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1?</li></ol>
<p>This can be caused due to any third party software conflict, firewall or Bluetooth driver incompatibility. Let's try the following methods and check the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the hardware troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks the hardware on the computer for any known issues and provides the details on how to fix them. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) Type “<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong></span>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) In the “<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong></span>” on the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d) Click on “<strong><em><span>Hardware and Devices</span></em></strong>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e) Click on “<span><strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong></span>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f) Click “<strong><em><span>Next</span></em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>Disable the security software and check</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><em><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Check for any pending Windows updates related to Bluetooth driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may check for any pending Windows updates related to Bluetooth driver and install if available. At times such drivers are available in Optional updates as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check for available updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click <strong>System</strong></p>
<p>b. Click <strong>Windows Updates </strong>in the bottom left corner</p>
<p>c. Click <strong>Check for updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 5: </strong>Install latest Bluetooth drivers from the computer manufacturer's support website and check</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h2>            reload windows 10 - ongoing problems.</h2>
                    <p>I now have a reload/boot disk made up, but now cannot get the notebook to boot from the cd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message comes up: "press any key to boot from CD or DVD"</p>
<p>If I press and release a key, it goes straight to a standard windows bootup.</p>
<p>if I hold the key, everything seems to stall.</p>
<p>This is an ASUS notebook.</p>
<p>I suspect there is a problem with the disk boot method, or another "special"</p>
<p>control key I have not been told about.</p>
<p>It booted OK from a usb in BIOS uefi mode, but the Microsoft software wouldn't work
</p>
<p>correctly in uefi mode.</p>
<p>The disk reads OK when I look at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I couldn't find any specific instructions on the k52f in google.</p>
<p>I found out about the shift + shutdown, start + f2 option to get into the BOIS settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be problems getting restarts while holding down keys. I have to power off and on several</p>
<p>times to get to the ASUS display screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all&nbsp;seems to be a "fault/feature" of the asus k52f bios, but I can't get any sensible response from ASUS.</p>
<p>has anyone seen similar behavior from any other makes of notebook, and have they found a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>I am trying to boot into the reloader disk to reload windows 10 from scratch,</p>
<p>rather than just reset it, or update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some ongoing degradation problems I am trying to solve,</p>
<p>plus an odd clock issue.</p>
<p>The chkdsk comes out OK.</p>
<p>As do the tests previously mentioned in my other posts on previous </p>
<p>update efforts.</p>
<p>see topics:</p>
<p>"Time service faults in windows 10"</p>
<p>"solving problems which develop odd twists?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to the latest BIOS. that may help a little??</p>
<p>It has had these problems ever since I got it, in windows 7</p>
<p>The trick is to get the ASUS to boot into the windows loader disk.</p>
<p>I suspect&nbsp; the asus notebook&nbsp;can only boot off usb or disk if set to uefi mode,</p>
<p>and the Microsoft software has a "hernia" if I do that.</p>
<p>The boot disk looks like it is supposed to boot from an efi file, too.</p>

            <p>I used the media creation tool, but the version I got was 3.4 GB, not the larger one mentioned.</p>
<p>It has identical-looking base directory contents to the usb, but the usb was about 4.4 GB.</p>
<p>Am I getting them from the right place?</p>
<p>Do I need to look for a larger version??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting fact: holding keys down during a windows boot tends to trash </p>
<p>windows- I had to install my backup at the windows repair action menu.</p>
<p>I see that&nbsp;you are just supposed to tap them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will read those articles and try to get a boot from the CD and/or the Legacy USB settings again.</p>
<p>I don't get the Windows Boot Manager coming up, and I need the uefi enabled</p>
<p>to get more lines of boot options from the BIOS setup.</p>
<p>Otherwise there are only main disk and DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will try again and get back to you.</p>

<p>The error that you encounter can be related to your BIOS settings, these settings are part of your devices default structure and best handled by your device's manufacturer. We recommend that you contact them to get a full support in setting up the BIOS on
 your device to allow the Windows boot-up to function correctly. </p>

<p>thank you. I have discovered that I need special software tools to get a working&nbsp;</p>
<p>update/ reload going, from ASUS. This lets BIOS security approve the reloader media.</p>
<p>I have updated my ASUS registration and put in a request.</p>
<p>see my latest topic post.</p>
<p>I will get back to you later on whether I can use the data on the win10 updater</p>
<p>flash drive.</p>
<p>I got the windows serial number through Speccy before I trashed the disk data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is rather slack of ASUS not to put messages to this effect in the BIOS!</p>

</p><p>"question has reply: help needed to recover asus notebook with blank hard drive, working BIOS."</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an apparent hidden BIOS security problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read on google that you need a special ASUS cd/dvd disc to get back in to do any installing.</p>
<p>I noticed I could only get an external boot in usb uefi mode-sounds odd??</p>
<p>Now it refuses to repeat the "act".</p>

<h2>            Program still in Add&#47;Remove Programs even after uninstall</h2>
                    I installed a program.&nbsp; Then uninstalled it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I removed it.&nbsp; But it still shows up under Add and Remove programs and it won't go away.&nbsp; Now I bought a new version of this program and because of the old version issue it won't load on my PC.&nbsp; I
 have a Dell laptop with windows 7 professional.&nbsp; Can someone help me?

<p>Hello HappyGirl2,</p>
<p>I suggest you reinstall the program. Then go to the programs website and see if they have a removal tool. Most antivirus have removal tools as just uninstalling through<br />
programs and Features does not completely uninstall itmes from the registry. If that doesn't help, then do a search on the internet for Software Removal Tool that are free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Dell 1525 Upgrade to Windows 7 ultimate- Battery-charging, microphone problems</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have a Dell 1525 Inspiron, I just recently upgraded to windows 7 Ultimate and boy I am annoyed.</p>
<p>My recording device does not work what so ever.</p>
<p><span>I have a line in-mic jack in the front of the lappy which worked fine when i had vista, but now it&nbsp;doesn't work at all.</span></p>
<p><span>My High definition audio device is now from Microsoft, i&nbsp;disabled&nbsp;this and installed the Sigmatel driver from dell for vista OS</span></p>
<p><span>Now the icon for the microphone line in appears, along with the microphone array icon.</span></p>
<p><span>The microphone array ( i assume is the in built mic, which has never worked since day 1)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I enabled the Microphone-line in (and&nbsp;disabled&nbsp;the microphone array) the green tick appears, but no sound registers what so ever....</span></p>
<p><span>NO it is noy my mic, as I repeatedly checked it on my friends laptop and it seems to work fine, on hers</span></p>
<p><span>I have installed the latest driivers and even tried to un-install the High definition Audio from Microsoft but it magically re-appears...</span></p>
<p><span>Sound recorder does not work and reads "an audio recording device cannot be found" ,&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;sometimes says it cannot detect my sound card, and other times it says problem with recording device, and MSN- messenger video calls does
 not work either.</span></p>
<p><span>I am at my wits end with this Rubbish and just wanna get my mic working!!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Number 2:</span></p>
<p><span>My battery doesn't charge either!</span></p>
<p><span>It says plugged in but not charging and always remains @ 0%....</span></p>
<p><span>In the device manager the battery option reads: Microsoft AC adapter</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft ACPI- Complaint control method battery</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft composite battery.</span></p>

<p>You should have checked Dell site first, for your model, you would have then seen that Dell does not supply win7 specific drivers.</p>
<p>Generally the Dell 32bit Vista drivers should provide functionality,&nbsp;provided your Win7 version is also 32bit, but may not,</p>

<p>Had a nightmare trying to get a game last night, well, it let me join games but disconnected me as soon as the loading was done.</p>
<p>Managed to get in by joining a friend in the end.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The battlelog website lets you get into DLC games too btw, seeing the app isn't available on windows phones yet, the mobile version of the site does all the same stuff as the app.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Battlefield" seems to be a bit more tempermental than "Call Of Duty" when it comes to online play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had a couple of times when the servers have been down and this is the only game that appears to suffer from this problem on the ONE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when the game does work it's pretty spectacular and easily a highlight XBox ONE experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both COD and Battlefield have put me off their "Season Pass/Hardenned/Premium" editions though with the high asking price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does sound like "Battlefield 4" is offering more content for your money though.</p>

<p>for you chaps having issues getting into DLC maps download the Battelog app on a device if you have one. Lets you get into DLC servers, although it's down to luck if you can actually get in them with how the game has been acting recently :p</p>
[/quote] Yeah tried it through battlelog earlier too and it still didn't want to know, strange thing it had maps up but they were nearly all empty bar 1 player and had no ping value either. The only one that looked active had "EA server" instead of "DICE" like
 i normally see.

<p><br />
Unless you encrypted your important/confidential data - anyone with Google access and time with the computer can get the data off it.</p>
<p>Unless you setup some sort of tracking program/protection before it was stolen - no.</p>
<p>You can hope they just take it to the pawn shop - but your troubles don't end there since if the pawn shop takes it, they probably aren't on the up-and-up either and now they have time with it.</p>
<p>Despite what anyone else said - if you had a regular password like most people use (less than 8 characters, probably no symbols in it - maybe a number/maybe not and maybe a mix of uppercase/lowercase lettering) for convenience - if they have physical access
 to the machine and Google - they can probably get the actual password off it too.&nbsp; Also - even without your password - if there is no encryption they will have access to everything else stored on the machine (and you would be shocked at how much gets stored
 that you do/visit.)</p>
<p>Contact the police, give them serial numbers and proof of purchase.&nbsp; Contact your banks, cvredit card companies, etc. to make sure they know your private imformation may have been compromised.</p>

                    <p><span>We ready to pull the plug and say, "Bye, bye Skype!" After Skype just accepted our third annual subscription payment from us, they blocked our account / put us on restriction saying we have violated the terms of the
 EULA...! We haven't done anything different this year than we did last year. My wife and I have hit the help page trying to get our Skype account fixed/off of restriction - It just keeps saying they have noticed suspicious activity on our account and sends
 us to the EULA page. NOT HELPFUL! &nbsp;There HAS to be another way other than sending in an e-mail and waiting for a couple of days only to receive the same canned email message again...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We have been customers for going a couple of years now - we have purchased a permanent phone number and pay our bill once per year - now they have our money and we can't make calls! Its beyond maddening. We hit the&nbsp;</span><span>link
 on the landing page and have been directed to the "Recover Your Account" page. We have entered every piece of info they require and each the system says that it can't process our entry right now, but to try back in a few minutes. We've been trying this every
 couple of days since early August. We have followed *every link* on their support pages and have not been able to find any other way of reaching them outside of this Community Forum. Anyone here have any other ideas? As other previous frustrated customers
 have said - perhaps our only other option is to uninstall the app and say "Screw Skype."

Windows Installer and Substituted Drives
<p>Users cannot install software packaged in the Windows Installer format to a drive that is substituted for another drive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try installing the package into another non-substituted drive.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tech-faq.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fimages%2ferror-1603.jpg" />
</li><li>Also, try un-substituting the drive being installed to and try again with the original drive letter. NOTE: This may cause some software to stop working.
</li></ul>
Windows Installer and the SYSTEM Account
<p>The Windows Installer software uses the <a href="http://www.tech-faq.com/error-1603.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>SYSTEM
</span><span>account</span></a> for installation purposes. Because of this, it is necessary for the SYSTEM account to have full control of any folder being
 installed to. Ensure that the SYSTEM account has the appropriate privileges as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click “My Computer.” </li><li>Right click the drive that the software should be installed to and click “Properties.”
</li><li>Select the “Security” tab. </li><li>For Windows 2000, verify that the “Name” box has the “SYSTEM” user account in it.
</li><li>For Windows XP, verify that the “Group or User Names” box has the “SYSTEM” user account in it.<br />
If the “SYSTEM” user account does not appear, add it. </li><li>Click the “Add” button. </li><li>When the “Select Users or Group” dialog appears, Click “SYSTEM” in the “Name” field.
</li><li>Click “Add.” </li><li>Click “OK.” </li><li>In the “Permissions” section, click the “Full Control” checkbox under “Allow” then click “Advanced.” A dialog box will appear.
</li><li>If using Windows XP, select the “Replace permission entries on all child objects with entries shown here that apply to child objects” checkbox next to the “SYSTEM” user account. Click “OK.”
</li><li>For other Windows systems, select the “Reset permissions on all child objects and enable propagation of inheritable permissions” checkbox next to the “SYSTEM” user account. Click “OK.”
</li><li>If a security dialog box pops up, be sure to click the “Yes” button.
</li></ul>

<p>The above article should help if you follow the instructions carefully.</p>
<p>I would suggest you download and install Service Pack 3 for XP </p>
<p>SP 3 should be installed after removing and before reinstalling the .Net</p>
